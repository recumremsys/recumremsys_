1 day Inca trail through the WINAYWAYNA RUINS / SUN GATE,"We have booked a private trek with VV Tour, it was the best decision, we had plenty of time for everything, especially for exploring Winaywayna Inca City, our guide David was the best with all his information about the Inca history. Highlight: No matter when you arrive, the Sun Gate is a spectacular entrance to this amazing site; Machu Picchu. Then we explored Machu Picchu for ver 2 hours with our guide in the late afternoon (less crowded). *** We do highly recommend being in shape because the hike it's challenging, especially when you HIKE the 1-day option."
Famous Trek,"The Inca Trail is by far the most famous trek. It manages to combine beautiful mountain scenery, lush cloud forest, sub tropical jungle and stunning mix of Inca paving stones, ruins and tunnels."
Worth every penny!,I absolutely LOVE Inca Rail! It has more availability in late departures and the panoramic view cart is a MUST! I would highly recommend Inca Rail over Peru Rail if you are trying to visit Machu Picchu within a day. It’s a challenging trip but so worth it!
Highly recommend the Classic 4-day Inca Trail BUT it is really hard so train and do NOT go in January,"We booked the Classic 4-Day Inca Trail Group Hike January 22-25, 2020 with Llama Path. Please see my review of Llama Path on their page but in short, they were amazing, especially or tour guide Jose Luis ""Pepe"" and would highly recommend them as your tour company.Let me begin by saying we did not have the typical Inca Trail experience. Unfortunately after summitting Dead Women's Pass on the 2nd day, a massive rock slide occurred immediately in front of us at the Pacaymayo Alto camp hitting a group of porters from another tour company, killing a man and severely injuring 2 others. After our guide and others helped the injured, we ended up hiking over the 2nd pass to the next campsite. That night a decision was made to hike to Aguas Calientes the next day via a porter trail because of more rock slides near the Sun Gate (we learned later, the trail was closed entirely due to the slides). We spent the night at a hotel on our 3rd night and saw Machu Picchu on our 4th day via bus.All of this being said, I still would recommend doing this once in a lifetime experience. The trail and Machu Picchu were breathtaking. The people of Peru and Cusco were beautiful. However...* I would NOT go in the rainy season, especially not in January. There are plenty of other times to go throughout the year when you do not have to hike in the rain and do not have the fear of rock slides along the trail. Yes, our hiking group was on the smaller side (7), but the threat of extreme weather and conditions is not worth it in my opinion. Really the Peruvian government should shut down the trail in January, not just February. However, according to everyone we talked to, that's not happening any time soon. I wish we would've gone in June for the Summer Solstice.* I would train for 6 to 12 months before the hike! I was not in good shape when we booked the trip and began working out every day from October 1 through January. It still was not enough. The trail is hard. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. It is a lot of up. It is a lot of down (more down actually). And all on rocks. I was the slowest in my group which luckily was ok because we were all in our early 40's but who knows who will be in your group. Try doing the ""Everest"" workout on a treadmill in your hiking boots (I bought the Oboz Women's Bridgers) if you can't make it out on actual hikes. * Go 3-4 days in advance of the hike to acclimate. We are from Colorado and I could still feel the altitude the minute we landed in Cusco. We only stayed 3 nights/2 days before the hike and wish we had more. I also wish we had booked a couple days in Cusco on the backside of the hike too because (1) it was the Peruvian elections 01/25-01/26 and they were not serving alcohol (this sucked, make sure to check dates of the election when you book!) and (2) Cusco is a lovely, foodie, safe little town. * A few other recommendations:- Don't bring a pee funnel, you don't need it but be forewarned at least on the 2nd night our camp only had a hole for a toilet.- Try packing cubes to help get all of your stuff into the porter bags (I also used a dry sack to stuff the packing cubes into so they didn't get wet).- Rent or buy hiking poles, you will need them especially on the down hill (gloves also help with blistering due to the poles).- I personally liked the blow up mattress add-on that went on top of the sleeping bad, it made for a better night's sleep.Again, we did not have the ""normal"" trip but I would recommend going on the trail if you have the time to train and can go in the dry season (their winter)."
"Inca Trail Amazing Experience, Highly Recommended","Before traveling to Cusco, we researched a lot about different operators. Some are more recommended and others are not. Local Trekkers came as highly recommended one by some of our friends who had done several tours with them years ago. We opted to do the Classic Inca Trail to Machupicchu with them and we have absolutely no complaints. Everything was very well organized from beginning to end. Staff, porters, guides, cooks, were all very helpful and very professional in their work. All very efficient preparing the camp site, having warm water ready when we got there. They always took warm coca tea by the morning to our tents and then warm water to wash our faces.Camping equipment of very good quality and above all clean. Delicious food, abundant and especially fresh. with vegan and vegetarian options.Local Trekkers Peru is worth every dollar. They dont over charge for what they offer. I absolutely recommend to use this company as your Inca Trail operator."
A trip to remember,"Magical, breathtaking, and spiritual. You can’t doubt the existence of God, when you first see the Andes."
Get the train if you have asthma and probably even if you don’t,"I’m reviewing the 4 day, 3 night inca trail which we did in 3 days during the beginning of rainy season. I cannot write this review without thinking about the hobbits from Fellowship of the Ring.  Those little hobbits were courageous and never gave up while trekking through Middle Earth in what was a very worthy cause to save the world.  However if there was a direct train to Mordor then they would be silly not to use it. Especially when time was such an issue. This is how stupid I felt at the end of the first day of the inca trail.  If you are traveling to Machu Picchu then don’t feel ashamed for getting the train.  You are not cheating, you will see the exact same Machu Picchu as I did but without the hassle.The trail itself after the first few pleasant hours either goes directly up or directly down. Both of which are not nice for different reasons. Going up gave me bad asthma due to wet weather and altitude. Going down kills your knees and the wet rocks can cause you to slip and potentially hurt yourself badly at any moment. The scenary is quite nice but you will rarely see it as you will be looking at your boots for 90% of the time so not to fall over and the last 2 days we did not see anything because of the rain clouds.  The bottom line is, its not fun or certainly not my kind of fun.This is made worse by the fact that when you do arrive at Machu Picchu mentally and physically drained you are confronted with hundreds of tourists all fresh faced with clean jeans and relaxed smiles enjoying the sites having just got off the train. They have no idea what you have been through and spoil any picture of the ancient city you try to take with their brightly coloured rain coats walking through the centre of the city. This review would be different if trekking was the only way to visit Machu Picchu but its not. There is a comfortable train that takes you on a beautiful route in-between the mountains alongside the river.  The hobbits had to do it. You don’t!Some people have told me that I should be proud of completing the inca trail with asthma and altitude sickness. Many people probably would be but me, I just feel stupid for not getting the train and spending more time in the magical city of Cusco."
Hiking with Camina los Andes,"Inca trail was a challenge, however one of the greatest things I have ever done. Percy was our guide. It was basically a walk down the history of the land, it’s people. Time has stood still and the world   Has just passed by. Our trek turned into a 3 days due to family emergency back home, camina los Andes helped us achieve that goal for which we will be eternally thankful. They went above and beyond in making sure we finished the trek ahead of time."
G adventures Inca Discovery Tour - Fantastic,"We did the Inca discovery tour with G adventures in early Dec and had an incredible time! Our guide, JP, was absolutely fantastic - really passionate and enthusiastic about sharing his culture and incredibly knowledgeable. We always felt safe and supported.This review will focus on the Inca trail part of the tour but we also really enjoyed visiting the pottery and weaving co-ops and Cusco as well. Bring enough soles if you want to buy souvenirs at the co-ops. I bought a scarf and baby alpaca shawl and spent about S300. The pottery is less expensive. We stayed at prisma hotel in Cusco and we were able to do overnight laundry - 6soles/kg so very reasonable. For the trail here are a few tips:Packing - the porters will carry 6kg and you are provided with a duffle bag. The duffle bag is not waterproof - bring a dry bag if you have one. If you rent the air mattresses and sleeping bags from g adventures these add up to 3.5kg leaving you with 2.5kg. Everything else will be carried in your day pack. Definitely rent the optional air mattress if you didn’t bring your own. The ones provided are extremely thin and it gets cold at night. The hotel you stay at the night before the trail has a scale so you can weigh your bag.Hygiene - The porters set up your tents and air mattresses for you. They also bring you a basin of warm water in the morning and coca tea in your tent which is lovely. You can consider bringing some soap and a small towel. Toilets - combination of squat and regular toilets. Bring toilet paper and hand sanitizer. The bathrooms on the first day are not free so bring 1 sole coins.Food - incredible! The chefs are truly amazing and cater to all dietary needs and preferences.  They even made a birthday cake in the middle of the trail! Lunch is generally the largest meal with soup, a main and dessert. Dinner is soup and a main. We did bring some trail mix and a chocolate bar for snacks while hiking but you definitely don’t need to bring much other than that. They also provide you with a bag of snacks at the start of the trail. The trail - the first day is straightforward and not very difficult. You will pass by stands selling snacks and drinks as well as several Incan ruins. The second day is fairly difficult as you do dead woman’s pass and the trail is very up and down. A few in our group did get altitude sickness and one had to turn back. Consider acetazolamide for this trail. We had torrential rain on our 3rd day - buy a cheap poncho in Cusco and bring it as it really helps keep you dry. The rain was so heavy that it was difficult to stay dry even with rain pants and a good rain jacket. Get the large size as it can cover your day pack as well. The fourth day is fairly easy hiking - you do need to start early around 4am. I did use hiking poles for this trail which I would recommend. I hadn’t hiked with them before but there were some steep downhill steps that were slippery in the rain. Tipping: you can tip in either soles or USD. Porters - 150 soles per person minimum! These guys are amazing - they carry everything and literally run the trail to set up camp before you arrive huffing and puffing with a tiny day pack. You can tell they are treated well with g adventures. For example they are all provided with hiking boots, jackets etc. Some of the other porters we saw were wearing old converse like shoes or even flip flops and were carrying more weight.Drivers - 5-10soles/person. Generally need to do this twice - for the driver that takes you to and from Cusco Main guide - we tipped a bit more than g adventures recommended because out guide was fantastic - $30USD/person."
Great Experience,"We did the hike on the trail leading to Machu Picchu . There is nice scenery for the adventurist hiker, but it is not for the faint of heart or if you do not like heights.I did the 4 day trek from 82km. Day 2 is definitely the hardest!Bring plenty of water and hiking poles. Felt great to finish it. Would I do it again? May not be"
Spectacular!!!,"Just a little note to let everyone know about our the 4D/3N Inca Trail to Machu Picchu simply it was a wonderful experience, thanks to our local operator Andean Hikers Peru team for organizing everything very well from the beginning to the end.    from the amazing chef Sandro and porters Rogelio, Juan, Fernando and the others to our Fabulous trek guide David without whom I’m sure we would never have made it all the way. David's enthusiasm kept us all buzzing, and his knowledge of the area, fauna and history of Machu Picchu was never once questioned compared to one guide we hear who was talking utter rubbish to his trekkers team. But David is an Ecologist Guide who has a lot of to teach to his passengers, he has a real passion for his job for which he does his best effort to communicate everything that Cusco and Peru in general have to offer. So it was a real pleasure to live this trek with him, we learned a lot with him. Also we were in trouble with our flight we were not able to do the briefing the day before our departure nevertheless, but Andean Hikers Peru team in a very professional way, managed well our late departure. Hopefully, because we have been preparing this great trek since almost one year.All were very helpful and did everything to make our Inca Trail very comfortable. Amazing to see how Sandro was able to prepare a so tasty and so much food (the portions are really significant) and every day, everything was ready to eat when we arrived from our daily stop. We have nothing wrong to say about this company, I can only recommend them highly you will not regret."
Amazing Incan Site,"Machu Picchu is a must see when you visit Peru. It's 1 hour or so by plane outside Lima in the town of Cusco. Prepare yoursef prior to arriving Cuzco due to it's 10,950 or so feet above see level altitude that would give some people a so called ""mountain sickness"" short of breath, headache, nausea etc..me & my friends got sick and did not enjoy the first day of our tour. Machu Picchu's altitude was less than Cuzco so we have had a great time exploring this amazing, wonderful rich of history Incan site. It's worth the visit and would do it all over again inspite of the altitude sickness."
This is a difficult trek!,"We had a wonderful guide...Marisol Velasco Espinoza.  Very knowledgeable, friendly..perfect English.  Most helpful recommending sires , IF you have time or can shorten for your convenience."
Dream come true,Did the 4 day Inca Trail and it was more than we expected. Loved every minute of it. Would recommend to any avid trekker
Rewarding experience to arrive to Machu Picchu after 4 day hike,"Seeing Machu Picchu from the distance after our 4 day inca trail hike was a very rewarding experience. The hike itself offers many beautiful sceneries with different climates such as jungle forest, andean hills and snow capped mountains at the highest points. Really beautiful hike. Pack as light as possible as you are responsible to carry your own backpack, although paying for a porter is an option. Our guide Victor from our tour agency Machupicchu Center made our trip fun despite our tired legs. There is also a lake you see on day 1 with crystal clear turquoise waters surrounded by snow capped mountains that make for a great photo opportunity. The Winay huayna ruins right before Machu Picchu were also very stunning. But the final reward was Machu Picchu and we also hiked Huaynapicchu afterwards. Food was excellent and I would recommend you bring some lemons to give some taste to the boiled water they give you during the trek. We also rented sleeping bags and trekking poles, so there was no need to bring much except warm clothes to our trek."
Well worth the tired legs,"For those of us who are not going to sleep in a tent, getting off the train at km104 is an experience I will never forget,  After passing over the bridge and checking in, you begin climbing. The climb continues for the next 4 hours, with narrow paths, steep and uneven steps.  I was so pleased I had my walking poles. The views are amazing, even in the mist and rain! The variety of plant life, lichens, fungi was stunning, and you do have the company of a few other walkers.  Take your time, look around and appreciate the scenery.  Visiting Winay Wanya is the icing on the cake, as you can only get there on the walk. After lunch, the walk levels out (a bit) and we were so lucky to do this with only our guide, Omar, for company. He was knowledgeable, interesting and great company, besides encouraging us all the way. Finally you arrive at the Sun Gate and glimpse Machu Picchu for the first time.  It was shrouded in mist, which made it all the more special.  The walk down, is also challenging as the path is again quite uneven.  Take all the photos you want on this decent, you won't want to climb up here again. Thanks Omar, for this walk and for a fantastic few days in Peru."
Awesome ,"Did the 1 day trek from km 104 to the Sun Gate. The only way to visit Winay Wayna. Awesome trail, incredible feeling when finally in view of Machu Picchu from Inti Punku. An experienced guide will take you back to the 16th century. Highly recommended."
Worth Experience,"We decide to take the trail, totally worth it   the ruins and the views were stonishing, special place in peru"
Wow! 1 day Inca Trail hike was incredible!,"My husband and I chose the one day hike because we wanted the real experience without spending the night.  Boy was it brutal.  We got off the train and immediately crossed a bridge where we checked in with officials for our hike.  Then the real hike began.  Most of it was up steep steps and more steps and more steps.  We are 50 and 55 and did not train for this but made it despite at times feeling like we wouldn't be able to finish.  I give it a five because it is an authentic experience on the actual trail built by the Incan people hundreds of years ago.  But...be prepared for a very difficult hike and bring more water than you think you need.  We ran out and were dehydrated by the time we finished.  My back pack was too bulky and I recommend minimizing the weight of your bag to the bare necessities. It took us 8 hours but many people finished in closer to six hours.  I am very scared of heights and had to focus on where on I was stepping and tried to forget about the steep dropoffs.  If I can do it, anyone can.  I recommend you go for it if at all possible."
Machu Picchu,This hike is a must unbelievable views from start to finish you need a minimal level of fitness to complete. Do your due diligence before setting off and you’ll be fine. Good footwear essential.
It’s worth the effort,"No reward without effort, and this trek had plenty of both. It started with a briefing at the local Nuevo Mundo bar in Cusco. Our host for the evening was Miguel Gongora who is one of the owners of this ideologically progressive tour operator known as ‘Evolution Treks’ (more on that later). Miguel is not only informative he is also very amusing (in both English and Spanish). We were given the summary of our four day trek; ‘first day you will be a little tired (13 km of climbing), day two is hard (18km and most of it pretty steep); if you make it through day two the last two days are a breeze. We were told to be ready for collection at 5 am (early mornings would be a reoccurring theme of this trek).The pick up was on time (almost) and we got to meet our group; four rowdy Australians and one bemused Englishman. The groups are kept deliberately small by Evolution (never larger than 8) which means that the guiding is intimate. As for our allocated trek guide, it would seem that he had fallen ill so Miguel had brushed off his hiking boots and taken his first trail tour in 18 months. In addition to Miguel we had a chef (Rambo) the chef’s assistant and nine porters. The porters carried our sleeping tents, the kitchen and the food. You could also opt for the ‘full porter’ package which meant that they also carried your clothes and sleeping gear (up to 15 kgs).  We chose the ‘half porter’ (7 kgs) which meant we carried packs of about 8 to 10 kgs (the porters carry between 15-20 kgs). The trekking started pretty easily but within a couple of kms the gradient had gone from gradual to ‘bloody steep’ and the path was now a series of never-ending massive steps stretching into the clouds that would never be allowed by any self respecting occupational health and safety official. Miguel did a good job of keeping our spirits up and regularly distracted and informed us with his incredible knowledge of Inca history and endemic plants and animals. Lunch was a welcome relief when it arrived and was amazing. There was a beautifully crafted avocado salad followed by local fish in a ratatouille sauce and cocoa mousse. I cannot overstate how good the food was on this trek, which was even more incredible given the very rudimentary cooking facilities that ‘Rambo’ (chef) had to work with. The afternoon was more steps (this time mostly down, but just as steep) and a little misty rain to keep things interesting. The first of the archeological sites was on the itinerary and it did not disappoint; having Miguel bring it to life with his captivating  story telling really added to the experience. By day’s end the light was failing and so was I. Too tired for dinner, I unrolled my sleeping bag in the two man tent carefully erected by the porters and I was out for the evening. The next morning started at 5 am (to ensure we finished in daylight). The trek on day two was every bit as tough as we had been warned but walking poles and using the half porter meant that we reached the top of ‘Dead woman’s pass’ pass (4,215 metres above sea level) by lunch time. The trekking in the afternoon was easier but by no means a stroll. This is serious hiking for anyone over 50 and even with a great outfit like Evolution you are still going to hurt- a lot. Having said that the Englishman in our group was 67 and he coped very well. I ended day two like I ended the first day exhausted and asleep in my little tent. Miguel was right, it did get easier after day two and what helped was that following the crossing of the mountain pass we had left the arid side of the Andes (Alpine Tundra) behind and were now in the ‘cloud forest’ with its enchanting selection of rainforest plants and butterflies. To make things even better the archilogical sites of Runkurakay and Sayacmarca were on the agenda which wetted our appetite for Machu Picchu on the final day. The final day is a 3 am start (we were pretty used to this by then) with a brisk walk (race) to the Sun Gate. Arriving at the Sun Gate is one of life’s great experiences even if you don’t get to see the dawn sun striking Machu Picchu (the sun is behind the mountain until much later in the morning). This view (which is even better as you climb down from Inti Punku to Machu Picchu) makes the effort of getting there all worth while. We felt that we had somehow earned our right to explore the latest member of the ‘New Seven Wonders of the World’ in a manner that the thousands of bused-in tourists had not. This trek was a journey that every ‘would be explorer’ should make at least once in their life. Taking four days to walk to Machu Picchu rather than a three hour bus trip adds considerably to the cost and effort of visiting this iconic destination but the benefits far outweigh these other factors. If you are trekking the decision of who you chose as your tour operator is critical. Evolution Treks are committed to better conditions for all porters and equal rights for female porters. They were the first operator to hire female porters and they strictly enforce load limits for all porters. In addition, unlike most operators, they insist on weatherproof sleeping quarters and rain gear for all their staff."
Bucket list item,"Booked the trip with OAT travel. Took the Inca rail from Ollantaytambo (early in the morning) to Machu Picchu. Bought the afternoon ticket going up the mountain. Took the 1:00 pm bus up the hill. Walk the looping trails for three hours and catch the late (5:30) bus coming back in town.  These Inca people are amazing in their knowledge in farming, irrigation, drainage stone mason, and city planning. It is an amazing sight."
The lost city,"Absolutely amazing. this trip is an absolute must, but if you can hike the Inca trail  the views and experience are worth it. you will not be disappointed"
Inca Trail 2 Days ,"Yeah, this is the tour of tours for the Inca Trail. Exactly what I was hoping for, easy, fun, and beautiful. And our guides, Plinio and Pepe were awesome -- very helpful kind, and knowledgeable!! Book it! You won't be sorry."
Some helpful tips for the 4 days/3 night trek,"I am a 64 year old and have trekked in many countries including New Zealand (Milford and Routeburn Tracks), Nepal (Annapurna Base Camp) and extensively in UK and Europe and have just completed the Inca Trail and this was by far the most difficult trek I have done esp day 2. Please find below some hints which you might find useful, in no particular order.1. I travelled with Trailfinders and arranged for some kit to be carried by a porter so I would just have to take a day sac. Trailfinders send an extensive list of kit to take and said that there was no limit on the weight the porters would carry of my personal kit. When I arrived I was surprised to be told by the Ground Handlers that there was a 7kg limited including my sleeping bag and including a bag to pack it all in. This was not an issue eventually but I would advise that you contact the Ground Handlers directly for this information. I will certainly be talking to Trailfinders on my return!2. I travelled in September, the dry season, but we did have rain esp on day 3 so take good rain gear esp overtrousers. It was also cold esp at night on day 2 when u r at 3800m so I took long johns to sleep in which were invaluable. 3. I saw a huge range of footwear used, from heavy boots to 1 man walking in leather flip flops (seriously!). After much thought, I had decided to use a pair of 3 season Salomon boots and was glad I did as they did not slip on sloping stone steps, protected my feet on the sharp stones and uneven rock sections and supported my ankles. They were certainly heavier than most but but I had no issues with my feet. 4. For clothing I just used layers, avoiding taking a down jacket and thick fleece. I did use a light weight windproof Rohan jacket in the morning until it warmed up.5. I did not use my walking poles as the going is so uneven they became a hindrance.6. I did take lots of snacks and sweets and found chocolate eclairs and fruit pastels the most useful. 7. The toilets and showers are awful, even worst than Nepal, so be warned!!! Also I took a couple of bottles of hand gel which I used regularly.8. Take lots of high protection sun cream plus bug spray.9. You will need to drink a lot, over 21/2 litres per day so I used a “camel pack” which worked v well.10. For training, I just did lots of walking esp if it included hills and trekked on a couple of occasions over all the tops of the Malverns and walked in the Lakes. I started about 6 months before and covered about 150miles/ month. I throughly enjoyed the trek even though day 2 was v v v hard, seeing some stunning Inca ruins and beautiful scenery esp on day 3 which was wonderful.Enjoy the Trek."
top hike in the world,"we did it, we hiked the inca trail, one of the top hikes in the world, and it is no joke. you need to be in good shape but we had a private guide who went at our own pace and my family and I had a superb experience. our agency machupicchu center provided us with all the equipment including tent, sleeping bag and backpacks, so we didn't have to bring anything but warm clothes. the rail is beautiful, the scenery is superb. the ruins on the way are so magnificent. We are very picky food eaters, but our cook fernando prepared us gourmet food exactly to our liking. this was one of the best tours we did in Peru."
A very physical and mental challenge ,Not for the faint hearted and don’t even attempt it unless you have seriously trained for it. The high altitude is an issue and two in our group could not even start the trek. We went with intrepid and had a great guide and porters that carried all our equipment A really hard trek but well worth the reward
Inca Trail / with percy 4d/3n,"The Trail is amazing, we where expecting a common service. It they exceed my expectation Jorge did great food for us, every time he actually give us a cake to say good bye, our guide Percy make a serious and wonderful work with us, he knows a lot about Inca culture. I recommended five stars service all the way"
"Very challenging, but worth it","The Inca Trail is not for anyone out of shape or with respiratory problems, given the high altitude (much above 13,000 ft) and the many hours of strenuous activity per day. That said, I would not have near the appreciation for Machu Picchu had I not hiked to get there. Our tour leaders with Inkaterra were great, and the food and accommodations/tents excellent. Shout out to two Incan sites in particular on hike day #4 that are not to be missed: Winay Wayña and Intipata."
Inca Trail 2d/1n w/ Gabriel,"The Inca trail and Machu Picchu are once in a lifetime experiences. You may go back to see them again in your lifetime, but that very first time is special. It’s all new and unique. With this being said it is important that you know who you’re booking with and who your guide is. Gabriel’s knowledge and expertise on the surrounding area and ruins is truly remarkable and sheds more light upon seemingly mundane things. This knowledge adds a mystic or even esoteric aura to the entirety of the trail and ruins making the experience into an even more special experience than I originally anticipated. Truly a wonderful guide and wonderful trip. Highly recommended! Book in advance!"
Amazing Inca,We did the Inca trail as part of our honeymoon. Booked through G Adventures. What an amazing experience. Day two through dead woman’s pass is tough going but so worth it. Would highly recommend
Great but too expensive.,Everything great but since we are talking about two monopolies the prices are crazy for what they offer and the country that they are located. Unfortunately you will have to choose between Peru Rail and Inca Rail if you want to travel to Macchu Picchu...
Brilliant experience,"We had a superb trip on the Inca Trail thanks to our tour guide @darwinbocangel through Intrepid Travel. We would definitely recommend this itinerary and Darwin as tour guide. Darwin was extremely helpful, approachable, and a great guide with plenty of knowledge to share about the Incas. We loved every minute of our experience!"
Top of the Bucket List destingation,"Travel books will tell you more than I can regarding a trip to Machu Picchu and the Sacred Valley region. However, I can recommend a first class guide called Jean Carlos (+51 974 581 077). He took my wife and I on a wonderful early morning trip to see the Winter Solstice and educated us about the history of the Pre-Columbians and Incas, as well as showing us amazing views."
Tough but unforgetttable,"We did the short hike from the 104km mark.  It’s about 9 miles total.  First 4 miles are the toughest, lots of climbing, you’re in the sun, and the views are breathtaking. At the halfway point there is a spot to stop and eat lunch (bring with you).  After lunch the hike is more gentle, softer terrain in the shade, until you start to approach the Monkey Steps.  They are super steep and narrow, but your reward is the Sun Gate and your first look at Machupicchu. It’s breathtaking.  The hike down into Machupicchu was tough as you are descending on hard uneven rocks.  It took us a long time to get down, probably because we were tired at this point.  The trail is no more than 4 feet wide at any point and the Incas loved stairs!  There are hairpin turns, so good hiking shoes and poles are a must."
Very Challenging hike with beautiful views and a great guide team,"Our family of 4 plus grandmother did the 4-day Inca trail hike with G Adventures.  First, I must say that it was a real challenge.  The guides with G Adventures were fantastic!  We have never travelled with a tour group before but due to the limits on visitors to Machu Picchu, we needed to do so for this experience (our last of the Seven Wonders!) My husband's step-mom is 68, but in excellent shape. Hunerato assisted her with her balance and held her hand through much of the hike.  Our lead guide Roger (Charlie) was fantastic.  He really encouraged our 13-yr old who was hesitant on the first day and warmed up to the experience towards the end.  He was extremely knowledgable about the history and great and telling the story of the Incas.  Prior to the trail, we visited a village with ladies who were weavers of Alpaca items.  They had beautiful hand-work and we were proud to support them.  We also visited a group of ceramics-makers.  G Tours tries to support local businesses and we were glad to do so.  We were not happy with the Castellana Hotel in Lima.  Although we had pre-paid for an extra night there on our way back to the States, we decided to eat the expense and book rooms at the Courtyard, which was infinitely better."
"Wow, Wow, Wow","The 4 day inca trail trek is an experience of a lifetime. We were lucky with the weather - cold in the early morning starts, but luckily no rain or snow. Certianly need to dress for all seasons as it does warm up during the day. The overnight stays in the tents were basic but with the nice touch of warm water delivered in the morning for a quick wake-up wash. So many stairs but worth it for the scenery......not to mention the end goal of sun gate & Machu Pichu. If hiking isn't your thing, you can catch a train to mach pichu"
No words can describe how amazing this hike is.,"The hike is great, so many stars at night and the ruins along the way are also fantastic. Our guide from machupicchu.center was top notch and our cook made excellent vegetarian meals for us. Lots of hikers during June but it was worth it."
FANTASTIC TREK IN THE PERUVIAN ANDES with LTP.,"Our whole experience in Peru was amazing and I would highly recommend Local Trekkers Peru becuase i and my 5 friends we just returned from the classic Inca trail 4D/3N and we had an amazing time along this trail and finish in Machu Picchu makes it even more cool, incredible and mystical.Our trek was led by the great Lenin (our guide) and Timoteo our amzing cook, who were fantastic at making us feel welcome, telling us all we wanted to know about the villages, mountains, Culture, history and sights we saw, and making sure we were safe, well fed and well looked after throughout the whole trek. They were supported by their fantastic team of porters, whose energy and friendliness made the whole trip an amazing experience. The Inca Trail itself is a great challenge, but fortunately we hired the services of local trekkers peru who made things easier to deal with.I can't recommend this trip highly enough for adventure seekers, avid hikers and anybody who feels they want to experience the mountains, the history and the food that this millennial culture (Peru) has to offer. Also i would like to highly recommend Alberto the Manager of the agency and his team of Local Trekkers Peru to organise your Inca Trail trek and look after you on the journey. He is not only highly professional and experienced, but also some of the loveliest people you could hope to meet. You won’t regret with them."
I day Inca Trail from KM104,"We travelled to Peru with Exodus and would thoroughly recommend them.  Our Guide in Cuzco was Thomas who was fabulous.  We spent two days acclimatizing and visiting the Sacred Valley then on day four boarded the early train from Ollyantaytambo.  Off the train at KM104, across the rickety bridge and our trek started.  We were a group of 5 (should have been six but one of our party was not well, so took the train all the way to meet us in Machu Picchu town.  First part of the trek took in Inca ruins, and lots of uphill steps, as well as fabulous birdlife that our guide was happy to point out to us.  Then onwards and upwards to the completely deserted Wina Wayna ruins, across waterfalls and ultimately up to what our guide called the 'oh my god stairs' - bit more like a scramble up boulders rather than stairs, then a bit further to the Sun Gate which we reached at about 3pm.  In my ignorance I thought we had arrived, but it was a good undulating walk (for which read more stairs) to Machu Picchu itself, which was by then almost deserted, so we could amble round the terraces, taking in the views with hardly another person in sight - great for photographs.  Then the bus ride down to the town where we spent the night, before visiting the whole of the ruins early next morning, lunch in town, and the train back to Ollyantaytambo.  One of our party was under the weather on the trek, so we took it fairly easy, but it was very hot - 27 degrees - and we were in full sunlight for a lot of the way.  it took 7.5 hours in total.  You need to carry everything - food, water, suncream, insect repellant etc plus clothes for cold in the morning, could have been wet (it wasn't) and warm so layers are the thing.  My husband is a very fit 70 and I am a fit 61 so although this was no walk in the park it was do-able.  Our guide made sure we rested in the shade where possible.   At the check point which you have to get to before 2pm there are some of the most unpleasant toilets imaginable!    we saw so much bird life and flowers on the way plus lamas and ruins - we were so glad to have done the trek, but equally happy not to have done the three day version.Our group went on to travel to Galapagos with Exodus, which I will review on the Galapagos pages"
"Do NOT use G Adventures for your trip.  Their concern is money, not the health of the group.",I developed a severe respiratory infection the morning we were set to leave for day one of our Inca Trail hike.  I told our guide of my illness and the fact that I was very contagious and could infect the rest of the group.  He insisted that it was my decision on whether to continue or not.  I learned that this was because the company didn't want to say that I wasn't allowed to go because then they might have to refund part of my trip or pay for alternate lodging and travel.  G Adventures was willing to put the health of the rest of my group at risk for money.  Let that sink in.  I was forced to say that I couldn't go when it was CLEAR that I was in no condition to try to hike.  Find another company who cares about the entire group.
KM 104,"You have to have a permit to do this hike which is a one day climb up a path to join the Inca Trail walkers who have already been traveling 3 days.  You won't actually see them because they will be up and through the Sun Gate before you can get up there.  You'll only be arriving with the other KM 104 folks.  I am 62 years old and trained ahead of time by walking 5-6 miles at least once a week.  I also tried to incorporate stairs often in my hikes.  But nothing could train me for the elevation.  So, I made sure I arrived in the Sacred Valley 3 days ahead of time and did 3 hikes there before the KM 104 so that any altitude issues (or digestive) would be behind me.  I think because of the prep it was a great experience.  We hired a private guide because I didn't want to slow any others down.  You should know that most of the walk is in the sun so bring sunscreen.  I thought I'd get heat stroke at one point.  I also walked very slow adopting the 'slow is fast' attitude other hikers had taught me.  In other words if you go too fast and have to stop to catch your breath exhausted all the time you will be slower in the long run than if you steadily plod along at a slow pace.  I was a plodder.  Lots of young folks were racing past me but I was determined to not overdo or injure myself.  The whole hike took me 6 1/2 hours.  It was most difficult on the first 2.5 miles where you are steadily going uphill to Winya Wanya.  It's ramps and steps the whole way.  And the steps are uneven and tall (not standard height).  I used walking poles and was glad I had them but they probably aren't essential.  We took a ton of water and drank it all.  It was 75 degrees when we did the hike.  I never peed except at the last spot where we met up with the Inca Trail hikers where there was a proper bathroom.  I didn't pee before then because I was sweating out all my liquid!!!!  It was so hot!  The hardest part to me was the 45 min walk from the SunGate down the wide flat ramp into Machu Picchu.  My knees were shot by then.  But, all in all it was a fantastic experience.  I wasn't too sore the next day and was able to climb Wayna Picchu."
Be prepared for EVERTHING,"My partner and I did the 4 day classic Inca trail with reputable company. The company was great and everything was well organised and as expected. My comments on one Inca trail are more for guidance to other trekkers. We did some training beforehand but going to the gym regularly. Our main focus was strength training and cardio. We did this for 4 to 5 months regularly, i.e. at least 5 times a week. Trust me this was enough to be ready for the trek. We were physically ready for the trek and didn't suffer physically. We had the following stops on our trek: Day 1: Walyabamba Day 2: PacamoyoDay 3: Winay WanayDay 1: This was not too challenging and easy. I believe anyone who is reasonably motivated can do this. Day 2: Going up to deadwoman's pass was challenging but doable. We were very breathless but we made it. Getting down from deadwoman' s pass was another story. It was terrible endless going down on some very large steps. Day 3: The start was hard as we had to go up and down  twice to reach two maintain peaks. The  we had to tackle the steps all the way down. This was hard but not as bad as day 2. Day 4 was amazing to reach machu puchu and see the wonderful sight. You may be wondering why average review. I had to be honest the biggest challenge for us on the trek was coping with illness. In my group of 9 there were 6 ill people. Day 2 we had an illness due to altitude and the person could not continue. At the second part of DAY 2 my partner was very ill. He could barely walk and the worst part of that he couldn't go back. He had some very severe digestive issues which was a real challenge given we were on a trek and the only available toilet is nature.The campsite at Day 2 was terrible. It was like sleeping on some stones. It was very uncomfortable. Day 3 was another day of illness. 5 people were ill including myself. The range of issues were stomach issues, throwing up, diarrhoea, nausea and cold. It was a really bad day for the whole team and we struggled to finish. The fact that were so ill made it bad for us and the motivation was just so low on this day. By the end of DAY 3 most of us had lost our appetite and no longer interested in food. I certainly became worried about food and water during this trek becuase we were feeling so unwell.Similar comments on day 3 about the campsite. It was like sleeping on the floor due to all the stones. Before you go on the trek ask yourself:- Can I cope with no shower for 4 days?- Can I sleep in a small tent on the ground for 4 days?- Can I stay positive even in the worst moment ?If it's yes to the above then go ahead in your holiday. Day 4 :"
Exquisite eye-opening 4-day adventure ,"Hiking the Inca Trail is about more than Machu Picchu ( which is a damn fine reward at the end mind you)! It’s about discovering the smart, sophisticated Incas and the Quechuan language and culture through your local guide - ours was an incredibly warm and knowledgeable Quechuan, Americo Pariguana Supa through Inca Trekkers. It’s also a four day adventure through many varied microclimates with diverse and richly coloured flora ranging from delicate orchids to dripping thick mosses. And it’s about stamina - with 42 kms of uneven, rocky paths that often go straight up then straight down with sheer drops or dips through small tunnels. All this at an altitude mostly around 3200- 4215m really takes your breath away! But the beautiful hard working porters, chef Florentino, and guide Americo, we had did everything to make delicious meals to sustain us and looked after our health! Just an incredible experience- but not for the faint-hearted!! PS don’t forget to pack your mozzie spray, bandaids, Panadol and blister kit and take a blow up camping pillow, walking poles, sunscreen, hat and camping towel!!"
A great family experience!!!,"My family and I, we were in Cusco - Peru last April and we did the Classic Inca Trail with Local Trekkers Peru, and let me tell you that we had a great experience during these 4 days of hiking and we are happy to have taken the services of this company, everything was perfect organise from start to finish.Our guide was Lenin who made sure that our experience is unforgettable, he is a very good guide, very knowledgeable, we learned a lot with him, about the history of Peru and especially of the Incas, ask for him if you do the Inca Trail with Local Trekkers. He is very experienced and your Inca Trail will be even more exciting with him.We were 8 people in total in our group all family and with us we had Lenin our guide, Domingo our Cook and 12 porters who were directly responsible for making this hike posible. They were of great help carrying all the equipment that was required to make this adventure possible. They also helped Domingo prepare the most delicious meals we have tasted since we arrived in Peru. Thank you very much guys!!!Finally we would like to recommend Local Trekkers Peru for all those who are planning to make the Inca Trail with a local, genuine and above all reliable company."
Hardest trek of our lives from Km104,"12km from 104 to Machu Picchu.  At altitude this was the hardest trek of our lives, partly as we were in full sun for most of the journey but it was worth every breath and drop of sweat.  With magic Inca sites on route to reach the Sun Gate with sun shining and blue skies was a treat to behold.  We arrived in Machu Picchu and entered the citadel around 4pm.  The place was virtually empty so we enjoyed the peace and tranquility that the usual crowds prevent.  Great way to see this incredible site.  Retired to the Sanctuary Lodge for a return visit the next morning.  The Trek/Hotel combination was perfect."
Smooth ride with nice refreshments,"All staff members I encountered were very kind. I went to the Inca rail ticket office in Ollantaytambo on a holiday around 2 pm to purchase the next available train ticket to Machu Picchu. And I was able to get on a train only an hour later, shorter wait than expected. There was a quiet and neat waiting area where I could get some complimentary coca tea, water and wifi. The round trip I got was about $135. This is probably bc I purchased it late afternoon and that it was last minute. You can try saving money by getting on an early morning train around 8 am. Overall I had a pleasant experience but to be fair, I found the ticket to be too pricey for an hour and 40 minutes ride. During the ride, staff members offer you a cookie, mini chocolate and various options of tea. I got coca tea just to be on the safe side. On the way back to Ollantaytambo 11 am train, staff members offered a small wrap for the breakfast. Most refreshments are included in the tickf. The view outside through the window was amazing! The entire top is not a window but two small sides of the top are windows, which was enough for me."
Tough but worth every minute,This is a bucket-list item and worth every bit of planning and expenditure. This is a truly amazing way to see the world wonder Machu Picchu. The trail is difficult as some of the inclines are “acute” but even with the rarified atmosphere - and yes you do notice the reduced oxygen- this is a trail I would recommend to anyone. I am 68 years of age and would definitely do it again.
The only way to see Machu Picchu,"My husband and I went on a week long vacation exploring Cusco, the Scared Valley, and the Inca Trail going to Machu Picchu.  We used Wildland Trekking Company which we have used previously to go to the Grand Canyon and the Smokies. Wildland Trekking is incredibly organized.  They really take care of all your needs.  Our tour guide in Peru was Jose Condor who was simply amazing.  He is incredibly patient and knowledgeable.  I learned so much about the Incas and the Quechuan people.  He took us on several hikes.  The views of the Andes, the Sacred Valley, and Machu Picchu were stunning.  Jose Condor is a wonderful ambassador for Peru whose rich history, amazing food, and beautiful scenery impressed me."
1 Day Trek with G Adventures,"This trail was a wonderful experience.  It was longer than I expected, but worth the feeling of accomplishment.The train stops at KM 104 and the experience begins.  I looked around at the other people trecking and there were every type of hiker...some looked really prepared and others...not so much.  One young woman was wearing a tank top with her water bottle sticking out of her bra!I had read that the first part of the trail was the hardest....I didn't find that part too hard.  Yes, there are stairs, but it seemed to be stairs...then flat...then stairs.  It wasn't too bad.  The next part across the side of the mountain was also not too bad..  I was really worried about the drop offs along the trail I had read about, but I really didn't feel worried  at all.  There was 1 short section where I took pause, but it was really a short part.  After doing the first 2 hours, I felt like it would be easier than I had thought.  Then...the trail went into the forest and started lots of up and down stairs.  It was lightly drizzling at this point, so I was slowing down and being careful not to slip on the stairs.  I used my walking poles a lot, but I had put the rubber tips on them and that made thme a little less ""grippy"".Finally we made it to Winya Waya and the 350 stairs that awaited us there.  I took a few breaks and made it.  This was about 31/2 hours into the hike.  We passed the camping spots for the 4 day hike and pushed on towards the final gate.  We ate a wonderful lunch that had been provided and I was ready to go.Here is where I started to weaken.  I had read a lot of information about how long the trail was...many sites quoting 10-12 Km....  We were there at the lunch spot.  The trail was more like 15-16km.  The last 2 hours were supposed to be ""undulating"", but there was still a significant amount of uphill.  Our guide was in good humour and put up with my crankiness.  The monkey stairs were okay, but the sungate is still another 15 minutes away.  The last push towards the sungate is another long set of stairs....had our friends not been there cheering us on..I'm not sure I would have been smiling at the end.  The weather was beautiful at the top and the views spectacular.  I really was glad to have made the hike there.  The next 45 minutes down to MP was not super easy.  It was all downhill, but the stairs were uneven and steep.The highlight was arriving at the terraces for photos with NO ONE there.  We had the place to ourselves. The next morning when we took the bus back up it was cloudy, drizzling, and full of people.  I was grateful for the previous day.I'm so happy to have done this. I loved our guide Enrique.  My husband is in really terrirfic shape and found this an easy hike.  I found it more of a challenge than I had anticipated.  I did train for it, but the extra Km challenged me mentally.  My fitbit registered over 30 000 steps, over 200 flights of stairs, and close to 17km.  Don't let it stop you...but be prepared."
Inca trail Machu Pichu,"The guide was terrible! I paid for an English speaking guide yet he only spoke about 10 words in English. He did the absolute bare minimum and I’m pretty sure he despises tourists. He did not put me in the hotels that were laid out in the itinerary, but rather, these isolated rooms with no one else around and dirty beds. The only saving grace was the support staff. When I told them about my experience they tried their best to salvage the rest of the trip and got me a new guide for the last day. The hike and itinerary itself is also wonderful!! You get to see a lot of beautiful scenery and parts of Peru that you will never forget."
Challenging but worth it,"Our inca trail 4d/3n followed a Salkantay trek as well, so our review is based on this combo itinerary. The inca trail was definately challenging but the trek itself was an incredible experience, highly recommended. The ruins along the way, specially Winay wayna were spectacular. The porters of our agency machupicchu center brought 2 bio toilets that made a big difference during the trail. Disposable water bottles are not allowed on the trail, only re-usable canteens or water containters so make sure you bring them."
One Day Trail,"I got off the train at Km 104(5800') and did the one-day hike up to Wayna Wicha (8360') , then to the Sun Gate (9000') and down into Machu Picchu (7500'). The trek took about 6 1/2 hours. It was the rainy season and we had light sprinkles for the first two hours, but nice temperatures. There were low clouds in the valleys but the views were still spectacular. The view from the Sun Gate is a usually a highlight but Machu Picchu was socked in at this point. However, by the time we reached MP, it was sunny and clear."
Highly rewarded,"The hike along the Inca Trail is well worth it, to be rewarded by sights of Machu Picchu. We only joined the final part of the trail for the final couple of hours to Machu Picchu, however it is possible to hike the whole thing in around 3/4 days."
one can actually walk on it,the Inca trail is made of stone and is very well preserved. u can see it right along the urubamba river and there are parts which go all along the sacred valley
Inca-trail - don't miss it!,"This is the real experience. Don't fool yourself by taking a one day trip to see Machu Pichu. If you want the real experience, you love nature and you love to Challenge yourself and hike - this is it!  And the company, g  adventure, is definitely the company for you! Do it - you won't regret it! Me and My friends loved every second"
4 day trail,"We had a blast on the inca trail as we had three amazing days but then, on the fourth and crucial day, it was so misty that we couldn't see machu pichu at all! It was kind of a bummer but we could pull ourselves up on the fact that we had three very sunny days. The hike itself isn't actually that hard, or as hard as they keep saying. If you have a bit of a normal physical condition, you will be fine! Just make sure you are adjusted to the altitude!"
Adios Adventures,"We toured Cusco/Sacred Valley and hiked the amazing Inca trail  (4d/3n) with wonderful guides from Adios Adventures.  From the initial planning - to our final day in Peru - we could not say enough about the terrific attention to detail,  genuinely very kind, congenial, and informative professional team members who helped make this the trip of a life-time for our family.   Our expectations were exceded every step of the way.  Enjoy!"
memorable Macchu Picchu,"Excellent hospitality display by Inca Rail, scenic trains with complimentary refreshment. Inca rail also helped us in changing dates of the trip without any extra price since we could not board the train on the pre-booked date due to a strike in the local area."
Excellent Inca Trail experience,"Back from our 4 day Inca Trail to Machu Picchu. It was incredible. We booked our trek through an agency called Uncover Latin America who did a fantastic job. Dave who booked our trek for us was very professional and helpful. Our guide Hector was amazing and kept our whole grouped well informed, knew his history and everyone was well entertained. Hector had loads of experience of more than 15 years. The meals we got on the trek were large servings and delicious a good mix of Peruvian and International. We enjoyed dishes like Lomo Saltado a Peruvian stir fry style dish, pancakes in the mornings, eggs, chicken, rice. The trek was quite challenging especially the second day hiking up through Dead Womans pass. On the last day it was very satisfying because we reached Machu Picchu which was incredible. After our hike we enjoyed a delicious lunch at the Sanctuary Lodge restaurant, then took our train back to Cusco. Brilliant experience. Book with Uncover Latin America."
Life highlight,"We had to do the 2-day trail, ""the Sacred Inca Trail,"" ""Camino Real de los Incas"" because we didn't have time to do the full Classic 4-day Inca Trail trek. The 2-day trek is at a much lower altitude than the 4-day trek. Regulations introduced in 2002 require doing the Inca Trail only with the services of a professional guide or as part of an organized tour group. We used Andina Travel, who were great. It is recommended starting the trek with at least 1.5 litres of water per person, and man, dress in layers complete with something waterproof! After skirting by Machu Picchu, trekkers spend the night in a hotel in Aguas Calientes, returning to the ruins for a guided tour the second day. After a pre-trek meeting the night before, we got up at 5 am and drove the long drive to Inca Rail train in Poroy with our guide, Washington and our driver, Enrique. We were a little scared as we weren't sure how serious this was going to be for moderately fit 40-somethings and our 10- and 13-year olds. We then took the early morning backpacker train through the picturesque Sacred Valley about half an hour to the trailhead at Km 104 (104 kilometres along the railway from Cusco) (2100 m).  There were snacks and tea on the train. My son was super nervous about mosquitos but didn’t get one bite. The whole route was beyond beautiful. Clouds drifted above, below, alongside us, and surviving Inca terraces and buildings of a vanished civilization were tucked into the mountainsides. The trail went gently upward for approximately four hours until we reached the Inca complex Huinay Huayna (Wiñay Wayna) (2700 m). We stopped to eat the plentiful bag lunch (sandwiches, chocolate, passion fruit, juice, bar) Washington had brought us at a place with sinks and outhouses I think used to be a hostel. Sub-tropical flora and fauna surrounded us. Occasionally professional porters would trek past us, hauling huge packs at twice our speed. Washington was so knowledgeable. He pointed out rare orchids but generally you couldn’t hear him if you weren’t right in front. The presence of the Incas was never far away, especially as we continued 2 more hours to the climax of the journey: our entry through the Intipunku (Sun Gate) from where we got our first glimpses of Machu Picchu (2400 m), “the Incas’ Lost Citadel, the forgotten city American archeologist Hiram Bingham rediscovered in 1911.” We were elated and all took pictures of each other. Although it was a little overcast, it would be much worse the next day, so actually we were really lucky. We hiked down the mountain toward the bus stop at the entrance, passing the majestic ruins that day. We had hiked about 7 hours, 7.5 miles. We boarded the bus that took us down a crazily switched-back road to Aguas Calientes, the railhead beneath Machu Picchu, and our hotel."
Inca trail with Inka Natura,We had an amazing time with the inca trail. We went on a four day hike to Machu Pichu. Our tour guide Saul as well as all the porters with us provided us with wonderful service and helped us through probably the hardest walk of my life. Saul showed us the ruins along the trail and patiently guided us through while the porters (one of them being the head cook Mario) carried all our stuff far faster than we could walk unburdened and then cooked us amazing meals. It feels so good to have garlic bread after six hours of walking up rocks.Machu Picchu is a wonderful sight and while not manditory taking the hike makes you appreciate so much more. It is an incredibly hard hike but definitely worth it and the amazing people at Inka Natura made it possible. Definitely worth considering the hike or at least a day trip to Machu Picchu if you visit anywhere near Peru.
Best hike in the world,"we did the 2d/1n inca trail and this is one of the best hikes in the world. We will come back again next year to do the 4d/3n inca trail. No need to bring a lot of water, there's plenty of locals selling water through out the trail."
Exhilarating,Inca Bridge and Sun GateMake sure you have a strong heart and kneesYou need heart on way up and knees on way downGreat trails and you get away from the crowd Magnificent views
Panoramic Peruvian Sites,"Our Inca Trail guides were funny, informative, and extremely helpful through out our entire trip - They answered any and all questions and even offered to help find dinner spots, Machu Picchu was busy, but our guide got us in, to the buses, and throughout the amazing ruins without a hitch.   I also rented ATV's and toured the breathtaking Peruvian farmlands, countryside the salt mines with Inca Trail.  Again, a Fantastic experience -- I could not recommend a more professional, knowledgeable and just ""fun to tour with"" group as the special people at Inca Trail."
A walk through history,"The beauty of this trail is indescribable.  However, it's not a walk in the park, its a hike and some of that hike is difficult.  However, if you're in good shape then you need to experience the Inca Trail for one day or several days...but, with a professional guide.  If you can, just do it!"
Adios Travel- 2 day Machu Picchu hike,"We recently returned from our 2 day Inca Trail hike coordinated by Adios Travel (both in Cusco and Virginia).  The communication between Heather, Jacque, and I was amazing.  I wanted to extend our Machu Picchu stay so I could climb Huayana Picchu and take a different train back and they helped me do that. Hubert was our on site guide.  He was amazing.  We booked a private hike for ourselves.  He met us the night before at our hotel to go over the plans. The next day he was on time and had boxed lunch for us.  He carried our gatorade that came in the lunch most of the way which-- when you are toting a pack on your back for several hours.. every ounce helps!  He also helped us buy out bus tickets that we would need on the day after he left us.  I'd recommend Adios Travel to anyone heading to Cusco."
Never ends but BEAUTIFUL VIEWS!,Definitely a LONG hike but worth every turn. You think it will never end around every mountain turn but you can't take away the sites or the views you see.
Challenging,The trip is grueling but doable in 6-7 hours. Your body needs the time to acclimate to the high altitudes you will be hiking and sleeping at. If you are super fit and think you won’t have issues you might be right but if your wrong you might be putting yourself in a life threatening situation or you may be wasting your money when you need to turn around on your second day to head for lower altitude.  I found it quite a challenge at 55 years old but met a 76-year-old woman doing the same hike.
Unparalleled experience ... spectacular! with Local Trekkers,"Recently, me and my family, 3 adults and 2 children 08 and 12 years old, made the great Inca Trail to Machupicchu. We planned this trip under the guidance of Alberto, the manager of Local Trekkers Peru, the trek company we used for this adventure.He assisted us very well during the reservation process, responding to all our concerns and accommodating our needs.I only have words of happiness and gratitude for local trekkers, our guide Raul, our cook, Timoteo and the 9 porters we had were all very good people and very helpful. They did everything in their power, so that we would feel very comfortable. Raul as our guide was very profesional, we loved every day with his stories and legends of the area besides the history of the Incas. He is very knowledgeable about his environment, we learned a lot from him. I'm not writing many comments in forums, I only do it when something really fascinated me, so this is one of the few that I write during my life, since the Inca Trail to Machupicchu, particularly for me, is the walk that every adventurer, tourist, traveler, etc. must do and what better if you hire the services of a serious, safe and above all reliable company like Local Trekkers Peru."
2 Day Inca Trail with Adios Adventure Travel,"We booked our 2-day Inca Trail trip to Machu Picchu through Adios Adventure Travel, which is a reputable and amazing company to work with. They made booking easy, they were very prompt with communication, and our guide was incredible knowledgeable and fun. I could not recommend Adios Adventure Travel enough."
"Challenging hike, and absolutely rewarding!","Be prepared for stairs! Up and down. Altitude is a problem, so be sure to acclimate. Amazing scenery and Incan ruins all along the trail. Our guide, Chino, was very knowledgeable and patience. Don't waste your time trying to find good food in town, because Victoriano cooked gourmet Peruvian food, breakfast, lunch and dinner. The porters are superhuman, couldn't have done it without them. We were blessed with good weather and great company."
Visiting Aguas Caliente and walking on the ancient paths was amazing,"We had a private tour and was well worth it.  Out group consisted of 4 people - but 3 were ages 64, 66 and 75! The guide was so good and everyone made it to the top and through the ruins!  I wish that I had more time in the area to hike some of the other mountains.  My only regret is that we decided not to stay longer as the others knew they could not handle the trek.  IF you (like me) are able to do more then I suggest a plan that you do your own thing and meet back at the hotel!"
It’s an enormous challenge but worth it,"This is not for someone who is out of shape. With some very big days and enormous vertical ascents and descents you need good kit, strong knees and legs and a big heart. But saying all that it is one of the most amazing and satisfying things we’ve done. We took our two sons 23 and 21 and had a great time. Yupi Adventures was our company and Lenin our amazing guide."
Inca trail,The Inca trail had always been on my bucket list for 25 years and so I headed to Peru 🇵🇪 on my own and have just had the most amazing 2 weeks with the highlight being 4 days trekking the Inca trail to Machu pitchu met a wonderful varied group of people who bonded so well and had so many laughs together ! The trek is challenging  but so worth it ! I’d recommend it to anyone
Not for the faint of heart.,"This is a hard hike and I do recommend training for this hike. It is brutal. Not as much the hike itself but the altitude and the hike, with all that I'm glad I did it.  I went with G Adventures and they did an outstanding job good guides good food, Porters kept my gear dry."
"A great hike, sadly 4 days of walking doesn't give any benefit in access to Machu Picchu","I really enjoyed the Inca trail hike, however after 4 days it was sad that people who just caught the train to Machu Picchu got better and earlier access under less duress. If you want to do an amazing hike with great views go for it, it is challenging and rewarding, especially if you don't use a porter. If you want the best access to Machu Picchu just get the train up to aguas calientes and catch the bus up first thing in the morning and save a lot of time and money"
One of the most challenging and rewarding hikes I've done,"This is a fantastic experience, we used Intrepid as our tour and were well looked after. You need a reasonable level of fitness to complete, make sure you have correct shoes, clothing etc."
how cant you enjoy it,"Seriously, if you don't enjoy this trip their is something wrong with you, we did the 4 day hike up the mountain and took the back door into the park."
One Day Inka Trail Hike,"We decided to take the one-day hike on the Inka Trail that ends at the Sun Gate entrance to Machu Paccu.  You get off of the train from Ollantaytambo at km104.  This is a special ticket event so plan ahead.  Guide is required.  Maria met us at our Urubamba hotel early and we made the 7:00 train out of Ollantaytambo.  About 75 minutes we got off the train, hoisted our backpacks and crossed the river.  After the bathroom, sunscreen and bug spray break we passed through a passport control and ticketing station.  Then we started.  The initial part was about 15 minutes of gradual climb passing through a few Inka sites.  Then the uphill began in earnest...for about three hours.  We stopped for a lunch (provided by the tour company) or sandwiches, fruit and snacks at a waterfall near the base of Winay Wayna.  Then another 15 minutes of steps through Winay Wayna and a nice discussion on the functions of the site and we were mostly done with climbing...for now.  For about 1.5-2 hours we hiked an undulating trail...some up and some down until we were very near the Sun Gate...then near vertical steps and I mean vertical.  Hands and feet stopping every 5 steps to catch your breath for 15 minutes.  A few more rises and Machu Piccu appears on the horizon.  About a hour downhill gets you to Machi Piccu proper.  The is one of the most amazing experiences I've had.  Hiking in the path of the Inkas is truly an honor.  The air is clear, the vistas are expansive and \beyond description and the feeling of accomplishment is worth every step.  Get Maria as your guide.  She really loves the trail and gives you much more that you can possibility ask.  Good boots are a must.  Pack water, rain gear and snacks.  SLow down and enjoy what you are doing.  There are at least two passport control and ticket gates, so, don't try this on your own as you'll be turned back.  Total time is about 6 hours and about 8 miles in distance and 2700 feet up."
Amazing & Breathtaking,"Wow!  Thanks to Marcia an Inca descendant with Intrepid for one of the most memorable treks I have done.  This is a fantastic part of the world & a must for any adventurer, Marcia is so passionate about her heritage & is full of knowledge.Tracks are unlevel so good hiking boots are essential if you want good support & cushioning underneath, other essentials are sunscreen & insect repellent.A really beautiful experience with an amazing view of Machu Picchu from the Sungate, one I will never forget."
Phenomenal  Adventure with Enigma Travel Company,"Get ready for a life-changing experience:  Every aspect of this trip and each  activity was well organized by Enigma and far surpassed my expectation.  The adventure started in Lima.  The guides in Lima were passionate and informative about the foods and cultures of Peru.  They led us through a market where we sampled literally a dozen different fruits that I had never seen before.  Sacred Valley provided acclimation to the altitude and a preview of the spectacular scenery that abounds on the Classic Inca trail.  Sacred Valley was where we began learning in earnest about the Inca culture and about the Quechua culture living in the Andes. The most spectacular aspect of the trip was entirely attributable to our guide “Nilo” who had both the passion and enthusiasm combined with a phenomenal understanding, respect, and reverence for the Inca culture and Quechua culture which in some way I know each and every fellow trekker internalized.   As Nilo referred to us, we were a “happy family”  of 15 who traversed the Inca trail in 4 days/3 nights along with our two guides, Nilo and Elvie,  our 27 exceedingly helpful and strong porters who passed us in the first five minutes along the trail, and one talented chef.  Thank you  Nilo and Enigma for this life-altering adventure.  If anyone has the opportunity to travel with Enigma:  snatch it… and hopefully you will be fortunate enough to get Nilo and Elvie as guides! Dana Goldstein/USAOctober 2018"
The most amazing trip of your life !,"My son and I completed the 4 day Inca trail May 12, 2018. There is no question that the Inca trail is the most amazing trail in the world. Do not be naive and think it is just another trail and will be easy to complete, without question this was the most difficult physical challenge I have ever completed in my life. There are Numerous times where you come to a section on the trail and you say to yourself there is no way I can accomplish this but you have no alternative, you just do it ! We had beautiful weather only a half hour of light rain the entire 10 days we were there. May is a great time to go 60’s during the day but 30’s at night.Before you start the trail spend 2 days in cusco to get acclimated to the altitude.This is a trip you have to do once in your life."
A spectacular Inca Trail trek to Macchu Picchu with Llama Path tours,"I have just returned from hiking this trail with my adult daughter. It is a place of stunning beauty. The trail is definitely a physical challenge and one needs a level of fitness The arrival at the Sun Gate, the descent into MP letting the city unfold as one approaches is, is an amazing experience. We ended with an optional hike up Huayna Piccu mountain, although it was tough after a 4 day hike, the stunning views from there were oh so worth it.  We did this trip with Llama Path and I cannot say enough great things about them. The planning was meticulous. Our guide Jose-Luis(Pepe) was one of the best guides I've ever had, his absolute love of this area is evident and he is a fountain of knowledge. He was encouraging all the way when the going was tough. And the food-- well chef Fernando -- how do you do it -- multiple course meals every meal with fresh ingredients, we couldn't believe the dishes that kept arriving-- thank you Fernando especially as this needed to accommodate gluten free-- absolutely delicious -- and the last day a gluten free cake -- wow!A truly fabulous experience. With a truly great team from Llamapath"
Amazing trip,"Thank you for an unforgettable trip. From the porters carrying our bags, the chefs making amazing meals, to our amazing guides Washington and Yoshihiro. You were all incredible!! I can see why g adventures is number 1. I couldn’t agree more! You all go above and beyond. Special thanks to the guides. You made it your mission to get all of our group to Machu Picchu. I enjoyed the banter along the way! Beat group ever. #Llamacaliantes"
Inca Trail,"I actually did not walk the Inca trail, but saw many of those walking the trail and spoke with them. It took 4 days with lots of porters to help guide them. If you are fit and healthy, go for it. Lots of hikers use this trail and it's a challenge for them to achieve the walk and to meet lots of friends from all over the world."
Wish I could go every year! I miss their coffee,"We recently did this stunning trip and discovered the most amazing coffee. If anyone from UK is going soon and would be willing to pick some up for us.. well, I’m lost for words! I’d hug you! I’ve never experienced such a beautiful coffee after searching high and low we cannot find anything even remotely similar. I’ve even had friends on the lookout! It was from the D’Wasi Cafe which you MUST check out it’s simply divine. Please get in touch, ofcourse coffee costs and postage if required would be covered. It truly would make my wife’s year if I could put another pack in her coffee cupboard."
Fantastic trip!,"Valencia travels really took care of us from picking up at the airport to each day of the hike treating us with great food and help. The guides were really awesome, I'd highly recommend them for others."
Beautiful.,"It´s recharging and eye-opening to be on these ancient trails. We did not hike the whole trail as we did an adventure tour that featured ohter activities like mountain biking and rafting to reach Aquas Calientes, but already the part we hiked on Inca trail was amazing!"
Perfect Inca Trail trip with G Adventures,"This was one of the best trips of my life. So much culture, history, natural beauty and, yes, physical activity. It was challenging but not excessively hard. (I'm 50 and in decent shape; to prep for the trail I ran about 12 miles a week for several months, took the stairs everywhere, and did some strength training and yoga.) Our guide, Ever, was fun and energetic and kept everyone in a positive mood. The food at the campsites was amazing; the toilets, not so much, but we survived. Luckily, we had perfect sunny weather the whole time. Our group was fabulous; we were among the oldest but we all got along really well.Some tips:- Take Diamox if you can. We had a little altitude sickness in Cusco but it was gone by the time we hit the trail. Coca tea is nice but I'm not sure it's effective.- Bring warm clothes to sleep in. I was pretty cold at night and wished I'd brought a sweater.- A Buff is your friend. You can use it as a hat or a neck gaiter, and to cover your nose when you use the bathrooms.- If you're doing the G Adventures tour, bring cash to the women's weaving co-op. We would have bought out the whole store if they took credit cards.- Layer, layer, layer. On our early September trek we went from short-sleeved shirts to lightweight down jackets within the space of a few hours.- Don't get sick. Easier said than done, I know, but I can't imagine how much this trip would suck if one were ill. Use hand sanitizer, don't eat any uncooked vegetables, and keep your mouth closed in the shower. If you're at all active and considering this trip -- don't think twice. Book it."
Great Inca Trail with Andean Hikers Peru,"We had a really amazing Inca Trail to Machupicchu 4 days with Andean Hikers Peru, with the excellent Andy as our guide he is a very experienced and reliable guide who is extremely kind, helpful and respectful. We were really couldn't recommend him highly enough. When we come back we will be trekking with Andy again. Andean Hikers Peru organised everything very well for us with an incredible service. Transportation just in time. The food by our cook Humberto was excellent, the meals delicious and plentiful every day. The porters, of great help, were the most sympathetic and kind men we met during our stay in Cusco. Without the work of these men, rest assured that the Inca Trail would be impossible to do. Me and my family will remember this trip for the rest of our lives. so I recommend this company as your Inca trail operator, you will not regret and you will not have last minute surprises, they will give you everything offered at an accessible price."
2 weeks in Peru,"our trip started in Lima, Cusco, Inca trails, Puno Lake Titicaca. We used Peru Tourism Pentagram and from the start they were very helpful. The itinerary was clear and explained all what’s included in the tour. Every question we had was answered in timely manner. We were also given alternative if any of the member of the group will be unable to do the hike. They told us every one will make it and the guide will assist a lot. All the tours and transfers were done by Condor Travel and they were punctual each time. Tour bus or van were all very comfortable and the tour guide spoke English well. I would like to mention that our guide on the IncaTrail was Saul Concha Huayllani. He was very knowledgeable and attended to all of us, esp the person needed the most help during the bad weather ( thunder, sleet, freezing rain, snow and mostly rain) we encountered after reaching the dead woman’s pass all the way to camp for the night. After the weather improved the next 2 days, trekking was less stressful. Still difficult to breath due to elevation but hiking was more manageable when it’s not raining or sleeting. It was an amazing experience. 3 nights of camping is very doable. No shower is tough but you make do of what you have.The porters worked hard everyday and carrying all the gear and cooking our food, setting up the tent every day was back breaking job, they did it with a smile daily. They were my inspiration to get up and hike to the next camp. Our chef name was El and he even baked us a delicious cake. Hiking the Inca trails was hard, but worth every minute of it. Good physical training is a must, mint tea, mint candy, ginkgo biloba, OTC organic altitude tabs and lots of water to drink helped me daily on the trail.Lake Titicaca was awesome. Uros a floating island and we visited Taquiles island. Learned a lot from the local people.I highly recommend Peru Tourism Marirose was our travel consultant and Condor Travel if you ever plan to visit Peru or hike the Inca Trails We did our tour from August 18 to September 1, 2018"
World Class Trek,"This is a world class Trek!Anyone ages 12-70 In reasonably good health can do this Trek!It’s not “easy” but doable.I have trekked all over the world, from Kilimanjaro, Tour de Mont Blanc, Patagonia, Mount Ararat, Zion’s, Yosemite etc.The Inca Trail is my favorite for too many reasons to list... also, spending at least a couple of days in Cusco is a must—-Incredible part of the world!RNelson (Austin,TX)"
No words can describe this amazing trail!,"I heard about the inca trail, read about it for years, but finally, I went this year. wow! no words can describe this amazing hike. We did a combination of Salkantay + Inca Trail + Huaynapicchu, and it was a hiker's paradise. So many beautiful inca sites, glacier lakes, snow capped mountains and of course entering Machu Picchu through the sun gate like the incas did it was amazing. Our tour operator was Machupicchu.Center, they had portable bathrooms, and gave us the option to charge our phones with their solar charging stations as well as hot showers. My parents did the inca trail 5 years ago and the operator did not have portable toilets, I strongly recommend you choose a good tour operator who will provide portable toilets."
One of a kind experience ,"Just did 5d/4n Inca Trail - amazing, wonderful, challenging, stunning scenery and archeological sites, best epithets! 5 Days - in order to spend more time at MP. Great trip in all respects, from a scenery, educational, historical and perspectives. I recommend Alpaca Expeditions as a tour operator (you can also check my review on their page) But as a forewarning from an experienced hiker, canyoneer and overall fit woman, and 2 young adolescent athletes - this is a serious physical experience and no matter how fit you are or trained, the ALTITUDE can get the best of you and in the ways you can't even imagine. Just prepare yourself. We have done a lot of strenuous hikes, climbs and trips before (at 1,200-1,500 meters above sea level) but never at this altitude, hence ALTITUDE will determine your overall performance on this Trail. It is a strenuous endurance workout either way. Macchu Picchu is the ultimate goal of course but you will see several other important ruins along the way which can resonate with you as well. TIPS AS A MUST:1.  Acclimate in Cusco. We had 4 days, one of which we visited Sacred Valley to ""ease the pain"" which is at a lower elevation. 2.  Altitude sickness assistance - that would be coca tea and natural medicinal supplements. Some people take pills but there are side effects. Once you are in Peru you will hear what to do but ensure to do your own research of means against altitude sickness symptoms.3.   Rain gear, i.e. waterproof hiking boots is A MUST, rain jackets and pants - we had pouring rain the first 2 afternoons, with hail on the second. 4.   Sunscreen - Sun burns in high elevation. We opted for long sleeves and pants throughout our stay in Cusco and MP, but applied sunscreen on open skin. You will need to do it more often, maybe every hour. 5.   Bug repellant - or they'll eat you alive. Mosquitoes and other tiny flying monsters. We used essential oils which I mixed myself in a small glass bottle. In our experience the essential oils wore out every couple of hours or so. 6.   Headlamps - you'll need them at the campsite and in the tent after dark. We were told by our guides that some people forget. 7.   Wear layers - Our choice for the late August (equals winter in Peru, still dry, days before the rainy season, cold nights) and since we had it anyway, is alpine skiing basic layer thermal wear of good quality which keeps you warm no matter what and wicks the moisture. We wore the basic layer (top) and thin packable down jacket only the whole trail, losing the down jacket around 9 or 10 am with sun heating up, and putting it back on closer to 4 pm. Adding rain jacket when rained and early mornings for thermos effect.  Hiking pants (ours water-repellent and breathable) was enough without any bottom thermal wear. We slept in our thermal basic wear. 8.   Camp Footwear - we were able to wear our closed-front crocs on the last night only because the other nights were rainy and wet. May you have an experience of your life and be well prepared!"
Spoilt along the entire journey,Peru is an ancient place that requires visiting and capturing experiences. Machu Picchu was the penultimate of Peru experiences. The Inca people have an interesting history from ancient to modern. They are a wonderful caring people who look after you and provide you with excitement in their country
The Journey IS the Destination,"Hiking the Inca Trail is an amazing experience, one that I’d gladly do again.  We booked our trek as a private trek with Enigma and they were AMAZING!!!!!  Our private group consisted of family and friends ranging in ages from 17 to mid 50s.  Everyone in the group is active, some are regular hikers.  None of us are super athletes or marathoners.  After reading so many TripAdvisor reviews, I think I may have scared myself to death prior to the trek.  While I was quite prepared, being nervous or worried about it was not necessary.  To acclimate we flew to Cusco prior to our trek and spent 3 nights acclimating.  We also ALL took Diamox, thank goodness!  We had no major altitude sickness issues in our group.  Basics about our Trek:*Group of 11, private trek*Enigma*3 nights on the Inca Trail, arrived late afternoon and 1 night in Aguas Calientes.  The Inca Trail is amazing. It is an experience that you will never forget.  The weather is completely unpredictable.  While I knew that it could rain, could be cold, I wasn’t prepared for how fast the weather changes.  Be sure you have GOOD rain gear.  My waterproof hiking shoes were great but I wish I had a really good lightweight rain jacket, rain pants and then a poncho to go over everything.  When it rains for 10 hours, everything gets wet.  Since we were on the longer trek, we didn’t experience crowds, super early mornings or terrible traffic.  I think doing the longer trek was worth it.  It wasn’t as hard as I thought it was going to be.  I really expected this hike to be brutal.  I am not saying it wasn’t challenging.  It is a challenging hike, you will be tired at camp, however, if you hike and prepare before you go, this should not be impossible.  There was no time where anyone in our group thought they couldn’t continue.  You must have the attitude that you will finish.  For many of us, the hardest physical day was the last day where you have a 4,000+ft descent.  Be sure you have trekking poles and ibuprofen for the next day.   The Andes are stunning!!!!  Enigma is AMAZING!!!! I would recommend them for your Inca Trail Trek.  They are not the cheapest but you do get what you pay for.  We had a head guide, Edgar, who was so knowledgeable, kept a great pace and knew the trail so well.  Our assistant guide, Winder, was funny, kind, he stayed with whoever was at the back. There was never any pressure to go at a certain pace. Winder was there.   We had a head cook, soup chef and 19 porters.  The food is FANTASTIC!  We couldn’t believe the meals they were cooking for us, everything freshly prepared.  In the morning they bring coffee and tea to your tent.  It is just awesome.  We didn’t need a fraction of the snacks we brought with us.  Enigma provided snacks every day to us.  Just bring energy chews, light snacks and medicines.  One person in our group had a bad case of travelers diarrhea from our time in Cusco and it was good that we had Cirpo and Imodium with us.  Pack everything in zip lock bags to stay dry.  We were given duffles by Enigma and lined them with a trash bag.  Still, you take items out of your bag in your tent.  It if rains at night, the side of the tent may get wet if items are against it.  Best to have everything you take separated into Ziploc bags to stay dry.  It also makes packing way easier and organized.  We arrived at Machu Picchu in the afternoon.  We were able to tour Machu Picchu that afternoon and again the next morning AND do Huayna Picchu.  A note since you are reading this about the Inca Trail.  If you can do the Inca Trail. Huayna Picchu is just not that big a deal.  You are done in 2 hours.  It is steep but you stop along the way and catch your breath.  If you are super freaked out about heights, maybe not but don’t worry about it being too hard."
A great experience,"My wife and I went with Alpaca Expeditions and we couldn't be happier with their care of us on the 4 day/3 night trip.  For reference, we had never done a hike before (or even camping!), we are in our early 60's but fit, and we live near sea level.We had good weather all the way to Dead Woman Pass but then got hail that turned to rain. This continued, with occasional breaks, for the remainder of the trek. Thankfully, we wore waterproof hiking boots and not sneakers!  The tour company provided plastic ponchos.  We had been told by friends who had done the trip to take plenty of energy bars, snacks, and toilet paper. We ended up carrying far more than we needed.  Appetites decrease at altitude and we found we would each use perhaps one protein or energy bar per day. Toilet paper and snacks were also provided by Alpaca Expeditions at the camp sites.  Needless to say, we ended up carrying plenty of stuff along the whole trek and back to the US.The things we found very useful on the trip included waterproof boots, a hydration pack in the backpack to let us drink while walking, walking poles, sunscreen, and a broad hat to keep the sun off."
G Adventures - Inka trail trip (8days/ 7nights),"My friends and I hiked the Inca trail to Machu Pichu with gadventures on the 27th July ‘18. We were part of a group of 13. It was one of the best experiences of my life. This was 100% because of the excellent team that took care of us for the 5days/4nights. Carlos our guide is one of a kind; easy-going, knowledgeable, with a great sense of humor. Nestor, our other guide is an absolute gentleman. He was outstanding! So kind and patient, got to know each of us individually and gave the people who needed extra help all the attention they needed. The lads made sure we all got there happy and healthy. The team of porters ‘PORTER TEAM 6’ are amazing people. The food was delicious and they were always so friendly and encouraging. They carried all our stuff and as far as I am concerned they are hero’s. Thanks also to the chefs. Genuinely can’t thank these wonderful people enough, would definitely recommend them. Muchos gracias!!"
Hard trek but worth it for the scenery,"We did the four day trek to Machu Picchu. The going was tough at times - we live at sea level so the altitude made hiking a struggle. But it was well worth the effort. Stunning mountains, inca ruins and the tranquillity of some of the landscapes and forests were amazing. Not to mention the llama.Some of the mountain paths were a little narrow for my liking - and with a large drop to one side so no margin for error."
Breathtaking Experience,"Did the 4 day trek from km 82 to Machu Picchu. If you're going to visit Machu Pichhu, this is the way to do it. There are nothing but perfect and breathtaking views the whole way. It is hard, don't mistake me, but it was an experience that shouldn't be missed, if you can do it. Be in good shape, and do some training before you leave. We went with Valencia Travel, and there was nothing I wouldn't recommend about booking with them."
Hiking Inca Trail,"I took the classic 4 day 3 night trip, the view is beautiful, the ruins are amazing, the experience is great, the trail is a little bit challenge (steep up and down) at some sections overall but it is ok, but still, you need to prepare well. For me, the second day climbing from 3300m to 4200m is the most challenging part, I saw many people struggling at the same section, but still, it is doable for most people who do some exercise regularly. You probably also need a little bit luck to have a clear sky, if it is keep on raining, you may miss many wonderful views."
Highlight of South America trip,"Doing the Inca Trail makes reaching Machu Picchu at the end even more incredible than it already is after walking for 4 days to get there.There are ruins along the way too, which gives you a taste of what’s to come. It’s quite hard at times, with the climb over Dead Woman’s Pass being the part I found toughest, but if you’re of reasonable fitness, you should be fine.We acclimatised for around 10 days, slowly moving up in altitude on a tour of Peru before doing it, which I’d recommend, as the altitude does make it harder.We did it in running shoes, as did a bunch of other people in our group, so don’t listen to people that say hiking shoes/boots are essential. As long as you have comfortable shoes, you’ll be alright.It gets cold at night, so take warm clothes. Walking socks were useful both for warmth and protecting feet from blisters. A poncho is essential, as it can rain heavily at times and you don’t want a heavyweight jacket weighing you down.  Otherwise, just take clothes that you’re comfortable walking all day in.The showers available at camps are freezing, so consider taking wet wipes if you don’t want to use them.High energy snacks are good, so take some chocolate and sweets for when you need a boost.Also, take a head lamp for moving around the camps at night, because they’re pitch black!"
Only for the bravehearts,"One look at the Inca trail and you see it is not for the usual tourist. If you are a brave-heart, follow the trail, otherwise take the bus. At each stage you will wonder at the remarkable manner in which the train was made."
Touristy Must See,"You have to go with a guide. My guide grew up in that area so he knew it very well and was super knowledgeable.There are large crowds and no bathrooms. The hike up to the view point was not hard, but you have to be able to climb uneven stairs. The air is thin because of the altitude, if you're out of breath from minor activity don't panic. Go slow, enjoy the view."
"Inca Trail with Carlos, Nesta and team 6","Outstanding 4 day hike. Lead by the enigmatic Carlos whi had fantastic humour, knowledge and passion. Supported by the compassionate and loveable Nesta, these two were nothing short of outstanding guides. However the trip could simply not be what it is without Porter Team 6 lead by Livio and Eddie. The work those guys do is incredible, lumping 25kg on their back up and down every day is something you have to see to believe. With this in mind the quality of the food was quite unbelievable, literally like being in a top restaurant.  The trail and Macchu Picchu is breath taking but was made even better by the grouo of 13 brilliant people we travelled with. From all corners of the world , ages and backgrounds this was a truely brilliant experience. #teamcondor #kingcarlos #nestaisahero #team6"
Inca trail Machu Picchu,Great 4 days your and the machu Picchu was amazing. The Guid Roger was very friendly and helpfull. Recommend this tour!
Intrepid Inca Quarry Trail Trek,"Intrepid’s Inca Quarry Trail trek was first class. Our tour leader Hulio was a rock star and for anyone looking for an unforgettable experience the Quarry Trail is a must. It goes higher than the Inca Trail (4450m), is significantly less crowded (we didn’t see a single other tour group) and finishes a day earlier allowing you to attend Machu Picchu clean and without the need to wake up at 3am and queue up at the MP entrance point in the dark."
"Guiding Peru Tour Company: Tour Cusco, 4 day Inca Trail trek to Machu Picchu","Thanks to the whole Guiding Peru team for an amazing trip.  Our guides - Bryan for Cusco and Carlos for the 4 day Inca Trail trek - were extremely knowledgeable in Peruvian history and culture.  The guides, porters, drivers, chefs and support staff are very competent.  I felt safe and well cared for at all times.  Also, all team members were  incredibly pleasant and friendly.  Their kindness and positive attitudes really added to the experience.  I appreciated the detailed packing list on the website.  By using it, I was ready with everything I needed.  All the equipment provided by the company (tent, sleeping bag, sleeping mat, blanket, pillow, hiking poles, and food service items) was of high quality.  I would book with Guiding Peru again in a heartbeat."
Inca trail with REI adventures is AMAZING,"A bucket list trip, 9 days in Cusco, the sacred valley, and 4 days/3 nights hiking the ancient Inca trail with REI adventures was a spectacular trip. REI is first class in every regard. Guides, porters, food, camp equipment, hotels before and after the hike.... every detail handled perfectly. If you’re considering any adventure travel, book it with REI."
Bamba experience Inca trail with Diego,Just completed the 4 day Inca trail with Diego! Great guide who motivates you when you don’t feel like you can push yourself any further! Full of lots of great stories and knowledge along the way. The food was amazing! Felt like we were in a more expensive package but was just standard service! 5* service! I was traveling along but got put into a group of people the same age as me which was great also :)!
Peru Treks - Inca Trail,"An amazing adventure on every level! The guides were fantastic, porters and cooks were amazing (as was the meals). We were with a fun group, who make the trek so much fun.I cannot say enough good things about Peru Treks and this trip to Peru and the Inka Trail, everyone needs to do this."
A well worth challenging walk,"Probably one of the hardest and most challenging things I’ve done to date. But well worth the challenge, really found myself by achieving this spectacular walk.Day 2’s Dead Womans Pass was my hardest point and I just took it slow and was thrilled to make the top- proved a lot to myself that day, very fulfilling!The views and ruins on route are superb, by the end I was ready to walk it all again!!"
4d/3n Inca trail - Llama Path,"We did the Inca trail group service with Llama Path who I highly recommend, the service we received from start to finish was incredible which made the whole experience the best trek I’ve ever been on in 2 years of travelling. You’ll get a briefing the day before you leave at their office so you know what to expect & make sure you have all the right equipment ready. I advise to book the Inca trail in advance as it can become booked up really quickly & there are only a limited number of tickets a day on this trail! Day 1, 3 & 4 of the trail are a lot easier than day 2 where there are 2 passes you need to complete & reach the highest altitude, however the guides will stay with you at all times & help you get through it if you struggle. Throughout the trail there are many archaeological sites you visit which are interesting & break up your trail for a nice rest. The weather can change all the time so I recommend taking layers, waterproofs and waterproof covers for your bag, insect repellent & sun cream.This hike can be a challenge but do able for all ages, just take it slow & steady as there is quite a bit of uphill & a lot of steps! Hire a porter if you think you might struggle with the extra weight, it might be worth it."
Do the hike in the Dry Season,"We recently completed the trail and thought that the whole experience was fantastic.There are a lot of review in the trail so I will keep mine brief.My view is that this is a hike that you do in the dry season. It would not be a whole lot if fun if it rained heavily while tracking as as Peru has a very distinct dry season, timing your hike for this time of year seems like the way to go.We did not have a drop of rain and I believe that this added considerably to the experience. Clouds would have hidden many if the fabulous views that we had. Even though we were hiking in mid winter the days were hot (sunblock weather). But the nights were very cold (except for the last night when you are at a much lower altitude). Our tour company hired out suitable sleeping bags at US20.The toilet facilities are very basic and take some getting used to. If you can’t cope with very basic toilet facilities for four days then the hike is not for you."
"Peru Treks - fabulous organisation, totally focused on customers wellbeing","We have recently been on the classic Inca Trail 4D / 3N with Peru Tours and couldn't be more delighted with the way in which we were supported through really comprehensive information about how to prepare for the trek and what would be involved. Every aspect of the trek was covered and supplemented by a briefing at their offices a couple of days before the start of the trek. The guides were excellent, really knowledgeable as well as encouraging and patient. Unfortunately one of our party was unwell but rather than the guide just taking us back to the start of the trek and abandoning us, he stayed with us the whole time we were away from the rest of our party before rejoining them for the final day of the trek at Machu Picchu! Not only did he attend to the medical needs, he also sorted out the accommodation, travel arrangements and tickets alongside ensuring that we had as good as experience as possible (I had returned to check he was OK) - taking me on tours of other ruins, providing me with an understanding of the history of the Inca's and, once my son had recovered, taking us on longer treks and ensuring we had everything we needed. This support was truly outstanding and really over and above anything we could have expected. Oh, and the remainder of our party who continued on the trek had a fabulous experience  - excellent food, really attentive guides and porters and lots of great times with the whole group."
Best way to get first view of Machu Picchu,"If Machu Picchu is on your bucket list, there is no better way to get your first view than coming through the Sun Gate from the Inca Trail.  My daughter and I hiked the Lares Trek followed by the shorter version of the Inca Trail starting from KM 104.  If you can stand at least a 1 day mostly uphill hike then you can at least complete the shorter version of the Inca Trail.  It is so worth it.  We used Alpaca Expeditions - an absolutely excellent company to work with."
Amazing Adventure to MachuPicchu,"I did the Inca trail to Machupicchu for 4 days and 3 nights, with Salkantay Trekkers Peru.Our organization was excellent I joined a group of 6 people.We had the briefing one night before our departure where our guide Jose gave us full information and some suggestions.The service was very good, with all the staff that we went from the first day between them it is worth mentioning the service of our Cheff and our porters who were the people who took our travel luggage.The whole group saw the desire to work as a team, and in a professional manner.Our Guide Jose very kind and attentive with all the group of tourists and the staff of the Agency.I had the best travel experience with this group and very organized, I congratulate the whole group for making me part of this unforgettable experience.I recommend this travel agency in Cusco, for those people who are interested in traveling to Machu Picchu."
Short Inca trail - Kaypi Tours,"Went with family for the short Inca trail hike. It was a two day trip with hike on first day and Machu Picchu on second day. Our tour guide from Kaypi Tours Lito was awesome. He took care of everything. Great views, waterfalls, Inca ruins. Overall a lot of fun."
best way to approch machu picchu,"did the 1 day hike. Starting from km106 - should be km104, but there were a landslide few days ago.around 10km (vs 14km if started from km104), and 920ish meter in elevation gain. nothing too hard. took 3h30mn.You get the best view on arrival (from intipuku - sun gate), you may arrive at a time where the site is not so crowded. We felt almost alone on the trail during the day, saw some people but not that much."
Great Hike - Beautiful Views,We did the 1 day Inca Trail hike during our G Adventures trip. The guides were awesome. Although the terrain wasn't that difficult the altitude was a challenge. We were all in pretty good shape but still had to stop often to catch our breath. The guides were aware of this so stopped frequently. The end of the tour was at the Sun Gate overlooking Machu Picchu at the end of the day. It was beautiful. It rained all day but it was still an awesome day.
Beware if you are afraid of heights...,"We did the one day hike with a G Adventures guide.  The sights are indescribable.  We are from a high altitude so that didn't bother us and the exertion also wasn't a problem.  The one problem for me was that in all of my research about the trail, no one ever mentioned how frequently the trail was hugging the side of the mountain with extreme exposures on the other side.  I realize that is likely a failure on my part to do more research but it became very challenging after a while.  If you struggle with heights, you may want to ask yourself if this is a good match for you.  The other disappointment is when you come through the Sun Gate to get your first view of Machu Picchu, you are inundated a crush of people who have walked up the trail from Machu Picchu and are all jockeying for the best selfie.  It was kind of overwhelming.  Overall, it was a great challenge but one I probably wouldn't sign up for again."
inca trail 4d/3n,"We absolutely loved our time with local Salkantay Trekkers Peru - doing the 4D-3N classical Inca Trail with them. We felt this was an excellent company to choose to do the famous trek  to Machupicchu with, and we liked that it is owned by local people (rather than just a large foreign brand). We only had four people in our group, which was amazing to Us (they take a maximum of 8 people for the trek), the tour guide was fantastic and the porters were definitely the most friendly on the whole trail!Everything was perfect and we were so sad to say goodbye to Richard, and our porters. If you have the opportunity to do the outing with Salkantay Trekkers Peru, I highly recommend it.It was one of our favorite days of the trip. Thanks  Team!"
Absolutely Amazing,"We did the 4-day hike with Wayki. We had the best time. Nothing, I mean NOTHING, went wrong. I could talk all day about the good things. We had an amazing guide and wonderful group of porters. The chef cooked incredible meals for us. The trail is beautiful and well-maintained. The only regret I have is that 4 days flew by so quickly."
Porter Treatment,"While on the Inca Trail with another tour company, we were on the same schedule as a G Adventure group and ran into them frequently.  I noticed immediately that their porters were not issued a uniform.  Many were under dressed for the weather, without coats or rain gear, and wearing sandals instead of hiking boots.  Their toes were black possibly from previous frostbite.  Porters from G Adventure also carried packs much larger than other porters we saw on the trail.  I have serious questions about the way G Adventures treats their porters"
Amazing  Views of Nature and History,"We went to Machupicchu by bus from Aguas Calientes where we had stayed the night before. Once you get up there the views are amazing. It is worth all the troubles to get there, even though it rained all night and we thought we will not be able to go up to see the Inca Valley. The weather is very unpredictable in that region. Breath taking views of all the natural mountains and the remains of the Inca Valley. We hiked down after the tour and it was quite challenging even though we were just going down. Well worth it."
Inca Trail,"Went to South America (used a company called Chimu) for a few weeks part was walking the Inca trial. Amazing experience difficult at times, Marco our guide was fantastic. To to see the various Inca sites amazing, to walk into Machu Picchu through the sun gate gives a real appreciation of the grandeur that is Machu Picchu. Would recommend"
The way to see Machu Picchu,"The ‘short’ Inca trail is from km104. It takes from about 9am to 2-3pm to reach the Sun Gate, and a further hour to get down to Machu Picchu. This was all with plenty of photo stops, rest breaks and lunch. Some of the climb is up steep steps and the rest is moderate slopes. Anyone used to hillwalking will have no problems as the guides will give plenty of time for anyone feeling breathless. And the best bit...you only get to see MP once you reach the sun gate - stunning. Don’t be put off if the weather is cloudy, it gives the whole site a more mysterious feel (as long as it’s not completely obscured). Travel light but with plenty of layers as there is a huge variation in temperature. Footwear can be trainers or walking boots as the paths and steps don’t get too wet/muddy. Enjoy !"
Inka Trail + Alternative Rainbow Mountain,"This was the end of my South America trip and the highlight, 5 days of pure adventure, culture and nature. I was prepared, at least I thought so, but the stairs were a killer. But Joel was an incredible guide who always walked last with our small group, motivating us to not stop but go on. The camping was warm, even if outside the weather was freezy. Also the hot coca tea helped to stay warm and altitude-sickness free. Considering the organization, it could not have been better, and Alex, a heavy guy, made it too. The view down to the Machu Picchu is precious, there's nothing that can exchange the feeling I've had here, and exploorperu did an incredible job with that hike. But the same goes for the alternative Rainbow Mountain, as I did not want to hike 3-4 hours and they had only about 1 hour. A gorgeous place and view. My legs start to hurt when I think of the entire trek, even after 3 weeks, but all of that was so worth it! Places you have to see."
KM 106 and the Sun Gate,"We had a guide from Peruvian Soul (Peruvian Soul managed our entire Peru experience wonderfully) picking us up in town (AC) and walking the train tracks to KM106 at around 6 AM. This ended up to be a nice warm-up prior to crossing the river and starting up the trail.As many other reviews state, the quality of the guide is essential and understanding this is a porter's trail makes the hike easier. Porters literally run by you carrying sacks of refuge and whatever from their catered clients high above.There were six of us - the oldest (me) being 60 with the youngest 35. This was a challenging hike, but did not require a level 10 for an hour on a stair-master. Nor do you need to be a spin-class instructor - have a small group + guide and set a pace.The trail is quite well covered with trees and plants - not too exposed. The trail from the river to the Sun Gate is in quite good shape too. The Inca sections are beyond descriptions - just simply amazing to walk on stones placed 600 years prior in an environment unimaginable, but this applies to all the Inca sites.We arrived at the Sun Gate around 1PM and had an absolutely great time from there to Machu Picchu itself. Other reviews complain about the hike perhaps and the time of day - my suggestion is to get up early, have a select group of folks (not strangers), and a good guide - all is simple from there.Allocate two hours to visit Winay Wana on the trek up. I suggest making this your longer rest stop as this Inca site is beyond description. As all hikers round the bend and see it for the first time there is more astonishment than perhaps Machu Picchu itself. Missing this site and not having time would be unfortunate. Advise the guide you'd like to drink water/food there as opposed to the porter's camp.The hike from the porter's camp to the Sun Gate is relatively easy and is stunning in views and Inca architecture. The scramble up the stairs just prior to the Sun Gate is a hoot.We hiked around the region for four days with Machu Picchu being our literal journey's end. Peruvian Soul arranged our holiday and i would suggest them. Eloy was our group's #1 guide, but all guides were efficient, polite and well informed. I suggest visiting other Inca sites requiring a bit of a hike prior to Machu Picchu and I would recommend spending the day on 106 and Machu Picchu and skipping the town stuff.Our visit was epic.The altitude and endless steps made the physical side challenging but rewarding. Carry a quality framed pack and goodies and confirm your boots have new tread!"
"Magical Machu Picchu with Peru For Less and Wayki Trekkers, Inca Trail","Words will fall far shy of describing the amazing time we had!  Adrienne Moss, with Peru for Less, had many suggestions, encouragement, and coordination which were invaluable.  She especially helped my wife and I in the time we were apart, and her time alone in Cusco to Machu Picchu; this was the longest time we had been apart in 30 years, LOL.We ended up doing a lot of activities once we teamed up. Riding horses in the mountains above Cusco was very fun, and spectacular scenery as almost everywhere we went!  I believe the guides name was Olger, and he was very kind and passionate, and took great care of us.  It had drizzled rain the day before, which turned out to be great for the ATV ride.  It really was phenomenal how well everything was coordinated.We almost backed out of the ATV ride, as my wife wasn't so sure about doing it in the rain.  Turns out we made the right decision to proceed, as it was so much fun.  I was good the dust was knocked down some, and Tipon was amazing!  I believe our guides name was Roger, and he, as all our guides was personable, enthusiastic, and fun.  It was very worthwhile.Probably some of our most majestic and spectacular scenery was on the Mountain Biking Outing.  Maras and Marais were fantastic and the bike rides were most fulfilling, though tough at a few points with the altitude and a few uphills.  Most of it was a gentle easy downhill.  Our guide was very patient, passionate, and encouraging.  This was one of my favorite activities.  The lunch was fantastic that day, as well.  We also ventured into the city square that day, and bought a couple cornhusk baskets at a local market.I really think it was hard to beat the village experience at Patacancha!  OMG the women and the children were so kind, loveable, and genuinely heart-warming.  I'm SOOOOooo glad we caught up with the group.  Juan told us much about the customs, culture, and projects around the villages in the highlands on the ride up.  The lunch that day was one of my most favorite life experiences ever.  Great meal, and a bit surprised by the Cuy.  It was my third time to try it (and the best) but my wife's first, and she actually liked it.  Corrine did a great job guiding us through Ollyantambo afterwards, another fascinating site!The City tours far exceeded the expectations of both my wife and myself.As to the Inca Trail....WOW!!!!  This was an experience that has notched an indelible mark on my soul, and I will never forget the beauty of the landscape - far outshining my expectations, the genuine kindness and work the porters, chefs, and associates lent, and the tough work it took to accomplish such a rewarding finale.  Miguel and the Wayki Trekking Team were beyond reproach.  I had a much smaller group than I was anticipating - 2 young girls from nSweden and a nice girl from NY!  We all got along so well, even though the girls kicked my butt.  I still can't get over the food; could never say enough how good and plentiful it was!  Miguel took time to speak to our hearts, minds, and spirits at multiple occasions along the trail.  He is a gift to his profession, and it was a true honor to have associated with him.  He was very patient with me, as I was a bit slower that the marathoners I was teamed up with, LOL.  Machu Picchu was magical and lived up to our expectations.  We were blessed with the most perfect weather.  Miguel, and the other guide my wife and I had together, were marvelous.  She loved the Huayna Picchu hike which pleasantly surprised me.  It scared the bejesus out of me on a few of the death-defying stairways, and ledges.  Couldn't believe we were up and down within 2 1/2 hours.  The views were so stunning.  I appreciated the efforts and encouragement by Adrienne to do Machu Picchu Mountain, as well.  This was very challenging, and quite the exertion for both of us, but less scary for me overall.  We had a very comfortable time frame in which to do the hike.  We started both mountains at 7 am.  Being at the Sanctuary Lodge was a godsend, as it was so easy to access the park in the early am.  We were amazed that a few hundred people were already in line at 5:15 am.  I was a very romantic and enjoyable stay; would highly recommend.  Expensive, but I feel very worth it.Every accommodation we loved and they all exceeded our expectations.  Aranwa was fabulous, far nicer and more special than I was expecting.The Rio Sagrado was truly a slice of heaven!!!  One of our most favorite places of all time.And the Grand Finale the Monasterio - wow, made my wife literally cry with it's beauty, history, the culinary delights.We became quite the fans of Pisco, as well, over the trip.  There was a really fun Pisco drink making show by the bartender our first night at the Sanctuary Lodge.  We can't wait to return to Peru, and coordinate with Adrienne and Peru For Less!"
2 Day Machu Picchu Inca Trail Trek - word of caution re route change,"We recently completed the 2 day Inca Trail trek.  Upon arrival, we were advised by our tour company that due to a problem with the trail (bridge out?), our route had been changed so that we departed from km 106 instead of km 104.  This change put us on the Porter's Trail: an intense, steep series of switchback stone stairs straight up a mountain to Winay Wayna. It was challenging and exhausting and took from 2-3 hours for members of our group to complete. It was a far cry from the advertised original km 104 route which is supposed to be suitable for people of average fitness.  I'm not even sure what we missed out on by not going on the original trail.  The good news is that everybody in our group did manage to successfully complete this portion, and the rest of the trek to the Sun Gate seemed like a breeze by comparison.  Check with your tour company about the route detour and consider your fitness level before you commit."
Amazing hike with Camping Tours,"We just had an absolutely unforgettable experience hiking the Inca Trail for 4 days and 3 nights with Camping Tours. Our guide, Paco, and all our porters were truly our family during the trip. The food was amazing, equipment was good quality, we felt safe and in good hands, and the customer service by the office was impeccable. We had a slight snaffu and Camping Tours bent over backwards to make it right. They care a lot about their customers and it shows. I can’t recommend Camping Tours enough and would come back to Peru just to do another tour with them."
1 day Inca Trail,"We did the 1 day hike which in my opinion was the way to go, tough in the beginning, steep and humid but after lunch the trail was a gentle up and down until the last part(Monkey Steps) just before Sungate, it's a slow downhill after that due to the steps and uneven surface. When we arrived about 415pm the crowds were pretty much gone, the place was magical and amazing especially with the afternoon light."
Effort versus Reward - 1 day Inca Trail,"My wife and I are around 60 and not in peak physical shape but we opted to approach Machu Picchu via the 1-day trek to the Sun Gate with Bamba Experience.  The whole day exceeded our expectations!  The exertion of the climb was at times, a little too much for my wife, and it was only for our guide, Junior, who carried her pack for most of the trek that we both made it.  The reward of reaching the Sun Gate and the elevated view of Machu Picchu was worth the effort.  During our many stops Junior imparted his knowledge of the local flora and fauna which added to the whole experience.  Tips - travel as light as possible as water should be the main load weight.  You will need plenty of it!!!  Ensure you have good sun protection as the effort in climbing causes you to lose sun cream through sheer sweat. The packed lunch was eaten following the main ascent - excellent time with a good selection of sandwiches, fruit and chocolate.  A never-to-be-forgotten experience for us both!!!"
Bucket List tick,An experience of a lifetime. Whilst the trail was challenging it was rewarded with some fantastic views of ancient Inca ruins and the magnificent Machu Picchu. certainly one to tick off the bucket list!
PERU FOR LESS,"I have wanted to do the Inca Trail for a long time.  I started a year in advance to review various tour companies. There was quite a financial  spectrum of companies. I started seeing a number of positive reviews for PERU for LESS.  I began an ongoing conversation with one of their travel specialists Rylee Mcgowan.Thanks to Rylee and Peru for Less, we had a great trip to Peru.Their attention to detail was amazing.  No detail as far as the trip was left to chance.Transportation was right there when we arrived. The hotel choices were great especially the San Blas in Cusco.  The 3 days to acclimatize in Cusco worked well. The guides for the Cusco and Sacred Valley Tours were very good and provided an excellent experience.  I especially enjoyed going to the co-ops where the original woven products were made.The 4 days and 3 nights on the Inca Trail along with guide Jorge were amazing and informative. As an avid backpacker, I would label this hike difficult and you had better prepare physically. All in all, it was a great experience with Rylee Mcgowan and Peru for Less."
4 days with g Adventures group 3,"incredible adventure holiday, supported by an energetic and passionate tour guide, porters and holiday group.This holiday had been on our bucket list for some time and when we went, the rubber absolutely hit the road! The Inca trail was hard going at points, day 2 of the Dead Woman's Pass was the hardest day, but we felt fine during and after. The chef's supporting the group knew how to prepare, sustain and restore us along the way so we never felt like it was an arduous journey.The scenery is superb and we had many hours of being 'alone' on the trek when the group was spread out. We saw many Inca sites along the way for a welcome history break, and when you get to Machu Picchu the walk is as worth it!Not only did we get to experience history, with g adventures we also visited local communities prior to the Inca trail, plus our guide Rudy always provided us with cultural insights and anecdotes.After the trail we went to the Amazon for a few nights, recommend anyone to head on to Puert Maldonado after the trail!Sublime - I will be back!"
Fantastic bucket list adventure,"We did the 4day/3night Inca trail with Alpaca Expeditions and it was perfect. Breathtaking scenery, history, flora, fauna..The guides, porters, cooks all helped to make this an experience we will never forget. We were a group of 6 women in our mid 60's .   Some advice for the older crowd....this is not an easy trek.. You need to be in shape. 2 women turned back after the 1st day due to physical reasons, not having the time to train. I found doing the eliptical and hiking trails with steep hills and steps very helpful to prepare. We did some 6-8 mile hikes beforehand so mentally we knew we could do it. The altitude is the unknown factor. You need to have a positive attitude. We all had a moment of freaking out the night before the big day of hiking up 2 13,000+ft passes if we could really do it.  And you can.  Slow and steady at your own pace. .  And when you stop to breathe, look around and take in the beauty around you, pinch yourself and realize you are really living this magical moment . This really is a trip of a lifetime. One last thing... I do not use hiking poles at home to hike but you definitely need them for this."
Amazing and amazingly difficult....,"We chose Alpaca Expeditions and were not sorry to do this adventure with 'The Green Machine'. Our guides, Rosel and Toribio (Toro) were truly outstanding. The trail itself is not for the faint of heart, and was more difficult because we had 3 days of rain. Would I do it again? Nope. Am I glad I did it? Absolutely!"
Inca trail with Adventures Within Reach,Four day trek with with three nights camping was spectacular way to experience the Inca Trail and approach Machu Picchu through the Sun Gate! Our guides Claudia and Fernando were attentive and provided excellent education on the Inca civilization. Service provided by porters and chefs was also outstanding. All transfers were taken care of by AWR and went smoothly. Preparation for the trek was managed by Gretchen at AWR and she was extremely helpful and prompt in answering questions. Service provided by AWR made the trip enjoyable and worry free so that the vistas and Inca sites could be appreciated with no distractions. Strenuous hiking for us (age mid 60s) but very manageable with good pace set by Claudia. Highly recommend Adventures Within Reach for traditional Inca Trail trek.
Best trek in the world,"I am an avid trekker and this trek is definitely one of the best ones in the world. The combination of the andes, mountains, lush forest and the inca paved stones make this trek a true unique experience. But what topped the experience was the great food our cook prepared for us and Euler our guide who was very knowledgeable and personable. Booked it with machupicchu center along with rainbow mountain."
Avoid 'Tierras vivas' agency,"We just finished a 2 day inca trail with 'tierras Vivas' agency. The trail is great, but our guide Ana Maria was terrible. She barely gave us any information and she didn't put any effort. A waste of money. Be very careful with who you book the trail!!!!"
Truly amazing and inspiring,"Traveling to see Machu Picchu with high expectations was greatly exceeded by seeing, walking and learning about the inhabitants, history and then considering the engineering the people had to have had. MP is breathtaking in beauty and in witnessing the lifestyle and hard working people who lived there. Humbling to see the remains of past civilization."
Challenging km104 trail but fully worth it,"The Inca trail is truly remarkable as to how it cuts into the mountains in the most efficient manner. We also seen beautiful sights on the way from postcard sceneries, mini waterfalls, various flowers and tress to narrow cliffs. It is vital to our on insect repellent, sunblock and a raincoat as the weather in unpredictable in the rainforest. We bought our poncho just outside the train station at 1sol, it did the job. Some areas of the hike is challenging but the most important thing to remember is slow and easy."
Machu Picchu Salkantay trek,"Had the most amazing time, what a memorable experience, one I will remember for life. The stunning views, the breathtaking environment and the most amazing people. Percy our local guide made the experience, knowledgeable about the whole trek from fruits and wildlife along the way to the Inca’s story and Machu Picchu, so sociable and funny and made everyone feel like a “happy family” (that’s what he called us) Percy was working for Bamba Experience."
Memorable trip!,"We went with SAS travels ( 4 day, 3 night package ) and we have no regrets! They were so friendly and helpful. Always supporting us, encouraging us, giving us advice when we had difficulties on the trail; Their cook Braulio Aguilar was excellent! We always looked forward to his delicious lunch and dinner!! The trail is rocky with uneven steps; Train hard and you will love the experience!"
"A challenging, unforgettable adventure that everyone should do!","We took the four day trek to Machu Picchu with Bamba. The instructions, the equipment provided, and the guide were all first rate. Diego, our guide, was very knowledgeable, experienced, and patient with those of us who were a bit (or a lot) slower. He explained in great detail the many archaeological sites along the trail, and always ensured we were operating in the safest manner possible while making sure that each individual was getting what it was they wanted out of the experience. He was worth his weight in gold. The multi-course meals were of the highest possible quality, and much better than expected given the austere environment the cook worked in. Seeing Machu Picchu was our goal, but the adventure of The Inca Trail was actually the highlight."
Inca Trail with Kandoo Adventures - “can do”,"The Kandoo Peru team (especially Jose, Zoraida and Rachael) is outstanding! I was scheduled to do the 4 Day Inca Trail, and had done several days of touring other sites in the Sacred Valley prior to starting the hike (with Jose’s excellent guide services). I awoke the morning of the hike with a badly swollen knee and sadly had to make the decision to pull myself from the hike. Jose and Zoraida took immediate action and made arrangements to get me back to Cusco and get a hotel room. Zoraida then shepherded me through the process of getting medical attention - which was fast and effective in consultation and draining fluid from my knee (note - payment was in cash direct to the doctors at time of service). Since my knee was feeling better almost immediately, Zoraida then made all the arrangements (car, train, hotel, bus) to get me to Machu Picchu in time to meet the hiking crew for their arrival at the site. I was then able to do the site tour and part of the hike to Huayna Picchu (knee was not strong enough to climb the steep parts). While not the complete fulfillment of my dream, Kandoo Peru made it turn out to be a great experience! This is certainly not something you want to have happen, but it is great to know that Kandoo “can do” when/if it does."
Awseome,What an experience of a lifetime! I would highly recommend this. We took altitude sickness medications. Our rational was that we didn’t want to get this far and be sick and miss the experience.
THE Experience of a lifetime!,"I had high expectations before embarking on the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu, and I can say without reservation that the experience was beyond my wildest expectations.  It is a true pilgrimage experience that is deeply rewarding and gives you an intimate appreciation for the genius of the Inca Civilization.  There are many noteworthy sights along the 4-day trek path, and the natural beauty is spectacular.  Seeing Machu Picchu from the Sun Gate on the 4th day is something you will not soon forget - it has been 2.5 years since I went and it is still fresh in my memory.  I would recommend that anyone going on the trail be prepared for a strenuous hike - you will be on lots of stone, uneven surfaces, with lots of uphill and downhill sections.  Good overall fitness is essential, but you will not regret the experience."
South Adventure Peru,"Just back from an amazingly unforgettable trip to Peru organized from start to finish by Ruben at South Adventure Peru. We did multiple tours which included in part the Inca Trail and 4 days in the Amazon. There were so many details to our trip and Ruben and his team sorted out every single one of them for us. They were always quick to respond to our emails and if there ever was any issue with anything at all they would sort it our very quickly and VERY professionally. The guides were always professional and informative and quickly felt like more than a guide…they became our friends. The porters on the Inca Trail were some of the sweetest most amazing people we met in Peru and strong as bulls. This review would not be complete without saying something about the food on the Inca trail. It was truly 5 star! We were amazed at what our cook could create on a side gas burner. The entire team went above and beyond to make sure every detail of our trip was perfect include Jean Pierre who organized to have our laundry done overnight (after the Inca and before we left in the morning for the Amazon). I would HIGHLY recommend Ruben and South Adventure Tours out of Cusco. On a side note, to anyone travelling to Peru, be prepared for tipping. From drivers to tour guides and everyone in between…. they all work so hard for you and they deserve a tip."
"An unforgettable experience! 4 days, 3 nights to remember for the rest of your life","We had the fortune of completing our Inca Trek was an incredibly talented, personable and hardworking team lead by Percy.  Percy and Sergey became our friends as the experience went on- having a vast amount of knowledge about the Inkan history as well as support and understanding of how exhausting the climb can be for anyone undertaking it for the first time.Percy has a great sense of humour, warmth and approachability- really missed that once the trek was over.We would highly recommend this tour company who gave a detailed briefing the evening before we embarked on the trek, and ensured we returned back safely. Our only complaint would be around the tipping process, it would have been better, and less awkward for us Brits, if tips were included in the upfront price of the tour.  We had no problem at all giving the money- the guys had definitely worked for it, although some in our group were not aware of the etiquette and a small group of us ended up covering a significant amount of the shortfall.If you do a chance to complete the Inca trail, you won't regret it.  What a feat!"
Machu Picchu with #Kandoo Adventures,"We hiked the Inca trail to Machu Picchu mid April and had a great time! The Kandoo team was awesome and highly skilled. I would highly recommend them!  Our guide Jose has a lot of Inca knowledge and made sure we had a great experience every minute of the trip. He was well respected by the locals, the Kandoo staff, and the guests. Every meal was outstanding in flavor and presentation-very well done. We also enjoyed the company of the other hikers in our group."
Amazing 4 day hike - just beautiful ,"April 14, 2018 my friend Dani and I hiked the Inca trail for charity.  It had always been on my bucket list to hike it after Kilimanjaro.  I hiked with G adventures and it was amazing.  I enjoyed each day, even though it was tough.  Walking through the cloud forest, to ancient Inca sites, through high altitude passes, and misty rain was magical. Yes the toilets on the trail are rough and there isn’t cell phone reception.  It is just cool to be on the same trails, the same steps as Incan royalty. Our guide Elias was knowledgeable and really keep the group together.  The food was delicious and gave us the power to push through.  The friends we met made us laugh and seeing Machu Picchu was breathtaking.  Truly recommend , once in a lifetime opportunity."
4 day / 3 night Inca Trail,"One of the most challenging and memorable treks we have ever done. The changing scenery along the trail is spectacular, from panoramic mountain views to jungle and forest stretches, and of course Incan ruins.  The Porters are incredible and make the journey as comfortable as possible, and we were fortunate enough to have a renowned cook in our team. Arriving at Machu Picchu on Day four through the Sun Gate is something we will never forget!!"
First hiking trip ...,"Our family with my two girls, 16 & 9 hiked the Inca trail last year during Canadian march break and it was great.It was our first hiking trip even though my girls have done multiple days canoe trip during summer, hiking at high elevation is a first for all our us. Our journey started with our guide and driver picks us up at our hotel on the day of hike and we visited a few Inca ruins and the Sacred valley before heading to the trailhead ( the trekking company has campsites at the entrance to the hike with hot showers, kitchen and a dining place). Day 2, we started our hike and was the first group at the entrance to the trailhead. The first day was quite easy and every got to the camp site with high spirit. Our guide though warned us that the next day will be short but will be all climbing up to Dead Women's Pass. He was not lying, I had to rest every 10 steps to catch my breath... and my two girls were so fast ahead of us, and they once waited for us for more than half an hour:)  Every single minute of the up hill made me think that I was going to have a heart attack. Day 3 was all down hill but it was a loooooooooooog day... I somehow twisted muscle of my left leg and I was walking so slow. I made to the camp site around 6 , and did not even have our afternoon tea. Day 4 we had to get up at 4 in the morning and packed during heavy rain and said good buy to our porters since they had to catch the early train , and lined up in front of the entrance to Machu Piccu in heavy rain.. and reached Sun Gate around 930. The scenery is breath taking and the ruins are amazing, make everybody wonder how the Incas managed to move those large boulder up the hill. The food our chief prepared is yummy... tea, snacks, fruit, soup, main dish and dessert! Love our porters and they have such beautiful smileThe guide is just OKAY - he is not talking much and not explaining much"
Outstanding beauty,We were a group of 8 and did the 2day 1 night inca trail. It was hard going but am amazing! Our guide Reuben from Tucan Travels was brilliant! Very supportive and helpful.  The trek was tough going up the steep steps but when you reach the top and see the inca village and magnificent views you forget about you're aches and pains. Well worth doing
This is TOUGH!,"More than anything, I really just want to clarify a couple aspects of this INCA Trail (ours was a 4-day) trek for potential Trekkers (Regardless of the Trekking Company you select). We had NO idea how hard (both the physical and altitude aspects) of the trek were going to be.1) This trek is for Experienced hikers, the terrain is relatively flat for ONLY the first 2 hours, the remainder of the 2.5 days is all either predominantly upward or downward trekking (approximately 20 hours). It is a difficult undertaking.  Day 2 is EXTREMELY difficult, 11 hours of only up and down hiking at a very high altitude. The Fitbit read 288 flights of stairs at the end of the trek!The trekking companies don’t tell you this!2) I HIGHLY recommend arriving in Cusco (14,000 feet above sea level) at least 3 days in advance of the date your trek departs. Unless you are an experienced 14000 ft. hiker and understand how altitude affects you, this is a must.  The altitude is probably the biggest single factor that you need to take into consideration. If you experience altitude sickness, you usually won’t know this until either day 2 or 3 at altitude.Machupicchu is beautiful, we were there in early April, at the end of rainy season, and had mostly beautiful weather and lush green views everywhere. The UNESCO site itself is crowded, and our guide said much worse from April to September.I hope this helps give you a better idea what to expect, happy travels!"
"The Best Experience Ever, with Andean Hikers Peru","Me and my girlfriend have just done the classic Inca trail, at the beginning we did not know where to start or who to look for to plan this adventure, fortunately after doing a hard research work on internet and see the payment and booking options, we decided to get in touch with Andean Hikers Peru and it was the best decision we made because the hike with them was spectacular.Our Guide was Javier and was by far the best hike guide we had, very charismatic, gentle and above all very knowledgeable about Inca culture and history, he also has a very fluent English which made communication with him not a problem, thanks o him we learned more about Peru but this time to depth.The Inca Trail is very beautiful and challenging at the same time, and there is a lot of logistics behind this hike that needs to be carried, for this case Andean Hikers Peru provided us with a team of very helpful and friendly porters, without these guys for sure that this adventure would not have been possible to happen.Also someone who deserves our recognition is our great Chef Americo, who was in charge of feeding us with the best of Peruvian food during these 4 days of trek, we tried everything with him from the Andean beans to the delicious cuy or guinea pig, thanks to him I think we will have to do more exercises to lose the pounds we earn during the hike.Finally if someone are looking for reliable and genuine company to do the Inca Trail don’t hesitate in contact Andean Hikers Peru, you won’t regret."
"Inca Trek 4 day, 3 nights with G Adventures","My friend (60 yr old woman) and I (54 woman) completed the trail. We are hardy, fit hikers from the Canadian Rockies. I have a very bad knee (need a replacement) but with medication and disposable ice packs was able to finish in the same time as the 30 yr olds in the group. The continuous step ups and down's  were the hardest for me as I need to adjust my stride length. Strong hiking poles with shocks in them were essential. We took altitude med's even after 4 days acclimatizing in Puno, I think it helped. If my strength wasn't what it is I think the trip would have been difficult and not enjoyable due to the knee pain and being forced to take the steps. Yes old people can hike the Inca Trail. I'm glad I went."
Incredible journey,"You travel through such a variety of scenery, camping and feasting on stunning views and beautiful flora and wildlife."
2 day hike on the Inca Trail,"We decided to do the 2 day hike on the Inca Trail with Alpaca Exhibitions. It's basically 1 day hiking up, and then the next day you take the bus to get into Machu Picchu with your guide. I really loved this! It was exhausting, but it was so nice to have then the rewarding view on Machu Picchu, when we reached the top of the mountain! Just a lot better than only coming by bus (which we did the next day to get into Machu Picchu)"
Might be the coolest thing I have ever done!,"We had no idea what this would entail and let me say it was beyond our expectations.  The hike was challenging yet invigorating and worth every step.  I really can't adequately describe in words, let me just say do it if you can!  Spectacular!"
Hike the Inca Trail,"The best way to get to Machu Picchu if you have the time and the strength and courage.  Much more interesting than catching a train and a bus there and back in a day.Three nights; four days (though the last day gets you to Machu Picchu early in the morning and you have the rest of the day there, so not that much hiking on day four, though you do have to tackle the 52 steps nicknamed ""gringo killers"" for their steepness).Book fairly early (I booked about 6 months ahead), as there is a limit to the number of permits issued per day - 200 I think.Pick a good, reputable company - one that looks after their porters - limits their weight, gives them a uniform, etc.  We were allowed to give the porters 6 kilos each - and it was weighed.  The porter's packs are weighed at the gates.I went with Intrepid from Australia, which partnered with Peak on the ground in Peru.New tents.  Portable chemical toilets.  Great food (the chef had garnish like flowers made from radishes and olives, and even baked a cake on our last day!).The hiking is a little like Nepal, though much shorter.  Plenty of ups and down.  Can be hard on the knees.If it's wet, the paths can be muddy and the rocks slippery.But I wouldn't have done it any other way!"
Short Inca Trail,"An amazing adventure for those who want a challenge! We did the one-day inca trail - and was not disappointed in the views and sights.Our train to the stop was delayed for a few hours - but in the end this worked in our favour.The hike was ardous but rewarding - a nice packed lunch by a waterfall in the shade from the midday sun was relaxing. The sights throughout the walk were unforgetable, memories which will stay with us for ever.We reached the summit of Machu Picchu around closing time; meaning during peak summer time, it was almost empty - a few people and a few llamas are in the pictures I managed to capture. Breathtaking beauty does not to justice to the views or feelings evoked from this natural beauty. By the time we were on the bus down to our hotel, it was dark and the temperature slowing dropping off - a welcome realise to the heat of the day.Truly magnificent!"
"Looking for KM 104 Short Inca as DAY TRIP only NO Hotels, No Food, No Nuthin",Anyone have suggestions for KM 104 Inca Trail Hike as Day Trip with none of the extras that would be reasonably priced?Thank you!
Must Experience at least once in your lifetime!,"Whether you are on a shorter 3 day hike or a longer trek, the Inca Trail is a hike you must experience to truly appreciate the magic that lies within the Sacred Valley of Peru. Machu Picchu is absolutely mind-blowing but the actual journey of walking all the way to this ancient Inca site is priceless... To think that these ruins and this trail was actually made at a time when they didn't have the machines or technology we do now. Its incredible to see the land itself,  the purity of the Incas that still reside on the trail, and to take in such rich landscapes and cultures along with exploring a plethora of hidden ruins along the way- only then in this experience are you able to fully grasp the beauty, magic, and sacredness of the Incas and the Peruvian culture. You must have a guide to hike the trail and most companies are great but Vicuna Adventures Peru was exceptional in my experience. I conduct retreats around the world and pride myself in meeting some of the best people in their field. I first met Sabino, tour guide and owner or Vicuna, about 4 years ago and use him every year Im in Peru. A guide who can encompass the history, culture, mysticism, flora and fauna knowledge and so much more, is a MUST! The team that accompanies your trek is even better with the best chefs (custom meals for vegan/vegetarians also), porters, etc. all make the trek one to remember for a lifetime. The Inca Trail is fit for everyone- with the right porters and guides, they will always have someone to stay behind the group and help those that may be struggling. I saw 80 year old women holding umbrellas to block the sun and shuffling their feet along but my gosh they did make it! Incredible...but lastly, to walk through the sun gates at 4am and to know how far you trekked to get to your destination- you will finally understand what it means when they say, ""Its the JOURNEY, not the destination""... Now Im ready again for round 3! LOL!! :)"
Amazing trek ,"Machu Picchu is a “must see” for many people and we thoroughly enjoyed the trek, gruelling though it was at times. Most reviews talk about the details of the trek, I am just going to highlight the tips so it’s not a personal travel narrative. - used the company Kusa Treks - highly recommended and I did a separate TA review- in Cusco stayed at the Rumi Punku hotel - again- recommended and subject of a separate TA review - if you have time to train before you go - do cardio and a stepping machine (or walk up  flights of stairs). This is the best preparation you can get -take your 2-3 days in Cusco to acclimatize. Besides helping you on the trek it’s a really interesting place to visit. - if you are reasonably fit you can do this easily, a lot of it is psychological - there are “go go” people and “slow slow” people on all tours - diverse- if you are fast be considerate of the slower members - while you are waiting enjoy the views. If you are slower, enjoy the trek and don’t worry about the fast packers - the guides want everyone to enjoy the trip and Machu Picchu will still be there when you arrive. - pack light - it’s hard to get more than the basics in your duffle bag. Weigh your stuff at your hotel before you get picked up by the tour company, remember your sleeping bag and mat form part of your personal gear and weight allowance and they take up a lot of the space. - in March the weather was damp a lot of the time so the idea of “wash one wear one” for clothes etc didn’t really work too well. Quick dry stuff didn’t. Probably much better in the dry season. - everyone says take Sol on the trip. Do but carry a pile of small change - 1’s 2’s and 5’s. you need this for toilets and for buying snacks on the trail. I had about 200 Sol but wished I had taken more coins. - at the last stop before Dead Woman’s Pass there is quite a selection of snacks and drinks available. It’s expensive but at that point you don’t care. 2 gatorades and 4 chocolate bars were 70 Sol. - there are some places where you can recharge your phone so taking the charger is something to consider. I didn’t but on airplane mode my phone lasts 4 days. I had a fully charged juice stick as well so no problems. - hiking poles were very useful. Don’t normally hike with them but the sheer number of up and down steps takes its toll on the knees, even for the fitter members. - try the coco tea- not really sure if it helps with altitude sickness but it doesn’t hurt. - toilets might be western or squat - get used to it. Toilets in the government sites tended to be squatters, rustic but functional. If you have done any backwoods camping or canoe trips you won’t have a problem. A little easier for the guys but it all depends on what you are used to. - yes- bring your own toilet paper. Few places on the trail provide it. - don’t litter - even fruit peels (I know they are biodegradable but they are still unsightly and take a fair time to completely break down)- the trail is remarkably clean but you still periodically see empty plastic bottles or cans and candy wrappers. No excuse whatsoever for this behaviour, tuck them in your pack or pocket till later. - get to know your guides, they have so much history and local culture to offer and really add to your trip. -tip well, a few extra bucks from us goes a long way for these people. Don’t be stingy - it’s just a part of the cost of the trip and you wouldn’t be there without those guides and porters. - remember that the journey is as much a part of the experience as the destination - enjoy it. Have a great trek!! Picture is an example of local entrepreneurship - reinforces how important tourism is to this part of the country."
"Great adventure, absolutely doable","This trek exceeded our expectations in many ways. First of all our porters and chefs, who carried a duffle bag(max 6kg) for each of us and all the tents, food and kitchen equipment(each porter no more than 20kg). 22 porters in all, every day they set up our camp and made us delicious breakfast, lunch and dinner. We felt so spoiled, but its how it is and its fantastic. The trek itself is tough at times, especially the second day where you climb 1115 meters from 3100m above sea lvl to 4215 masl(Dead woman's pass). You can and should take it very slow and drink a lot ans you'll manage. After the pass its 6 kms down to the campingsite. The trail goes through the majestic Andes with old ruins, inca terraces, jungle and splendid viewpoints. The last day we arrived at Macchu Picchu, where we got a guided tour and a couple of hours to explore ourselves. We booked the tour with G-adventures and we couldn't be more satisfied. Our guides Nick and Jaqueline were awesome, the porters were machines and the chefs made us great meals. Absolutely would recommend this trek!"
Great Company ,Used this company to book my trip to Machu Picchu and it was great. Travis was very helpful and helped provide an awesome experience. I would recommend them to anyone!
Amazing experience! Spectacular views!,"Went here with a group of 15 people via Peru Treks and Adventures - I highly recommend them. I cannot express how incredible it was to do the Inca Trail - along the trail, you will pass by at least 5 ruins and not only that, you will encounter llamas and alpacas.If you get altitude sickness easily, I highly recommend getting some altitude sickness pills. As well, make sure to bring small change (for snacks and using toilet), toilet paper, and your passport - this is how you're allowed in the trail as well as Machu PicchuAlong the way, there will be pit stops with squatters as well as regular toilets - this is where having your own toilet paper and small change come in handy as most places charge for using toilets. If not, you just have to do your business in natureDay 1 is training day - the hike is fairly easy and tolerableDay 2 - the toughest day of the hike as there are roughly 4h as ascend including steep stairs then straight back down. Be mentally preparred for this dayDays 3 & 4 - easy also. You'll get woken up early on the last day to make it to thr Sun Gate - unfortunately when I went, it was very cloudy so we didn't get to see Machu Picchu from here"
Climb then climb some more,"Just do the walk, stop whinging, carry lots of water, drink lots of water, apply sun screen all day and you must have insect repellant."
"Far better than Machu Picchu, the Inca trail is the real Peruvian experience!","First tip (especially for travelers from Aus): book your trek with Intrepid tours, they are amazing. The guides, cooks, and porters are excellent. Everything is carried out with maximum respect to the porters who have to carry all our luggage and equipment, but at the same time, all trekkers are taken care of as if they were in a (bush) hotel. We ate well, had great tents and extra toilet facilities that other hikers did not have.Second tip: Try to forget about the destination, the trail, the stunning views and ruins you come across on the 45km walk rival (and in many ways beat) what you eventually come to at Machu Picchu. So try not to get worn down by the hike, just enjoy where you are and also the people you're hiking with. We hiked day 2 in the rain and snow (!) and had a blast doing it! It was definitely hard and at times draining but that made it all the more fun to sit with the other hikers at the end of the day and talk about all that you'd accomplished. Our group had such a good time that getting to Machu Picchu was a bit anticlimactic. On the trail, most of the time, it's only yourself and your group. So getting to Machu Picchu can be a bit overwhelming with the 3000+ tourists swarming around the sight. Therefore, enjoy every moment of the hike because you will miss it when suddenly you see hordes of well fed, well washed tourists taking selfies."
"4 day hike, and memory of life time","Before you begin you need to decide between the one day excursion by train and bus from where ever you are staying or stay at the expensive mountain side hotel close bye the site. A better plan for those in reasonable physical condition is to sign on with one or other tour company that leads hiking the trail along the traditional path over which the ""Inka"" ( the ruler of the Empire) travelled from Cusco ""down"" to his winter residence in Machu Picchu. Make no mistake it would be ""down"" if it were not for the mountains that get in the way. There are of course many trails through the mountains that the pre columbian natives used. This walk is considered the ""traditional"" route  and is protected within a national park Although the choice of beginning at 2500M in the sacred valley where the park control is located, is some what arbitrary, but it makes the hike spectacularly beautiful if moderately challenging in places. It is a walk on a highway paved in irregular stone. First day is relatively easy and camp is struck close to an Inka site with gorgeous views and everyone is optimistic. Day two is a challenge as it reaches 4200 meters at Dead Woman's Pass. No individual woman is actually commemorated by this name  just that there is a rock formation reminiscent of a woman lying on her back. From there on the trail descends with shorter more easily managed ascents on the last two days.G Adventures were our guides, reasonably priced but excellent service they set up our tents and carried most of the gear while providing  lunch, afternoon ""tea"" and an evening meal in a dining tent produced by chefs in full uniform each day followed by breakfast the following morning. We would the take our light packs for the days walk and the porters broke camp after breakfast, packed up every thing and carried it to the next stop. The chefs provided the hot meals in a tent that was set for lunch and then again for tea , evening meal and breakfast a remarkable feat! and delicious. As far as we could tell this was the pattern for all the guided groups using other providers as well. It is of note that individuals will no longer be permitted to travel independently on the trail, presumably for safety, limitation of traffic and  preservation of sites. The price will inevitably rise, so book well in advance.There is always a discussion of physical conditioning necessary to achieve this moderately challenging walk. My wife and I did conditioning walks before we left for Peru. That did help but the second day of the Machu Picchu trek was probably the most challenging thing I have done in decades, but totally worth every moment."
THE Reason to visit Peru,"This trail is well maintained. Easy to follow.. As other people mention, there are hard parts and easier parts.Views are awe inspiring. There are several things along the trail that you only can see if you are on the trail.  Views, ruins, waterfalls... to name a few.. We even saw bears!Do this! You will not regret it! Don't delay!"
Once in a lifetime experience ,"The Inca trail was one of the most amazing things I have ever done. The trail is not a dirt path but rather completely stone and completely uneven stone steps built by the Incas.  The first day is the easiest to get you acquainted, mild elevation changes, nothing to challenging. The second day was the most grueling as you are essentially climbing up all day long, once you get to the top of dead woman’s pass it gets easier. The third day is the longest day, starts with an short climb and then the rest of the day is all going down steps (your knees will never be the same). The 4th day you wake up early to get to the sun gate and see the ruins. Make sure to use the hiking poles, have comfortable shoes (I used tennis shoes), and make sure to have lots of warm clothes at night as it gets very cold. We had all sorts of weather - sun, rain, and even snow!"
Bucket list - tick!!,"From landing in Lima and exploring the Catacombs, to meeting the multi-national group and then completing the 4 day Classic Inca Trail was amazing from start to finish!!We ended up as a group of 14, made up from the UK, Denmark, USA and Canada; the age range went from about 21 all the way up to 60+ and although the trek had its moments, everybody made it (slowly, but that's not the point)As a walker, and someone who has spent many a night under the stars, the whole set up was truly amazing. The porters are immense, the food amazing and the whole sleeping situation absolutely more than adequate.Top tips:Forget Dollars - local currency is the way to go.(Other than the final tip to the porters)Pack light - walk in a set of clothes and then when you change each evening, let them dry.Camera - the views are amazing, you need to capture them.Boots - not required, half decent approach shoes are more than adequate.Tents - if you're shy, pipe up and request a single tent.Connect - get to know your guides, ours were amazing and happy to chat away about the trail.Machu Picchu - its easy to become a walking snob, when you get to your goal there are hordes of tourists already there (bus up) ignore them and enjoy the moment.Train - Don't sleep off your journey, look up at where you've walked!!I'm going back!"
4 day Inca trail Machu Picchu,"Bad experiance wity bamba exoeriajce. Tents leaking I had no sleep while inca trail & they wake u up at 2:30am to sit 3mins away for 4hrs to then rush up steep & wet sloppy rock steep hill to get to sungate hut trying to barge pass others like competition, then you reachbit after arguing with people who got in your way, along the way & you don't see anything asvits all clouds & rain. Then we left MP to grab food & tent back in - I needed toilet & wasn't allowed back in as your only allowed  2 stamps only. Grr. Then we left at 11:30 am which was rubbishbas onky git shown few places inside MP. It was raining & cloudy all that time, so we was all soaked wet, tired & pissed off basicly.. as we left for town near by the sun canrbout & we was all gutted as wanted to go back to MP to get some photos & capture it as it is. No one got any pics as was in the clouds & couldn't go back as the stamp rule messed it up for us. The fact we left 11:30 messed out day up & not being told clearly this stamp rule access. What makes it as bad as it is / is that I paid £700 to do inca trail & everything from day one with porters wanting more money that described day before, was all just unprofessional. Never seen guide on yours as left us to it as he kept saying you can't get lost it's the inca trail.. anyways. All in all, very exspensive & misrable time when it should if bed. Exciting amazing & all my dream come true. I learned about history of incas but honestly you be better judtvosying £100 for the day pass to visit Machu Picchu in your own time & the train. Are lovely & posh. And it's an amazing place but I feel I need to visit it again as don't feel I've seen it... dispute doing inca trail. I'd go up by train next time.  Don't go with bamba experiane anyways. Inca train is great 👍🏼 just know rules & your times with trains & buses etc. Do it yourself without all these money grabbing your companies. I highly recommend a day trip over the inca trail. Have fun either way."
Bucket List Ticked Off,"I did the 4 day, 3 night classic Inca trail . I booked it as part of a longer trip to Peru & Ecuador with GAdventures.  The Inca Trail was everything I expected & more.  It was physically & mentally tough but the support I received from the amazing porters and CEO (Gerson) was fantastic, and, of course, the coca tea!! I have to admit I was very close to turning back on day 1 in the morning as I found the initial hill very hard and two people from another group had given up and were walking in the opposite direction back down to the start, it was a tough moment. However, I ploughed on, and dropped my pace and took regular breaks to catch my breath and was rewarded with stunning views and scenery, and making it to the Sun gate early morning on day 4 to see Machu Picchu appear from the clouds was a simply magical moment in my life. Although I was prepared for the infamous squat toilets, I was surprised to find there were some flush toilets along the route and locals selling drinks & sweets on the first 2 days too."
A once in a lifetime experience,"In October this year, we made our dream of Peru coming true, especially with the gains to do the Inca Trail which was, to be honest, the toughest one to find with whom to do it. After a lot of research, we found Erik who helped us with all our questions and a quite transparent and informative website called exploorperu. As I red that it's best to have an official guide and there was so much information on google with high prices or not even prices and incomplete information...I was happy to find those guys. On our arrival, Leo welcomed us kindly and we already started with our briefing of what we have to expect and how to be best prepared to make the time up there the best time possible. It was really informative and his English was perfect! I was already afraid that our guides won't speak proper English. The best start was actually to be with a local community where they did the briefing. Getting to know the local's habits and to be with them, until we left for the trail on the next morning. The entire trek was just incredible! Leo and the others were incredible, if it was their attention, the knowledge they shared as we passed by lots of ruins and historical places like Sayaqmarca or the delicious food - absolutely recommendable!The place of where we hiked, this nature and the treks with the views to the mountains was my favorite as this was so different from what I saw before in Europe. Impressive!Another mind breaking moment was our arrival at the Sun Gate, with a view over the mountain and the ruins. Leo also did an interesting tour through the ruins of the lost city, as Machu Picchu is the mountain, not the ruins. Cannot repeat how incredible this entire tour was.My tips: Bring a second pair of shoes in case you have problems or at least not use a pair you recently bought to avoid blisters that are fun-killers. Further, make sure you have great guides as I think those guys make the entire tour special, Leo, for example, did a perfect job, but I've read so much of bad experiences out there, a pity! An absolute must for everyone who has the time to make this tour, as 4 days are quite a lot to finally see more of Peru too. We had 12 days and it was sufficient!"
The best way to experience Machu Picchu,"We used Alpaca Expeditions to trek the Inca Trail and have posted a separate review for that fantastic tour operator. We chose to do the 4D/3N hike, understand there is a 1N and a 5N options, looking back I do not regret choosing this option. It was VERY challenging but it gave us the perfect mix of sight seeing: from mountains to ruins at a good pace... I think the shorter option does not allow for enough sightseeing while the longest -well, let's just say that I had enough of the public toilets and sleeping in a tent.If you don't consider to be in good shape either train your body or skip the hike... you will be miserable if you don't prepare properly. Definitely listen to your guides when they tell you what to bring, don't think they are exaggerating. We were lucky enough that we didn't get rained on, only a little drizzle on our fourth day, but doing this in the rain must make things 5x more difficult, be prepared with the right gear and clothing and be smart about what you bring as you don't want to carry too much weight. TIP: we spent a few days in Puno/Lake Titikaka (which has a higher elevation) before doing this hike and also took elevation meds PRIOR to the hike, I had a constant headache the 2nd and 3rd days but it could have been much worst."
You will never forget this amazing adventure!,"There is something magical and mysterious about Machu Picchu and the Inca Trail.  Huayna Picchu is the steep mountain you always see in the photos, but the mountain (from which the pictures are always taken) is longer, taller, and fantastic.  The hike takes at least two hours, and in many places you have to use your hands to climb. Bring water, wear layers, and use mosquito repellent. Once you reach the summit, the beauty is breathtaking.  We met interesting people along the hike and at the top.  We also enjoyed an amazing open-eyed meditation of appreciation to celebrate and remember every gift this bucket-list trip offers."
The only way to visit Machu Picchu,"This is not the best way -  it's the only way to visit Machu Picchu. I recommend the 1-day trail. There are many good tour guide companies, but I really liked the one I used: Inka Trail backpackers. They were very friendly and helpful."
"G adventures: Sacred Valley, Inca trail and  Machu Picchu",G adventures Inca trail was an amazing experience. Would definitely recommend the sacred valley tour and the Inca trail to Mach Pichu. Very well organised.
Pure bliss,"What an awe aspiring place. After visiting the pyramids in Egypt, his was yet another place that leaves you in a state of wonder."
Amazing experience!,"I did the 2 days Inka trail. Beautiful views and very emotional arrival to Machu Picchu!A must!The 4 days trail seems to be amazing if you have time to do it. You need to book in advance, you need a guide to come into the trail."
DO NOT UNDERSESTIMATE THIS CHALLENGE,"Don't underestimate the physical challenge of this undertaking.  The guiding companies will emphasise the qualities of their guides, and how much of the hard work is done by your porters.  If you're not used to hiking 10 - 12 miles per day at an elevation of 10,000 feet+, then this is definitely no walk in the park.  Especially if you go at the time of year when it is going to rain.  And it WILL rain, not maybe - it will.  How else could the jungle be this green!  And there is little to no shelter.  We were lucky enough to be able to spend our summer in Colorado, 'training' on the high peaks, which transformed our experience.  We were fit and acclimatized by the time we took on the Inca Trail and as a result, thoroughly enjoyed every moment.  The other 4 people in our group, really struggled (despite being a LOT younger than us) and as a result, it made for a 'miserable' experience for them at times and we witnessed this a lot on the trail.  You'll likely be paying good money for this experience, so our recommendation - 'make sure you're as ready as you possibly can be', so you can REALLY enjoy it.  The trail is busy, be prepared for that, but if you're a good hiker you'll soon escape the crowds and we enjoyed plenty of peace and solitude along the way.  The entire experience - especially the arrival at the Sun Gate entrance to Machu Pichu - is simply unique."
"Awesome, you know, AWESOME!","Nothing I could say round be anything you haven’t already heard. Such a marvel, history, beauty, all the above."
A Spiritual Experience,"The Inca Trail is physically challenging and is so visually and spiritually inspirational . Along the trail are multiple Inca archeological sites, several of which are breathtaking.  We learned about the Inca cosmology, and began to recognize its manifestation in their built works. We did the trek in mid September 2017, and were lucky with the weather. We acclimated for 3 days in Cusco, so we were ready for the highest altitude (which is encountered on the second day of the trek). At Dead Woman's Pass we were walking in the clouds, so visibility was low, but otherwise conditions were fine. At the higher altitudes temperatures at night were in the mid 30s (F). We wore extra layers in the sleeping bag if we needed them. Staying warm was not a problem. We rented air mattresses without which we may have been cold (and we would have been uncomfortable). We brought inflatable travel pillows, which were perfect. The trek experience and entering Machu Picchu through the Sun Gate, high above the citadel, made our visit especially profound. Our tour group was Peru For Less. They partner with Wayki Trek for the trek portion of the experience. Both services exceeded our expectations on every level. Key pieces of advice: book early (or you could be shut out of the trek). Spend an extra day acclimating if you can. Cusco is wonderful... give yourself time to explore on your own. Rent an air mattress and hiking poles. Wear a good set of light weight, waterproof boots. Wear wicking clothing that's easy to layer. Use a quality pack with proper hip loading belt to keep the weight off your shoulders. Get a 2 liter water bladder. Be prepared to bundle up when you get to Dead Woman's Pass, including gloves. Enjoy plenty of coca tea and make an offering to Pachamama! You'll love it."
Inca trail,"We spent 4 days walking this beautiful trail. The majority of our things were carried by porters. The guide made this trip informative. The best advise I can give is, you don't need to carry much. We wished we had only carried an extra jacket and our camera! The porters carry up to 7 pounds of your stuff and the food they feed you for breakfast lunch and dinner is enough to feed an army. I was never able to finish my meals the portions were huge. The first days stop had the skechiest bathrooms but after that they're still primitive but tolerable. Incredible views the whole way, This trail is not for the out of shape but if your in average shape you'll enjoy it."
Inca trail,"I would highly recommend this. I would offer a few tips to help. Make sure that you bring money. On the first day there are no free bathrooms so make sure that you take 1 Soles coins. After the first day of the bathrooms are free. You will also need money to tip the porters and the cooks. I think we paid about 100 or 150 Solis a apiece.       I read a lot about the fitness level required. Many sites say moderate fitness. You don't have to be a professional athlete but you do have to be in shape. I was running two to three miles a day and spending a lot of time going up and down stairs and StairMasters. I read that there are over 8000 stairs, so practicing is very important. The better shape you're in, the better you will be able to handle the trail.        Altitude can be an issue. Make sure you acclimatize in Cusco for three or four days. A doctor can also prescribe diamox for altitude sickness. Keep in mind that it's a diuretic so you will have to go to the bathroom more if you take it. That can be a problem on the trail or waking up at night in a cold tent.      There are so many people at Machu Picchu. Taking the trail got us there late in the day when there weren't very many people around. When we went back the next day, we had to wait a long time at 4 in the morning to catch a bus. It also took a long time to get out because slow people were moving down the stairs. There is also a huge line. Walking the trail gives you more time to see Machu Picchu and it's not flooded with crowds of people. There is an old Inca bridge that you can hike to also.     The second day is the hardest because you are going mostly uphill. I read a lot about the trail before I went and everyone said that dead woman's pass was the hardest and once you got past that it was easier. No one told me that after you get to the top of the pass, you go down for 2 hours and then it's hiking uphill again for two hours. I wasn't prepared mentally for that. You will spend a lot of time going downhill so I would recommend walking sticks to help support your knees.     I felt it was worth it to pay for a porter. It would have been extremely difficult to carry all that weight. Most everyone in our group had a porter.      I went with llama path and I highly recommend them. They are very knowledgeable and professional. They also take good care of you. There are dozens of sites that give you information about the trail. I just wanted to give you some of the tips that I learned on the trip. It is amazing and I recommend it highly. The last day when we rounded the corner and saw Machu Picchu was one of the most amazing things that I have ever seen."
Just amazing!,"Me and my friend can absolutely recommend this tour to everyone! We had four great and well planned days full of activities. We had an amazing guide, Neyser, with a lot of humour and good knowledge about the Inca people, the culture and history.If you ever consider going to Machu Picchu, not just for going there, but also to explore the mountains around with MTB, trekking, zip-lining and riverrafting, you HAVE to take this tour :-)"
Fantastic Trek Service along the Inca Trail,"we booked on the 4d/3n inca trail with Bioandean Expeditions  after doing a lot of research and reading the reviews. Wow! What an amazing company. Everything was absolutely perfect and we could not recommend them highly enough to anyone thinking about doing some trekking while in Peru. We met our guides for the trip, Edmar ""Apu and Rider at the Bioandean Expedition offices for our briefing the night before and they were absolutely brilliant. As well as taking care of everything during the trek, they were both very friendly, extremely funny and very knowledgeable about the Incas and their way of life. Edmard  is such an enthusiastic and fun loving person it is hard not to have a great time. His pipe playing definitely takes the edge off the hard climbs on the way! Bioandean have definitely thought of everything to make your trek special, including great equipment, fantastic camping spots and even private toilets (which none of the other companies offer). The underlying philosophy behind Bioandean Expeditions is to offer the best possible service while at the same time ensuring that the porters and support staff that provide that service are well looked after. You can see this in the equipment and clothing that the porters ""The Bio Warriers"" have compared to other companies and also by their general happiness throughout the trip. They are always smiling! It is genuinely unbelievable how they cover so much terrain in such a short amount of time carrying all of the camping equipment and luggage. Yet every day when you arrive at camp they are waiting for you with hot drinks, clean water and food. Oh my god, the food! Every single day the chef produced a dazzling array of delicious food. I cannot empathies enough how good the food is. Restaurant quality food cooked in camp and served in a private dining tent. Dinners and lunches were 3 course affairs with mains consisting of 4-5 different types of food. It has to be seen to be believed! All in all Bioandean Expeditions  far exceeded all of my expectations and if you can book a spot on one of their treks you will not be disappointed.Great work guys! Keep doing this job  you 100% deserved this review"
2D1N Inca Trail,"The so-called ""2 day 1 night"" inca trail is basically 1 day of hiking and living in Machu Pichu town (Aguas Calients) and coming back the next morning. We were only interested in the day hiking and it was a monopoly so we had to go with a tour. We had to wake up at 3:30am in Cusco to catch the 6:10am train from Ollantaytambo, then get off at KM104 to meet our guide there. The guide took care of entrance and distributed food (chocolate, fruit and water). We started at Chachabamba and at noon we were at Winaywayna, the campsite for the last day of 4 day trekking but also offers toilet and water for us. In the afternoon we made to Sungate at 2:30PM to get the first glimpse of Machu Picchu, then 1 hour downhill to reach MachuPicchu. Watch out now after the trail you've been drinking like crazy but there is no washroom in Machu Picchu! On the next day we got back to Machu Picchu on the earliest bus, and then after the visit we headed back to Cusco."
Nice hike but be prepared.,"We did the day hike on the trail leading to Machu Picchu and ending at the Sun Gate .  There is nice scenery for the adventurist hiker, but it is not for the faint of heart or if you do not like heights.  Our agent did not give a good explanation of what to expect.  It was 9.5 miles, and climbing the stairs at the terraced ruins of Winay Wayna was challenging. Bring plenty of water and hiking poles."
wonderful,great place to visit and explore not easy to get to but worth the trip if you have the time really makes you wonder what they were doing here
Inca Trail gAdventures,"We had the trip of a lifetime and were so pleased that we chose gAdventures.  After much research, I chose gAdventures because of their reputation and experience/history of treks on the Inca Trail.  They have a head office in Toronto and when I called into one of their reps to discuss the trip, they spent 40 minutes explaining details before I even booked with them.  They were also extremely helpful when Air Canada cancelled our direct flight to Lima three weeks before our trip started.  They worked hard to find alternate flights for us and to minimize the stress. Our group of 16 were fantastic travel companions – we met the night before hitting the trail and quickly became good friends.  Our group members came from Australia, Canada, USA, England and luckily everyone was very supportive and we had lots of laughs along the way.  Our guide Rumi was extremely passionate about Inca Culture and took great care to ensure we had an extremely positive trip.  We were accompanied by 23 Chasquis (porters) and two cooks. It truly is amazing how hard they work and how effortless they make it look.  I was so surprised by the quality of food and snacks and the dining tent that was set up made for a comfortable environment to share meals after a long day.  When our group arrived for lunch and in the late afternoon for camp we were greeted with cool drinks and individual washbasins to prepare for a meal. Lunch and dinner were 2-3 courses and always started with a hearty soup.  We had one vegetarian and one person that required gluten free food and they were fully accommodated.   On the third day, our chefs managed to freshly prepare a cake with icing.  Every morning the Chasquis wake you with steaming cocoa leaf tea and a warmed wash basin. We felt very well cared for.We rented an inflatable thin foam mat, sleeping bag and hiking poles – they were clean and no need for a sleeping bag liner.  The mat and bag are included in the baggage weight that the porters can carry and takes up approx. half of the 6 kg allowance; therefore it is imperative you pack lightly. They provide a smaller duffle bag for your stuff that the porters carry.   There is a scale in the lobby area at Hotel Prisma so definitely weigh your daypack and do not overload it as you will be lugging it with you each day. I noticed that our group wore pretty much the same clothes on the trek –no need nor is there room to bring multiple changes of clothing.  There is an opportunity to shower on the third day but it is freezing cold water so only one group member did it.  About half our group experienced altitude sickness to some extent – I definitely did and initially experienced headache, nausea and general malaise.  I was glad my physician prescribed Diamox to take. The only side effect was tingling in my fingers and toes and having to void more frequently.   Our guide had a finger pulse oximeter and my oxygen levels measured in the low 80’s – they had supplemental oxygen tanks with them and thankfully I did not have to use it.   The trail itself is very challenging especially when you factor the possibility of altitude sickness. If you hike and are reasonably fit and take your time, you should not have any problem.  The second day is definitely the hardest with 4-5 hours of unrelenting uphill climbing at a high altitude - it is quite hard to catch your breath. This is followed by downhill for about 2 hours which interestingly can be just as hard as uphill – tough on the knees and ankles so adjust our hiking poles accordingly.  I was in awe of the archaeological sites and ruins along the path – always something to see and the vistas are breath taking.  It is funny to see llamas walking on the path as well. Despite it being dry season we experienced rain for 3 out of 4 days – so that made it challenging to be constantly pulling on and off a rain poncho.  Fortunately for the last day, the sun came out and we were able to see the sun rise over the Sungate and had a picture perfect day for Machu Pichu.  Definitely use bug spray at Machu Pichu.  I did not feel the bugs biting my ankles and had welts that took weeks to heal.   You can stamp your passport at Machu Pichu with a neat MP stamp – there was a short line to do this.  The lines for the washrooms (female) were crazy – you line up to pay and then wait to use the facilities.  The bathroom are clean and have a toilet seat which is a welcome site after using the squat toilets on the trail.  Take a bottle of water/drink into MP with you because you will have to exit if you want to purchase them or to use the washroom.  After touring this incredible wonder of the world, we took the bus and met at a restaurant in Aqua Caliendes for a final meal together.  There are places in the town where you can pay to shower and one of our group members did that but she didn’t have clean clothes to put on.  If I could be guaranteed good weather (no rain), I would definitely do this trip again – it just was such a phenomenal experience.  I would highly recommend gAdventures as they will give you a safe, authentic experience with like-minded travelers.  Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to message me."
Not for wimps,"We hiked the one day trail from Km 104. This trail is no joke. The first three or so hours is all uphill. The trail is very uneven and requires serious concentration. Our guide told us there are around 3000 steps. While uphill was strenuous, downhill was just as challenging, especially if you are not a fan of heights like me. The altitude is also a factor. All of that said, this was one of my greatest accomplishments. There is no better way to see Machu Picchu!!"
Amazing Once in a Lifetime Experience,"Machu Picchu, Inca Trail Hike 4days/3nights. this tour is great. It's a once in a lifetime experience but it's not for the fainted heart. The hike is extremely challenging, Not only physically but the altitude plays a big role. I almost gave up because our group was quite fast and my friend and I had never hiked for so long. At the end, we made it! and feel very accomplished. Tips:- Train at least 2 weeks before going - Extremely important to bring, not matter what people say* medicine for altitude sickness as every one is different and you never know how it will affect your body* enough toilet paper, even if you think you don't need that much* poncho, even if it's dry season* warm clothes, it gets cold at night* Get poles, you will need them. Especially going down.* and all the essentials: jacket, good hiking boots, long pants (if weatherproof better), hat, scarf, etc. - Have a plan for when you arrive to Aguas Calientes, as your train doesn't leave until late afternoon."
Loved it all except toilets !,"My wife and I joined a party of 6 in total on the 4 day hike. It exceeded our expectations whilst the loo situation is exactly as you expect it (grim). The hike itself actually we all thought was not too bad, sure day 2 you climb high but if you've done some prep, it's not that bad, unless you have altitude sickness. Views are amazing and it's a constant photo opportunity. Camping was fun, food was great considering you are in the middle of nowhere. Chef was accommodating  to dietary requirements. If you are thinking about doing this, stop and book it, you will love every minute of it. But, please book with a reputable company to ensure the porters are treated fair. We saw one porter with another company and he was on the verge of collapse, it was upsetting and we fed and watered him. We used condor travel who seemed to have the best spots at every campsite, had a happy team and have a really good reputation."
Incredible experience.,"We did the four day 3 night Inca Trail trek with Bamba Travel. The walk its self is amazing, something I would recommend to any one. The views during the walk are spectacular, in some case I would say better than the views at Machu Pichu. I would say it’s important to take plenty of snacks for the walk, and potentially even pay extra for a porter if you can afford it. Also, walking poles will save your knees on the walk down of day two."
Great spiritual challenging journey ,First off I recommend getting walking poles and rain jacket in case it rains. Even if it is the dry season as it rained a few times. Also get good shoes with grip as can slippery. The inca trail was hard! My partner found it hard but it was such an achievement at the end. Machu Picchu is so amazing however there are sooo many people. I wish Machu Picchu opened first for people who do the trek first as it I personally think we deserve to be there first! Take your time when walking and enjoy the scenery. Take breaks. The porters are amazing at what they do and watching the porters run down the trek is incredible. Did Inca trail through Interpid.  Would recomment doing it through Intrepid. Food was amazing. Bring toilet paper and be prepared for a challenge of a life time.
Hike was amazing but certainly not a piece of cake,"I did the Inca Trail 4 day/3 night hike from km 82 milepost to Machu Picchu with other members of my family. Three of us in our 60s and one in her 50s, plus a teenager and a 23 year old. It was an amazing experience to do the hike and have the opportunity to see more than just Machu Picchu and learn more about the Inca history as well. We used the services of SAS Travel which was excellent. The hike is not for everyone. Make sure of your conditioning and ability to finish what you start if you want to do this hike. There's no turning back after you start up Dead Woman Pass, and it's quite a ways to the finish line."
Ancient Incas,"OMG, this is so not me, but I did it. I can remember I would not telephone my mum before I went because I thought I would cry, I was generally very scared. Once I started, just passing the point that marks the beginning of the trail, I was lifted. Our group had the most amazing guide and he was so knowledgeable. The flora and fauna is fantastic, I actually now did this a little while ago but it is so clear in my mind. I can still see the humming birds hovering in front of me. You will camp at 3 different places and if toilets are an issue (as they are for me) be prepared to use bushes and be a bit bunged up!!! It's worth it for what you will see. If you can do this, make the most of it. The history is just mind blowing and if you are lucky enough to see the fantastic sunrise at the sun gate on the last day as I was, you will probably find yourself saying you want to do it again! I went with a company called Tucan Travel and would absolutely recommend them to anyone. A bit of a no thrills company but provided us with such an adventure. There were a variety of people on our tour, ranging from individual, groups friends, couples and families."
"Inca Trail from KM104 (1-day hike): It's a Pilgrimage, Not a Hike","After reading conflicting and vague information I decided to make the 1-day Inca Trail hike from KM104. Our group of four adults ranged from 56 to 71 years of age and we all lived in lower altitudes and were in good health.  We had a range of beginner to experienced hikers.   Two members of our party were former military pilots who had received survival training and were the intermediate to experienced hikers.  If you subscribe to the definition of a pilgrimage being ""a long journey to a sacred place"" then the Inca Trail from KM104 is for you!  The books we read prior to the trip said the distance from KM104 to Manchu Picchu was 5.6 miles – we tracked our journey on two devices at 7.19 miles, climbed from 6000' to 9240', and required 33,000 steps.  It took 8 hours and 45 minutes.  Two marathon runners who train at altitude made the same trek the next day in 4 hours and 30 minutes but ran the first half of their hike.  The trail maps make it look like gradual up and then down which we learned are simply a straight line from one elevation to the next and NOT an indication of the trail.  There were many ups and downs in between.  The elevation changes are made through a series of uneven, stone steps that are irregular in size and shape with some stair step depths being extremely narrow (3-4"") and many of the steps being 16-20"" high. Walking poles are a must and while others in our party only used one pole I used two and found them to be extremely helpful as it allowed me to position some of the weight into my shoulders and arms when moving up and down large steps.  The trail averages 30-48"" wide and is consistently uneven.  You must pay attention so that you don’t trip or fall.  There are a couple of challenges with the trek: Unknowns, altitude, bathrooms, and heights. You have to pack for the unknowns such as weather.  While I was prepared for rain and chilly temperatures our hike was in full sun and 80 degree temperatures (which our guide said was extremely hot).  We could not have known the weather in advance - you have to go prepared for the unknown.  Unless you've been training at altitude get ready to have to stop frequently to catch your breath.  While our guide carried oxygen for emergencies we were never offered it and frankly never reached a point where we HAD to have it. The trail is cut into the side of mountain and there is NO place to pull off and privately use the bathroom.  The only bathroom is located at the Trekker's Hotel (approximately 4-5 hours into our hike) and it is a private hole in the ground.  I packed a Freshette but there was no place to use it on the trail and I did not practice with it before leaving home which was a mistake that I learned at the Trekker's Hotel!  As ridiculous as it sounds I would recommend wearing Depends (adult diapers) so that you can go when you need to and then change your ""diaper"" at the Trekker's Hotel (placing your soiled diaper in a Zip Lock bag to bring down).  Yes, the trail is built into the side of mountains so if you are afraid of heights I would not recommend this trek.  Most of the time there is sufficient vegetation to block your view of the height but there are exposed places along the trail where you are aware of the height and the dangerous edge that you are walking along.  Llama's have the right of way!  Yes, there are wild Llamas on the trek and you must allow them to pass you.  The typical llama that we passed required approximately 18-24"" of the path (and they can kick if upset) and so creating enough space for them to pass is no small feat.  Key success factors: Weather, your guide, equipment, physical training prior to the trip, rest when you can, stay hydrated, and eat.  If it is raining DO NOT make the trek as the rocks are slippery even when dry.  Your guide is critical to the hike's success. Guides are required to have a certification that includes emergency and survival skills.  In addition, they are required to carry emergency supplies.  Our guide's pack weighed 30 pounds. Proper, well broken in equipment is critical.  I debated about hiking boots or shoes and ended up wearing hiking shoes with my usual orthotic insert and they worked extremely well.  I even did my pre-trip training in the hiking shoes.  If you have weak ankles you should wear hiking boots and braces for weak knees (the hiking down takes a toll on the knees).  I would also strongly encourage you to get a backpack that sits on the hips and does not hang from your shoulders.  In addition to two poles, I would also recommend placing a flashlight in your backpack in case you get stuck on the mountain past dark (due to an emergency). Physical training/conditioning is necessary – I did 30-minutes of interval cardio five days a week and worked with a trainer on strength training two hours/week for six months prior to departure – this was essential!  I could have trained more but physically I had what was needed for the trek and had no soreness the morning after the hike.  There are 5 to 6 places designed for you to sit down and rest - take advantage of those.  Be sure to take your backpack off at every opportunity and really rest, hydrate, and eat a small snack.  Our guide recommended that we bring 1 liter of water but we carried an additional 2 liters per person (there is NO purified water along the trail) and we found that 3-4 liters (adding sugar free electrolytes) was the right amount of water per person.  If you don't want to carry that much water in your backpack consider taking a water filtration kit (there is a waterfall about 2/5s of the way into the hike).  Due to the inability to use the bathroom along the trail the tendency was to get de-hydrated.  And, unlike daily life in which you may push yourself to keep going even if you are hungry you CAN NOT do that on this trek.  Every time you have a break you MUST eat a small snack (banana or energy bar) because it helps your legs to remain steady.  The night before the hike I would recommend no drinking of any alcohol nor having any coffee the morning of the hike as they are de-hydrating.  It's also important to eat a protein dense breakfast the day of the hike with some carbohydrates.  What if an emergency occurs?  There is no helicopter rescue.  If someone has an emergency and needs to come down off of the mountain they have to be carried out on a stretcher.  This requires that the rescue team hike up to where you are and then carry you back down on a stretcher.  This will require hours and possibly result in you being on the mountain after sunset.  Other issues that make this trip unique: The altitude can rob you of your trip and the logistics are not easy.  I would NOT fly into Lima and head to Manchu Picchu in the first day or two.  Instead, give yourself time to acclimate in Cuzco and/or the Sacred Valley for several days prior to hiking.  I also got a prescription for altitude sickness and took it as insurance so that I would not have any down time on a once in a lifetime trip.  Regarding the logistics: in order to visit Manchu Picchu you have to go to Ollantaytambo (a small hikers village with lots of hostels) and catch a train to Pueblo Manchu Picchu where you catch a bus to take a 30-minute ride up switch-back roads to the ticketing entrance to Manchu Picchu.  Tickets for the train and the bus (both directions) have to be purchased in advance. The line to catch the bus to come back to Pueblo Manchu Picchu from Manchu Picchu average one-hour in length but get shorter as the day gets later.  However, they do stop running around 5 or 6PM which is why I would recommend starting the KM104 trek as early as possible so that you don't miss the last bus down nor have to rush to make the last bus and thereby increase the risk of falling or spraining an ankle.  If you miss the last bus you have a 1-hour hike down into Pueblo Manchu Picchu and after 7 miles of hiking you simply don't want to have to do this!  We did the KM104 hike on our way into Pueblo Manchu Picchu which created a meaningful logical issue: what to do with our remaining luggage?  Fortunately, one of our party chose not to make the hike and remained with our luggage on the train which we paid additional money to be able to do.  But the promised porters to help her once she arrived into Pueblo Manchu Picchu did not materialize and our luggage could have remained on the train to who knows where if she had not been there to get it unloaded.  For this reason, I would recommend traveling with your luggage into Pueblo Manchu Picchu (unless you have a personal escort who you trust with your luggage) and settling into your hotel on the first day and do the KM104 Inca Trail hike on day two.  Also, all five people in our party only packed European carryon luggage size bags. The space on the train is limited and you have to reserve your space by your luggage dimensions.  Bottom line, find a tour operator who is an EXPERT on Manchu Picchu and use them to book everything.  Here’s what I wore for the one day hike (which was in full sun and a temperature of 80 degrees):  Wicking under shirt (which I removed at the Trekker's Hotel); cotton tunic shirt; black jeans; hiking shoes with good socks; baseball cap; and sunglasses.  I also used two walking sticks. In my backpack: A windbreaker; cashmere sweater; plastic rain poncho with a hood; gloves; Chapstick; i-phone; mosquito spray; sunscreen; energy food; 3 liters of water; hand wipes/sanitizer; toilet paper; and two zip lock bags for trash.  We had a serious photographer on our hike who later said, ""DO NOT pack a large camera for the hike"" and suggested that photographers use a small camera or phone to take photos due to the added weight. Am I glad that I made the KM104 pilgrimage?  YES!  The experience of coming through the Sungate and looking down onto Manchu Picchu was glorious. We toured Manchu Picchu the next day with several thousand tourists and it made me even more grateful that we had authentically experienced the Inca Trail with a few other hikers who became friends along the way."
A fun spontaneous experience ,"My cousins and I decided to get adventurous and made our way back to our hotel from Machu Picchu via the Inca Trail instead of taking the bus. since we were going down, the trail was quiet easy and it took us an hour and a half to get to our hotel. The views were okay. I guess after seeing Machu Picchu ruins and mountains in all it's glory, the trail view simply cannot compare. Still, it was fun! An experience to remember :)"
One of the Best Adventures Ever,"This was such a wonderful experience. A 4-day hike with great people, learning about the Inca culture on the way, and enjoying the trail. Can get a bit difficult at times, but well worth it. The trip was crowned by an early morning arrival to Machu Picchu - the views were majestic. We booked in advance (6+ months) with Peru Treks. The people were wonderful. Food was heavenly. The organization was superb.I definitely recommend doing the trail to everyone who likes a good hike.A magical experience :)"
Inca Trail,"Awesome experience but a tough hike. The four day trek takes you to about 12,000 foot elevation, not for the faint of heart."
Worth every step.,"I had worried that I was over ambitious being in my mid fifties, so made big effort for the six months prior to improve my fitness. Can't recommend this highly enough. We were in a group of 9 and we regularly were in the lead group of 4.  One in our party struggled and came on hours after us each day with our assistant guide having to stick with her. No matter what the guides, cook and porters make aure you have the most amazing and unforgettable 4 days. Definitely the best way to approach Machu Picchu!"
"Hard work, but the only way to visit Machu Picchu","If you can afford the time, then the 4 day classic Inca Trail is a must do to make the experience of visiting Machu Picchu worthwhile. We are a family of 4, two middle agers of 49 and kids aged 21 and 17, and completed the Inca Trail with Condor Travel,  booked via Llama Travel in the UK. Our guide, Hector, was brilliant, and the whole experience would not have been possible without the care and attention of the porters and cooks (our daughter is a vegan and she was fully catered for). We did the trail as part of a group of 9, supported by 15 porters in total. It is hard work and you do need to be reasonably fit, have acclimatised to the altitude (we had 4 days in the Cusco area before we started), and have a determination to complete the trail. We were not going to use walking poles, but hired some from Condor at the last moment and were grateful we did as we found them to be essential. Be prepared to rough it in the campsites (well in the loo tent anyway), but the views, camaraderie and whole experience is something we will never forget."
I loved it!,"If you are here reading these reviews in the hopes of being convinced whether or not you should (or can!) do the 4-day trek to Machu Picchu, please take my advice and BOOK IT ALREADY!For months (literally), I scoured the internet for every shred of information I could find regarding this trek – even after taking the plunge & making the reservation.  I read all the reviews/blogs which touted the trek as a fun, amazing, life-changing experience. I also read the ones that left my palms sweating & me doubting my ability to live out this goal (you know the ones…those accounts of how extremely hard it was, an experience one would never wish to repeat, and the tales of severe altitude sickness, food poisoning, etc.).But I am delighted to tell you that not only did I survive, but it was not nearly as difficult as I had anticipated it to be (perhaps reading all those gory accounts did serve a purpose after all?).  In fact, it truly WAS one of the most incredible, soul-filling, breath-taking (at times quite literally), wondrous experiences of my life.  I loved every.single.minute of it! Each day was more beautiful than the one before.  Sure, there were times when I was tired, it was hard, my knees hurt, I wished for a proper toilet (some of them were pretty nasty!)…but the journey was worth it all.  I think pretty much anyone with some level of fitness & a whole lot of determination could make this journey.  We personally didn’t do specific training for this trek but we do enjoy weekend family hikes & lead relatively active lifestyles generally.  I won’t go into too much detail about what to expect each day, but I will give these overall tips;•Allow yourself proper time to acclimatize.  We spent a week between the Sacred Valley & Cusco prior to the trek.  There are many beautiful places to visit…this time will not be wasted.•The entire trek is manageable if you TAKE YOUR TIME.  Seriously, go at your own pace, stop to take lots of photos, enjoy where you are...in the ANDES on the INCA TRAIL!  You won’t get these days back, so just take your time & soak it all up.•There are plenty of rest stops along the way.  We went with Peru Treks & our guide was great at building in group stops, which definitely helped.•Bring hiking poles (I brought my own from home & my husband rented a set in Cusco for 20 soles).  We both found them useful.•Drink lots of water.  It helps with the altitude.  We each drank about 3L/day. We also used our water bladders/hoses which was more convenient than having to stop and take out a bottle every time you want a drink.  Also bring a few snacks for each day…they are expensive to buy at the few places where they’re available on the trail.•If you have never trekked with a huge backpack before, this is not the place to try it.  Half of our group of 16 hired porters.  50% of those who opted to carry all of their own stuff definitely looked like they wish they had spent the extra for the porter.  Why make the journey more difficult than it has to be…carrying enough water & other necessities for the day are heavy enough!•Don’t forget to pack sunscreen, headlamp, basic 1st Aid Kit (I didn’t & needed one…props to my better prepared fellow trekkers), toilet paper (2 rolls each…better to pack more than you may need), baby wipes (essential!) & your sense of adventure. The only real negative part I have to say is in regards to the people who go potty along the trail (unavoidable at times, I realize).  On the morning of Day 3 you traverse a beautiful mountain pass with some great look-offs & photo opportunities…complete with ground that is littered with piles of toilet paper/wipes (also tread carefully for what lays beneath the piles). So gross & kind of surprising that people would disrespect the environment in this way (those wipes that feel nice on your toosh do not decompose!).I would suggest that people bring along those little poop bags you buy for picking up after your dog (I did) & take their soiled toilet paper and wipes with them.  You are given the opportunity each day at camp to dispose of your garbage.  Some of us (most of us?) don’t wish to see it.If I were to do it again (oh how I wish!), here’s what I would do differently;•Wear the go-pro the entire time…we got some incredible footage, but I wish we had captured all of it just so I could relive it again & again.•Not been in such a rush on the final morning.  The pace was insane & for what?  Yeah, it was lovely to watch Machu Picchu light up from our (crowded) spot at the Sun Gate, but I personally would have preferred to have spent this time enjoying those last couple of beautiful hours on the trail before being confronted with the throngs of people at Machu Picchu.  That was kind of a bummer. I could go on & on about this trek, but I’ll stop here.  I do hope you get to experience this journey for yourself.  If you have any questions, hit me up…I know I was appreciative to all my fellow TA reviewers who answered mine when deciding whether or not to book this trip."
we all walked the inca trail,"there are two roads that one must take in order to enter the citadel, one takes you to the other one that can start in the city of cuzco itself.  Regardless, both merge in the entrance of the citadel, so everyone in fact has walked the inca trail."
The true classic Inca experience,"I did the Inca trail with Llama Path, one of the bigger tour companies based in Cusco. You will need to pre purchase your permits for this trail since this is the most in demand and generally permits are all sold out four to five months in advance. Generally, it is recommended that you engage with one of the big agencies to take care of the permits and to book the tour with them. Then the headaches of all the logistics and official permissions are all taken care of including the entrance to Machu Picchu.Remember there are only about 200 tourist permits per day on the classic inca trail. Although you can go to MP via train, it is highly recommended you do at least one of the trails to MP since it gives you the complete Incan experience. The classic Inca Trail is the most convenient as its short and avoids supremely high altitudes unlike the Salkantay and Ausangate and its just 3 nights. Having said that this trail reaches an altitude of 4200m where the air can get pretty thin, so make sure you are well acclimatised in Cusco before you set out on this trail. Coca candy can also come in handy in helping with the altitude sickness. There are some sections which are steep both up and down. So a pair of walking sticks will also go a long way in making this journey enjoyable. The views on offer on this trail are simply breathtaking. An added plus was that this was part of the original inca trail and therefore are dotted with Incan ruins which are literally hidden gems and devoid of all tourists except the ones on the trail. You will have to go on this trail with a guide as mandated by the Peruvian government. Make sure you ask questions about these sites and they will be glad to indulge. Toilets may be a problem as there are none except on the camping sites and it is highly recommended that you don't do big business while on the trail. But having said that the campsite bathrooms aren't the best in terms of hygiene. And be prepared to squat. Wet tissues help quite a bit and a headlamp is very essential. Although you will not be hiking on the trail at night but you may need to roam around the campsite in the dark. And remember, the porters always have the right of way. Make sure to choose an agency who are responsible towards the porters. Llama Path is one of them and is a very reliable company. It is highly recommended you opt in for a porter as it is very difficult to carry any additional weight than necessary in the high altitudes. Plan early, book early and make sure you prepare well. This is a must do to complete the whole Machu Picchu experience."
Amazing experience,We would like to go back. The train ride was amazing as well and you can see the beauty of nature worth it
4 day trek with G adventures,"4 day trek with three nights camping.  Prior to the trek was a little visit to the womens' COOP which was high up, cold but interesting looking at how textiles are made and what traditional living looks like.  Following that we went to the sacred valley for a tour and some photos.  That's where you get the sense that you are in for some beautiful scenery. The first hotel you stay at you can get wifi and eat/drink at some nice little restaurants in Ollaytatambo.  You will also see some impressive ruins there.By this time you should know whether you are prone to altitude sickness and should be ready for the hike.  G adventures are pretty good looking at some of the other groups/companies knocking about.  They certainly have a great porter service which is worth a lot whilst trekking.  The trek itself is doable but very challenging even if you are fit.  If you can limit yourself to your own pace with discipline then there should be no problem but pack well.The toilets.  Be prepared for the toilets.  Imagine the toilets from the film trainspotting and then times that by 10.  Now you can see and possible smell the campsite toilets. I couldn't cope so I took the toilet roll I used and disappeared up the mountain for peaceful, civilized relief. So did many others.  You also have access to a shower but I would place them in the same category.  I had one on the trek and survived with wet wipes.  Everyone says it is horrific because it actually is.  Something else to consider is paying a little extra for your own tent.  If your roommate has a cold and/or snores like a sleeping lion lent against a microphone, paracetamol and ear plugs will not save you.  This will exhaust you during the walking.The scenery is beautiful especially on day three when you hit the beginning of the amazon.  Very beautiful and tranquil.Beware of dead woman's pass.  I saw a lot of dead looking men and women on the way up.  Very hard-take regular breaks and be very careful coming down.  Very steep and uneven steps.Once you reach the Machu Picchu you will have a tour before beginning your journey back to Ollaytatambo by bus then train then bus.The money, the time, the travel, the lack of familiarity, no hot showers, awful toilets. Is it worth it? Absolutely.  Great place, great people. Unforgettable.  Cusquena the local beer helps and is actually sold on day 2 on the way up to dead woman's pass."
4 days hike to Macchu Pichu with 'La Bamba' and tour guide Francisco,"This tour was unforgettable, if you have the time do to it and you are moderately fit it is a must do!The tour operator is 'La Bamba', and they organise a good tour briefing the day before the departure, so you can meet your guide and your tour companion.The scenery and flora changes dramatically each day of the tour and it is always breathtaking.The first day is basically flat and quite hot, and you already get to see some amazing Inca buildings.The second day is the hardest, but it is totally doable as there is plenty of time to get to the campsite, so everyone went at it is own pace, regrouping at defined resting spot, and then kept going.The third day you move from high nearly bare mountains to a flourishing jungle full of flowers and hummingbirds, stopping on the way to visit more  Inca buildings.The fourth day is very rewarding as you eventually get to see Machu Picchu, and you have learnt so much on the way there that you can appreciate it much more that going there just taking the bus.Our guide, Francisco was amazing, he really make the difference, he knows all about he flora, fauna, history and custom of Peru and Inca. He answers all our questions and he was so passionate about Inca history, thanks to him we learnt so much.He was also very good organising the time of rest/meal during the hike, he was constantly making sure that everyone was well, not pushing to hard (which is were altitude sickness gets you) and having a good time.The train trip on the way back is also amazing, you will love it!Few notes:- The food was amazing during all the trip, they cater for vegetarian as well- You get hot water for freshing up in the morning and before meals- You only need to bring water for the first two days, after that they will boil water and give it to you (it may be seasonally)- It gets cold, bring warm clothes- Walking sticks helps a lot, especially going down the steep staircases- If you booked one of the extra hike from Machu Picchu make sure to request an entry window after 10am. They will give an hour entry window outside which you cannot start the hike. if your group is a bit slow or if the guide to Machu Picchu last longer than expected you may miss the window, but  10-11am window should be fine.- Tips, this can be difficult if you come from a country that doesn't do tips, all our group fell in this category and it got a bit awkward because they do make a big deal about tips, despite being not mandatory. What it will happen is that the last night of the trip there will be a tips ceremony, you will have to prepare two separate tips amounts, one for the cook and one for the porters. Then all the porters and cook are gathering around you and wait to receive the tips. In case of the porters you even have to state how the amount need to be divided about them because the boss porter may want to keep more for him. We clearly tip them less than expected because they were not happy.Suggestion:Walking Stick do help, especially for going down the step stairs."
Fantastic trek,"This was a dream trip, a bucket list item. I loved it! A very challenging trek and altitude to add to the fun! Our guide was safety conscious and mindful of our time to get to campsites each night so we felt in good hands. Our cook was fantastic as well as our porters. They earn their money! We had great weather, the views were fantastic, it was interesting traveling through villages the first day, struggling up above the tree line to Dead Woman's Pass the second day, down to a cloud forest on the third day, and literally walking thorough the clouds in the dark on the morning of the fourth day. A truly unforgettable trek!"
Very challenging,"The inca trail is no joke.  You need to be aclimatized before you go and be in reasonable shape.  Dead Woman's pass is at 4200m, so you will struggle if not aclimatized.  It is tough, very tough, but the scenery is absolutely beautiful and there are many incredible ruins along the way.  Be prepared for long days and a lot of stairs.  The 3rd day is about 3000 stairs down.  Difficult but worth it!!"
Exodus team are truly amazing!!,"Recently did the 9 day Inca Trail tour. Guide was lovely, informative, knowledgeable, efficient and extremely competent. Several people had health or other issues before or early on in the trek, and the tour guide, Will, took care of everything with great competence and care. Then I got really sick having completed the hardest part of the trek, and stuck high on the mountain with no help available, and Will arranged for me to carried down the mountain, met by another guide, and taken to a great doctor as soon as possible. I can't actually speak highly enough of how amazing the whole team was - they came up with efficient solutions to difficult issues and situations, they were unfailingly kind and attentive, and even paid for my lovely hotel room (which was extra and hence should have been my cost!). I really just can't say enough about how fantastic and professional and kind they all were. This is my second (of many) Exodus tours - will never do this sort of stuff with anyone else!"
Great outfitter for the Inca Trail.,"The porters were very good and very positive. The food was excellent, in and of itself, not just as trail food. Our guide was very knowledgeable and people were allowed to hike at their own pace. The sleeping bags we rented were mostly warm enough and the tents were adequate. f I were to do it again, I would bring my own pad that was larger and more comfortable."
The highlight of the trail is seeing Machu Picchu from above,"We did the 2-day trail and it was nice. But to be honest, Machu Picchu was the realy the highlight of the trip, Of course Winawayna was impressive as was the temple of the sun, but Machu Picchu itself was what took our breath away. You don't need to walk the Inca Trail to experience it's magic. Besides it's quiet expensive these days as you need to arrange for permits (200 tourists and 300 guides and porters are allowed on the trail per day), pay for guides and porters which will take about $500-700 p.p.for 2 resp 4 days trail"
One day trek a little disappointing,"I'd been wanting to hike the trail for several decades, while access was unlimited, guides not required, and camping wherever one felt appropriate.  Well those days have passed.  Limitations and restrictions now apply and I don't have as much time and patience for ""roughing"" it that I used to have.  So I opted for the one day trek.  There was a fairly steep 1.2 mile, 2000 ft climb from the river to the intersection near Winay Wayna, which we then explored.  After a checkpoint we began our hike to MP.  The hike was fun, fairly level with only a few elevation changes through the cloud forest.  Very nice.  Problem was that the view didn't really change.  We didn't hike far enough for the landscape to alter significantly so after about a mile, the hike became rather routine.  This kept up all the way to the Sun Gate at which time things turned around. I'm not sure it was a let down after years of anticipation, but ultimately I wouldn't opt for this again.  I'd either do the 4 day hike or just hike up to the Sun Gate from MP and go a little farther.  Ultimately, the experience would have been similar and I could have saved some time and a little money to do other things in the park."
Bloody hard work but worth it ,We had a great trip up the trail from Machu Picchu to the Sun gate in the early morning. Exhausting but just stunning views from a different angle. Well worth the trip.
Two Day Hike on Inca Trail,"We started our journey by being dropped of quickly from the train at km 104.  We crossed the bridge and hiked over to the check point.  Our guide had the necessary paper work, but we needed to show our passport and the passport number had to match the number on the paperwork.     Once we made it through the check point, we used the bathroom, which was a pit toilet.  There are no other bathroom facilities until you reached the lunch stop, which is a four to five hour hike.    The beginning of the hike was out in the open with no trees.  It was quite hot with the sun beating on you.  There are little rest huts placed along the trail about an hour apart.  They have benches in them and a roof to offer protection from the sun.  It is a great place to rest and have a protein bar and some water.     When we reached the waterfall, we placed our hands in the water and cooled off, it felt wonderful.  After this, there was more shade and the walk was more pleasant.    We stopped for lunch, which we carried in our back pack.  After we finished eating, we continued on our hike for another 3 hours.  We finally made it to the Sun Gate and stopped and posed for many pictures.     Make sure to carry at minimum two bottles of water and a granola bar.  I wore Merrell shoes and my husband wore Merrel hiking boots.  Good boots or shoes are important, but a descent pair of tennis shoes would have been OK.  Sun screen is important too.  We put bug spray on at the first check point.     Parts of the trail are very steep.  If you decide to do this hike, get into shape.  It is a solid 8 hours of walking upwards.  Try to carry as little as possible.  Your backpack gets very heavy.  I wore zip off pants and unzipped them at the first check point."
4D/3N Inca Trail,Hard and mystic experience to reach Machu Picchu.Unforgettable. Unavoidable if you really want to feel in your own skin the authentic experience of the inca culture.
Happy Trails...,"I actually didn't Google the Inca Trail to death before I went. I normally do tons of 'research' but left this to be more of a mystery. I did verify, beforehand, that snakes are rare on the trail.We went with Alpaca Expeditions and did the 4 day/3 night tour. Alpaca was great. Well organized and took care of us. The tour cost ~$715 including equipment and transportation to and from Cusco.The level of effort exerted on the trail was moderate to what I would consider challenging on day 2. I don't recommend this hike if you are not accustom to some level of physical activity. This shouldn't be a couch to 45 km activity. If you do decide to go, I suggest some cardio training beforehand. The altitude can be a problem. Coming from sea level, I had a nasty headache for 2 days but continued to walk around Cusco to further acclimatize and get used to huffing and puffing on steep steps and inclines. I did not take Diamox or cocoa and managed with the headache. Day 2 of the hike includes the two highest peaks at ~13700 and ~13100 feet. You gain almost 3000 feet of elevation in the morning hike. Since I do run on a normal basis, I was able to complete the day without too many problems. I will say that I thought descending was actually much harder...especially on my joints.Inca steps are gigantic. They are suitable for people with 10 feet long legs. I did take a tumble once. I'm not sure if walking poles help but I do suggest bringing or renting them.Several parts of the trail are narrow and require you to be a little more careful when you step but all in all, the trail seemed safe and manageable. Take your time as needed. The scenery along the trail is beautiful and the feeling of being immersed in it was amazing. Quite an experience.There are toilet facilities along the way...most are pit latrines. Bring toilet paper and hand sanitizer. The last day, you get up early so you can head down to a check point to line up (check point opens at 530 am). From there it is a 45 minute hike (at a crazy pace) to the sun gate. From the sun gate you have a stunning view of Machu Picchu (or so I'm told). We had three days of rain which is supposedly rare for June. We were not able to get any views of Machu Picchu. It's worth preparing yourself for the possibility that the weather will not cooperate. But, I found the trail to be so much more than just Machu Picchu. The Inca Trail is an amazing experience and one worth crossing off if it's on your bucket list."
Most amazing experience ever,"Best experience. Hiking the trail in unimaginable and can't put into words the awe inspiring views! This must be on your bucket list! Make it happen even if it wasn't on your radar before, it should be now."
4D/3N Inca Trail Hike with Killa Expeditions,"Wow! What an amazing adventure.  We are a group of 8 friends, ranging between 32 - 63, who just completed the Inca Trek.  We booked through Killa Expeditions who are based in San Diego, CA. It was wonderful working with Nicole who is American (married to Jose who is Peruvian).  There was a great deal of comfort in knowing that Killa were only a phone call away.  Nicole went well above and beyond to ensure that this Trek was well organized.  The adventure began in Urubamba where we acclimatized the recommended 3 days prior to trekking. Our guide, Justino, began referring to us as ""Family"" on day one…….and so we were!  The following days were filled with breathtaking views, treacherous terrain and accomplishment.  Justino proves to be a good mix of Inca historian and spiritualist guiding us through his country with appreciation for Pachamama (Mother Earth) and educating us on the Quechua principals of thanking this land for allowing us to be a part of it.  The porters are amazing….mostly Quechua farmers who work the trails during their off season for extra money.  They are shy, joyous people working non stop.  If you have researched the Inca Trail, you have heard about the incredible food that is prepared at campsite.  Honestly, how do they do it?   Delicious four coarse meals, three times a day.  Our first campsite was in the backyard of a local family.  Justino, explained that by utilizing the resources of the locals, Killa, could also give back to them by providing them with our leftover food.  We were also able to purchase, beer, water and even batteries from their small shop.  The first couple of days, you will see indigenous families along the way.  On day two, we tackle the infamous Dead Woman’s Pass .  At 59 and the least athletic of the group, I was at the back of the pack with Justino not far away encouraging me on.  No donkey for me, I had made it half way!  I had expected day 3 to be easier, but the first 2 hours are straight up.  Really glad that I had no idea about that!  This was my favorite day, trekking through a spectacular cloud forest with an array of plant ecosystems……many of them resembling the work of a floral arrangement.  On day 4, you are up early to get through the check point and reach your goal…Machu Picchu. We arrive at Sun Gate to catch a small glimpse of Machu Picchu through the thick cloud coverage then make our way through the maze of day trippers smelling of perfume and soap.  It is difficult to explain the feeling of arriving into Machu Picchu after hiking along a trail that was once trekked by warriors and peasants, alike ….the breathtaking views and architectural wonder, the pride, the sense of accomplishment and even the knowledge that your sore aching body is just hours away from a shower.  None the less, we have made it!  And, yes, it is a life altering experience!"
Altitude Sickness – Insurance warning,"Unfortunately we missed out on walking the Inca Trail due to my wife’s altitude sickness whilst in Cusco. Please beware that most insurance policies claim to cover “altitude sickness”, but elsewhere in the policy it will only pay out if you actually return home i.e. your home country. Our misfortune was to choose Insure and Go but this clause is in a lot of the policies, so beware.Perhaps if anyone has had more joy they could highlight any honest insurance company experiences."
Wow wow wow 4-day Inca Trail Trek,"My husband, friend, and I, all in our 50's, just completed the 4-day Inca Trail Trek to Machu Picchu.  We joined another couple who have become fast friends.  Our hike was arranged through Pachamama Explorers and is an experience I will not forget any time soon.  Our guide, Christian, was very organized and explained everything in detail.  He was excited to share his knowledge of the history of the Inca people as we stopped at different ruins along the way and watched the sunrise at the Sun Gate early on the final day of the hike.  The meals prepared by master chef Mariano were amazing and certainly surpassed our expectations on a camping trip! He even baked a cake for dessert on our last night.  The porters had tents ready every evening and dismantled just as quickly the following morning.  To say I am sore would be an understatement.  The second day was almost completely uphill while the third day was the opposite.  My calves have felt like jelly and my thighs scream every time I approach a staircase.  This will soon pass, but the memories of this trek will last a lifetime."
One of the toughest and most rewarding experiences,"Physically and mentally exhausting, the 4 day, 3 night Inca Trail trek to Machu Pichu is tough but worth it.Steep stair climbs and descents over 50km - non stop for three days of hiking mean this isn't for the faint hearted. But making it to Machu Pichu was exhilarating.I'd recommend booking with a reputable hiking company who provide tents and porters to carry most of the luggage. Walking poles and plenty of water and snacks are essential.Highly recommended - but spend money on a reputable tour company."
A once in a lifetime unforgettable experience,"The Inca trail is as amazing as people say.  We have just returned from an unforgettable experience visiting Peru.  We booked through Alpaca Expeditions and they were brilliant.  They are very professional and made out trip so special.  The food was amazing, we wherein awe at the variety and quality.  They organise everything for you and nothing is too much trouble.  Our guide was very experienced having done the trail about 400 times before.  The guide gave us excellent historical background and was very supportive as we made our way along setting an excellent pace.  We would definitely recommend Alpaca Expeditions - the green team were awesome clapping us as we made each major point on the trail, just lovely people.  We are a group of late 40 year olds with minimal physical ability.  We plodded on slowly and made it, definitely a strong mind helps.  The view at the end looking onto Machu Picchu is excellent but actually some of the highlights for us were the sites you can only visit on the Inca Trail."
How I trained for the Inca Trail - By a 52 year old woman.,"We have just returned from Peru after spending a month there which included hiking the Inca Trail , doing the four day, three night trek.  I thought I would share my training tips.  My biggest piece of advice would be start early and build up slowly.  This will build up endurance and help avoid injury.  Leaving it to the last few weeks, especially when you are older and not fitness fanatic (like me) is just a recipe for disaster.  I am fortunate because I don't work full time and live a short distance from hilly National Parks.  In saying that, if you live in a city area most training can be done in a gym, or even a high rise building with lots of flights of stairs.  I started hiking ten weeks out from the day we left Australia (we didn't actually start the hike until two weeks after that) so if you stop your training a week or so before you leave then don't walk for another two weeks or so, you will start to lose fitness.  This is why starting out as early as possible will help and try to train up until you go. The first six weeks of training I did two ten kilometre hikes in the hills per week.  The last four weeks I increased it to three ten kilometre hikes a week.  This is all the training I did.  I did not attend the gym or use any training equipment as the hills I walked were enough to push my heart rate up.  If you don't have access to hill walks, then substitute if for the stairmaster or flights of stairs in a building, believe me, the amount of steps you wil be climbing is unbelievable.  Of course the bike, treadmill or any sort of interval training are good to get your heart rate up as cardio is important.  If you can get out and do a bushwalk even once a week, on an uneven bush trail this will help with strengthening your ankles and helping with balance as the Inca Trail is uneven and requires concentration, especially on the down hills.  Other tips, take walking poles with you and learn how to use them properly before you go, there is a technique!  They help immensely.  Train in the same gear that you will be wearing, especially with your footwear.  Buy a cheap poncho rain coat over there in addition to what you take.  We got stuck in the rain on day 2 and used them with our existing rain gear and they wear great, kept us warm and dry as it was freezing (we hiked it at the end of May).  When you train put some weight in your pack to replicate what you will be carrying.  I found that the training I did was adequate, even though I had to walk the trail with tendonitis in the arch of my foot (developed during the training lead up) and had a head cold during the whole hike after catching it on the plane on the way over.  I found the hike quite comfortable and enjoyable.  Of course the dreaded Day 2 over Dead Womans Pass was a challenge but I kept reminding myself of the old saying 'How do you eat an elephant?'  One bite at a time.  Same with the Inca Trail, one step at a time.  It's not a race, take your time, enjoy the beauty around you and pat yourself on the back after completing this experience of a lifetime!"
4 Day Inca Trail Trek,"What an amazing 4 days of stunning scenery, great paths, fantastic guides and fabulous food. We booked the trek through Llama Travel in the UK and the trek was ran by Condor Travel in Peru. Both companies were absolutely excellent. Our guides Freddie and Omar were brilliant and kept us well informed on all the history of the route along the trek. Our tented accomodation on the 3 nights was brilliant as were the sleeping bags and the dining tent. The weather was fantastic (May) and there was more or less no cloud covering Machu Picchu when we arrived at the Sun Gate. We are both in our late 50's and found it not as tough as we had expected, if you are reasonably fit this is a must do, especially when using these companies. Something we will treasure for the rest of our lives!!"
An Amazing Journey,"I actually trekked the Inca Trail about 4 years ago, July 2013. It's one of the very few adventures I've had that I would love to repeat! I went with the Atlanta Outdoor Club who secured 2 incredibly knowledgeable and personable guides. The porters were truly amazing and the meals provided were top notch. The trail is truly doable for quite a range of fitness levels. The ruins along the trail are stunning, and you absolutely cannot beat the views the Andes provide from sun up to sun down. I was a bit sad when we finally arrived at Machu Piccu - I wasn't ready for the journey to end."
4 Day Inca Trail with Uncover Latin America,"Wow!! The most challenging and rewarding experience of my life to date. We booked our 4 day Inca Trail with Uncover Latin America who we cant rate highly enough. They made what would have been a good experience regardless, a trekking experience of a lifetime. we had 2 guides Juan and Hector who were fantastic, every meal was something we looked forward to because the food was so good. Always more than enough food. We had a fun group. we really enjoyed our lunch at the end at the Sanctuary Lodge of our tour of Machu Picchu. If you are planning on doing the Inca Trail I highly recommend Uncover Latin America."
The most amazing adventure,"This was a highlight of my life. I was with 3 friends and we booked through Intrepid (who I can't recommend highly enough). Everything was taken care of for us. We just packed clothes, boots, hiking poles and sleeping gear. The porters were amazing. Take spare cash to pay them, and give them anything you won't need any more at the end (we asked everyone in our group to hand over food or clothes they didn't want or need). We also packed coca leaves to give them as well as none of us could stand the stuff. I have made friends for life in the group I hiked with. Including the guides. Anyone can do the hike with some basic training. We live in a flat and dry part of the world and still received enough advice to live every minute of the hike. It's also the best way to see Machu Picchu."
Without question the BEST way to see Machu Picchu!,"I couldn't say enough about my experience on the Inca trail. It was an uplifting, soul searching and character building experience all in one. We went with SAS tours and they were amazing! We truly had the experience of a lifetime. It was the highlight of my two month South America trip. Do Not Miss It!"
Nature's Great Creation,An excellent experience. Get a good guide. The hike is pleasant but at some places the path was a bit narrow. Good pair of hiking boots and hiking poles is a must.
It's worth the hike!,"I did a 4 day Inca Trail hike for my 10th anniversary. It was a fantastic experience. We hiked all the way to 14k feet through dead woman's pass. It's strenuous but totally doable by a reasonably healthy young person. Half of the porters are in their 50s and 60s and they have no problem!We went with SAS because they have a good reputation for treating their porters well. As far as I can tell that reputation is well deserved.The whole trip felt like glamping. Your only job is to hike. The tents are carried by others, the food is cooked for you, and it's delicious! Porters wake you up every morning with fresh tea. It really was the highlight of my trip!I think I would have enjoyed Machu Picchu much less had I not hiked the Inca trail. It's a great idea to spend a few days getting context about how the Inca empire built things and the history.  Macho Picchu itself isn't the best part. It's very impressive, but it's also crowded. On the Inca trail you might pass another group a few times a day, but for the most part you are free to explore archaeological sites on your own, and there are a ton of sites on the trail."
4 day trek with PERU TREKS!,"Let me start by saying THE INCA TRAIL GETS A 5 STAR REVIEW, IT WAS SIMPLY THE BEST but I'm here to review the tour company as they don't have a page to review. With PERU TREKS The cost of 650 dollars is quite expensive and this is only the start of the costs as you will have to pay for breakfast on the first day, lunch on the last day and you are urged to buy extra porters on at least 2 of the 3 trekking days at 120 soles per day. I'm sceptical if the tour guide gives all/any of this money to the porters carrying the bulk as it went straight in his pocket. Then on the last night 'recommended tips' are collected so you'll have to allow for an extra 60-80 US Dollars, unless you're happy to stand out from the crowd. I give the above information in case budgeting and money is an issue for you. As far as the trekking and the guides go it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience. From the outset they made the group feel like a family and encouraged a positive, respectful attitude towards the porters (chaskis)One guide however, made a derogatory remark about homosexuals in case that puts you off. A once in a life time experience, you will 100% love Machu Picchu more if you've trekked rather than trained. Enjoy!"
Amazing Experience,"My husband and I did the 4 day hike last November. Started at Km 82 and ended at Machu Picchu. The experience is something I wouldn't trade for anything, even the 6 hours of pain on day 2. Let me start by saying that yes anyone (including my out of shape at the time self) can complete, but you need to get into shape before showing up. Day 2 is very challenging and will test you mentally and physically. One step at a time! Next, get a porter you will be happy you spent the extra money. It will give you the chance to really enjoy the hike, and as the guides say it's your vacation!Things you need to bring, good worn in hiking boots. Make sure the soles have good traction because there are many slippery spots. Hiking poles, your knees will thank you. Good hiking socks, hat, neck protection, sun glasses, bug spray, sun screen, comfy shoes to walk around camp in, rain jacket and a warm outer layer. The altitude starts to get to a lot of people the second day, so start chewing those coca leaves or buy the red and white pills in town before the hike starts. Just remember if you start struggling, stop take a deep breath and look around at the beauty around you."
Trip of a Lifetime,"I recently (late May) did the 4 day classic Inca Trail from Km 82 through to Machu Picchu. What an incredible experience this was, to say the least. I traveled with Intrepid Travel, who used Peak South America as their local operator for the porters, cooks etc. The guys from Peak South America where just great, really looked after us well.   In regards the weather this time of year, I thought it was ideal for the hiking. During the days the temperature  varied from about 17 - 20 deg Celsius. It got real cold at night, so you really need to pack your thermals, gloves, hat etc. My research beforehand indicated that anyone can physically do this trek, but it's advantageous to be reasonably fit. In reality this is true (I saw a people of all ages and levels of fitness along the way) if you have the determination. But I really do recommend getting as fit as possible before going. Believe you me, it is very physically challenging with a lot of steep steps to climb up & down. It will make the experience that much more enjoyable, it really will. In regards the question of running/gym shoes vs hiking/tramping boots. I could have done it in my runners, but was really glad I took my tramping boots. The stones on the trail aren't flat & smooth, but very angular & uneven. Firstly, runners would get wrecked and the soles of your feet would get sore probably. Secondly there's real risk of rolling your ankles, so tramping boots (not shoes) provide support & comfort. In regards some peoples goal / obsession of getting to the Sun Gate by sunrise (had a few people in our party who seemed hung up on this). Firstly, it is only at on the day of the Winter Solstice (June 21), that the rising shines through the gate & down to the temple in Machu Picchu. Secondly, it's not actually possible to make it to the Sun Gate by sunrise. This is because the entrance doesn't open until 5:30am and it's a good hour's hike up to the gate from there. How ever it is worth getting up early, so as to beat the worst of the crowds in Machu Picchu itself."
Must go!,My family and I did the 4 day hike last summer. It was emotionally and physically taxing but I would not take it back. I would not do it again but I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to do it! We went through Peru Treks. They were the best and reasonably priced.
Great trek and trek operator,"Our 4 day Inca Trail adventure was beyond amazing. We booked through Uncover Latin America who were beyond excellent, the guides, the food and the organizing we all exceptional. If your travelling with someone be sure to charge 2 cameras, my biggest regret was taking too many photos too early. Our guide Hector kindly took some photos for us on his phone and sent them to us via email. My husband had a little altitude sickness in Day 1 and Hector was very patient. If I did it again we probably would have had two days in Cusco beforehand instead of one, but we were limited with time. We were given some Diamox which really helped him. By Day 2 he was fine."
Adventures Within Reach ,"We did the 30 mile trek to Machu Picchu and it was a life changing trip! AWR did an amazing job of helping us plan and paid attention to the smallest detail. Our guides in Peru(Explorandes) were knowledgeable, warm, friendly and became part of our family by the end. I would do it again!"
Machu Picchu & Inca Trail,"Adventures within reach did an absolutely amazing job coordinating all aspects of my recent vacation in Peru.  Their staff made recommendations based on my interests and everything was perfect - a dream vacation.  The Adventures within reach team was very responsive and has an amazing attention to detail.  I did the 4 day hike on the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu and would highly recommend it.  The views were absolutely breath taking; it's something everyone should be able to experience.  As a single female, I felt completely safe - all thanks to the wonderful AWR team and their incredible attention to detail.  Amazing trip - 5 stars!!"
INCA TRAIL,Did the Inca trail in December 2010 for my 60th birthday. Lifetime experience. Two excellent guides accompanied us and the food that we were served 3 times a day was very tasty. All our baggage was carried and tents pitched by the porters who did an amazing job by carrying all equipment up the mountain . The trail was tough but one that I will never forget.
An awesome experience!,"We did the two-day trail rather than the four-day; mostly because of concerns with altitude sickness (we live in Florida, and you get up to about 11K on the trail.  The most beautiful part is coming through the Sun Gate and looking down onto Machu Picchu itself.  A few thoughts - bring plenty of water; if you're not in shape, don't do it; wear appropriate footwear, I wore really hard soled hiking boots and they were somewhat slippery on the loose rock of the trail - you might prefer a high-quality Gortex running shoe.  Again, a great experience."
KM104 - 1 Day Trek including Winaywayna,"I went to Peru with my mum who is 77 years old. My brother told her that to see MP from the Sun Gate is one of the greatest visual experiences in life. We actually started from KM107 due to the landslides. After a few hours climbing we made it to Winaywayna. This tucked away little gem simply takes your breath away, and can only be accessed from the trail. A few hours later we were at the Sun Gate, after a comical drag and push up the final 50 steps. As all the reviews will say, it is something special to arrive and see MP down below you, but the surrounding mountains are incredible as well. A wonderful part of the day was meeting all the people, whether on the 5 day hike or the 1 day sprint. My Mum was cheered and clapped by the fellow trekkers as she arrived at the Sun Gate. Something I will remember and treasure.Thanks to everyone who was on the trail on the 7th May - a special day."
Amazing five day Inca Trail trek,"Our extended family, ages 30 to 69, had a wonderful but challenging trek, plus time spent in Lima, Cuzco and the Sacred Valley. We arranged our entire trip through Adventures Within Reach, and all our guides, tours and accommodations exceeded our expectations. We were glad that we followed AWR's recommendations to do a five day trek instead of the typical shorter version since this was difficult enough for the experienced 60+year old hikers in our group. The sense of accomplishment when arriving at the Sun Gate is one of those moments in life that you will never forget!"
"Tough, tough, tough but worth every pain and breath","I am almost 65 and just finished it.  Day 2 is an unbelievable challenge but we went with good friends and the great folks from Alpaca Adventures.  I highly recommend them to increase your odds of success. I am being showered with praise and wow's from my friens.  Not for everyone, but if it is for you,do it, train, and go as early in your life as is possible.  Ending with the morning view of Mahu Picchu from the Sun Gate cannot be described or photographed."
Defies plausible description,"We undertook this hike as an adventure that would lead to one of the wonders of the world, and walked away from it realizing that we had just experienced a spiritual journey that defies plausible description. A vital and important fact must be said here, and that is that the city of Macchu Picchu, as amazing as it is, will only be a footnote for anyone who reaches it by taking the trail. The four days, and 43 miles we hiked (almost all sites we investigated before we went indicate that the Trail is between 25 to 30 miles, but several trekkers in our group tracked the distance and tight numbers showed an average of 43-44 miles), were the most challenging and stunning days and miles we have ever done (I understand that for some this may not be much of a challenge, but for us it was). The pertinent part was for us involves the Andean people, the local culture, and the Incan history that was detailed to us along the way, not to mention the continual bombardment of the most amazing views. The tour guides and team were such wonderful people to a fault (we have been privileged enough to have known many cultures in our travels, and I can honestly say that the Andean people are without question the kindest and most generous people we have ever met). Our guide Poppy Freddie, and our assistant guide Jimmy were absolute gems. Freddie invested himself in not only ensuring we made and successfully survived the hike, but he undertook a genuine interest in ensuring that we learned about the history and culture of the area and places we went. On top of that, he put forth a great effort to make our whole group feel and operate as a family, and I will long remember him calling us to food or conference ""Family"" ""Family"" ""Family"". He also made sure that this family group thought process included the crew, which we did notice that our group was the only group operating this way. This effect was extremely touching when we spent time together as a group at camp every night, and without a common language we we laughing and having fun together. Jimmy (who Freddy affectionately called Mamma Jimmy) was everywhere, always watching out for us, ready with any assistance, or just to help us get a photo together with whichever stunning view happened to be nearby (meaning this was a constant). Freddy taught us that normal trail etiquette is to move aside and let porters go past when they approach, while calling out ""Porter, Porter, Porter"", but he indicated that as these folks were always carrying far more weight, at much faster speeds, that it would be more meaningful to the porters to call out ""Chaski Chaski Chaski"" (not certain I spelled it correctly though) which indicates strong men if I got it correct. So our group did so throughout the hike, which brought on smiles from not only our team of guys, but also from other tour company men as well. We cannot say enough about our chef, and yes I did say chef, because the food and service easily rivaled any from many of the five star establishments we have tried over the years, and this fellow (Sacharias) and his crew produced our meals from the giant packs they carried, and with what fresh food the could procure from some of the villages we passed through, and prepared it all in a tent with near primitively means. We were treated to three and four course meals at every meal, and all served with a timing and execution that would do any restaurant proud. They really produced miracles including a birthday cake for someone who had their birthday along the way (no oven). These people stood out in a biting wind that threatened our meal tent. To hold it down while we ate (we did not know this until after we had finished, again wonderful people. This definitely the hike of a lifetime, but make sure that if you cannot do any altitude hiking training, that you at least do so hiking endurance training (saved our Floridian butts)."
Outstanding!,To do this you need to have some hiking and fitness.  Please check with your doctor and do a little prep work.  It's an amazing challenge!  Would do it again!
What a hike!,"Ticked this off my bucket list last month! Its awesome , amazing and mesmerizing....but not easy. Certainly not impossible though.I did the four day hike, and visited Machu pichu on the fifth day (after sleeping in hotel and a proper shower..surely makes a lot of difference to your pics) So choose wisely. some hikes cover it in 4 days..including the visit to Machu Pichu. Tips for the Trek:1. Poles: MUST 2. Prepare for the second day.. going up to dead Women's pass is not so easy. Dont eat much before you reach there.3. Don't underestimate the downhill trek, its equally difficult.4. Don't carry a lot in your bakpack. Tires you more. from second day, I packed my big camera also inside.Soak in the beauty...the trail has a lot to offer...sunsets in the Andes, the Inca trails, rivers, waterfalls..and the Inca sites on the way...everything is so amazing!"
Trek of a lifetime,"We did the four day Inca Trail trek with View Peru. Was an amazing experience. Tough at times but well worth it. The views are spectacular. If you do it, make sure you research your tour group carefully. Some are better than others. I would def recommend View Peru & Signatures."
If you want an authentic Incan experience.  This is it.,"Like many things in life, you get out of it what you put into it.  My friend and I are 68 but we trained for over a month and were able to trek the trail and immerse ourselves in the near jungle like adventure.  It is the BEST way to approach and ""discover"" Machu Picchu."
Amazing experience,"Before making this trip, I was advised that I had to be moderately fit. The trek was actually not too bad. A little strenuous but very doable."
This trip will be one of the highlights of your life!,"The Inca trail is an incredible experience!  Mixing the historical aspects of the Inca Trail, Cuzco, with the beauty of the Andes is just amazing.  Out trip was set up by Adventures Within Reach, they did an incredible job! (as usual, I am a very satisfied repeat customer :o))"
Machu Picchu on a Budget!,"There are many ways of reaching Machu Picchu. Many tourist make it there after hiking for days along the famous Inca trail. Others decide to take the train from Cuzco to Aguas Calients (the town below Machu Picchu). However not all travelers can afford neither of those famous methods. Trying to figure out an affordable way to reaching Machu Picchu we found the cheapest way of getting to Aguas Calientes from Cuzco in the same day for only $80 soles (about $24 USD) per person round trip. This method also includes a pleasant and easy hike of about 2 hours along a river and the train tracks. We enjoyed visiting Machu Picchu in this way and our budget appreciated it.

We are sure you will find our article helpful: http://www.ourfirstworldtrip.com/en/journal/100-english/journal/peru/486-machu-picchu-on-a-budget.html"
One heck of a trek but worth every penny,"Whilst there are several hikes to get to Machu Picchu, this review focuses on the classic 4 day Inca trail. My wife and I undertook this hike from 16-19 March this year with Alpaca Expeditions. My detailed review of Alpaca Expeditions can be found at their listing on TripAdvisor. Without going into too much I can confess that the trek surpassed my expectations. The sheer diversity of vegetation blew my mind. Even after trekking for 4 days we were not tired upon reaching Machu Picchu. The weather was terrible for the 3 days of the hike. It was raining constantly with overcast weather. However, on the fourth day when it mattered the most, the sun was out in all its glory to ensure our visit to Machu Picchu does not go in vain!Altitude-acclimatisation:---------------------------Below I am enlisting a few tips to help acclimatise to the high altitude in Cusco and the surrounds. Both my wife and I were extremely fortunate to have not encountered or suffered from any symptoms of altitude sickness. We did not take any medication whatsoever. I've read a range of opinions online about people suffering from altitude sickness. May be we got plain lucky, or even better, did all the right things. Take your pick.1. We are vegetarians so that helped a bit. In addition to that, for the first 2 days in Cusco, our main meals comprised mainly vegetarian soups. Dinners were strictly soups, not even bread! In Cusco we were happy to find so many vegetarian soup options including quinoa, lentil, spinach and mixed vegetable.2. We drank 3-4 cups of Coca Tea everyday without fail. A couple in the morning during breakfast, and one or two at night. This we continued right through until we reached San Pedro de Atacama in Chile after a good 3 weeks.3. Even though we are not big drinkers, we completely avoided alcohol for the first 3 days in Cusco.4. We consistently drank in excess of 2 litres of water everyday. Our CamelBak hydration bladder came real handy.5. For at least the first 2 days, we made a conscious effort to walk very slowly. Ditto when climbing stairs or walking uphill. I am one who walks really fast all the time no matter what. My wife almost found it funny when she saw me walking slowly. She could tell I was deliberately walking slowly and it made for a funny sight especially when climbing stairs. We often laugh thinking about these moments.6. We occasionally did a few breathing exercises. Take long deep breaths from time to time to open up the lungs.7. We stay put in Cusco for 3 nights before starting the hike. I have read about people spending a couple of days in the Sacred Valley and then undertaking the hike from there rather than travelling from Cusco. One important thing to remember is that Cusco (~3400 m) is higher than the first campsite on the Inca Trail (~3300 m). You may be better off if you have acclimatised well in Cusco itself. We arrived in Cusco midday from Puerto Maldonado and spent the rest of the day doing a bit of local walking (first night). The following day we did a day tour of the Sacred Valley (second night). The day after we did a half day private tour of the Cusco South Valley (third night). Thereafter, we started really early for the trek as we got picked up at 4:30 am from our hostel. 8. On the second day of the trail to Dead Woman's Pass, our guide asked my wife to inhale some mysterious liquid. My wife said it opened up her nasal passages. She wasn't suffering from altitude sickness as such, just that she was a bit tired. On further inquiry, we learnt that the mysterious liquid is 'Agua de Florida' and it apparently helps with altitude sickness. We bought a bottle of it from Puno where we travelled to after the trek but it is available in select pharmacies even in Cusco. Just ask around and keep it handy. The bottle we bought is still unopened and it now sits on the vanity chest.What to carry:-----------------You will get detailed information on this from your tour operator, but here I am writing what we carried.Passport (VERY IMPORTANT)Two wicking shirtsTwo hiking pantsFour pairs of undergarmentsFours pairs of woollen socksTwo pairs of cotton socksOne pair thermal undershirt & long johns (for chilly nights)One fleece jacket eachOne down jacket eachOne beanieOne pair of waterproof warm glovesOne mufflerOne broad-brimmed hatOne rain jacketOne rain pantOne pair of sturdy hiking bootsOne pair of thongsFull-body wipesToilet paperHand sanitiserCamelBak (3 litre)Sleeping bag (can be rented)Lilo/inflatable mattress (can be rented)Fleece blanketFrom the above, you can see we carried our own sleeping bag, inflatable mattress and fleece blanket. The only time we felt this was a hassle was on the last day when we had to get up before others to ensure everything is packed into the duffel bags. If we had rented them out the porters would have packed it for us. We, however, did rent out a pair of walking sticks each. Again, I did not find much use for them on day 3 and 4 of the hike probably because it was mostly downhill. We DID NOT HAVE TO carry rain pants and thongs. Everything else was ideal. We were fortunate to have rain ponchos provided by our tour operator (Alpaca Expeditions). At all the campsites there are squat toilets. Of course, they aren't super clean most of the times but at least something is better than nothing.One important thing to remember is where you camp during the hike is determined by your tour operator. I think where we camped was ideal as it gave us ample time on the third day to explore the Inca ruins whilst getting ample rest before the hike to Machu Picchu. Of course, this means we had to hike much more on the first and second day.This hike should be everyone's personal journey. Don't make it a race and try to compete with others. Take your own sweet time, stop to take lots of photos and cherish every moment spent on this incredible journey to Machu Picchu, you won't regret it!"
Fantastic trip with Humberto of Adios Travel - highly recommend this young man and his company.,"Took the family on a week long visit to Peru, flying into Lima from our home in Miami on Avainca. This trip's highlight was a one-day Inca Trail adventure, from the train tracks at mile marker ?? up the switchbacks to join the Inca Trail in Winaywayna, then on through the Sun Gate to Machu Piccu. Although Adios Travel would handle all of the arrangements from Lima/back to Lima, I had already booked most of the flights and hotels. They were able to work with the arrangements I had already made, added city tours, a great day of mountain biking, and the Inca Trail/Machu Piccu tours."
Wow!!!,Adventure of a lifetime!!Booked with G Adventures and it was more than I could have asked for! Guide Rohody was knowledge and supportive. Group 4 Porters were rocked! And the people in our group were fantastic - couldn't have asked for better travel companions. The hike was challenging but doable if you are in decent shape.  Drink the tea and chew the leaves to help with the altitude. It was amazing to sleep above the clouds and feel like you're amongst the gods!
Wondrous Experience!,"I have just walked the Inca Trail with Peru Treks, who are an excellent, responsible company with experienced and knowledgeable guides, superb cooks, great porter welfare and also support local community projects. I strongly recommend them for this trek, you will be well looked after. The trek itself is fabulous. Arriving at the Sun Gate high above Machu Picchu, after three or four days of trekking in the footsteps and past the palaces, fortresses and watch towers of the Incas is magical. I took the advice to acclimatise and do smaller before this one, walking Colca Canyon the week before, and spending time in both Puno and Cusco beforehand, and I was glad I did. I never had to take an altitude pill, just a few coca leaves and sweets. I was also very glad to have a camelback style water carrier, regularly sipping water especially when the sun came out. Everyone talks about Dead Woman's Pass on day 2, but Day 3 is equally challenging, although this was easily the most spectacularly beautiful and interesting part of the trail, walking on original Inca paved paths for much of the way. If doing this in March/April, expect rain, and the chance that Machu Picchu will be in cloud at the time of sunrise. The weather however changes rapidly over the course of the day, and this wondrous citadel in the clouds looks amazing in every type of weather!"
"KM 104 ""two-day trek"" disruption","As of April 2017, if you plan to do the two-day Inca Trail trek, be aware that a mudslide near Winay Wayna has closed the normal KM 104 trail. Instead, you will take the porter trail from about KM 107. The trail is shorter, steeper, and shadier. It still has very nice views, but you will miss the Chachabamba ruin."
Sights make up for some of the experiences,"My wife and I did the trail with G Adventures. We were the oldest in our group (late 40s) and probably the least fit, however we did complete the trail and although last in to camp each day we were never that far behind the others. People have already described the incredible vistas and their appreciation of the Inca ruins, including Machu Pichu and I would echo these views, although it is a bit disappointing to find that most of the ruins are actually about 50% rebuilt. The experience was spoiled for us due to a number of factors:- the toilet facilities are truly disgusting, particularly at the campsites on days 2&3. You could smell them from about 100m away, they were squat toilets covered and surrounded by faeces and urine with piles of used toilet paper in the corners of each cubicle. I have travelled widely and used these sorts of toilets before but these are the worst I have come across. In addition trying to find/ use them after dark is an adventure in itself and one best left to the imagination. - the terrain is rocky and treacherous often with vertiginous drops on one side, so you end up watching your feet most of the time working out where to walk safely. This is particularly the case when it is raining. You really need to remind yourself to look up and appreciate where you are. - because we were slower we were basically left behind by the rest of the group. At the start our guide had stressed the need to go slow and steady but our group decided to disregard this and he was unable or unwilling to pursue the point. Although we always had a guide behind us we rarely saw them as they preferred to chat with their fellow guides or sit at break sites knowing they could catch up with us before we got to camp. Effectively we completed the majority of the walk on our own. - we were woken at 5 on the first three mornings and 3 on the last. This is pointless at the time of year we went and only adds to the stress and weariness. Day 2 you are back at camp by 2-3! Getting up at 3 on the last day is because the porters have to pack up and catch their train. The result is you sit at the checkpoint for two hours in the cold. I have every sympathy with the porters for the incredibly hard job they do but the travel companies have the responsibility to work with the train company or provide their own transport rather than putting the onus on their customers who have paid a considerable amount for the experience. I don't say this to put people off but you need to know what to expect. I wouldn't do it again and if I'd known beforehand what I know now I would have gone by train."
Words cannot describe,"We hiked the Inca Trail in March 2017.  We traveled the trail as a family of four - two adults and two kids (aged 12 and 9).  Words cannot describe the Inca Trail or the ruins one encounters along the way.  While the trail is a remote excursion with its risks, it isn't too hard for fit folks to do.  Make sure you plan ahead and are physically fit.  Bring your trekking poles to help lessen the jolt to your knees with all stairs (both up and down)."
Breath Taking views and incredible trails,"My wife and I hiked the Inca trail over 4 days through G Adventures. Words will not do this experience justice, it was simply amazing. Our guide, Raymer, was extremely knowledgable and very very passionate about the history and culture of the incas, which made the hike that much more enjoyable.If you are going to visit Machu Picchu I would highly recommend hiking the Inca trail to get there, It just adds so much more to the experience. I would suggest, however, that you have a decent level of fitness, and give yourself a few days in Cusco to acclimatise to the high altitude. Also make sure that you have adequately broken in hiking shoes to wear. My wife had brand new ones and her feet suffered for it.Over all it is the highlight of Peru for me, and a once in a life time experience.So do yourself a favour and hike the Inca trail and become a true Inca warrior!!!"
AWESOME INCA TRAIL,"it was great, this was one of the awesome places i been in Peru, it was a bit tire to do the tour, but still amazing, i do this tour with a great travel agency, this agency were absolutely awesome, if you want to travel with an travel agency i recommend Backpacker Nation, this is they´re website backpacker-nation.com , they speak spanish and english and have whattsapp!"
Worthwhile challenge with Peru Treks,"Did this towards the end of March with Peru Treks; two females in early twenties, always felt safe and comfortable. Excellent company - incredible food service and staff, and great guides. Did it with a friend and we had a full group of 16 in total from all over the US as well as the UK. Tour guides really foster group spirit and we can hike at our own pace. The chef makes amazing meals, provide water for washing hands before eating, good tents and sleeping bags (which can be provided for an additional fee), all transport and entrance fees are taken care of. Only issue was during the time we went we weren't able to stay at the camp on the last night (Winay Wayna) due to rain; the decision to stay at the camp or to stay in Aguas Calientes had to be unanimous by all 16 group members; I felt the information was not explicitly conveyed to the group to allow for an informed decision. Other than this, I highly recommend Peru Treks. They also lead charitable initiatives which they should make more well known as they are doing good work! Pre-hike communication could also be improved but once you actually arrive in Cusco, the office is not far from the main square (about 10 min walk) and all the necessary information is provided. Highly recommend."
4 Day Classic is a MUST DO,"We are 60 years old and did the Inca Trail with Alpaca Expedition in January. Although difficult at times, the hike is worth it. We were so impressed with this tour company. I guess they are Number 1 on Tripadvisor for a good reason. The service, food, guides, tents etc are top notch. I don't know why you would look any further for a tour company. Our guide Reuben ""Sandwich"" was the best. Hiking the Inca trail was a very spiritual experience. We learned a lot about the Inca heritage and came across many archaeological ruins where Rueben would provide information and history of the Inca culture. The second day was a killer. We were up at 5:00 am and on the trail by 6:00 for 10 hours of hiking to make the 16 km for the day. We set out on the first leg; a 4 hour hike, straight uphill to reach Dead Woman’s Pass over the first mountain. We were climbing from 3000 m to over 4200 m in this leg. It was getting steeper and harder. The altitude was making it difficult but watching the GREEN MACHINE carrying 55 lb packs straight uphill gave me the strength to continue. Bring layers as it does get cool at night. Remember to acclimatize for 3 days prior to doing the trail. This is very important. We stayed in Ollantaytambo which is at a lower altitude than Cusco. Hiking the Inca trail is a Must Do. You will have a lifetime of memories and feel so proud of your accomplishments."
Amazing life experience!,"We've recently returned from our 4days on the Inca Trail with Toucan Travel - would highly recommend them as a company, but whoever you book with, the Trail is BRILLIANT! Beautiful, challenging (in a good way!), life-giving - will remember it forever :)Be prepared for some breathless up-hills whatever your fitness - the altitude is real - and some knee crunching downhills, but in my opinion most people who are fit and able to walk comfortably will have no real problems. And what's life about if not a little challenge?!Be prepared for stunning views throughout - DO NOT MISS Winaywayna, just past the last camp site before the final day. You'll be knackered but it's worth it. And try to enjoy the journey along the way - soak up the atmosphere when you finally get to Machu Picchu, but make sure you don't put all your eggs in that one basket as you might find the number of tourists who arrive there by bus/train a little overwhelming after your hard-earned trek... There are so many highlights along the whole trail, so just relax and breathe it all in along the way!"
Unbelievable experience,"First of all, I'm NOT a hiker, nor that I'm calling myself a hiker after this trip. However, the Inca Trail has its unique beauty that no matter how much anyone loves or (dislikes) the hike, it will be very worth it at the end. I took my pace very slowly, because I had a hard time breathing due to altitude sickness on the first day. But I do recall reading from one of the blogs saying how we should stop and look around the beauty of this trial. I know it's easier said than done, because I got afraid to just take my eyes away from the floor. But it was worth every single minute of it on the trail. Absolutely wonderful experience! And honestly...I've never thought I would start to become an outdoor lover!"
Tough but amazing trail,Our group did the trek with G Adventures. We were well looked after from the time we landed in Lima to the time we departed from Cusco. Two of our group did the Cusco option which involved 3 night stay in Cusco and going by train to Aguas Calientes. The rest hiked it. The second day is very tough. The best  thing is to go at your own pace. It rained a lot at this time but didn't bother too much because of the ponchos. It also dries up very fast. The food provided on the trail was excellent. The toilets were not such a big problem. It is a short tough trek but well worth it for the views and the end with Machu Picchu.
Amazing,"I can say of this way that for me and my friends will be unforgettable, the Inca trail is really spectacular, I want to recommend this place to visit if you go to Peru, you like adventure and walking, this is ideal place"
A magical experience ,"I booked this four day trip through gadventures as part of a wider tour of the Amazon and The Galápagos Islands. The tour started in Lima before flying up Cuzco where we met Elias and Caesar our tour guides, and the rest of the group. After a day of acclimatisation and a long bus ride to the starting point of the trail, it was time to meet our porters and pack our gear before setting off. There are only a limited number of hikers allowed on the trail and so we were quickly through the checkpoint and beginning to climb. The hike was to last four days and the first day was tough enough but the second days climb up to Dead Woman's Pass was a killer, but a huge sense of achievement when I reached the summit. The third day was a long trek and the fourth an early rise at 3am to trek up to The Sun Gate. When we climbed up to the peak above Machu Picchu the rising sun began to burn off the clouds to reveal the site hundreds of feet below us. What a remarkable and awesome sight!"
4 Days of Heaven,"This was one of my life memories. So beautiful all the way. Limits to the number of people on the trail which was good. Watch out for the tiny orchids along the way, and remember to take in those mental snapshots as you go along."
Peru Treks Rocks!,"We completed the 4D/3N trek but it was the most challenging task I have ever attempted.  I am 65 and in pretty good shape but I was not prepared for the toll oxygen deprivation can take on a body.  I was ready to quit at lunch on the first day – (the easy day!).  But my companion and our excellent Peru Treks guides (Nohemie and Edwin) encouraged me to go at my own pace, ignore the folks continually passing me (I was always the last to arrive anywhere!), and recognize that this was a mind over body challenge.  They were right – but I could not have completed the trip without them.  Always Nohemie or Edwin were trolling behind me – not nagging or urging – just keeping an eye on me.  And my Sweetheart did everything necessary to help me out including carrying my day pack for the second half of the first day!  What a guy!  The views are amazing – the Incan culture certainly worthy of appreciation – but if you are over 40 prepare yourself!  14,000 feet can be demoralizing!  Thank you Peru Treks for choosing, training, and valuing such wonderful guides.  Thank you also for your terrific porters and chef!  Who knew you could bake a cake or prepare restaurant quality meals at 13,000 feet?  My only recommendation – invest in thicker pads for sleeping!"
Not for the unfit,"Outstanding service from guides,cooks,carriers to negotiate the mountains with altitudes to 4.200 metres"
the one day hike is tough but the greatest,"We left the train to Agua Calientes at the 104 km mark and started climbing. The first 6 km is straight up, with stone steps on the steepest bits, up through cloud forest. Hot, very hot. The scenery is fantastic and the Winay Wayna ruins that we climbed all through near the final checkpoint, are huge, and not overrun with anybody other than hikers.  Physical fitness is a MUST. In order to do the one day hike in 7 to 8 hours the stops were short, but much needed. Bring lots of water and snacks.The view when we finally reached the Sun gate late in the afternoon was out of this world. Machu Picchu was spread out before us with only a few tourists left. I have seen this one day hike called a sprint, if you can sprint 12 km more or less straight up! It is also a kind of ""best of the Inca trail"". Really recommended for active people."
You Must be Physically Fit,Takes four (4) days to climb the trail and reach the summit to overlook the ruins of Machu Picchu. Well worth the experience and the adventure. Absolutely breath-taking but would be treacherous for anyone without the stamina or physical capability. Definitely a must do activity.
The #1 bucket list for all eager trekkers!,"Feel like a true Inca warrior as you trek the last steps of the Inca civilization. A 45km hike will find you rather sore afterwards as the steps are endless! Do not do this trek if you have weak knees- but also bring hiking poles for protection. Every step is worth it as you uncover the Andes ranges and Inca ruins all the way to Machu Picchu. Must do with a guide (condor travel was who we used and were excellent). Porters carry your belongings besides your day pack, the essentials to bring are toilet paper, a headlamp, hiking boots and raincoat. It is a challenging incline with the risk of altitude sickness but if you spend a day before in Cusco acclimatizing and drink lots of tea, take it slow and you will have zero issues! Bring your strongest legs, an open mind and a determined attitude and what a phenomenal outdoor vacation experience it is! Unlike any other :)"
Cussco free tour and inca jungle trail,"I've just returned from an amazing trip to Peru. We stayed in cussco which is a beautiful town. I recommend the free walking tours of cussco our guide was a man called Elvis who was brilliant and his local knowledge was amazing. The tours are free  and last a couple of hours, they do ask for tips which are down to your choice, it's well worth 2 hours of your time.We did the four day inca trail our guide was Leo Rodriguez from Haku travel.Once again an amazing character who couldn't do enough for us.peru is beautiful and if you are doing the 4 day inca trail you are in for a real treat."
It's Well Worth the Struggle,"Firstly, hiking the Inca Trail was the hardest thing, both mentally and physically, I've ever done. Both my fiancée and I were in pretty good shape going in, but the trek made both of us question whether we'd ever really been physically fit; day two was excruciating, and it was compounded by the fact we went during rainy season and so the trail was both steep and a muddy slog. When we arrived at the Sungate the clouds were so thick we couldn't get our first look at Machu Picchu.HOWEVER. About fifteen minutes into our descent towards the site the clouds suddenly parted and, as if in a movie, Machu Picchu suddenly appeared beneath us. It was utterly magical. Surviving the trek (I use the word in a broad sense, but still) made the visit to Machu Picchu itself that much more meaningful. I'm sure it would've been equally great if we'd just taken the bus...but it's a pretty incredible feeling to complete one of the most famous hikes in the world at one of its most famous historical sites. We used G Adventures, who were a superlative company. The one thing I'll say that you should absolutely remember going in: the toilets along the trail are DISGUSTING. Most of them are squat toilets and all of them reek. Bring lots of TP and be ready to hold your breath for as long as you're in them. I've never been happier to see a Western toilet than the night we got back from the trail."
Peru Trek Agency ,One of the most challenging but rewarding trips! We went with Peru treks on 4D/3N. Absolutely amazing trekking through the Andes. Our guide was super passionate and very informative. The chef cooked awesome food and our Chasquis were incredible. Would highly recommend if you are up to the challenge!
Classic Inca Trail via Tierras Vivas,"I hiked the Classic Inca Trail (4 days/3 nights) to Machu Picchu.  The hike itself is a great experience as evidenced by almost any review you will read about it.  This review therefore is dedicated more to the company (Tierras Vivas) that I booked it through.  I had decided to book this trip in advance, in accordance with a great percentage of the reviews that I had read.  While shopping around online, Tierras Vivas had one of the cheapest prices and seemed to be one of the more legitimate booking options that I had found.  They offered to options: the Cheap Inca Trail for USD 500 and the Classic Inca Trail for USD 650. Cheap Inca Trail included the permits and tickets for the Inca Trail and Machu Picchu, three days worth of breakfast lunch and dinner, tents, the train and bus back from Aguas Callientes to my hotel in Cusco, etc. The extra 150 included a sleeping bag, a blanket, a pillow, a mattress, the bus from Machu Picchu to Aguas Callientes, and an extra porter to carry my personal belongings.  I booked the trip 4 days before and was informed that there were only 2 spots left available for the dates that I wanted to hike.  Communication was lax prior to leaving and I had to initiate most things (like planning the time and place for the briefing), however, they were responsive when I contacted them through their website.The night before the hike I had a briefing with my guide.  They brought me a duffel bag for my personal belongings, however, the sleeping bag was in the duffel bag.  I was allowed to load the duffel bag with 7 kg, however, the sleeping bag was 5 kg, so I could only bring another 2 kg of clothes and stuff, which really isn't that much, i'm sure my hoodie weighs about 3 kg.  If I was overweight, I'd have to pay USD 70 for another porter.  In the end, there wasn't really another porter to carry my stuff, the existing porters just had to carry more stuff.  the sleeping bag was decent, but the mattress wasn't anything special (though i guess it was better than sleeping on the ground).  The ""blanket"" was just a bed sheet which was pretty much useless ad the pillow was about 8 inches square.  The extra 150 was really just for a sleeping bag that they carried up for me.  It probably would have been worth it to buy a sleeping bag and carry it myself.The day of, I met the other three travelers in our group.  All of them had booked the trek the day before, meaning that the 2 person availability was simply a line they fed me to get me to book it.  They had all booked the Cheap Inca Trail (or the equivalent of) none of them had booked it through Tierras Vivas, rather had booked it through local travel agents once they got to Cusco.  One of them had gotten the whole package (Cheap Inca Trail) for USD 300, and the other two paid under USD 500, indicating that it pays to NOT book in advance (of course this is down season, I can't speak to peak season, but it seems that down season is not nearly as busy as they make it out to be).The hike itself was good, however, food seemed to be an issue.  The food was excellent but the portions were tiny.  For instance, our first lunch we were served an avocado salad, with one avocado split between 4 of us; delicious, but more of a taste test rather than an actual meal.  Nearly every meal was tiny with more white rice than protein, which was difficult because some of the hiking days left us with a huge appetite.  The guide was good, her knowledge of Incan civilization was impressive but her English skills weren't great.  Instead of telling us when she didn't understand our questions, she would fake it and give us the wrong answer until we clarified with our traveler Spanish.  They said on the website that tips for the cook and the porter weren't included in the price, nor were they obligatory, but, of course, they were obligatory in the end.  The trek itself was awesome.  It was a hefty four-day hike that has you entering Machu Picchu on a great endorphin buzz.  There are some parts of the he that test you physical capacity, if you don't like to feeling the blood pumping through your veins, its probably not the best option.  But if you enjoy a good workout, then this is as good as it gets.The last day coming home was very disorganized.  i didn't end up taking the bus from Machu Picchu to Aguas Callientes thus negating one of the extras included in the Classic Inca Trail package.  There was a nice hike down to Aguas Callientes and I took that instead.  The train from Aguas Callientes to the town where you catch the bus was great.  They (Tierras Vivas) splurged on this one and it was well worth it.  But the arrival in the bus station was chaotic.  Someone was there to pick me up, but they had also tried to stuff the bus with anyone they could find that would pay a fare.  The others on the bus had been waiting for an hour in the parking lot and were livid.  The bus was over crowded and the atmosphere was tense, but I was so tired i didn't care.  However, the finally was that they didn't drop me off at my hotel, but at San Francisco Square and I had to walk about 30 mins to my hotel (duffel bag and all).  They never called or asked about their equipment (the sleeping bag, the ""blanket"", the pillow, etc.) and I left it in the lobby of my hotel and sent them a note on their website.All in all, the trip was a fantastic and unforgettable experience, i'd do it again in a heartbeat, maybe along a different trail though, just for variety.  But I don't think I would book through Tierras Vivas.  They seemed sloppy, disorganized and cheap.  I don't think their staff is treated that well, and they seemed to charge for things that weren't worth what they were charging for it.  If you did the Cheap Inca Trail, it might be a little better, but if you really want to book ahead, maybe some of the more expensive options are better.  Certainly, on the trail, they looked more organized and ethical.  Or, if you want to go cheap, it might be better to wait until you get to Cusco and shop around (although I'm not sure how good this would be during peak season, but down season, it's definitely doable)."
A life changing experience ,"It's not for everyone. It's a challenging 4-day trek that requires sheer will power, determination, a decent stamina and a genuine appreciation of nature to really enjoy this. We went during the low season when it was summer in Peru and the rainy season. So that meant most days it was raining, the trail is slippery, and the temperature really dips at night so it's cold! We were so lucky to have Wayki Trek (locally-owned Peruvian company) who took care of us so well. They cooked amazing food throughout the 4-day trail, had wonderful porters who carried our belongings and set up tents for us every night at base camp, and we were led by a wonderful guide, Miguel. I was the slowest in the group (4 of us altogether, so it's a lean team), and am so thankful Miguel was patient with me as I struggled with altitude sickness for half of the trek to Machu Picchu. He waited for me in the heavy rain and never let me trek alone, always keeping an eye on me to make sure I wasn't left behind without help. He also had good local knowledge of the history of the Incas and was very experienced - so that gave our group a lot of comfort knowing we are in safe hands.Trekking through the cloud forest was a real treat! Orchids and flowers blooming everywhere, multi-coloured moss covered rocks and trees, mist-covered mountain tops and gorgeous birds. I would recommend this trek to anyone who would like to see a different side of Peru - apart from just the famous Machu Picchu. Only by taking on the trek can you fully appreciate the Inca history, the level of detail that civilisation had invested into their structures, and the natural flora and fauna of the mountainside. Try it, and be open-minded about the experience. But if you are not prepared to tough it out (Day 2 is hell on earth), then don't do it, and take the train up."
Amazing experience ,"I did the 4D/3N inca trail tour and had such a great time. The walk itself is quite challenging at times but so worthwhile. Amazing sites along the way to Machu Picchu and it's truly humbling to see what the Incas achieved. Anyone with a good level of fitness is able to do this although be prepared for any kind of weather. We were lucky and it hardly rained but I imagine that if it did, the trail would be much more difficult. You definitely need good quality hiking boots. My partner and I didn't take the altitude tablets but were the only ones on the tour that didn't. If you take the tablets, just be aware of the side effects. We did the tour with Alpaca expeditions and they are great. I highly recommend them and they organise everything. Food, guide, porters and experience was top class."
Extraordinary experience ,"The 6-8 hour walk from Km 104 to Machu Picchu was the highlight of a already fantastic trip. The views, the experience,and  the other ruins along the way, are more than worth the walk, but the arrival at the ""gate of the sun"" and to take in Machu Picchu from there for the first time is literally breathing. Don't forget a raincoat."
BEWARE OF G ADVENTURES,"We recently booked a trip to Machu Picchu, scheduled to leave in June.  We've had nothing but problems.  First I indicated that we needed to update our passports prior to G Adventures securing our trekking permits.  They indicated that as long as they had the passports prior to mid-to-end of January, everything would be fine.  Then, out of the blue, I received an urgent email from them in mid-December telling me they required passport numbers that week.  Then I told them that we wanted to fly in a day early to acclimate, and they told us that they would extend the hotel for us at the same hotel that we would be staying in during the tour.  In late December they contacted us to say that they had secured the hotel but they couldn't book the extra night.  After heated arguments with them, they were suddenly able to secure the hotel. Finally, a few weeks after we booked, they lowered their price for the trip and refused to honour the new price.  We have strong regrets about booking with this company and would strongly recommend that you consider other organizations."
amazing,you have to do the inca trail it is another thing it is going to be very very hard but you are gonna feel very good with yourself.
Magnificent Machu Picchu!,"We spent a week in Peru touring all the magnificent cites, colors, and cuisine.  Our guide Gonzalo Lima was absolutely AWESOME!!!  There were 8 of us including one 8 year old and he was able to keep us all energized, excited, safe and amazed at the wonders of Peru.  We booked him with Adventure Travel.  Would highly recommend him!!!!"
October Trip - 4 day Inca Hike with Peru Treks,"As others have wrote, there are many tour companies to choose from. We (m28/f27) went with Peru Treks, which we booked 8 months in advance. I'll try not to repeat what others have mentioned, but overall the company did a fantastic job. Highly recommend!Here are a few tips...1) Pack LIGHT! Hire a 1/2 porter to carry your sleeping bag/pad. Everything else should easily fit into a 35-40L backpack. We had SEVERAL fellow hikers who had to hire porters after the 1st day. Also, if it rains heavily and you don't have proper coverage, your sleeping bag will get WET. 2) You don't need water filter/purification tablets. Locals sell water/sports drinks throughout the hike (except the last day). So bring cash and pay for H2O as you hike. I recommend a water bladder to keep hydrated.3) Must have items...Pancho AND backpack cover, Flip-flops for campsite, body/face wipes, flash light, Sunscreen, Hat/bandana, elevation sickness medicine, Hiking poles, Bug spray (spray heavy if not wearing pants!), winter hat/gloves, a good camera. 4) Stay a night in Aguas Calientes after the hike. This will allow you to take your time at Machu Picchu and have a great relaxing dinner. When we arrived in MP, there was fog/cloud cover. With the extra time, we were able to wait until it cleared and took our amazing pictures. I wouldn't recommend hiking Huayna Picchu, as the Inca trail takes a LOT out of you.Overall, the Inca trail is a trip of a life time. It's not easy, and the high elevation makes it 10X more difficult. The feeling of accomplishment is amazing, and something that you'll never forget!"
"Vaya Adventures - 4 Day Classic Inca Trail to Machu Picchu, Cusco, Sacred Valley and Lima","My wife and I decided to take our 16 year old and 13 year old to Machu Picchu MP).  While researching MP I discovered the Inca Trail. I did not feel comfortable planning my own trip so I outsourced the details to Vaya Adventures.  They planned an incredible trip.  I will try to provide the details in a concise manner.Lima - The trip starts and ends in Lima because you can't fly direct to Cusco.  Most tours use Lima as a short stop.  You can either spend the night in Lima or hang at the airport and connect to Cusco.  Since our flight landed at 1:00 AM we spent a day in Lima to recoup.  At night Vaya booked us a culinary tour that was awesome.  We visited 4 restaurants in different parts of the city having drinks, appetizers, main courses and desserts.  Our favorite was Amaz which was amazing.  We stayed at the Casa Adina which was in Mira Flores.  It was nice, staff was great and the food was as well but we would have rather been near the ocean as there is a nice path that is along the Pacific while there is little within walking distance to the Casa Adina.Sacred Valley - We stayed for two nights at the Sol y Luna which feels like a spa resort.  The rooms are individual cabanas.  Food and service are great and the views spectacular.  It is imperative that you acclimate to the altitude so the two days were perfect.  On the second day we went on a mountain biking tour that included lunch.  Not a box lunch but fine dining in a tent - it was one of our best meals for the trip.Inca Trail - Do not underestimate how difficult this trek is.  For our family of 4 we had a guide, 8 portors, a chef and assistant chef and it was still brutal.  Unlike other tours our lasted a full 4 days and arrived at Machu Picchu at 2:00 pm on the fourth day.  This is critical as it gave us an additional day to acclimate and we didn't wake up at 3:30 am on day 4 to race to the Sun Gate in the dark.  Of course it meant a night in town as we toured Machu Picchu the following day.  The trade off is a bit easier trek but it will cost you a hotel room.  Vaya also has private camp grounds which make the camping easier.  Also since few tours are on the same 4 day schedule as Vaya, we only say ONE OTHER tourist over four days.  We had the trail to ourselves.  It was incredible.  Food was great, the guide unbelievably knowledgeable and experienced.  While nothing can make the Inca Trail easy, Vaya made it as achievable as possible.  Note the trip was during the rainy season but we were lucky as it didn't rain until we arrived in Machu Picchu.Machu Picchu - For our one night we stayed in the Sumaq Hotel which was awesome.  Luxury all the way.  Our only regret was that we only stayed in the hotel 14 hours.  As for Machu Picchu if you arrive or leave at the wrong time the bus lines are horrible.  My son and I trekked to town at porter speed and it took an hour.  My wife and other son took the bus and arrived a half hour later.Cusco - Vaya booked us in the Palacio del Inca which is stunning and even more luxurious than the Sumaq.  It is a great location as well.Vaya takes care of every detail.  There are guides and hosts meeting you at every location.  No detail is overlooked.  Due to a heart condition I am a vegan and somehow every restaurant knows and the Inca Trail chef prepared incredible meals just for me while my family continued to enjoy meat and dairy."
great experience if you book with a proper tour company,"The Inca Trail itself is incredible - stunning views all day long, loads of birds and plants. It is challenging if you are not fit or not used to high altitude. Some people from my group resigned after the first day which is the easiest one. Second day is very challenging for people with no climbing or mountain experience because it is all the way up to the Dead Woman's Pass. But it is so worth it! Remember to chew some coca leaves or just some sweets as glucose is needed! Take it slowly at your own pace - it is not a race!We booked with G Adventures and it was great and well organised. Our tour guide was Gerson - an amazing person with real knowledge of the region (born and raised in Cusco). Our porters were not carrying more than the allowed allowance and please make sure that is the case when you book your tour. They are very poor and humble people so respect them and treat them fair. Remember to tip them at the end of the tour as well as they work their socks off so when you reach each camp site everything is waiting for you! Our chef even baked a cake for us to celebrate the completion of the trail. Visited in August - chilly at night so bring your 4 season sleeping bag wth you as the one they rent in Cusco to all tour operators are as thin as paper. Also pay extra for a inflatable mattress - you will not regret it!"
Good trek!,"Well worth doing if you are fit and able. The whole thing isn't too strenuous but the mixture of altitude, camping and back to back early mornings can take it out of people. We stayed in Quito for a few days a week before which I think helped with acclimatising. We did the trek with G Adventures which was very good. Only had an OK guide but the chefs, porters and everything else were fantastic. In saying that it is hard to tell if there is much difference between each company as we all pretty much did the same thing.Definitely worth doing the trek and finishing at Machu Picchu to get more of an appreciation rather than just going there."
Outstanding trek with a great Operator,"We are not avid trekkers but this was the best outdoors experience of our lives. We booked our trek through Uncover Latin America, and they were unreal. We had our trek organized by Chris in the office, very easy to talk to and well organized. Our guide Natalia was great, had a gregarious nature and made sure the group was all having a fantastic time. Food great and the trek incredible. Hire some walking sticks, they are an essential item, your walking on uneven stone paths and an extra support of a hiking stick will come in handy. Bring enough water to get you through until lunch time on the first day. A 1.5 litre will be enough. From then on at each meal break the cooks will fill up your water bottles with boiled water. Water and drinks are sold along the way also at various points. Carry plenty of soles with you to buy drinks and odd bits along the way. You will need to pay a tip on the last evening to the guides and porters. Bring suncreen, mozzie spray, toilet paper and baby wipes (very handy). We hired a toilet tent, glad we did the public toilets are not great. Had lunch at the Sanctuary lodge on the last day at Machu Picchu arranged by Uncover Latin America, nice touch to finish off an awesome trekking experience."
Stunning,Be prepared!!!!! BE PREPARED!!! The amount of people who hadn't trained or prepared themselves for some work was disappointing. The hike is stunning and really makes you appreciate the effort the Incas went too.
Fund raiser,"Didn't think I'd make it, wanted to leave after climbing dead man's pass as I was exhausted (should have trained a little), pleased I didn't! !! Views are amazing lots of things to discover along the way. Once in a lifetime experience. Only bad bit was having a stomach bug go through the group - not good when out on a hike in the middle of nowhere thankfully only lasted about 24hrs.  Recommend looking up at the stars - it's a must! Seeing the milky way will stay with me forever!!!!!"
Mother-Daughter Epic Adventure,"I wanted to take my adult daughter on a trip that she wouldn't do on her own and that would be a bonding experience for us. This absolutely fit the bill. The 4-day Inca Trail hike to Machu Picchu was challenging, interesting and different than anything we had done before. We met other people on the trek and had a wonderful time partially because our tour company, Peru Treks, was so great. The meals were impressive, tents set up for us each night and the guides were informative and attentive. An epic trip we would recommend to anyone with some physical abilities and an adventurous spirit!"
5 days to get your imagination to appreciate what they did,If you are physically able this is the only way to truly appeciate Machu Picchu.  Otherwise it is an oversubscibed visual event.  The trek lets you see significant ruins on your own and walk in the footsteps of the Incas
A must do walk at altitude (take it easy),A walk through the valleys and the mountain tops. Just need to be of average fitness but you must be prepared to manage the altitude. We found spending 2 days in Cusco well worth is to get use to the high altitude. Symptoms we experienced were headaches so we just took it slowly. Don't push yourself too hard and drinking lots of water seemed to work for us. Be prepared to tip the porters at least 100 Sols each. The guides make it clear that this is the done thing and set you up to do this on the last night.Best thing: the 4200m climbWorst thing: the toilets (but they are beginning to upgrade these)
Meh,"I travelled with a friend on a four day trek with Inca Time Tours and had a mixed experience.The first day was a bus ride for a few hours from Cusco, then mountain bike down a mountain. The guide didn't introduce himself until several hours later when we arrived at the top of the mountain and everyone was wondering what was going on by this stage. The ""lunch"" was at 4pm so don't expect to have lunch that day unless you want to buy something at the dodgy road house on the way. It was pouring rain and freezing on the bike ride - icicles on our fingers, hiking boots filled with water, little visibility making it very dangerous - so most of us ditched the bikes within half an hour.Then we had whitewater rafting what was great - the guides were super excited and funny, making for a really cool experience, not to mention a great way to see the jungle.The hostel we stayed at that night was horrid. When we arrived they had definitely been blazing up and stinking the restaurant out. The room walls were paper thin, the roof was just shade cloth and a couple of the younger people were pretty inconsiderate with noise. The next day was hard but I wouldn't have missed it for the world. We trekked through the jungle and stopped at some beautiful little huts along the way. Our guide sat us down at a particularly nice one to show and tell us all about Peruvian culture - the food, the drink, the cocoa leaves - there was a monkey and a macaw that lived there we got to interact with too.We finished the day with the hot springs which was good but the mozzies were hectic.The third day was zip lining which was the highlight of the trek for me - high and open and scary as hell, but I loved every second of it!The final day was of course the summit up the big MC (we chose to do WP as well). The walk is hard, you must start as early as possible to avoid the masses of people that arrive about 9am, but it's a good thing to see. I was very disappointed in the amount of ppl they let through the gates on a daily basis. The place is eroding (as our guide explained) and one of the worst things for that is ppl touching the rocks, but let's not allow some stupid rock to get in the way of another outstanding duck face selfie, right?Also our guide ditched us the previous day and didn't even summit with us, just palmed us off to another guide at the top of the mountain who wasn't that inspiring with his talk.The best part of this day was climbing WP - do it or don't bother going! It's beautiful up there.So all in all, the accom and food were bearable, the guide was meh, the amount of tourists allowed on MP thanks to the train line and bus is atrocious but most of what you actually do along the way is fantastic."
Inca Trail with Uncover Latin America,"The best travel experiences are always the ones that end up being far better than you anticipate. We had a wonderful experience. We booked through Uncover Latin America, who were brilliant. Our first contact was with Chris who was really pleasant and helpful when it came to booking our trek. Our guide Natalia was absolutely brilliant, with years of experience and professionalism, she kept our group of 8 really happy and entertained. We got huge meal servings and the food was really delicious. Had some great soups, pancakes, pastas, lots of proteins. At the end of our hike we were treated to a delicious buffet lunch at the Sanctuary Lodge located at Machu Picchu. For all those tempted about doing the Inca Trail, I say do yourself a favor and do it! We had the most amazing adventure trekking through the heavenly Andes, coming across Inca Ruins and being rewarded for our efforts with Machu Picchu at the end which was beyond incredible. If you are wanting to book with a good reliable company than we highly recommend Uncover Latin America."
Peru Treks,"If you're thinking of hiking the Inca Trail, I highly recommend doing it. I would also highly recommend the company we went with, Peru Treks.Peru Treks allows groups of up to 16 people (ours was 12). There are more porters than trekkers (we had 18), two guides (Manny and Jimmy were the BEST), and an incredible chef (Benedicto).From the start of the hike, I knew that we had made the right decision with this company. They allow you to hike at your own pace, and have a guide at the front of the group and one at the back. The group reconvenes at various points along the trail for a snack, so we never were left behind.As for the meals, you get lunch on days 1, 2 and 3, dinner on days 1, 2, and 3, and breakfast on days 2, 3, and 4. The meals were INCREDIBLE. Every meal was a 4 course meal, starting with a little appetizer (salad, empenadas...), then a soup (mushroom soup, egg drop soup, chicken soup), and then the main course which consisted of a protein (usually chicken, although there was also fish and steak), and various sides including rice and veggies. Its incredible how they can cook this food at the top of a mountain. One day we had a cake! The chef literally baked a cake at 12,000 ft in the air.The company provides tents for you to sleep in, two people to a four person tent. We rented sleeping bags, and they provided a light mat to put underneath. We hired a half porter for myself, and he was able to carry up to 6kg of my things, including the sleeping bag and mat. The hike, while hard, is not impossible. We took our time to get to the various pit stops, taking in the amazing scenery and our surroundings. Day 2 is definitely the hardest day, but if you take it slow, you can definitely do it.I would recommend this trip to anyone who is considering doing it. The trek itself was actually better than Machu Picchu.  I have never before felt so accomplished, and this trip changed my life."
Train with a stair master before you go!,"The scenery was beautiful, our guide was fantastic, the meals were delicious! But do not underestimate the difficulty of the Inca Trail! The porters make it look so easy to run around on the trail (one of them even has a tshirt that said ""I make this look easy""), it's not! While I am the first to admit, i'm not in great shape, you will definitely want to train with a stair master before you do this hike. The Incas loved their stairs! I did the 4 day trek from 82km. Day 2 is definitely the hardest! 75% of the day is all uphill, with the last 25% going down from the pass to base camp. You will definitely want to bring rain gear as well. It didn't rain a lot while we were on the trail, but we did get some precipitation (a shower or two and hail). Poles were an incredible help as well! Between helping lift yourself up the hundreds of stairs, and helping keep you from slipping on wet rocks when you're going down, you'll be glad you have them! Also sunblock! Bring it and put it on multiple times a day! Trust me on that!  If you're new to hiking though, don't start with this trail. It is the most challenging thing I've ever done, and when I got to Machu Pichu, I was underwhelmed because i was so exhausted."
Harder than I thought it would be.,What a hike! Did not expect to climb over TWO passes in one day!  Felt great to finish it. Would I do it again? No!
Fantastic,"My wife and I just finished the 5 day Inca Trail and it was wonderful! Hardly any people and beautiful scenery. Special thanks to our team and Equatours, who organised everything for us."
Would I do it again - no (Inka Trail with Peru treks),"Booked my inka Trail with Peru Treks almost 9 month before I started it. Communication with the office has always been great. People their are very helpful and friendly. The trip:To be honest I expected a lot from it. Starting with seeing a lot of beautiful inka ruins to enjoying beautiful landscapes. Reality was very disappointing. First day - still full of joy about what will come. Hiking wasn't bad as all. You got to get known your group and lunch was quite nice as well. And really impressed about the porters carrying a weight of 30 kg and still running up those mountains. Second day - up to the summit it went. It was a struggle. Even without altitude sickness and a good health & fitness, it took a long time to get up their. You didn't have time or patient to enjoy the environment as you wanted to reach the summit. No matter what it takes. As soon as you reach it - it goes downhill for three hours. Really downhill. My calves were still burning days after I finished the trip. Third day - similar to second day - climbing up and down again Fourth day - getting up at 3.30 am cause porters have to catch their train at 5 something. We had a  quick breakfast than headed down to the gate of the national park which opens at 5am. As the gate is only 5 mins walk away, we waited for almost 1 hour for it to open. Than the chase started. It was really a run to the sun gate of Machu Picchu. You weren't allowed to stop on the way - if you did the tourguide told you to stop and head forward. At that point I could halfway understand it cause you wanted to be early at Machu Picchu before all the other tourists arrive. BUT when we arrived at the sun gate - we stayed there for almost half an hour. Taking group pictures etc. who cares about group pictures when you are above Machu Picchu and already see the tourist bus arriving and the place you wanna be is filling up, while you are not allowed to head down. When we finally did; already at least 20 buses had arrived. AND THAN we forced again to stop to take AGAIN group pictures. When you think that we than finally could see Machu Picchu - so wrong. We had to leave it completely to pick up our tickets and than re-enter again. Even than you still weren't able to explore it by yourself, cause the tourguide kept your bus ticket. So you had to stay till the end of his tour through Machu Picchu to get your bus ticket and finally you could explore it by yourself. The Information of the tourguide provided was pretty bad compared to the information other guides around us provided. Therefore I preferred to listen to the others. At the end you feel forced to give him a tip as he says goodbye to each one in person. I hated this situation as I wasn't happy with provided service. Why not happy? There are different reasons 1. Traveling as a single woman. I don't like being approached by Tourguides - not at all. Especially when they force you into a hug and everyone sees that you don't like it at all. Or being called an angel what happened to  another woman. There were more incidents like that. It was clear that those guides approach single woman. 2. Not being flexible regarding accessing Machu Picchu. Instead of giving out the bus tickets straight away, they are kept til the end of the guided tour.3. Guides did not stay with the last person in the group. There was one incident i remember. Almost all of us arrived at a meeting point. Both guides were there as well even though 3 people were still hiking up to this point. Imaging having trouble heading up a mountain and you know that everyone is already in front of you. I would freak out. Furthermore some of the campgrounds were pretty nasty. You could smell the toilets ten meters against wind. One group actually was so lucky to camp right next to those toilets.  Spending 700 usd or more for this kind of trip. You could at l least expect them to take care of toilets. It was really disgusting. Some of us preferred to go behind a tree.I wouldn't do this trip again. Go direkt to aqua calientes, stay there overnight and take the first bus to Machu Picchu - you will enjoy it and you will save a lot of money and"
Once in a lifetime,"The whole trail is surrounded by amazing scenery, but it isn't for everybody, be aware that this is a 3 days walk, up and down hill, and it is pretty rough, but any good physical person from all age can do it. Otherwise you have the train, and then some shuttles that bring you to the Machu Picchu. However, if you decide to do the walk, this is a must do at least once in a lifetime."
Inca trail,"This was an amazing trip.  I recommend  this trip to anybody.  Thanks Valencia Travel  to  the guides, cooks, and specially to the amazing potters."
Inca Trail -- The Journey is the Destination,"Do it! I must admit after reading some reviews, I was a bit concerned about just how challenging the trail would be. I'm a 53 year old male in decent condition. I'm not one who works out much, but I have hiked the grand canyon (Havasupai Falls) and some slot canyons in Utah. It's tiring, particularly for someone like me that does not like to do the stairmaster -- but I found it to be but hugely gratifying and am thrilled that I did this trip (I liked this every bit as much as the Galapagos -- btw, you should do that too). The second day, someone in our group was wearing a fitness watch and said we did 38,000 steps (not sure how many uphill, but the 2nd day is the hard day -- you'll climb to just about 14,000 feet). Slow and steady -- get your trudge on.Machu Picchu has been on my bucket list for a long time. But that was a mistake. This is all about the trail and the amazing things you'll see as you hike. I was not very knowledgeable about the Inka history before I left -- I really loved learning it as we hiked. Inka ruins are everywhere; on the trail, you will have the joy of exploring them in pure isolation with your guide and perhaps 10-20 new friends in your group. After 4 days of this magic, seeing thousands of people atop Machu Picchu is disheartening. Had I flown in and taken a train to view Machu Picchu w/o the trail, I would have been incredibly disappointed. Cool to see the site, but it feels more like an epcot exhibit to me now. On the plus side -- GREAT toilets and a cool little refreshment bar area that overlooks the mountains (you appreciate different things after you hike for 4 days ... )Before I forget: Do yourself a favor, hire a porter to carry most of your stuff so you can enjoy the hike with a day pack. Weeks before the hike, my friends mocked me for not carrying all my things. That transitioned into being a genius as we completed the first day (and they all chose to hire a porter at the last second so they too could lighten the load).The hike takes you through a variety of terrains, including a lush jungle, which was my favorite part. The mountains, waterfalls and ruins ares simply majestic. The distance is light, but the steep elevation more than makes up for it. It is LOVELY hiking with a great tour company (we used Valencia; more on them later -- they were fantastic!). They take care of tent set-up, etc and provide terrific meals and rest breaks along the way. The guides are superb and the porters are superhuman (they carry 50lbs on their backs and do the trail 10x our speed -- literally running most sections).BTW, if you are still on the fence, I'll share one more fact that should make you realize you can do this. The world record for completing the trail is something like 3 hours and 45 minutes. Yes, what took me just under 4 days to complete, a super human ran in under 4 hours.Tips: Bring extra cash. Make sure you reward the guides and porters well. They make this trip hum and you should thank them generously in cash for that. Don't be overly cheap as you prepare for this trip. Get extra light gear to make the trip more fun (my last 2nd purchase of a fleece and rain cover were expensive but perfect!). Make sure your boots, sock liners and socks are high quality; I completed this trek without a single blister -- I used tape to prep my hot spots, and that was also a good idea. Don't sweat the toilets in the ground. You'll soon be impressed with your squatting ability and will never ever feel badly about using a public toilet again.So, two big thumbs up from me. This is totally about the journey and the hike itself. I loved it!!"
Not far off the main area,"If you made it this far, you need to go all the way to the Inca Trail and bridge.  how they carved a trail off the side of the cliff is a wonder in itself.  A visit well worth your time."
Only walked a short portion of the trail...,but it was incredible ... spiritual and magical all at the same time.  Incredible history and the engineering is awesome.
DO IT!,"If you thought about doing it, go for it. Not all tour companies are the same. We went with Intrepid (who hired Peak, porters wearing grey) and they hiked the perfect distance each day. I was so worried about my fitness but we didn't need to. Much easier than I thought.- take altitude medication if doing the hike. - drink lots of water. You experience so much more than just Machu Picchu. Do your research, know what to take. Make sure you have a porter carrying your stuff, so much more enjoyable."
Accomplishment of a Lifetime,"Not your typical walk in the park.  Be prepared for uneven terrain, lots of steps and fantastic vistas.  The view from Sun Gate is one you will always remember."
A Long Time Wish,"I finally carried out a long time wish and visited the Ancient site of Machu Picchu and can honestly say it was worth the time, travel and money.  It is amazing how they built this site and the craftsmanship is first class.  We went from the UK with everything organized by Lama Travel and they provided all the tickets, guides etc. and we could not fault them.   Everything went as planned and they gave you ample time to visit other sites and historic buildings either on your own or on an organised trip.  All planes on time half way around the world until we arrived back at Heathrow and BA had overbooked our flight back to Edinburgh and let the trip down."
Absolutely awesome experience,"We booked it in May to do it on October 22 with Incatrekkers (great company). It was sometimes hard but definately a very rewarding trek. You come across some amazing views and ruins to finally end up at the wonderful Machu Picchu! The second day of the trek is the hardest with a long climb (including 1 break) to Dead Woman's Pass. For people with weak knees, make sure that you have some kind of support (brace, walking sticks, etc.) because after 4 days climbing up and down stairs will make sure that you feel them. We had only 1 afternoon of rain, but it was really heavy rain and hail. So make sure to bring an extra pair of pants and towel and if you have room for it an extra pair of shoes. Our solution to the soaking wet hiking boots was to put plastic bags over our socks, which did the trick quite well! But rain or shine, the trek itself is worth every single coin! Just make sure you book it with a company that you are comfortable with. Some bigger companies have big groups of 12-15 people which may not be your thing, so figuring out what the company offers and where the money goes to may be worth looking into to. I recommend Incatrekkers if you prefer small groups and very good service!"
Awesome trail!,We decided to do the 2 days and 1 night hike. It was a great experience because you get to appreciate the rain forest. Just be prepared and bring rain jackets and pants as it can rain and also be prepared to walk in the heat.
Outstanding Trek with Uncover Latin America,"It´s the best trek I have ever done, I am from Denver so we do alot of trekking. Think Lord of the Rings mixed with Indiana Jones, amazing scenery and archeological adventure. We were recommended Uncover Latin America through my work friend who sang them praises, and we would quickly like to do the same. Chris who organized our trip was great, there were limited spaces at the time we booked but he made sure he got things done swiftly and got our spaces, explained everything very transparently. Our guide Hector was amazing with over 15 years experience, he managed our group exceptionally well and everyone had a fun time. Food was way beyond what we were expecting, and we enjoyed a delicious buffet lunch at the Sanctuary Lodge after our visit to Machu Picchu. The trek was just the right challenge and thorough rewarding. Dead Woman´s pass on Day 2 was a challenge, pack some Snicker´s, Gummy Bears, Gatorades and chocolates to help give you the extra energy you need on this day. We had 2 days in Cusco to acclimatize before starting the trek. Book the trek at least 4 months in advance, despite doing this it was a real last minute rush to get our spaces."
A must do,A must do experience for everyone. One of those things everyone should experience at least once in their lives!
Amazing experience - book with Peru Treks,"The Inca Trail and Machu Picchu is an amazing experience. I don't need to go into details, all I need to say is that it lives up to the hype. I would highly recommend Peru Treks. These guys are real pros. Anthony was an incredibly knowledgable, fun and interesting guide, ably supported by Pedro. The food was impressive (including for all kinds of dietary requirements) and the whole porter team were amazing (watching a guy sprint past you with a full gas canister on his back is something else as you pant up the trail)."
Hiking high!,"Do it! It is an easy four day hike, could be tough for some ( like my husband) who suffer from altitude sickness. It's really important to acclimatise, drink the tea they offer in the hotels. take a couple of days to get your 'sea legs' an you will be fine. There's a great Irish Pub in Cusco, lots of atmosphere, good beer and English food( better than you think). We hired a guide who took on all the planning for us. He put his team together; cook and four porters. They were the stars of the whole trip! They wre ahead of us every day, set up camp for lunch. Hot water with soap, a three course lunch freshly cooked, and they applauded us as we puffed our way into camp! THEY had run up the trail carrying everything! Tents, chairs, tables, even a calor gas bottle and a pressure cooker! They worked so hard to make our experience the best they could. I applaud them all! This was not summing it, this was 'Glamping' and then some!My husband had difficulty with the altitude, Ro ( our guide)stayed with him all the time. When my children and I got to one of the camps  They were nowhere to be seen. One of the men made a sandwich and walked back along the trail to find John and Ro. It was our last evening before the Sungate, John was totally wiped out. We had to get up at 5 a.m. to get to the door with our passports : allowing us to continue to Machu Picchu and the wonderful entrance through the Sungate! Our wonderful porters packed up the camp and ran down through the trees to take the train back and start the trail AGAIN! Amazing people!Machu Picchu speaks for itself, I am not gong to tell anyone what it is like, you have to experience it for yourselves. Doing this hike will give you a unique opportunity to exactly that.Do it!"
"Anyone can climb a mountain, one step at a time.","Let's be clear.  I'm not the typical 'cross-fit, stair-master, run 12 km for fun' type of trekker that you see up on the trail.  In fact, when I showed up in the parking lot the porters were makin' bets to see if I'd make it past the first 15 minutes.  I'm over 300 lbs and 46 years old, but, I am strong, and determined, and I was doing a 17 km hike at home, numerous times, getting myself prepped for the trail -- and I was doing stairs at home.  Up and down, up and down.  So, I didn't head to Peru without conditioning the ol' muscles...but, on the bus ride to km 82, I was worried.  I love looking back on adventures...especially when I think about how much I worried about this trek.  In all honesty, I believe it is a trek within most people's abilities. My Peruvian guide told me that the thing that was most harmful on the trail was 'irritability' - and he was right.  I saw irritability take down the fittest folk.  That...and altitude. So - here's my take on it.  I did the 4 day tour.  Day one was easy-peasy.  In fact, my guide was chatting to our group about some plant on the trail and then when we stood up to continue, he said, 'this is camp.'  And I was like, 'CAMP?  Are we are camp?!'  HAHAHAA -- I had made day one and I was prepared to keep going.  Day one is undulating. Up, down - but mostly gradual - only 9 km. Day 2 is a butt-kicker.  Dead Woman's Pass is waaaaaaaaay over there and you keep hiking and wondering why it's not getting any closer. I never had any muscle fatigue, but it is up, constantly. It is incline all-the-way. The air does get thinner, it does get harder to breathe, and everyone is in the same boat.  But it was doable.  One step at a time. Saw the irritability set in with some people - and I think it was because they did not compensate for the altitude. If you slow down, have a look around, talk to fellow trekkers, take some photos, have a lolli, and then continue, it's awesome. But, people try to move at the same pace that they move at home.  The summit is a great feeling :-) . Celebrate because the lee side of the pass is kinda torturous.  It's straight down.  I thought it would be awesome - cuz down uses less cardio.  But, I gotta tell ya - some of those steps were as high as my knee and I'm 6 feet tall.  Everyone, even the super-hike-the-world trekkers busted out the hiking poles on this side. It's hours of straight down - on rocks.  And if those rocks are wet, it's a tad ankle-breaking.  So - instead of freaking about about Dead Woman's Pass - I think ya'll should work on your 'down' muscles.  We ALL agreed in the dining tent that night that we looooooooooved UP, but down was harsh man.  (But still incredibly awesome!)Day three is 16 km - longest day.  Beautiful day.  All rocks paths so watch your footing.  Lotsa stopping and going, 'holy mother of god I'm hiking through a freakin' cloud forest in the Andes on freakin' rocks put here by freakin' INCAS!'  Lotsa fun.  Two summits to go over, not as high in altitude, but lotsa 'up'.  Day four is short and sweet because you get to Machu Picchu that day.  And it came quick - I was pausing at the bottom of a hill and there was a stone structure at the top of it, my guide came around the corner and said, 'That's the sungate up there.""  I  said, ""HUH? The sungate - you mean, I made it!?""  And you know, I actually didn't want it to end.  I was loving it so much.  It is beautiful and awe-inspiring, I was a little melancholy knowing that I wasn't going to wake up tomorrow to ramble through the Andes.The Inca Trail has to be done with a good attitude.  If you don't want to do it, or if hiking isn't your thing, don't do it.  If you get cranky easily if things don't go your way, like rain - or loss of appetite (common at altitude), or cold nights, or snoring porters, or 'exhausting inclines', then this is probably not the trail for you.  It's hard, but it's doable.  At the end of the trail the guides and fellow hikers said, 'we never saw you without a smile on your face'. Because it is a privileged to be there and accomplish this hike. Some didn't finish - some got altitude sickness - one woman I saw had to be carried by porters.  The first day you see people turn around.  But honestly - I had made this harder in my head then it was. I never took any altitude medication because everyone seems to get sick from it - I just drank buckets of water. I drank about 5-6 liters a day. I had read that water was the best way to ensure you don't get altitude sickness and I think that's true.  I did the same in Tibet and never had a problem there.I took it at my own pace, I was consistent, I set goals like getting to the next tree or rock, I never rested for more than 30 seconds...and I made it to camp every day before the sun went down.  I did a Peru and Bolivia combo trip and those 4 days were not just the highlight of the trip for me, but seriously one of the highlights for my life. Big girls can hike the Inca Trail.  But, your legs better be in good form and your lungs should be healthy. I went by myself as a solo traveller with Intrepid Tours. Our guide was great - the porters are treated fairly and given proper boots and clothing, the food was fantastic and I felt well supported the whole time. Loved it!As a tip - take less clothes.  You're not going to be changing outfits - and you'll probably sleep in what your wearing.  Underwear, socks and maybe a t-shirt change because you'll sweat.  For perspective, the guide and the porters wear the same stuff everyday.  I had two shirts with me that never got worn. You'll probably not need to take snacks cuz our cook fed us tons of food and we had snacks given to us also.  But, you may want candy with you - sugar is good for the trail. My life was all about water, hiking poles and coca candies.  HA!"
2d/1n,We booked with Alpaca expeditions for the 2d/1n trek. We had only a part of one day on the Inca trail but it was fantastic. We visited in late August- the weather was beautiful - no rain. The views along the way were amazing. We visited Winay Wayna and got our first glimpse of Machu Picchu from the Sun Gate. The hike was a little challenging but doable and well worth the effort!
Unforgettable ,One of the most physically demanding things I have done but absolutely with it.  Breathtaking scenery to accompany a great achievement in completing the trail. We travelled with Intrepid and cannot speak highly enough of the guides and the amazing team of porters and cooks that ensured our experience was as amazing as it could possibly be.
REI strikes INCAN Gold!,"We selected REI for our Trek based upon reviews and reputation.  This trip and REI lived up to all expectations!!!1. Our tour guide, MARCO, was outstanding!  His knowledge and passion for his heritage and culture was amazing.  He also had tons of knowledge about plants, birds, and wildlife.  He was so compassionate when hikers were struggling or sick .  2. Meals and lodging were all good to great.  Camping locations and equipment were the best on the trail.3. REI itinerary kept us away from the crowds, as much as possible, until we reached MP.  4. Porters were outstanding , we had plenty of snacks, water, and food was PLENTIFUL!  5. TAKE WALKING STICKS/POLES.  Many say these are optional.  Our entire group (4 in their late 20's, 4 in our 50's) thought that they should be required.6.  Be prepared.  We had a couple battle altitude sickness and two of us got 'Pizarro's Revenge'.  Get appropriate meds before you go!7. REI itinerary provides pass to hike Huayna Picchu - this is an AWESOME part of tour.  Only 400 people per day get to climb so having passes pre arranged was GREAT.So many more great things about this trek and REI!!!  Don't want to spoil all of the surprises!"
Perfect way to see Machu Pichu with Adios Adventures,"We opted for the 2 day tour, hiking 12km to Machu Pichu on day one then a proper tour of the site on day two.  The tour was organised by Adios Adventures and it was fantastic.  Everything went like clockwork from the moment they picked us up at our hotel in the Sacred Valley until they dropped us off at our Cusco hotel 2 days later.  Our guide (Hubert) for the two day was amazing; kind, very knowledgeable and fun.We are lucky enough to have seen a lot of the world and this was, unquestionably, one of the best experiences or our lives."
2 Day Inca Trail Trip - 12 km hike,"We did a lot of research to find the right trip/providerSome facts- 2 day tour with overnight stay in Aguas Calientes- Private tour (2 of us) with our own tour guide- 12 km hike of Inca trail with finish at sun gate (Day 1)- exploring Macchu Picchu with guide (Day 2)- 420 USD per person- booked it 3 weeks ahead (there were no permits for the long Inca Trail left)- Tour Operator United Mice12 km Inca TrailIt's a lovely walk and took us around 6 hrs in total including launch, photo sessions etc.We visited the site Winay Wayna before we alles the last kilometers to Macchu Picchu. You have to climb some very steep stairs! The locals call it gringo killer which is very accurate! The trail ends at the sun gate and it's a great feeling to arrive there and finally see Macchu Picchu after the hike!Price420 USD. We were shocked by the prices at the start but once you are at Macchu Picchu and Aguas Calientes you understand. Average hotels are 120 USD, train around 120USD and a return bus ticket up to the site is 24USD. So we started to understand why the tour was so dear. Looking back it was ok.Tour Operator- United MiceVery organized. We got a detailed induction the day before so we knew what to expect. The guide Walter shared a lot of his knowledge with us during the hike and at the Inca sites. The guys even gave us a free lift to the bus station on the day after we had come back from the tour! Great service"
Tips for the Inca Trail,"I’ve compiled a list below of everything that I wish I knew at the start of planning the Inca trail, and things I found really useful, which will hopefully shortcut the time for others researching and answer some of the questions! Tour operatorI went with Alpaca Expeditions and they were great but you can search on TA and find many others with equally good feedback. The most important thing is to book well ahead to get your permit as there are only 500 a day (of which under half that amount is left by the time you factor in guides, porters and cooks). I tried to book in February for May / June and they were sold out as people pre book well ahead before Christmas. In the end I went in September as that avoided the really busy months of July and August, but still had good weather. Alpaca looked after us really well, and the most incredible thing is the food they serve which is simply amazing in terms of taste and variety and you will certainly not go hungry at meal times. Boiled water is provided every morning, lunch and dinner so no need to buy any or use water purification tablets. I also liked them as they kept ahead of the pack by extending day 1 and 2, so we camped a bit further ahead of most other groups and this resulted in seeing very few other groups on the trail, other than Inti Sun Trek and Llama Path as they also seemed to take this approach. Alpaca also provided a toilet tent which provided a degree of cleanliness and certainly better than having to use the trees! ​MOST IMPORTANT  - Journey or Destination?Is the reason for doing the Inca Trail about the grand finale of Machu Picchu? If so book an extra night in Agues Calientes so you have the following day at Machu Picchu. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, it’s highly likely that when you arrive after the Inca trial you really are too tired to fully appreciate it and you’ll be too rushed. You will  probably only arrive into the citadel at Machu Picchu around 08:30 a.m. At this time there are already lots of people. Your guide will let you take some quick snaps and then you need to exit the site and check your backpack (if too large), grab a drink, visit the toilet, get your passport stamped (small stall right next to where you check your back packs), and then your guide will give you your tickets, and only then you enter formally through the turnstiles! This will be about 09:00 – 09:30 as there maybe queues to get in! By 09:30 - 10 the place really fills up from the tourists arriving by train. Your guide will probably give you a tour of the site and then most tour companies will have a group lunch in Agues Calientes before you catch your train at approx. 16:00. In reality you need to leave around 13.30, so you will never have time to do the site justice especially with the crowds (up to 2500 tickets a day). However, if you have an extra night, you then have lots of options. We climbed Huayna Picchu (more on that further down) and afterwards had lunch re-entering at 14:00. By 15:00 most people had left and the site was nice and quiet, so you could get great photos and soak up the atmosphere. This is the Machu Picchu that I remember. I would have felt short changed leaving that day only experiencing it with the hoards! The experience without the people is completely different. You can catch the bus down after 5 P.M. (with no queuing) and have a nice evening in Agues Calientes and an amazing shower J returning fresh into Machu Picchu the next day, clean, watered after a good night’s sleep. It also allows you to catch sunrise too if you catch the 05.30 a.m. bus up, as you arrive too late on the Inca trail to catch it. It also provides a bit of contingency on the weather as our first day was cloudy but the second day was bright sunshine! I can’t recommend this strongly enough.Packing List & WeightPassport (which must be the same as on your booking – they check), daypack, water bottles / camelback for 2 -3L, waterproof hiking shoes / boots (see later), sleeping bag (and liner if hiring one), headlamp, 3-4 t-shirts, 1-2 longs sleeve layers, 2 hiking trousers, undergarments for every day, fleece, warm jacket, comfortable shoes for wearing around camp, rain jacket & trousers, waterproof gloves, sun hat and warm hat, sunglasses, small quick dry towel (as there is an opportunity for a shower on day 3), toiletries including toilet paper, toothbrush, toothpaste, wipes, hand sanitiser, sunblock, mosquito repellent, lip balm, plasters / compede, ibuprofen, medications, ear plugs (a necessity as you will most likely have a snorer), menthol nose cream to clear airways (as altitude tends to bung up your passageways) and finally a camera! As you can see you will need to be prepared for all weather conditions as it will change depending on the time of day and what part of the trail. Day 2 up to Dead Womans pass was the coldest. However, beware of how much this weighs. Although you can choose to have 7Kg porter allowance, 3-4 Kg is taken up by the sleeping bag and air matt (if you rent them), so it’s wise to weigh your kit before going otherwise you will be carrying more in your day pack than you would want! You may need to prioritise!FootwearI pondered over the question of shoes vs boots. Some of the advise included that 1 lb on your feet is equal to 5 lb’s on your back, so the first consideration is to go with the lightest footwear you can get. I went with boots and they gave me good ankle support (especially for downhill) and saved my toes. But they were significantly heavier than my shoes. Others in the group went with shoes and were fine. Perhaps if you are wary of your ankles go with boots but otherwise go with shoes. Also key is breaking in any new footwear, so make sure you have had several days walking so they are comfortable on the hike. The extra walking will also help with preparing for the long days walking that you will do on the trail. The more preparation you do the more likely you will enjoy the whole experience.Altitude SicknessThis is the unknown and can affect anyone, regardless of age or fitness. Even previously being at altitude is no indicator. The best advise is to spend time at altitude before starting. At least 2 -3 days in Cusco will help and there is loads to see and do anyway. Making sure you stay well hydrated is also key. All the tour operators will carry an oxygen cylinder for emergencies. The most likely affects will be lack of appetite, difficulty sleeping and headaches. Once you get through dead womans pass on day 2 that's the highest point, and so any symptoms should ease after that. Just take it at your own pace, breath through your nose (tip from the guide and does work) and drink lots of water and the odd Cocoa tea!  Machu Picchu day & Sungate (Intipunku)On day 4 be warned you will probably have to wake up at 3.30 a.m. and leave camp by 4:00 a.m. However, you then have to wait for up to 1.5 hours to start the final stretch of the hike at the final entrance gate as this does not open until 5:30a.m. once light. The reason for being up so early is to allow the porters to pack up the tents and kit and then do the hike back to the train station to catch the ""locals"" train. From the entrance it takes about 1.5 – 2 hours to the Sungate (Intipunku) and you will have to tackle the “gringo killer section” which comprises a final steep stretch of stairs.  However, by the time of reaching the sungate the sun is already up, so be warned you don’t get to see sunrise over Machu Picchu! Another reason to do an extra night in Agues Calientes! However, seeing sunrise or getting good views from the  sungate is very much at the mercy of the weather. When we arrived at the  Sungate around 7:00 a.m. it was very cloudy and we could just about make out Machu Picchu. Although the cloud cover often clears by later in the day. TippingOur team of porters and chef were simply incredible. When you see how much they carry and that they will pack up camp, pass you enroute and then have everything ready again when you arrive into camp brings it home. On the last night you tip the porters and chef as they leave early the next morning. Your  guide will give you advise on how much to tip, but its then down to you as a group to decide. Our group collectively made sure that each porter got 80 Soles each, and the chef 150 Soles. The guide was then tipped on an individual basis. So make sure you have money on the trail for tips and also buying the odd drink / snack from the locals. Huayna Picchu This is the tall peaked mountain that you will see in the background of all the famous pictures of Machu Picchu. You will need to book your tickets well ahead of time as there are only 400 tickets a day, with 2 timed slots to go up either at 07:00- 08:00 and 10 -11:00. We did the second timed slot and started at 10:50 and were one of the last people to enter (as you need to sign in/out). Only when you get there do you realise how steep it is at around 400 Metres above the Machu Picchu citadel. At first it seemed quite daunting but we saw a lady coming back down slowly who was in her 60's who told us she had taken a couple of hours each way as she had been on the first slot. And that's the key thing, it is possible for all abilities, just do it in your own speed, it may just take you a bit longer, and if so better to book the first slot. There are multiple sections that are very steep and you have to crawl up using hands, using ropes and some sheer drops. You are rewarded when you reach the top as the views are fantastic as you are looking down on Machu Picchu and have panoramic views of the valley. Unless you suffer from vertigo, I'd truly recommend doing this, as when looking back at your photos standing in the classic Machu Picchu view, seeing Huayna Picchu in the background and knowing that you've climbed it always makes me smile! ​ Train backI booked on the standard expedition train at 4.22 back to Ollantaytambo and I was pleasantly surprised that it was very comfortable, even with glass viewing panels in the ceiling allowing nice views. So in my opinion it would not be worth upgrading your ticket which some operators offer. Often in life its how you experience something. Machu Picchu is truly amazing, and going through the 4 days on the Inca trail really makes it that more special. A true wonder of the world. Enjoy!"
A hike to machu picchu,"if you have the time, hiking the inca trail is basically like a long hike in to machu picchu.  if you are on limited time or are already an experienced and seasoned hiker (like us, we live in the mountains, so its not so big a deal), then you can skip the inca trail and get right to the Aguas Caliente instead.  For those who are urbanites, the inca trail is a great way to go."
Doable but dont take lightly and prepare.... then you can enjoy,"Did a week ago and certainly glad I trained for it. The second day is very difficult and you do have to dig deep. The altitude does take affect. Make sure you do the second day especially at your own pace, dont be afraid to lag behind and take appropriate rest breaks. The last 3 hours up to Dead womens pass on 2nd day, it was a matter of 25 steps, stop, rest, 25 steps stop rest but still got into camp an hour ahead of schedule. The rest breaks give yuo chance to appreciate the views anyway. Observations & tipsIn late september it was cold in evenings and u need good cold weather gear but it was not freezing.Have quality light gear such as merino and puffer jacket. The marino wear is light warm , provides a warm mid layer when cold and frankly does not smell as much after multiple uses without washing.  Have a set of thermals for night/eveningsI wore the same pants the whole 4 days and two long sleeve hiking shirts.Its probably better to bring extra underwear so at least they are fresh instead of too many back up hiking clothes. One back up set of hiking clothes in case of rain would be most I would take.U dont get a lot of time in mornings to prep, do as much as possible the night before to reduce mucking around in the morning.U will smell as will every else and get used to wearing clothes beyond the time you normally would ( though remember the spare undies)Normally get a bowl of hot water to wash in the morning but note you dont have a lot of time, normally 1 hour from wake up to leaving, which includes eating breakfast. I would use this water to wash face with a face washer not a full wash down. Get a washer with a cloth hook on it and hang it off you back pack during day to dry off.I used used large body wipes which I used to the clean whole body when I arrived in camp each afternoon. It refreshes you and wipes all the lotion etc off from the hike. You can then get dressed in warmer evening gear and feel a bit cleaner.There are lots of little bugs especially below 3500 meters. I used a sun lotion that has an insect repellant in which worked most of the time and saved time having to rub two lots of lotions over me. When the bugs got thicker I use some higher deet insect lotion. I also had a hat and the hiking shirts with built in insect retardant in which hiking shops now sell, with these 3 things I had minimal problem with bugs. A guy who wore shorts had bites all over his legs, so if wearing shorts or short sleeved tops use plenty of lotion.Luckily it did not rain a lot , but if I trekked again I would take a reasonable quality poncho (not a cheap disposable festival type one) instead of a rain jacket. When your tired its much easier to use. Also it means you dont have to use a rain cover over you pack which can be a pain as it stops all access to you pack and is another thing to do when your tired and in a hurry to cover up from the rain and its a lot easier to take off when the rain stops. I would also pack rain pants (light) for additional cover for extending period of rain. It didnt rain much on my hike but it would be miserable if your gear got wet, due to cold, limited space in tents and very limited chances of drying your gear.I wore goretex trail runners not hiking boots, as I didnt want to wear hiking boots everywhere in the week prior to and post the hike touring around Peru. They were fine, though twisted ankles are common apparantly so be care full and take a conforming bandage regardless of what you wear just in case. For camp wear and also to wear around hotels etc a pair of sketchers are good, as light , easy to pack and easier to dry. Whatever shoes you wear hiking, break in well before going.If porters provided for you gear , the limit generally appears to be 5kg ( about 12 pounds) and they weigh it. So precheck carefully prior to going as last minute rushing will see u probably forget stuff.I used a a camelbak for water, our tour they filled for you each morning with cooler water they boiled the night before. If using bottles consider ones with hooks you can hook onto your backpack.Forget about beauty routines and products, keep it basic as you need to keep weight down and reduce things to do. Face wipes are easy and perhaps a small moisteriser and something for your lipsWith back pack use one with waist support to reduce weight carried on shoulders. Even with the porters carrying stuff you will end up with at least 5 to 7 kg on your back, (water, snacks, rain gear etc) and over 4 days your shoulders will feel it.The toilets are ordinary and the squat type. A small atomiser with eucalyptus oil or similar will void most smell. Squating is not easy if your not used to it, so have your toilet paper and/or wet wipes get ready BEFORE you squat as digging around in packets or unwrapping toilet paper after you have done your business and still squatting is fraught with danger.....Most people phones last the 4 days, on airplane mode, mine didnt, so ensure your phone will last that long or take a spare battery or recharge pack. Switch off all roaming, location search wifi search etc.Take good sunglasses and lotions, it can get hot and glary.There are a hundred packing lists if you google inca trail packing lists, pick the basic one and get good gear and that should do you.Spend 2 , 3 if possible days aclimatizing to altitude, it will help and drink plenty of water, it does help. Take paracetamol and stronger pain relief, some people suffered, I managed with a few paracetamol on the second day. Other meds for diarrhea, constipation and a broad spectrum antibiotic also appropriate , cause if you need them, their aint no pharmacies/drug stores on the trail. Have a few 1 soles coins  , you may need them for toilets though most camp site toilets dont charge. Some 5 soles coins or 10 soles notes also for water/drinks sold on the trail for the first couple of daysThat seems to cover most issues I saw. If you have good gear, dont over pack, keep it simple, pre plan, then you will can focus on enjoying the spectacular views and experiences of the hike...enjoy"
Incredible experience with Uncover Latin America,"Nothing quite compares to the level of fulfillment like reaching Machu Picchu after trekking the Inca Trail for 4 days. We booked our trek through Uncover Latin America, who were brilliant. Very easy booking process. Our guide Oswaldo was excellent and kept our group entertained. The food was the standout for us, and the buffet lunch there at the end at Machu Picchu was a great way to finish things off. The Inca Trail was a good challenge. Both my wife and I were pretty sore afterwards. The trek was incredible, amazing scenery the whole way through, Dead Woman´s pass was a challenge, and many interesting ruins along the way. Some quick tips that might help you, we booked a private toilet tent, which we are glad we did, and we took the Vistadome train back all the way to Cusco so we could enjoy that amazing scenic train ride. We booked with Uncover Latin America and I can highly recommend their services."
"Tiring, rewarding, emotional, memorable.","The 4 day trek from km82 is not for the faint hearted but neither should it be restricted to the super fit. Adequate aclimatisation over 2 or 3 days should see any altitude issues resolved. Resolve and motivation are as important as fitness, but the trek is not recommended for those with heart or mobility issues. Paths are long steep and whilst solid, blocks are usually irregular and take a toll on the feet and knees. Imagine walking up a broken escalator for 3 hrs and then down another for 2 hrs. Multiply that by 4 days and you get an idea of the physical effort.Now add in the locals,inca ruins, humming birds,high snowy peaks and wonderful vistas, culminating in arriving at the Sun Gate after 26 miles, to look over Macchu Picchu - the photos just do not do it justice. Go through physical hell to get there, feel like you have arrived at Paradise when you get there."
Incan history and beauty with exercise,"We did the one day hike, which involves getting off of the train from the Sacred Valley to Machu Picchu at mile 104 and hiking the last about 6 miles.  It involves a total elevation climb of about 2000 feet of gradual uphill climb (from 7,183 to 8,954 feet) and takes about 6.5 hrs with numerous short stops.  Several fascinating Inca ruins are passed along the way.  Hiking up the many steps of one of these, with side alcoves containing dripping fountains at each landing, was the most demanding of the entire walk.  The “gringo killer” is a much overrated, very step section that is only about 100 feet long and ends at the Sun Gate with a marvelous overview of Machu Picchu down below.  (There is a more rigorous four day hike where you camp along the way that we did not choose.)  Due to the altitude, this one day walk is not for your Sunday stroller but people who are in good shape, even in their 70s, should not have any problem.  Note: use plenty of bug spray right from the beginning.  There are lots of small flies (sand flies?) that you cannot feel but leave large, bloody, itching welts."
Not an easy trek but a worthwhile one!,"This is such an amazing experience.  I was not necessarily truly in shape when I trekked this and it was doable, but definitely not easy on my knees.  Gorgeous views.  Pack suncreen, mosquito repellent, and plenty of water!"
Must do it,"Physically one of the hardest things I have done due to altitude, the appreciation of Machu Picchu City after a hard slog is so much more when you arrive.Inca Trail to Machu Picchu consists of two main routes: the longer trek climbs to a heady 4,215m above sea level, is around 45km long and takes 4 days to complete; the shorter route ascends to just 2,650m and is only 10km/6miles.I had chosen the ""easy"" (shorter) option, so when my train arrived at “Km 104” (the distance from Cusco and also the name of the starting point for my hike) I was invited to jump off the train when it stopped in the middle of nowhere. it was a good choice"
Possibly Better than the Ancient City Itself,"My family and I decided to hike the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu rather than taking the train. We would not have changed our trip at all. The hike itself allowed us to interact with the less visited ancient sites, see tremendous wildlife and vegetation, and learn so much from our guide throughout the trek about Peru in general. Although clouds covered Machu Picchu when we reached the Sun Temple on the 4th day, the sense of satisfaction from completing the tough trail remains unrivaled. However after going down into the city, we hiked back up to the Sun Temple when it was less cloudy to see the city from that vantage point. Throughout the trail, we encountered smaller but undisturbed Incan settlements or religious sites, and one of our favorite was Wiñay Wayna. So if you have the chance, I definitely recommend trying to see that site in addition to Machu Picchu. The whole trip explained to us why Machu Picchu is one of the seven wonders of the world. Worth a visit, but the hike is difficult if you want to do the whole trail!"
Andean Treks Led Us to Machu Picchu,"Traveled with Andean Treks to Machu Picchu this summer. What a great experience! We worked with Heather in their Massachusetts office to set everything up. She was fantastic (truly the model of what customer service should be)! We did their ""Short Inca Trail"" tour with an add-on Machu Picchu Mountain hike (led by tour guide Ketty) and had a blast. She took us on a hike from Chachabamba to Machu Picchu and provided us with a great educational experience. I would highly recommend working with Andean Treks if you're thinking of traveling to Machu Picchu. We were on a tight timeline and had planned the trip rather spontaneously. If we had it to do again, we would have planned farther in advance and would have done the full 5-day/4-night hike/camping trip. If you are planning a trip there, be mindful that permits for the Inca Trail sell out quickly, so you will want to be sure that you book 6+ months in advance. Suggestions for hikers: -Bring plenty of water, especially if hiking in summer months. There is no place to stop for refills between Chachabamba and Machu Picchu. -Bring/buy a walking stick for the Inca Trail Hike. They're cheap in Peru ($5/10 USD). -Layer up. Machu Picchu in June was chilly in the morning and hot in the afternoon. -Take your tour of Machu Picchu late in the day or early in the morning. Peak tour times seemed to be between 9am-3pm. We arrived at the ruins around 4pm after hiking the Inca trail. Though we had our tour of the ruins scheduled for the following morning, this would have been the perfect time for it. We got up at 6am for our tour the next day (we took the bus up from Aguas Calientes), and stood in line with hundreds of people who were also looking to beat the trains carrying thousands more that would come in later in the morning/day. Despite the crowded bus ride up, we were glad that we went before the huge tour groups arrived."
Challenging,Fortunately we only did a small portion of the trail not the 4 day trek up to Machu Picchu.A tough climb with stone steps and rocky walkways.
Amazeing,The hike is the most amazing thing that I have ever done. If you are going to Peru on the other hand do not skip this part! and definitely hike the inca trail. Best experience ever. I went with G adventures the tour guide was Edid (or something like that).

Exhausting but exhilarating! Peru Treks & Adventure is top notch trekking company!,"My family of five hiked the Inca Trail with Peru Treks & Adventure trekking company. They did an exceptional job of making sure we all had plenty of delicious food and supported us along the way. My middle child (13 years old) had difficulty with altitude sickness on the 3rd day of the trek. Our guide, Darwin, helped encourage him with a calmness and understanding attitude. He also ended up having two of our porters help transport my son up some of the day 3 hills so that he could meet up on time with the rest of the group for meals. We are so grateful for the support we received throughout the trek. Darwin also gave a superb presentation once we reached Machu Picchu. Our other guide, Ronald, gave a well-organized orientation prior to our departure. The trek itself offered incredible views, a substantial physical challenge and beautiful Inca stonework to view along the way. I highly recommend Peru Treks & Adventures. They seem to care for their porters and were very organized and easy to communicate with prior to the trek. They would get back to me promptly with questions via e-mail during the months were were planning our trip. We are so happy we chose them for our trekking company and happy to have experienced the awe inspiring Andes Mountains and Inca structures. The entire experience far exceeded my expectations!"
Brilliant if not exhausting,"Well what can I say about the trail!I am Partially lost for words but here goes....There is no part of the trail that doesn't offer amazing views, the history of the trail was bought to life at each archeological site we passed through by our guide.The trail was extremely hard going at times - even for the extremely fit among us. The frequent stops to catch our breath simply gave us an opportunity to take in the the views.The support team were incredible - not only for their ability to beat us to every campsite, but to provide us 3 amazing meals every day - often presented better than some restaurants I have visited.The 4 day hike ended at machu pichu which is the most incredible place I have visited. Do this immediately"
Worth it,Hiked this amazing trail with World Expeditions. Most amazing hike. Day two up to dead womans pass is the toughest but the view is amazing. The down hills on the stone steps is a killer on your toes so take socks which cushion the feet. Beautiful ruins to see along the way
Beautiful hike! Beware of altitude sickness! It's real!,"We did the classic Inca trail--4 days of hiking & 3 nights camping. We went with Southwild. They were very good.It's a tough of hike but quite an adventure & accomplishment.If you're prone to altitude sickness, see your doctor before leaving home. You camp 2 nights at close to 12,000'. It's lots of up & down & not much level hiking."
bucket list trip,"We went with Alpaca Expeditions in July 2016 and it was the experience of a life time. I am over 60 and in decent shape but the altitude was still very challenging. The guides and porters and cooks made the trek not only doable but enjoyable. I loved it but I would change two things if I ever make this trek again (and I hope I will!) Instead of leaving from Cusco at 4:30 AM to get to mile 82 I would stay closer to the beginning of the trail. Instead of taking the train back to Cusco the same evening as arriving at Machu Picchu I would stay in Aqua Caliente for one more night and hike up Huayna Picchu the next day. It was too rushed to come down to Machu Picchu from the Sun Gate, take the guided tour and then hike up to Huayna Picchu. I chose to take more time in Machu Picchu itself instead of the last hike. I regret not having spent more time in Machu Picchu."
A trip here will change your life.....,"I took a trip here with my Mom and Sister. The Inca Trail is so amazing. I do encourage people in great health to attempt the trail, those in less stellar health should opt for the train. I was not here in the rainy season, which I heard is kinda like being in the Pacific Northwest.....so try and visit when it's not so rainy. Even when the sun is out, it can get pretty cold."
Most intriguing trip,"The trail is magnificent, the vegetation changes from the desert to forests.  We had rain for three days out of four, however that did not make the hike any less exciting.The trail is very hard, the view is breath taking and everyone on the trek is nice; this is something you do not want to miss if you enjoy hiking."
Peru Treks and Adventures,"This was a once in a lifetime trek and it was very well organised. The meals were pretty amazing considering how far they had to be carried. The sleeping bags were super warm and got us through the night. We would recommend hiring a porter to carry your sleeping bag and mat if you are hiring them from the company, unless you have a good size bag to attach it to. We hired a sleeping bag, which turned out to be a lot bulkier than we expected (but they were so warm) and our bags were not well equipped to carry them. Please prepare for wet weather i.e. buy a poncho. The hike to Macchu Pichu is well worth it, the views and historical stories make the effort worth it. We would recommend this company to all future hikers."
Be Careful!!!,"We opted for the train, instead of the three day hike to visit Machu Picchu, and am glad we did!!!  We encountered many hikers once we arrived.... some were held up at knifepoint and robbed, and all were dirty and exhausted.  I know that it's a great challenge for some, but be careful.  And I definitely would not go with children... way too dangerous!"
Do it! You won't regret it!,"I was so apprehensive about the Trek - was I physically fit enough? Was I mentally fit enough? Was I too fat? Was I too old?.....so many worries!I genuinely thought I would have to endure the trek in order to be rewarded by the sight of Machu Picchu emerging from the clouds from the Sun Gate - but I was wrong... I enjoyed every second, and would do it again in a heartbeat!Our company Condor Travel (booked through Llama Travel in the UK) and in particular our guide, Darwin, and his team were superb. They pride themselves in going at a pace which ensures everyone makes it. As our guide would say, what's the hurry, enjoy the views, enjoy the journey as long as you get to camp before sunset, what's the problem?!?I can honestly say that the only thing that troubled me were the toilets, but I got over it!I did the trek in their dry season, and am very glad I didn't attempt it during their summer (which is their wet season).If you're at all anxious about the trek, that's natural. Yes it's hard, but if it was easy it wouldn't be as special. Just do it! You won't regret it!"
Be prepared! ,"It's without a doubt an amazing pilgrimage but it will wear you down some. If you are in marginal shape or older I recommend looking at a 5 to 7 day trek, enjoy the scenery and the beauty without the long days!"
"Amazing, incredible, moving experience","Do the hike! The whole hike, for 4 days and 3 nights you'll be able to imagine what it must have been like to be an explorer and happen across incredible Incan ruins and gasp in awe at the brilliance of the structures. Phenomenal experience"
Inca Trail with G Adventures - Highlight of our holiday!,"We did the Amazon to the Andes and a Galapagos visit with G Adventures for our holiday, and the Inca Trail was a highlight. It was challenging at times, especially on the second day. And while I really had to push myself to get to the top, I would definitely do it again if I had the chance. As part of the, you have porters who can carry (some) of your gear for you and there are also cooks who prepare three hot meals a day. The views along the way are amazing. You also come across some ruins on route and your guide will offer a detailed history of them. Any negatives? Bathrooms on the trails aren't great - some folks opted for the bush on occasion. There are 500 people allowed to enter the trail each day - 300 of these are porters and 200 are other tourists. So as campsites are clustered together, some people may feel like it is not as secluded as they thought. I think the positive overall experience outweighed any negatives. If you are thinking of doing it, I personally recommend the dry season (June - August), with only an average of 2 days a month receiving rainfall. And remember, there are permits, so you will need to book about 6 months before going!"
you can´t miss it,"I only had one they there, that is my only regret... It´s beautiful and impressive... the guides are very nice and proud of there history. But wear comfortable shoes, repellent and sun block. Be prepared to hike a little and if you are using the bus be there early because there is a long line. But in the end is worth the effort!"
"Top notch Operator, Uncover Latin America","A real physical challenge, but so very rewarding all at the same token. The whole trek and not just Machu Picchu at the end was outstanding.  We really need to give a big pat on the back to Uncover Latin America, the company we booked our trek with. Their level of service was top notch, from our initial phone call with Chris right to the return at our hotel at the end of our trip. Our guide Wilber was very energetic, funny and had lots of charisma with a ton of knowledge about his ancestors, and the surrounding environs. We had really big and delicious meals, I had the vegetarian option, and we loved the  buffet lunch at the Sanctuary Lodge at the end. A magic experience. We had 2 nights in Cusco beforehand to acclimatize, drink plenty of water and have a long sleep. We had oxygen pumped in our room. Made for a compfrtable nights rest."
Once in a lifetime adventure,"We did the 4 day classic and The trail was not easy but manageable for anyone with a moderate fitness level.  The altitude did catch us off guard and we struggled but luckily we had factored in a few days in Cusco to acclimatize.  We hired porters for our baggage and would highly recommend doing this if you are contemplating it.  This was a once in a lifetime experience and absolutely fabulous.  The trail itself can be quite busy with a lot of hikers but depending on your guide you can take less traveled tails where it will be just your guide, your companions and yourself a truly magnificent and intimate experience.For the mechanics of the hike we hired a local crew that included our guide, a cook, and a number of porters.  These fantastic Peruvians took great care of us and worked very hard to make sure everything ran smoothly.  I can't say enough about what a hard job they did and how well they did it. If you are considering going on the trail make sure you book your spot at least 6 months to 1 year in advance.  It will be an unforgettable adventure."
Stunning views and beautiful forests,"The trail up to Machi Picchu is stunning, there are two ways up for the fitter take the sun dial (the way we went). The views are worth it and the trail is beautiful"
Fantastic - but make sure yo take hand sanitiser.,I travelled with my family of four using G Adventures who were brilliant. The trek was challenging but I would say that someone of moderate fitness and mobility could complete it. About 11 kilometres each day but all up and down. The altitude was difficult. Up to 4000 meters at dead woman's pass which made most of us feel a bit nauseatous with headaches. The food cooked in the trail by the G Adventures staff was brilliant. They even made a birthday cake fresh for my daughter who was 16 on the trek. One of our group of 11 was evacuated down with either a stomach bug or altitude sickness. The toilets are totally rank so you will need lots of hand sanitiser and a sturdy stomach. Top tips bring some flip flops or trainers for the evening after walking all day and a pack of cards or something to play with fellow Trekkers in the evening. The scenery is absolutely stunning and worth every moment of effort. I would encourage you to do it.
Amazing experience,"Walking the Inca trial was an amazing experience. We travelled with llama travel from the uk who use condor travel as their local agents, the guys at condor were truly 5 star thought and highly recommended. My main suggestions for the trail are to pack light and hire walking sticks even if you think you wont need them they make the down hills alot easier. The hard work will be worth it when you reach the sun gate on day 4."
An absolute must,"We visited the inca trail to Macchu Picchu in July 2016. Not one drop of rain the entire 4 days which was perfect as some of the rocky steps would have been nasty in the rain. We went with Adventure Peru, who on the porters above award wages (a big thing for us as they work incredibly hard!). Our tour guide Ruben was fantastic and could not have done more for us. Over the 4 days hiking we were challenged physically and mentally, and wouldn't have changed a thing. It was hard, but the views once we got to the amazing Macchu Picchu were so worth it!"
Most amazing experience,"My daughter and I had always wanted to trek the Inca Trail. We booked with Explore who were great. Everything was organised perfectly (thanks Hector our guide). The Inca Trail is not for the faint hearted. We had done some training but it soon became evident that more training would have helped!!The scenery is beautiful and changes daily. Mountain views, rain forest, Inca ruins and cloud forests. Trekking at allitude is an experience in its self. I just walked at a slower pace than normal so I could breath at a comfortable rate and enjoy talking with my fellow Trekkers and enjoy the scenery. Walking through the Sun Gate and seeing Macchu Picchu for the first time as amazing!! (It is another hours trek from there to MP).There is no doubt that , for me, the Inca a Trail was a physical challenge and also a mental challenge. If you are thinking of doing it, go for it, but do train as much as possible so that you can enjoy the experience and your surroundings."
"High expectations, exceeded.","The  Machu Picchu experience is overwhelming. We were very lucky to have an impressive guide for our 2 day tour. Our first day consisted of a 15km hike on the Inca trail.  The hike goes to Sun Gate ruins, a somewhat difficult section of the hike, with incredible views, above Machu Picchu, overlooking the city.   We learned a great deal about the history and construction of the Inca trail, including the timelines of the construction periods, the builders and their reasons for this extensive undertaking. It is quite humbling to experience firsthand this engineering feat. Applications for agriculture, transportation, and defenses were all utilized for the designs in the construction.    The next morning we waited  in line at 4:30 am, for the bus that takes you to Machu Piccu, again, our guide was great: informative and enthusiastic.  As the sun was rising we witnessed some of the astronomical features of the site, the lighting of certain temple rooms, for example. We did  an extensive exploration of the city, its temples, its meeting areas, its incredible wall construction, etc  You try and get it all in: incredible views, construction details, the harmony of  the city itself with the surrounding areas, quite amazing. Lastly, we were very impressed by our tour company, Lama Path Inca Trail,  and the general  management of the Machu Picchu site, they limit  the amount of people allowed in the city, that includes , the employees, the guides, etc ."
First rate trekking company,"I just completed this journey with 8 other family members and another family of 6. We ranged in age from 21-64. Peru Trek is definitely the company to book with. Our guide was Janet and her assistant was Peppe. They were both great and since we had a large number of women in our group we were really happy to have a female guide. She was wonderful! She was passionate and compassionate. The porters are so hard working. And the chefs were fantastic. We all hired the 1/2 porter and 4 of us mature women hired the private porter for day 2 & 3. Carrying a 12 lb backpack on those days would have been hard. It was worth the extra cost to be able to enjoy the trail more. Be prepared for unsanitary conditions as far as restrooms go, but this is not the fault of Peru Trek, they are the same for everyone on the trail. We had one lady who really struggled on day 2, but Peppe and the porters helped her along. This is a tough hike but so worth it."
Another Bragging Rights Earned,"Inka Trail is known worldwide as one of the top five destinations for hiking. It is a 45 kms stretch peaking at 13,776 feet to be hiked in four days. The second day is supposed to be the hardest passing the “Dead Woman Pass” mountain. On the fourth day, hikers are to get up at 4 am, hike for two hours to IntiPunku, the Sungate, to watch the sun rise at Machu Picchu. The timing is really up to your guide. We were able to hike this in three days and at the end of the third day, we were on the bottom of Machu Picchu and camped there. On our first day, we hiked three hours longer advancing us to 3.5 kms above where we were to begin on the second day. Our guide arranged for our permit to camp at a different campsite. Second day is supposed to be the hardest but in our case, I believe it was the first day as we barely arrived to our site before sundown. This is a lottery system and permits are sold on the first of February with only 500 hikers, guides and porters are allowed. Get your permit fast. The steps were high, all stones. I can’t help but wonder how the Inkas built high steps when they are short people with short legs. But the greatest entertainment for me is to watch the porters climb up or slide down practically running, with their sandals and 20 kilos of weight on their back. They are super human. On our last night, we had a ceremony to hand the tips to the porters, cooks and guides. If you do this, please be generous with your tips. It was very touching to hear the speech of the head porter (spoken in Quechua and translated in English by our guides) when he said, behind these people who helped you are not just faces but they are raising families. In addition, he said, “Our government is supposed to be helping us. Instead, it’s you, the tourists who help us.” Oh how true. After they finished, they had blisters in their hands. They really spoiled us and made our climb bearable and achievable. It’s another feat, another great memory and another item off my bucket list. Now it’s your turn.  Train well and know your limits."
Walking in the footsteps of history,Amazing spiritual journey following in the footsteps the Incans traveled so many years before. A must on the bucket list.    Full disclosure: the altitude is no joke!!
AMAZING views and overall experience!,"This was such a challenging and rewarding 4-day trek! I highly recommend it to anyone with a decent level of fitness, although Day 2 of the trek is quite tough. My personal favorite day of the trek was day 3 because it was much more scenic and relatively easy. The breathtaking views along the way are comparable to Machu Picchu. I went with the tour company G Adventures and had a blast!"
Sungate Tours made this a trip of a lifetime!,"I cannot say enough good things about Doris Gonzalez and Sungate Tours in preparing us and for this 11-day adventure which included the 4 day hike to Machu Picchu. The staff took care of us in 5 star manner, from airline, boat, bus, and train transfers to the excellent cuisine on the trail. The Quechua guides added so  much to our experiences at different sites and genuinely cared about meeting our ever need. This was an exploration of one of the most beautiful places on earth, with mystery, history and natural history combined. Sungate Tours servces all of Pery, Bolivia and other parts of SA. I know some of my friends my be planning an Amazon trip with them next."
Peru Treks - excellent ,"We have just arrived back from our 4 day trek along the Inca Trail with Peru Treks. It was definitely challenging physically but our excellent guides, Manny and Jimmy supported our group of 12 (age range 12-53) at all times. They were positive, encouraging, informative, funny and caring. The food prepared by our chef, Lucio was of the highest standard and even included a birthday cake (not sure how you cook a cake on the Inca Trail?!) the porters were also excellent and attentive at all times. What a fantastic experience. Thank you Peru Treks. We will never forget it."
Amazing,"Probably the hardest thing I've ever done but totally worth it. I did it without a porter because I wanted to challenge myself however next time I will use one. Day 1 isn't too bad and gets you up and going. Day 2 is a killer hiking up 1200m vertical to dead woman's pass. Once there I got a bit emotional and the view is spectacular. But then it's straight back down another 600m to camp. Day 3 is another slog but not as bad as 2. The views on day 3 are simply awesome. Day 4 is a quick walk almost run to machu picchu. I went with Peru Treks and could not fault them. Our 2 guides were excellent and made sure everyone in the group was ok, as we generally split into two the quick ones (present company included) and the slower ones. Our group consisted of age range from 23 to 67, and while personally I think 67 is too old they managed to do it so hats off to them. The food everyday was amazing and you definitely don't go hungry! Some tips:Pack a clean t shirt (preferably merino) for each day, 1-2 hiking pants (zip off to shorts are ideal) warm layers and jacket, hand sanetizer, toilet paper, roll on deodorant, sun cream, chap stick with sun protection (this I forgot and my poor burnt lips are still paying for it). Hiking poles optional - I hired some but then rarely used them and found them an inconvenience.Long story short this is a must do. Personally I don't see the point in catching the train/bus up. While I understand if you're on a money and/or time budget the hike is far superior. Plus all those day tripper tourists with their selfy sticks and fancy clothes can get annoying because you feel you have earned the visit and they just get in the way!"
Breathing and hard work,"We joined a group to do the inca trail. We started the 4 day trek after a few days in Cusco to acclimatise to the high altitudeWe walk every weekend but made a point since January to walk higher and further, ie doing Ben Nevis a few weeks ago.Day 1- the day was really hot. We walked 10-11 km... up and down until we reached the campsite at 3100mDay 2- the dreaded walk to Dead Womans Pass.... be prepared for steep walks... you walk high and long, its a 7 km walk but feels longer. You climb to 4200m and once you reach the peak- the emotions will hit you. You then walk a steep drop to the campsite at 3600m. Trust me... it was bloody coldDay 3- is a 12km walk up and down... the knees may hurt but the views of the cloud forest and camping above the clouds was spectacular.  The stars were clear and amazing ! The camp site remains at e600m and its coldDay 4- lots of walking of which 4 hours is all down hill to about 900m until you get to the monkey stairs.... by now you wonder if you can make it up the steep almost straight stepsThen the moment you've been waiting for. Walking through the sun gate to the sight if machu pichu in the distance. Yes many if us cried it was so emotionalThe walk to machu pichu from the sun gate is about 40 minutes but the view is worth itIf you do the trek- we went with Exodus.... use porters. They are amazingYou must have a season 4 sleeping bag- our comfort zone was -5 and it was needed2-3 pairs of walking trousers and quick drying tee shirts for each day2 litre bottles for waterHatWaterproof coatGlovesSun creamMosquito spray Its easy to take far too much but its simply not worth itOur guide Cesar was simply the best and got us through the daysThe cooks prepared the most amazing breakfast, lunches and dinners. Goodness knows how but they didThe porters beat us each day and we arrived to our bags and tents already up. The cheered us every day when we 2arrived at camp. Seriously they deserve the clapsIts not easy...  you must acclimatise properly before hand... our tour took 5 days by coach to reach cusco and 2 days there to get use to the altitude. Our walking and gym for months before helped us... Didn't ache in the slightest while walking. I have asthma and didn't need my inhalers although you pant while walking esp day 2-3 due to the high altitude but nothing to worry aboutDON'T TAKE TABLETS FOR HIGH ALTITUDE.... the side effects are almost identical as altitude sickness. One of our group was carried of on a stretchered by 2 porters due to the effects of the medication on the morning of day 3...If you can push yourself to do this trek then do it. Don't be a wuss and go by bus from Machu Pichu town... challenge yourself. You won't regret it"
1 Day Inca Trail with Paul from Condor Travel,"My mother, aunt and I took this hike with Paul, a knowledgeable and positive guide with Condor Travel.  My mother and aunt, in their mid sixties, were not anticipating the difficulty of the hike at elevation.  We took quite a while to finish the hike.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, however, would not agree with the ""easy-moderate"" rating.  There are sections that are flat and easy, however, with the elevation (we live at sea level) the ""Inca Steep"" stairs make this a difficult hike if you are not in decent shape.  My opinion is that it is a must do if you truly want to experience Peru and the Inca, but you must prepare ahead of time.  Fortunately, Paul was prepared and had Icy Hot and some salts to add to my mom and aunt's water as they were cramping.  I loved this day!  Be prepared for heat, sun, and lots of steps.  It was amazing to see some of the many orchids Peru has to offer.  We also ate lunch at a beautiful waterfall. If you can, you must do this hike."
Awesome!! with Uncover Latin America,"We had a simply awesome time a big thanks to Uncover Latin America, Alan our guide was beyond  excellent, food amazing  and everything well organized. The trek itself was a challenge,  but a good challenge, lots of ruins  to see along the  way  the big attraction at the end Machu Picchu  was above and beyond what we we anticipating all trek. We had a delicious buffet lunch organized for us after our tour  of Machu Picchu at the Sanctuary Lodge, a great way to finish what was just an amazing experience we will  never forget."
Experience of a lifetime with Paul and Condor Travel!,"The Inca Trail was definitely the experience of a lifetime! My husband and I booked the 4 day trek with Condor Travel and it was fantastic from start to finish. The hike is challenging but the trails are very good and well maintained. The elevation is quite varied and the second day we walked/climbed from 3100m up to 4215m. It took a while and was hard work but it was still amazing.The views are stunning and there are a few Inca sites along the way, which were very interesting. Paul, our guide was fantastic, very very knowledgeable and very helpful. Always asking how we were and how we were feeling. The porters were amazing, carrying all the equipment needed and we were always welcomed into the camp with them all clapping. The chef was amazing and we ate superbly well, 2 courses of food for breakfast, lunch and dinner, we even had freshly caught trout on the first day! They all made the whole experience extra special. Walking up to the Sun Gate was so exciting on the last morning and even though it was a bit misty and cloudy so we couldn't see Machu Picchu very well it was still amazing. Would definitely recommend this trek and Condor Travel, superb!"
Best time ever!,The inca trail is a once in a lifetime experience. We highly recommend doing a trek and we went with the very professional Alpaca Expeditions. The hike is difficult and challenging but the trail is well maintained and clear. This is not for everyone as you should be in fair shape and expect to be exhausted at night. The altitude takes time to get used to. The trail is closed one month of the year for maintenance. We encountered no animals except for the horses and mules that work carrying people and goods up and down the first day. We saw very few mosquitos or flies. The sights are breathtaking and you must look at the stars at night! There are toilets you can pay to use but I recommend sticking to the one your group provides so pick a group like Alpaca that does. The mornings can be cool so make sure you have a pair of gloves or carry some hand warmers. You have the opportunity to see many inca sites on the way to Machu Picchu so have a camera with you at all times.
Incredible Journey with Valencia Travel,"A group of friends just finished the four day trek on the Inca trail to Macchu Pichu. What an incredible journey. We booked a Clymb Adventure trip with Valencia Travel and we were not disappointed. Wonderful experienced and knowledgable guides in Alex assisted by Edy, and truly remarkable porters. The food was incredible, the views breathtaking and the historic sites unforgettable. While Macchu Pichu is amazing, the journey to get there and the sites along the way we experienced with friends and new trail mates will have lasting impact. The challenges are obvious: challenging days on the trail, altitude and I don't like camping. Come prepared and hire the porters to carry most of your gear and you will be fine."
Short Inca Trail,"We decided to do the 1 day walk. This was slightly challenging but not too difficult, a reasonably fit person should be able to complete without difficulty. Some parts were steeper than others. The weather was excellent, bright sunny day with clear skies. The views all along the route were spectacular. Our guide from Condor Travel was knowledgeable and spoke excellent English. Although we had warnings about the path being narrow it was reasonable, perhaps in wet conditions it could be a little more tricky. Another trip not to be missed!"
Some tips to make the most of this once in a lifetime experience!,"My husband and I did the original four day Inca trek with Llama Path. I have reviewed the company separately.Here I am just giving a few tips for anyone considering the trek. First and foremost, DO IT! Yes it's expensive but it was an absolutely brilliant experience. In no particular order:1. Walking poles. They will be your saving grace going downhill after summiting Dead Woman's Pass on day two. Listen to your guides when they say to zig zag down the steps like a crab. They know what they're talking about! 2. The Sky Train. We booked it by mistake but didn't attempt to cancel it as we figured it would just be a slightly fancier train and that a little luxury (a clean toilet!) would be nice after four days hiking. It was A LOT fancier. In fact we were surrounded by very rich Americans doing an all expenses paid tour of Peru. And we were very, VERY smelly!It was completely surreal and really awkward. Especially when the hosts had to parade up and down the aisle modelling alpaca clothes. There was also a dancing clown. I wish I was joking. But yes the toilet was fabulous. Also, after the four days hiking you really don't need another view of the mountains through a glass ceiling. 3. Day packs. It hadn't occurred to me how much you'll need to carry during the day so make sure your day pack is big enough and comfortable. I would highly recommend a platypus/camelbak to  make it easy to drink water. Staying hydrated is of the utmost importance. Each day I brought a waterproof jacket (even in the dry season, we did use ours once), two litres of water minimum, warm clothes for the early morning hikes on day two & four, sun cream, sun hat, sunglasses, toilet tissue, alcohol gel, emergency medications/first aid supplies and the snack provided by the company (fruit & biscuits). 4. Porters. We originally had booked half a porter (7kg) between us to take our sleeping mats & bags and some spare clothes. When we had the meeting the evening before the trek we were told that the mats and bags weighed 6kg. That only left 1kg for any extras that we might want at camp. So we decided to book another half porter. In hindsight we could have managed without it especially since we were carrying a good bit of stuff in our day packs. But it was nice to have sandals to put on in camp. 5. Fitness. We were worried about our level of fitness and the altitude but we ended up being the third and fourth person into camp every day (after another Irish couple funnily enough!). We followed the company's advice and walked/hiked almost twice a week leading up to our holiday but nothing too strenuous, about two hours max each time. We did three bigger hikes in the months before hand and that was it. With Diamox for the altitude, walking poles for the steps, porters to carry a lot of weight for you, a little bit of training and a positive attitude there is no reason why anyone in their full health can't do this trek. 6. Footwear. We both hiked in walking shoes and didn't feel like we could have done with hiking boots at any stage. Unfortunately both of our shoes have Gore-tex waterproofing (because it rains a lot in Ireland) which led to very sweaty feet by the end of each day. If you are buying shoes specifically for this trek then go for non-waterproof walking shoes with good grip.Hope this is of some help!"
The hardest hike you will ever take,"From Cusco, Peru, with reservations someone in great condition can begin hiking the Inca Trail, some 50 miles to Machu Picchu. Some travelers prefer a lift to trim four miles off the experience. The changes in elevation created difficulties for four members of our tour group and had to return with two of the guides.  The rest of us hiked a narrow established stone trail with stairs and tunnels along the way, moving from 8,000 feet to 15,000 feet, passing ancient Inca structures along the way.  Four nights and five days later, we arrived at the Sun Gate, where beautiful Machu Picchu greeted our eyes.  A member of our expedition stated that hiking the Inca Trailmwas harder than boot camp!"
What a memory!!!,"My wife and I spent 8 and a half hour hiking this trial (from km 104 to Machu Picchu). The three of us including the guide were the last to arrive at Machu Picchu. When we arrived the site was completely empty, what an experience! It was not easy but doable."
Beautiful and rigorous trail,"This trail has gorgeous views and because it is basically a one way trail, unless you overtake other people, it feels less crowded than it is because you don't meet people coming the other way.We only did the last section with the extension from Chachabamba (husband didn't want to commit to too much due to uncertainly about altitude sickness) but it was harder than we expected having been told that this section was a gradual easy ascent.  As always with hiking, it's relative.  Bu this a 'real' hike.  You'll be fine if you are reasonably fit and wearing proper approach shoes or hiking boots, but I'd not advise couch potatoes in trainers or sneakers to attempt."
Great Adventure in the Inca Trail with a 100% local outfiter,"Localtrekkers.com a local tour operator based in Cusco earns one of these largely due to its climbing and trekking team, a dynamic duo, Alex and Ronald The Kings of the Andes.Together these two guides combine their unique personal insights of the histories of the Incas, the rituals of the Andean people while actually performing these rituals during the trek. Imagine rising at 4 am, waiting on you hand and foot for breakfast, hiking with you all day, doing the same for lunch, snacks and dinner, detailing the historic intricacies of various ruins and on and on until about 10 each night, always performed with grace and diplomacy. Yikes! Look, this climbing trek is hard, punishing at times and they do not pull punches. They over promise and over deliver at every turn.About food, for me every dish was excellent and delicious, and every meal was served in a buffet style. Francisco and his son cook. So, keeping in perspective the hardship of trying to feed 8 trekkers, Porters, guides etc., cooking out there aint easy. So expect meals on occasion bordering on cool to cold but kudos to the chef for an exceptional ceviche, flapjacks perfect and my personal favorites, an entrada of guacamole on a chip, exceptionally simple frijoles and a freaking awesome cake. Thank you very much localtrekkers.com to do this experience unforgettable.If you book a tour with this company ask for Alex and Ronald as your guides and of course Francisco as your cheff. YOU WON’T REGRET."
4 day hike is amazing!,This was one of the best experiences of my life.  My wife and I planned a 10 day trip in Peru with the help of Chris Mahoney of Uncover Latin America.  The 4 day hike to Machu Picchu was an experience I will never forget.  The 4 day hike is the best way to see the Inca Trail.  Do it.
Excellent  tour to Peru's Northern cities,"We explored Peru's Northern cities and ancient sites with InkaNatura Travel and could not have chosen a better tour operator. We went on the 6D/5N Lost Cities of Northern Peru tour. The arrangements were excellent, we stayed in wonderful hotels and learnt  a lot about Peru's ancient history from our tour guide Pedro. Orlando was our very capable driver.Peru's North coast has much to offer the tourist, especially those interested in history, and it's a pity that more tourist don't visit this part of the country. The scenery is totally different from the South. In addition there are the very interesting archaeological sites and excellent museums.The tour started in Lima and took us to sites such as Caral, where the first  pyramids were built at roughly the same time the Egyptions started building their first pyramids. We contued to Huaraz at the foot of the Cordillera Blaca, travelled over the mountains to Chavin, visited Sechin, then Trujillo and finally Chiclayo from where we visited the ""Cracked Pyramid”, Túcume, and the Royal Tombs of Sipán.I can highly recommend this company. We thoroughly enjoyed this tour."
Choose PERU TREKS - simply the best!,"My son and I have just come back from the amazing 4 days trek and had a wonderful time, very much down to the superb people at Peru Treks. Booking with them was easy, we always got quick responses to our questions, great information sheets and maps. At the trek the two highly educated guides Janet and Ronald just couldn't have been better. They were kind, caring, helpful, smiling, great fun, encouraging when the going got a bit tough - really looking after their 'family' all the time. Their knowledge was extensive and made the trip a great learning experience. The porters were happy, outstanding people without whom the trek would have been impossible. The food fantastic and ample and the general feel was a very happy and together team. Don't bother looking anywhere else, it just can't get better than this! Thank you to all the team and our best wishes. Helle and William"
Compulsory tipping ruins the fun,"We did the four day Inca trail with Llama Path. The guide, accommodation, food and fellow travelers were all great, but the constant little hints at how important it was for us to tip just became offensive. A tip is supposed to be a little extra given voluntarily to acknowledge good service, and doesn't even exist in some cultures. Instead we felt obliged to tip, with both the time and amount to tip specified by our guide. I don't blame him, this is something which I'm sure is drilled into them by the management, so ingrained did it seem. I suppose the worst part was that Llama Path loves to rub your nose in how well they treat their staff, and while on the one hand they tell you that the porters are well paid and treated to summer holidays at the beach, the message is that your tips are very much needed and you are effectively shamed into giving by being rounded up before dinner to pay your dues in front of the other travelers on your trek. Frankly this just made me angry, because I felt manipulated, and it took away from what was otherwise a challenging but very satisfying way to visit a truly amazing place. Why can't I just opt to pay whatever the true cost needs to be in order to ensure your staff are treated fairly, and then be free to enjoy the trek without being forced to participate in weirdly artificial cult-like greetings ceremonies (end of day one: I heard all the other groups' forced clapping in succession as they too went through the same uncomfortable ordeal) clearly designed to open my wallet when it comes to tipping time?"
Most amazing experience ever,"We trekked with PERU TREKS, I absolutely could not rate them highly enough. Our guides, Edwin and Pepe were knowledgable, friendly and helpful. As Edwin told us at the start, it's about the journey, which almost outweighed Machu Picchu  for me! I could write an essay about the whole experience but simply, it was amazing. The porters are some of the most incredible people I have ever seen, the food was delicious, we were woken up with coca tea in the morning and to top it off with were with an amazing group of people. We always seemed to have the best camping spots and our porters always seem happy. You will never feel so proud, walking around sweaty and smelly, amongst clean, fresh smelling tourists with their guides pointing at you saying 'they just came off of the 3 night 4 day trek!' and seeing the impressed look on their clean faces. I did loads of research, and these guys came out really well, paying their porters well and not cutting costs. Good quality equipment. Don't go for the cheapest trek you find, you will regret it!! Not for the squeamish - be prepared for the unsightly sights in the 'toilets', bring loo roll, snacks and determination. The altitude is tough, day 2 is tough. Just take it at your own pace, keep moving and you will reach the top of the pass!!!"
Visit,From our hotel we went DOWN into the valley by train and then one very hair raising local bus ride UP to the ruins - if you don't like heights do not look down. A guide is essential to get all the history and then have a walk about on your own. Lots of sheer drops so take care. Plenty of steps to go up and down. A very interesting place not to be missed. It was the highlight of our tour.
Trek of a lifetime,"The 4 day Inca trek is a must when visiting Peru. Physically one of the hardest things I have done due to altitude, the appreciation of Machu Picchu City after a hard slog is so much more when you arrive. Walking next to swarms of people walking in with clean faces, smelling of fresh perfume made me grateful for earning it at the end! Such a beautiful part of the world!"
4-day Inca Trail Trek...Amazing!!!,"I chose the 4-day Inca Trail trek to Machu Picchu with G Adventures and it was the toughest and most amazing experience!  Everything with the trek ran smoothly.  The guides and porters were excellent.  The meals were delicious and I felt pretty spoiled.  Day 2 was the most difficult, but we took short breaks along the way and I can't tell you how thrilled I was to arrive at Dead Woman's Pass.  On the day we finally arrived to Machu Picchu, I couldn't believe that I was seeing this place with my own eyes...WOW!  It was an unforgettable experience.  I highly recommend G Adventures!!!"
A 5-hour hike up the Inca Trail,"The Inca Trail to Machu Picchu consists of two main routes: the longer trek climbs to a heady 4,215m above sea level, is around 45km long and takes 4 days to complete; the shorter route ascends to just 2,650m and is only 10km/6miles. As I didn’t fancy a four-day hike and sharing a tent with bugs and snakes I had chosen the ""easy"" (shorter) option, so when my train arrived at “Km 104” (the distance from Cusco and also the name of the starting point for my hike) I was invited to jump off the train when it stopped in the middle of nowhere, where I was met by my trek guide Alfredo (it transpired that I was in a “group of one”. After a brief chat we crossed the Vilcanota River footbridge, followed by a group of around a dozen German trekkers and their guide who had also jumped off the train at the same point. Almost immediately we came to the first checkpoint – a well preserved Inca site at Chachabamba (sounds like a cue for a dance!) where my trail pass was stamped and we were off into the jungle before you could say “Dr. Livingstone, I presume?”Over the next few hours of steady, continuous, climbing along paved stone paths cut into the mountainside we were treated to breathtaking views of the mountains, valley, rivers and waterfalls. Then after 2½ hours and 6km we reached the ruins of Wiñay Wayna (“forever young”) high above the Urubamba River. This spectacular Inca complex - only discovered as recently as 1941 - features curved agricultural terraces on a steep ridge, and ten fountains (used as ritual baths) fed by 19 springs running between two groups of buildings.From Wiñay Wayna we continued along the undulating trail below the crest of the eastern slope of Machu Picchu mountain. We reached the 52 steep steps leading to Inti Punku (""the Sun Gate"") after another tiring 3 km and on the crest of this ridge – the highest point in the trek, and where the Incas controlled access to the city – we caught our first glimpse of the ruins of Machu Picchu below. The final section of the trail is downhill, and involves many steep steps (not so easy on tired legs), but the views of the ruins unfolding before us made the effort worthwhile.The time taken since crossing the Vilcanota River footbridge at the start of the trek to the Machu Picchu ruins was exactly 5 hours (as per the timestamps on my photos), which of course included regular stops to view the scenery, take photos, have our packed lunch and catch our breath. Alfredo complimented me on keeping up such a good tempo, as “Most walkers start off fast but finish on their knees”, and added that the trek usually takes between 5 to 8 hours to complete.At this stage we had completed our efforts for the day, and we joined the long queue of tourists (most of whom had stayed on the train all the way to the station) to catch one of the coaches down the long and winding road to Aguas Calientes. After a very welcome bath and rest I would be back up the mountain pass to explore Machu Picchu at closer quarters the following morning!"
Highly recommend Uncover Latin America,"We did the trek with tour company Uncover Latin America who were brilliant in every aspect. Chris was our first point of contact and he was ever so helpful and patient, our guide Oscar was a pleasant character, very talkative and keen to pass on his wisdom. We got really big meal portions and all the food was a delicious, really important when hiking all day in the Andes. With all this we were then left to enjoy the magic this 4 day trek has to offer. The only unique advice I can probably offer is to do plenty of stretching exercises each morning, your legs and whole body will get a work out. Loved the lunch at the Sanctuary Lodge at the end of our tour of Machu Picchu."
Amazing Trip,"We had the most amazing trip with Amazonas Explorer, a fanatstic company to travel with, nothing was too much trouble and everything ran so smoothly. The Wayki's are the most caring, fantastic people and looked after all our needs, we were sploit.Our guide Chino was the most knowledgable and accomodating person that you could hope for, he made the trip the trip of a lifetime, it exceeded all our expectations.I would highly recommend this company and the Inca Without Crowds Interary as you basically have the trail to yourself.Such a beautiful part of the world."
2 day hike along the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu!,"My friend and I spent some time in Santiago, Chile and just had to visit Machu Picchu. I am an avid hiker so we agreed on the 2 day hike in hopes that it would work for both of us. It definitely did!! Transportation was reliable, accommodations were comfortable, and our guide was amazing and very kind. We had a really wonderful and safe experience. This was perfect for the two of us to get a personalized adventure! We already have our next trip planned with Adios Adventure Travel!"
"Quechuas Expeditions provided a super smooth, amazing adventure, small groups, HIGHLY RECOMMEND; Guide: Rodrigo","We chose Quechuas Expeditions to organize our Machu Picchu trip in June 2016 and we had the adventure of a lifetime!  We told them the things we were interested in seeing and doing and they helped us plan a customized itinerary that included Sacred Valley, Cusco City Tour, and 2 day Inca Trail.  This trip requires a lot of trust in your tour company - Quechuas Expeditions is super reliable and earned our trust!  Every time we had a connection or needed someone to be waiting for us on the other end of a train trip, they were there.  Our guide was Rodrigo, who grew up in Cusco, and is licensed as a professional guide (he went through 5 years of college to be a guide).  Every day he explained what we would do and what we needed to be prepared, and handled all the paperwork. tickets, and admits to each location.  I found the inca Trail to be a physical challenge - the altitude made ascending steps very difficult, and I I felt out of breath every 5 or 10 minutes and had to stop.  Rodrigo was encouraging and motivating, but also respectful of my physical limitations and I never felt like he was trying to push me beyond my limits just so he could be done.  The last part of the trail is the most difficult, with many very steep steps; I had to climb on hands and feet one step at a time.  But when we reached the Sun Gate at the top, it was all worth it! JUST WOW!  It feels unreal to see Machu Picchu lying below you - the pictures you have seen a thousand times... in real life!  Rodrigo spoke great English, shared all kinds of information about the Incas and their customs, significance of everything we were seeing, and answered all our many questions.  He also gave us a tour of Machu Picchu the next morning, then left us to explore freely.  At the end we felt like Rodrigo was a great friend and even part of our family :)"
Inca Trail,"Our Inca Trail trek lasted for 4 days. It was the best thing I've ever done. The part I loved most was not only the Inca sites, but also the spectacular landscapes. This trek is quite popular so I advice to book one 6 months in advance."
4 day trail - tough by worth of it,"My wife and me we had an idea of doing this once in our lives. Somehow it happened that I stepped in my 60-es when we finally booked it, so I thought - maybe a bit late but who cares, we shall do that.  The begging was harmless - walking behind porters on unpaved road surrounded by beautiful landscape. Unfortunately after no more than 5 km my wifes hiking boot start falling apart - sole part. Few km after same thing happened with mine as well. This  almost new ""top quality"" hiking boots we brought from Europe (funny enough, we didn't want to relay on hired ones). Fortunately our guide Freddy somehow arranged two pairs of second hand sneakers from the locals, so we could continue hiking. Wearing sneakers instead of hiking boots definitely didn't make trail easier ( soles of my wifes ones were a kind slippery and I felt mine a bit short). Nevertheless we continued watching every step and feeling every stone on the road.As read many reviews  people posted about Inca Trail  I had my expectations - once we climb Huarmi Wanusca - dead women pass at 4200 m.a.s.l, will become easier. Despite my expectations, soon I realized that going down is not easier than climbing up, and that a path is going up and down all the time. What seamed as flat part on the map usually is another steep climb or descend.  Simply every part of the trail was   almost equally hard. Now when analyzing it, I am rather convinced that there was not much difference between day 1, 2 and 3 and it seamed that all the days have been  rather equally balanced. No mater how hard and exhausting it was , my wife and me, we enjoyed every second of it. Beautiful landscape, birds and flowers and ruins of Inca settlements on every step.Thanks to a excelent organization of Skyperu and especially to our guide Freddy and his local connections, we made it and on a morning of fourth day we saw MacchuPicchu  emerging from the mist and showing it face to the sun - unforgettable."
One Day Inca Trail Hike,My brother in Law and I did the one day Macchu Pichu Inca Trail hike from Km104 a couple of weeks ago.Edgar from Enigma Tours was our guide. It was a brilliant day. As there was only the two of us we found our own pace. The views were spectacular and it wasn't as arduous as I expected except for the final Inca staircase which was very steep for someone with short legs! Approaching from the Sun Gate was unforgettable and a real sense of achievement.
Peru Treks and Adventure....Amazing!!!,"I have just spent 10 wonderful days in Cusco and during my stay I did the 4 day Inca trail trek with Peru Treks and Adventure. I had the most fantastic time and cannot rate this company highly enough. I was travelling alone and was a little apprehensive about the trek but I needn't have worried, everything was just perfect and so well organised I didn't have to worry about a thing. The trek itself is very challenging but I had an amazing group of people around me. The jewel in the crown was Ernesto and Jimmy our tour guides....they were fantastic and made sure every detail was taken care of. Ernesto was so knowledgable and kept me laughing and smiling even when I was struggling to get up to Dead Woman's Pass on day 2!!! I cannot thank Ernesto and Jimmy enough for making it a truly unforgettable trip.The food was a really great surprise...I don't think I've ever been so well fed! Our cook Lucio produced wonderful food for us every day with an awesome variety of dishes and flavours. I was certainly never hungry. The rest off the team, the porters, made sure our camp was always prepared for us when we arrived each day and they all worked so hard to make everything comfortable for us. I admire each and every one of them for the job they do. Of course there were some slightly less glamorous sides (you are hiking along an ancient trail after all!).... The toilets leave a lot to be desired but in my opinion it's just one of those things to get over and get on with. I had such a wonderful experience with Peru Treks, I really cannot fault them and they made my trip one I'll never forget."
"10/10 with Intrepid and guides Nep, Oscar and Shandi!","Quick overview: Booked through Intrepid. Guides (Nep, Oscar and Shandi) - excellent, happy, encouraging and definitely adjusted things to fit our needs as a group. Food - excellent. We had 3 course meals and even had desserts like flambayed bananas with chocolate sauce! What a treat. Porters - wow. These guys are like machines... and they all range in age, from 20 to 65. Impressive and you'll want to bring extra money just for putting you to shame (sometimes running past you with 20-25kg on their backs while you struggle step at a time with your 2.5kg day pack). Scenery - incredible. The trekking scenery is breathtaking and you'll want to stop and take pictures along the way. The archaeological sights you see along the way are impressive and the information from the guides allows you to imagine the places when they were used (Nep had a never-ending supply of props to help the stories). Machu Picchu - impressive, breathtaking, cultural... its everything you imagined and more. A trip that will be never forgotten.In-depth review: After hearing from fellow travellers that Machu Picchu was the hardest trek they did, we can honestly say we were stressing about the trek, but that was all put to rest when we met with our guide Nep the evening before. He explained the plans for the route, the pace and assured us that we were going to enjoy the trek, stop to take photos, enjoy the scenery etc. He stressed that it was not going to be a race but an experience that we could all take in and enjoy. Love this guy already, from the absolute start he was happy, funny and encouraging. He understood the dynamics of the group and was very accommodating to the people going at different paces (along with our 2 other guides Oscar and Shandi).The trek itself is beautiful. The first day you begin going along the river and the terrain is ""andean flat"" as Nep called it - meaning that it is very up and down but small, gradual increases, rather than steep. There are some steps towards the end of the day, but nothing major. We arrived at the camp to see the porters were already there, tents put up etc and they clapped us as we arrived (which was the theme of the next few days, even though they put us to shame with their energy, determination and sheer willpower!). They had a bowl of hot water for each person so we could wash with (this happened every day) - something that we greatly appreciated as we eyed up our stash of wet-wipes! In the evening Nep gave us the option for the next day to have lunch at the 4 hour mark (2nd major stop on the way up) or after the dead woman's pass. We opted for the latter as we just wanted to get the hardest part out of the way.So D-day arrived. Our second day but the hardest. 5-6 hours ""steep"" incline to the dead woman's pass and then a 1.5 hour descent to lunch afterwards. To be honest, it wasn't all a steep incline. There were parts that were gradual incline and then there were parts that were steep, also had difficult terrain that included steps made of random sized boulders - some of which were a bit of a step for a shorty like me. I advise to look for the smaller steps or flatter ground - mostly located on the edges. This helps to keep your muscles ticking over rather than wearing out quickly. Step at a time, right? Luckily for us, our guide seemed to know when we needed a break and always told us to break, drink water and enjoy the scenery - taking photos. So we made it to the dead woman's pass with a break up top to enjoy too. After around 30mins we left to begin the descent. This is where you are glad you bought/hired poles. If you don't have your knees in the correct place, you can put strain on them and affect the walking for the rest of your trip. Don't do this. Luckily for us we had a qualified physio trekking with us and she gave us some tips to save our knees. Its important to take your time and get your alignment correct. The rest of the day was pretty much the same - boulders with random sizes for steps and difficult terrain. This was the night Nep warned us as the coldest of the nights away - the highest camp that we stayed and my god it was cold. Layer up, dont be fooled by the sun that greets you! Hat, scarf, gloves, the lot! There was an option for a shower but the water would have been cold... we happily opted for our bowl of warm water :)The 3rd day is when we were all in awe by our surroundings more than ever. As well as grasping for our water, we had camera's at hand and snapping every few minutes. The views of the glaciers did it for us. Spectacular. The trekking itself is very straight forward on this day, and there are a lot of steps towards the end of the day - so make sure you're looking after them knees!Last day - very early start. We were again given the option to get up at 3am or 3.30am. This was to give the porters a chance to pack up and make the first train back to cusco. This is the only issue that we had. Of course we wanted to help out the porters that had worked so hard for us, but that also meant that we had to wait for 2 hours, in the cold for the check-in point to open (I forgot to mention that there are check in points along the way - checking people's tickets with the guides, etc). This was VERY cold but when we got going we were happy to move fast and get to the sun gate, because we wanted to be warm. Of course after 10 mins of walking fast we were all dropping layers as we were too hot. Never 100% happy haha! Anyway, we were one of the first groups to reach the sun gate and it was lovely. We got to watch the sun come up over Machu Picchu and eat our breakfast while doing it (last day we had a little packed lunch). Best breakfast view EVER! After breakfast and photos at the sun gate, we started our 45min descent into Machu Picchu, then outside to use the toilets that seems like the sparkliest toilets you've ever seen - luxury! We then went back in for a guided tour and some free time of Machu Picchu. At this point there are day tourists everywhere, and after 4 days of trekking you feel like you should have privilege for taking photos, not be shunned by someone for being in the way of their photo's - like I was. Anyway the site shows the intellect that the Incas had and is just impressive by the sheer magnitude and depth of the whole place. Unforgettable to say the least. There are Llamas & Alpacas on some of the sites which makes for a funny picture! At some points you may question if you/your knees can take anymore but every step, every incline, every descent and every sight is worth it. You will not be disappointed by this experience - totally worth every second."
Excellent Trekking Experience,"Legs are pretty stiff haha. We just finished the 4 day Inca Trail with Uncover Latin America. Couldn't recommend more highly. From our very first contact with Chris the Aussie guy who put this all together for us to Vanessa our lovely and amazing guide to the porters and the cooks. Many thanks. The trek was tougher than we expected but the experience was also above everything we imagined, and there's no finer finishing line than Machu Picchu. It's a good idea to spend some time in Cusco to acclimatize before hand, and drink plenty of water."
Incredible 4D/3N Inca Trail with Alpaca Expeditions.,"This classical Inca Trail is a once-in-a lifetime experience to walk the original Inca roads which lead to Machu Picchu. This is the most Incredible, Exhilarating, and Challenging Trek, however, it is also the most beautiful, intriguing, fascinating and captivating Trail ! It has approximately 26 miles thru valleys, meadows, mountains and jungles with about thousands of steps and an elevation of 13779 feet! The terrain and the stairs are all uneven stones and rocks which demand your full attention. We also passed by many magnificent Inca sites, waterfalls, rivers, cloud forest full of orchids, hanging mosses, tree fern and flowers.   We chose Alpaca Expeditions because this company has a great reputation and also they give back to their country and the community. They also take good care of their porters by paying them well with health and life insurance. We also chose them because they provide a private toilet on the trail. (This is a luxury that you truly appreciate for the 4 days hike).Alpaca did a wonderful job! Everything went very smoothly. The tents, the matts, the sleeping bags were nice and clean. The porters were very hard working, and very friendly (they took the time to cheer you when you got to the camp sites at the end of each day). The food were fabulous! It was amazing how the cook can provide such a high quality meals each lunch and dinner. The guide (Rozel) was very knowledgeable and informative on the history of the Incas and the trails. He is so patient and friendly. The Trail was very challenging physically and mentally. I have to mention that Rozel and his assistant Toribio were very helpful and kind to me. They helped me tremendously to get to the finish line! Without their help, I don’t think I could achieve my goal. Thanks to Rozel & Toribio, I barely survived the Inca Trail! It was very rewarding once we got to the Sun Gate with the most magnificent view of the mountains and Machu Picchu in all its glory! It is the most memorable experience!We were also very lucky to have beautiful weather during the Trek."
Inca Trail with G Adventures 10/10,"Reading the other reviews on here and some peoples unfortunate experiences makes me so happy I booked with G Adventures. I did the trek in the cross over between April/May. We met our team and were provided with the walking poles we hiried (Do it! You'll be thankful on the way down!) a snack bag and met our 3 guides, People have posted alot about how crowded the trail was, I didn't experience this at all. On day 1 I walked almost half of it alone or next to local people. Day 2 as you can clearly see the route up to dead woman's pass can seem more croweded but it was never a problem and day 3 except for a few small traffic jams, I mainly walked with a couple of friends without another person in sight! The final campsite was pretty crazy but that's to be expected. G provided us with an amazing team of porters and chefs, easily identified by the purple gear and backpacks. They treated them wonderfully, we all tipped well for their services and interacted at all camp stops. They all had a smile on their faces and were constantly mucking about together, playing games at camp during their time off periods and it made me feel happy I was contributing to a company that look after their staff. Our food was absolutley amazing and they even baked us a huge cake on day 3 for lunch!The trek itsself was tough but not impossible and it's mainly in your head when the altitude was making the uphill tough on day two. But I loved it and would do it again in a heart beat! Don't hesistate just book it! We had amazing weather, bright sunshine every day - except of course at the sungate which I hear is actually pretty common but the site cleared and allowed us amazing photos."
From Km 82 to Machu Picchu,Early June seemed a good time for the trek. Nights were not too cold and it did not rain when we did the trek.
Amazing experience!,"When I booked the trek, I made sure I chose a company who treat their porter well. I booked it with Perutrek. The trek was absolutely amazing! Our guides were very nice and the porters were fantastic! The chief we had was incredible. He maintained a high quality meals during all the trip."
absolutely a must for an adventure seekr,I chose to hike the trail for my 30th birthday. It was fantastic from start to finish. It is challenging but not terribly difficult. I loved the many ruins that we saw along the trail. I highly recommend Sam travel Peru as they are a local company that takes mostly small groups through the trail. It was a fantastic camping experience with gourmet food!!!
Well worth the Effort!,If you are considering visiting Manchu Picchu and are fit...you really should do the Inca Trail. You will see several Inca ruins along the way; that most visitors will never see! We did the one day trek...four days would be too much for us! it is a longer and tougher trek than you will be led to believe but do it anyways! The views and elevations were incredible. We saw amazing wild orchids just growing along the path( best seen in April). You climb up and down several mountains on your quest to the Sun Gate for your first view of Manchu Picchu. The view from the Sun Gate is amazing!!!!
Peru & the Inca trail,"This is just a brief overview, as the whole trip was just too much to write about! Firstly, we booked with Llama travel uk and the excellent service began immediately! From information & advice to help making choices about add-ons I cannot fault them! Llama travel booked our trips with the Peruvian company Condor Travel & they were amazing throughout! Very helpful guides - we were met from our flight in Lima by Felix, then Miguel for our Lima tour, Percy met us in Cusco airport, Ernesto, for our Sacred valley tour & Hose for our Inca sights in Cusco, finally we had Reuben in Puno for our Lake Titicaca & Uros Islands section. All marvellous!Our four day trip on the Inca trail was incredible! First we met Freddie one of our guides for the trip two nights before we began the trek, who gave us an overview & our duffel bags for the porters to carry some of our gear. It was going to be hard but our party of six from our hotel were up for the adventure! We had another free day to acclimatise to the altitude, then our trek began. Our coach picked the six in our hotel up at 6am and three lovely Americans from another hotel, then we were on our way to Urubamba for our final chance to buy snacks & water before travelling to the start of the trail.  Freddie & JJ  our two guides, helped us all to achieve our goal of getting through the four days. They were both so knowledgeable & supportive throughout! - 'don't worry about the altitude, its all about attitude!' The 12 porters were fantastic - they carried huge packs from camp to camp set up our tents & clapped as we arrived each evening! The chef & his assistant made wonderful meals every day for us, as good as any hotel! I wish I could tell you a day to day review but it would exceed the word space! Suffice to say that each day was a wonderful experience in fantastic surroundings. The fourth day we were up at 3am as we needed to depart early for the sun gate - our porters were all packed up & running with their equipment to catch the early morning train in Aguas Calientes; while we queued at the checkpoint before our final 6km to the sun gate where we saw our first glimpse of Machu Pichu through the mist We walked the last few hundred metres in a state of tiredness & exhilaration - we had made it to our goal! Machu Pichu was everything we expected & more, but thanks to our guides, porters & chef it was a four day experience which will never be forgotten. We all had a lovely cold beer in Aguas Calientes to round off the day before travelling back to Cusco on the train. After our final day in Cusco (which was a lovely town) we moved on to Puno, travelling on the Andean Explorer which was a beautiful 10 hour journey through the Andes to lake Titicaca; amazing sights, food & entertainment on board! We were met by our guide Reuben who took great care of us while seeing the Uros islands. There was a strike there for some public work which had been promised for over ten years but Reuben helped us to a trouble free time & although it meant we missed out on one of our visits, he got us to the airport & on to an early flight to avoid delays to our journey back to Lima. As we had to leave by 3am to avoid the disruption (for which we received compensation from Llama travel which had arrived by post before we were back home) Reuben provided us with blankets for the bus trip & couldn't have done any more to help us all. Thank you Llama travel, thank you Condor travel but most of all thank you to our fantastic guides! You made our trip into an unforgettable experience from beginning to end!"
The inca trail. Trek ,"I'm not going to post To many photos as that would ruin some of the trail. I can't describe just how amazing the trail is. From arriving in cusco and discovering areas of cusco to the day you leave, for the trail, and the day you arrive in Machu Picchu. There is excitement new trials and new views around every corner and each step. It's not the easiest trail. With big steps up and down, it takes its toll on your knees and legs. It can be very cold one second needing gloves, hats and coats. Then coming out into the sun and having to strip off everything. The altitude Max's at 4215m some of our group got headaches, but there are coca leaves to chew that relieve this. Having said all this when we did it a 78yr old man completed the same trail !!!!!! Proving mind over matter. If I can leave this review with one thing. I would advise you to do this if you can. We geeked with intrepid and they were great. The group of people you meet is amazing. And the trip was truly once in a lifetime. Also take a warm coat and a thin waterproof. They were so valuable. Also you can buy everything you ever need in Cuzco. So if you do forget something don't stress."
4day/3night inca trail,"We booked our inca trail through Magical Cusco which is a tour aggregator. Our treking agency was colibri (difficult to find them on trip advisor). We had a great time on our trek. We had booked a regular tour but since it was only my husband and I it ended up being a private tour. Our guide Miguel was very friendly and informative and kept with our pace. He gave us a through briefing before each day and accommodated any requests we had. They promptly picked us up at each destination and adhered well to the time. The food was excellent with 3 course meals everyday. Couldn't thank the cook enough for amazing food, they even made a cake for us on the last day. Would highly recommend them. We couldn't have asked for a better agency to do the inca trail."
Short Inca Trail (2days/1night) a Great Option,"If you're not sure about the 4D/3N Inca Trail tours and want to do more than get bussed up to Machu Picchu the 2D/1N tour is a great option.It's a train to Km104, pass the checkpoint to the ruins at Chachabamba, then to Winay Wayna, then on to Inti Punky (the Sun Gate). It's a 16km trek over around 6 to 7 hours that's steep in parts but manageable. You arrive at the Sun Gate at around 3.00pm and then head down to Machu Picchu for an hour or so of photos before getting bussed down to Aquas Calientes for dinner and a night in a hostal. Early next morning you get bussed up to Machu Picchu for a 2 hour guided tour of site before having a few hours on your own to explore and take more photos. That's the basics and different tour companies have slightly different itineraries so shop around.We went with SAS Travel. To be fair the tour was good and our guides were good as well. One helped one older lady in our group of 9 all the way which was great. One had good English and the other fair English.Now for the not so good bits. They said they would pick us up from our hotel at 4.00am. At the briefing they said we had to be at their office at 3.45am. When we complained they agreed to pick us up at 3.30am from our hotel. They didn't arrive until 3.55am which meant waiting in the cold for 25 min. From what we've found out they all try this on and blame the narrow streets.On the train our guides didn't travel with us and also one of our party was seated in another carriage. On the way to MP there was a spare seat in our carriage (?) but on on the way back. The guides not being with us lead to a few issues with the train staff who wanted to see our trail permits before letting us off but that got sorted.On the final day we were booked on a 6.10pm train so had to wait several hours in Aquas Calientes after our lunch at 2.00pm even though our guides caught an earlier train. There's only so much of the same souvenir stuff you can look at.Finally we were told there would be a SAS person with a sign at Ollantaytambo to pick us up and minibus us to Cusco. Didn't happen. Just about everyone had left when a guide from another tour company helped us by pointing out the SAS representative. We were then put on a minibus and waited there for 25min before anyone came to us. After a few choice words about the delay we were put on a full size bus and headed off the Cusco. End result we arrived in Cusco at 10.15pm ons not 8.30pm as indicated. 5 of our group had early flights the next mortal were not happy.I raised these issues with SAS via their website but not response in over a week. They managed to respond in a day when it related to money. Funny about that.Don't let this put you off there are many other tour companies that do the same trek.Hope you enjoy MP as much as we did. All in all very worth it."
"Beautiful, challenging, quiet. Highlight of the trip, 5/5.","I booked the classic Inca Trail with Kandoo Adventures. I found them to be friendly, knowledgeable and efficient. All round first class from the airport pickup to airport drop-off. I undertook the classic Inca trail with Alexandro. His ability to name all the flora and fauna was outstanding coupled with his sense of humour made for a wonderful few days trekking to Machu Picchu; so much so, that the stunning trek itself was the highlight of the trip. Well done Solrida, Alexandro, Juan Carlos, I've come away from Peru with nothing but glowing memories and reviews. Fabulous 5/5."
Travel the Inca Trail with Adios Adventure Travel,"Just back from a thoroughly wonderful 12-day tour in Peru. Every arrangement with Adios, from the first discussions with Jacquie to the last, relieved, exhausted and happy step down from Wayna Picchu, was a quality experience. My husband and I talked our parents into this trip as a group of 5, and the custom itinerary Heather and Jacquie put together affordably met everyone's needs and more. All hotels were comfortably three-star, yet unique and well-located. We were well-informed and in direct communication with the main office before and throughout. The capable and safe drivers, professional, knowledgeable, and dedicated guides, and friendly local hosts in Lima, Ica (Nasca), Puno/Titicaca, Chinchero, Maras, and Cusco made our travel a memorable, unique pleasure.  Because I want to give them a global shoutout: Kelly Masias in Lima, Juan Carlos with Jumbo in Puno, Vidal Jaquehua in Cusco and most of all the tireless Hubert Jaquehua Callo all over the land of Inca Power!, thank you. We will always remember this experience."
