Stunning view,"Cool view even with the clouds! Just a little bit more crowded than I like, but it’s worth it.Nice and not too expensive cafe up there ☺️"
The Mountain Range of Ancient Gods,"The Tahtalı/Olympos Mountain Range is a remarkable natural beauty in Antalya. According to the ancient Roman/Greek Myth, these were the mountains of Gods. You have a chance to reach the top (app 2300m) via a sky lift. You can go to the sky lift by bus/car. At the entrance and top station, there are cafes. At the top, you also have some  chance to make paragliding."
This is an interesting adventure.  ,"This is an interesting adventure.  The rise on the fenikulere and descent from it capture.  You watch from a window with altitude how climatic zones change from subtropics to almost polar.  It is very cold at the top of the mountain even in summer.  From the top of the mountain and when you climb the mountain there is a beautiful view.  But I recommend to visit this place only in clear weather.  If you come in cloudy weather, then you will not see all the beauty of the coast."
beautiful experience,"beautiful experience but very very very cold, nice view. a good fresh air. just amazing place to take pictures and to be away from the city and everyone. a couple of moments to feel the earth"
Absolutely good trekking to the top,"We left from Beycik and went on the top. The trail is very well marked, first traverse the wood and then stony, dry part of mountains. The views were amazing! Very nice restaurant on the top (especially giant chocolate muffins!). Really suggest that route it's much more interesting than the cable car."
Splendid View,"Tahtalı Mountain is a majestic mountain in the north of Kemer. Ascending the peak point of 2365m with the aerial tramway, you can see the heart stopping landscape of Çıralı and Olympos beach. You should certainly have a cup of coffee and if you have enough courage you should try paragliding. Don’t forget to have thick clothes cos it’s cool up there."
"Great place, visit is a must","To cable car substation we reached by rented car, it is the most comfortable way to get there, but not cheap. There is also possibility to catch dolmus, for example from Kemer to Tekirova, you have to get off on the crossroad at main road. From there you can take minibus operated by Olympos Teleferik, that take you to substation. Ride by cable car was really fun for me. Views are amazing and the trip is really fast, something about 10 minutes. On the top you can buy something to eat, souvenirs or enjoy paragliding in tandem. Views of the coast and mountains are really great. You will not forget them for a long time."
Amazing place,Better to go there on sunny day. View from mountain is spectacular. Bar is very expensive so my advice to take something with you.
Great Views must see,"it is a spectacular view not to miss, easy to book and the cable car is safe and easy to get on.  Make sure you go."
View,"Very nice view, where my boyfriend propose to me, whats make this place unforgetable.. A little bit cold but very fresh air."
Love it!!!,"It was amazing !! We enjoyed our trip, definitely something to do if you are in Turkey!! I was a bit scared at first but everything is great and smooth. The professional pictures were such a good quality. Thank you."
Tahtali Mountains,Visited this place with young kids. This tour does not require a tour guide. Just needs a taxi there and back and entrance fees can be paid when you reach the place. It’s called Olympos Telefrik.
"Telepherique up, walk down","Just don't get lost, as we did.Great walking! Fabulous scenery. well worth a visit. You can parachute down from the top (with a guide) for $200, and it takes 40 minutes - all the way to the beach from 2300m!"
Breathtaking views,"We did this as part of an excursion offered by Thomas Cook and we were blown away by the views from the top.  Yes the cable cars get full up (70 passengers) but there was still lots of room in there and in 10 minutes you have reached the summit 2365 meters high.  The temperature is normally 12 degrees lower so I would recommend taking an extra layer to put on once you reach the top.  Once up the top you can literally see for miles, all of the coastline along to Antalya as well as across the whole mountain range.  There is a cafe at the top so you can get a drink and something to eat whilst soaking up the views.  I would highly recommend doing this trip."
Good but not great,Too many people squashed into the cable car made for an unpleasant trip both up and down the mountainThe view from the top was okay but truly not really specialIf you need something to do to pass the time give it a go but don't have too high expectations
Feel the Endless ,"We decided to go up while sunbathing by the sea and take a drive to half of the mountain. If you are wearing short and tshirt ,dont forget to take your Jacket with you. When you reach up the hill,the wiev is great and you fell the Endless. İt's quite expensive per person but you can experience once."
Amazing ,It is a safe trip to the highest mountain Up the mountain you can discover the sea view and mountain view in cold weather even during hot summerThere is a restaurant up which can serve you in food and drinks
Amazing!,"All our family liked it very much! Amazing place to visit and to think how nature is GREAT! You need to see it, photo is nothing comparing to fillings!"
If you want a  view of Kemer from on high buy a post card,"All standing cable car squished in bored on the way up squished in bored on the way down,Oh nearly forgot  there's a boring bit in the middle.Look North look South look east look west and your all done.  Two persons equals waste of  £72."
Perfect view,The road through the pinewood forest before you reach the cable car is a must see. The journey to the top of the mountain is lovely and the scenery on top of the mountain is beautifull. Bit expensive but a must do.
Cable car ride,"we went on a trip organised by Vigo tours to the Olympos Cable car ride to Tahtali mountains ,very good photo opportunity with spectacular views from top ,take a coat for the top as cold on mountain ,We were then taken to Kemer and had 2 hours free time for lunch or walk to sea and shop ,would recommend this trip to anyone Guide was very nice spoke good English and very helpful."
Fab views,"We've been here twice and enjoyed both times. Lovely views. I'd recommend a coffee at the top, as the prices were fairly reasonable."
European mountain roads,"Ultra smooth driving experience, with hills and lots of trees ending up at tahtali with good view of Antalya, kinda cold though.."
Amaizing View,"If you like trekking, you can try to walk top, just 2363 meters. I did. You can see different kinds of plants on your walking."
On top of the world.,Lovely and scenic. The views are outstanding and its nice to feel the breeze on a hot day. Always have good footwear when walking around here and plenty of water. This is a must for visitors to get away from the hussle and bussle.
Feeling closer to the sky,"If you are not afraid of climbing with a cable car, it will be an unforgettable trip to the top of Tahtali mountain over the pine trees. The Mediterranian sea is under your feet and a wonderful view to watch."
Wonderful view.,"This cable car ride is really something special.I am not very good with heights and was not looking forward to it, however, the Swiss engineering and spectacular views made it all worthwhile.The ride up was a little bumpy but at no time did it feel unsafe.Once at the top we were amazed at the views and the modern cafes and facilities. Well worth a visit."
Blue skies,"Visited on an organised trip on a morning of blue , cloudless skies. A little crowded in the lift but no problem and well worth it at the top . Didnt bother with the professional photographers , took our own instead and worked out fine ."
Really high ,"If you have the chance to see it ; don't hesitate , it's really worth a visit , you can see the a lot and on a very high point 2346m , there is good cafe on the top they offer tasty breakfast , the views are stunning and the cable car is so enjoyable , something unforgettable ."
Tahtall mountains,It would have been a great day had the weather been better as it was very cloudy so we were above the clouds and could not see anything and it rained
View from the Top,"Who would have thought what should have been a 10-min prep to jump off a cliff would leave me spending half a day at the Tahtali summit? At 2365m, we were told Tahtali is the highest mountain near the coastline in the whole of Europe so we just had to go paragliding off it of course. Come the morning of our adventure, we took the cable car taking in the silence and spectacular views of the Mediterranean reaching the summit in less than 10min. Once kitted out, the wind changed direction so what should have been ten minutes spent at the top to get ready and jump off became a three hour wait for the right weather conditions. What else to do but enjoy the cool mountain breeze on a hot and humid August day and the delicious mint lemonade – one of the best I have ever tasted – at the Shakespeare Bistro while enjoying people-watching. There are quite a few day trips here so there is always some action at the top including of course the catapult which looked super fun but at $25 a pop we weren't going to be persuaded to give it a go. Instead, we took a little walk with one of our pilots from the west to the east platform - not for the faint hearted but the 360 degrees view of the pine trees and the sea was well worth it. ps. If you ask the cafe waiters the chances are they will tell you the wifi doesn't work, just snoop around for the password and you'll find it written across the building. :)"
"Nice overview, but no possibility to walk out from fenced area.","Nice overview of the sea area from the mountain perspective. Nevertheless, no possibility to make even short walk from the station as the station is surrounded by fence."
Breathtaking but chose a clear day,"Visited here in August with family. The problem with a pre booked excursion is that you can't book the weather as well. We were lucky as the clouds that often surround the peak cleared long enough for us to enjoy the stunning view and get pictures. Take a jacket or warm cardi as even in the heat of summer the peak is cold to freezing.The cable car ride to the summit is an amazing experience in itself although again low cloud banks can obscure the view. The cars take eighty people a time so it can feel a little claustrophobic. If you want a boarding tip it would be this. Eighty people are counted into a boarding queue with a scanned pass. If you can see from the queue that you are not going to get by the window hang back make yourself last to get on that means letting everyone board before yourself. As you step on to the cable car the doors close behind you, turn round and you are right in front of the glass doors. A perfect view. Be aware of the summit photographers they insist on taking a stack of pics this way and that. It can work out at hundreds of pounds for them. We nearly paid £200 sterling for 18 pics that we really didn't need."
Do not miss so stunning view !,"It is no cheep, but this stunning trip worth the money you spend ! Wonderful view from Switzerland-made cabin and unforgettable from upper point. .Tahtali mountain is about 2365 metres high. A four-story building at the top offers a souvenirs shop and good Shakespeare-cafe with authentic Turkey coffee.                                                          For the most daring have gum-jumping with a view of the whole Turkey! (See my pics!)."
Go here!,Well worth paying the money The view from the top is superb but choose your day for a clear cloudless visit.
Breathtaking view,"If you decide to spend your holiday in Kemer you must visit this place.Tahtali mountain is amazing .It is about 2000 metres high and when you go on the top you can see beautiful view on the coast.Also, there is a caffe where you can enjoy drinking some turkish tea and relax on fresh air.Up there it is very windy and cold so you need to pick up a jacket.You travel by cable car for about 15 minutes, which is also nice experience.All in all i recommend visiting this place"
This is Olympus Telefric,"Wonderful ride to base station, nice views from base plaza, and snow topped mountain views at top plaza.Smooth cable car ride.Do not miss this if you are in Antalya."
A view to die for,"Traveled by cable car to the top of Tahtall Mountain and what a great trip it was, a beautiful vista opens before you and it is in more ways than one breathtaking. We booked through a local tourist office in Kemer (Maxwell Tours) and the service was good. It was also cheaper than going through the hotel rep. We saw some people paragliding off the top of the mountain but not for me though. At the top you were able to get refreshments and a snack if you wanted to and the service was good.Just be aware of the photographers at the top they were a bit in your face and started to take pictures of you even when we said no.It was a great experience from beginning to the end."
great views and good fun,Great trip and looked after all the way. Lots of stops and not to scary for those people like me that don't like hieghts.
above the clouds,went here on the cable car you feel like your standing on top of the world it was breathtaking. the cable car ride was exiting and heart pounding
BLESSED RELIEF FROM THE HEAT & HUMIDITY!!,"This experience was a treat from beginning to end:1. We loved the tram ride to the top. It was fun to ride it it with a group of teenage girls, who screamed with every bump!! The same girls formed a Turkish flag at the top with their bodies. (see photo below)2. My husband did the elastic sky-jumping experience. He was willing to yell a little and the operators offered him a 2nd ride for free just for his yelling.(see photo)3. The outdoor restaurant served GOOD Americano Coffee. The service was excellent.4.Best of all, the temperature was wonderful. We stayed 2 or 3 hours and soaked it up!!!"
top of the world,"Well worth a visit. Spectacular views both driving up to the cable car, from inside cable car and from the top. Organised this trip with local tour firm Maxwell's slightly cheaper than Thompson's. Downside is that the cable car is packed and on the return journey people tend to think that they don't have to queue,this was mainly Russians who seemed to use this method every where."
"Beautiful, don't miss it","A pricy, but very well organized trip, recommend to use the SeatoSky door to door transfer (EUR 10/person instead of EUR 50 what the hotel offered).Perfect view from the peek!"
mother nature,"we got there by taking the teleferique wonderful panoramic views, specially from the creasts.to get to the teleferique you take a wonderful paved road climbing among a pine forest."
Well worth the trip,We enjoyed the views and watching the paragliders and the sky park victims being flung around! The views were amazing above the clouds.
Excellent 11 minutes experience in the cableway,Amazing view from the cableway and from the summit of Tahtali mountain at 2365 m. Highly recommended.
Fabulous view of Mediterranean sea,"During my summer holiday in Beldibi / Kemer, I made a trip to Tahtali summit of mountain Olympos. This is the highest mountain in Turkey with sea overview. According to mythology, Olympos is named ""The mountain of Gods"" and its summit Tahtali of 2365 meters is place where Zeus met Hera.I booked this trip at tour desk Tez Tour at my hotel. Also, travel agencies as like TUI, Jolly Travel and other ones organize this trip. If there isn't any mentioned tour desk at your hotel, there are numerous local travel agencies near your hotel as like Ginza Travel, Maxwell and other ones that organize the same trip. This pleasure cost me 55 USA $.I was picked up in front of my hotel and bus drive lasted for 40 - 45 minutes from my hotel in Beldibi to the lower station of cable car. The ride by modern, new and safe cable car lasted for 10 minutes and it was so interesting, full of excitement. When I got at Tahtali, I was rewarded with stunning view of Mediterranean coast and sea. It is really fabulous experience when you have an ice cream, cake or drink and at the same time you enjoy spectacular view. This was an excellent escape from heat on the beach. I refreshed my body and my soul had a beautiful rest.There are possibilities for daily and evening visits. For better photos choose morning or sunset visit. If you are a romantic soul, you could book evening visit and watch sunset. As I know, Wednesday and Sunday in August are reserved for this pleasure. Meeting point is lower station of cable car at 19.10 and ride to the summit is at 19.15. If you are adventure type, then you could take paragliding flight. Tahtali is the highest paragliding center of the world. A flight on average lasts for 30-45 minutes and anybody can fly from the age of 5 with a licensed instructor. Landing point is on the public sandy beach in Tekirova. More information on www.escape.com.trThe future visitors, whatever you choose, have an enjoyable time!"
good choice for everyone who likes nice views or who needs rest from heat :),"Cable car is around 15 km from Kemer, 60 km from Antalya. It´s nice half day trip, with good conditions you can see mountains on one side and whole Antalya in other one. One way with cable car takes around 20 minutes. You can combine it with trip to Phaselis or Olympos beach."
"Nice, nice, nice","Took a trip to Tahtali because didn't want to spend all the day in a bus or walking in heat with children. And it was a great choice! Children were excited by 15min way in cable car, rather speedy with amazing views around. On the top : it is different Turkey - more calm, even more impressive. Sure that everyone will find his own way to spend some time there: a thrill on sky jumping or a drink in a bar - definitely incredible feelings :)"
Amazing view,"From the top of Tahtali mountain, there is an amazing view to the inland mountain and to the seaside. The teleferic can help you to go on the top during the warm weather."
STUNNING well worth the visit,I was pretty nervous about getting in a cable car especially in Turkey but as it was built by Swiss ( so I knew it would be stable and well made) I gave it a whirl.The cable experience was fun if not a bit nerve wracking but I'm so glad I did it. It took 10 minutes to get up there and the views on route to the top were beautiful. With the national forest below and Mountains as we kept going up what more can you want. There are some stunning views and it's a welcome break from the heat as its cooler up there. You get some great pictures up there and some memories that will last forever. I had a coffee at the cafe at the top and that was very nice aswell as the brownie- that was incredible!!!
Spectacular,"A must do trip!  Scary if you don't like heights!  We took a private taxi, cheaper than a rep trip and he waited for us to bring us back!"
Good ,Nice mountain trip it wastes sometime of your day.. But it's really not worth it without the parachute.. Parachute costs 300$ ..
Cable car,"Visit up the mountain on the cable car was amazing. The views were staggering and watching the paragliding was breathtaking. There were even patches of snow still up there, considering hot hot it was down in the valley. Well worth the visit."
Nice 1/2 day trip,Half day trip up to the top of Tahtali via the cable car. 15 min wait at bottom and as long a you avoid the Russian stampede to get best spots on the car (sadly manners haven't reached our friends from the east) the trip up the mountain is only 10 mins. Once up top you are greeted with wonderful views along the Bay of Antalya. Also a nice restaurant at the top...recommend the Apple Pie. The break from the searing heat of sea level is quite refreshing too - 12 C at the top. I would thoroughly recommend  this trip as it is only a half day at most from Kemer.
4 hours excursion,Tahtali is great. I paid 120 USD for 2 adults + child at Maxwell tour office in 5 minutes walk from the Alkoclar hotel.
Tahtali Mountain cable car,"We took the cable car on the last day of our holiday. It was fairly expensive but well worth it.The journey up was spectacular, and the views from the top amazing. We spent quite a while at the top, and ate outside at the cafe. The restaurant wasn't open on the day we went up. Food was expensive but was.such a good view!It would have been improved if they had shown how it was built, with a small display of photographs."
Spectacular says it all,"We done this trip as part of a day excursion. Getting from the bottom top the top by cable car was an experience in itself. Apart from the stomach churn when the car goes over the pylons it was a wonderful climb. As you ascend to the top the views change and it seems like you will never get to the top, overall I think it took about 10 minutes. When you get to the top well all I can say is WOW. We had a good morning where the were no clouds so the view was something not to be missed. There was some snow and it does get quite cold so take something to cover up your arms that will keep the chill off. I used a sarong which was sufficient. There was a couple who decided to parachute down, off they went and within a few minutes the cloud came and they were no where to be seen. I believe the parachute jump has to be pre booked in advance.There is a slingshot ride and this seemed popular. We spent roughly 45 minutes on the mountain and I think that was more than enough time to take photos etc. We had a coffee in the café that we thought was not over the top in cost. There is a small souvenir shop and professional photographers who want to take a picture of you to purchase. They were a little bit annoying as it took 3 or 4 no thanks and a final very sharp NO for them to go away. The trip back down was as amazing as the trip up. I would recommend this as a break from your hotel if you want something to do that is quite tranquil but has that WOW factor"
Just amazing,"Sorry, guys, will not write too much, just simply  - go there! Unfortunately I got there with no snow but the view is still amazing. Really worth going. Starting from escalator and then the view to the mountain. Though the price for a ticket is a bit expensive."
Tahtall mountain excelent,"Great views, good value for money, snow in the morning, sunbath in the afternoon, don't forget your camera"
Amazing views,We loved this travelling up the mountain from around 29c to 5c in the snow and having our pictured take  and printed quiet cheaply. Only downside for us was not much English is spoke here so this was a barrier for us as it was our first time in turkey.
Fascinating,"The view on the top of Tahtali mount is fantastic, but we did not really like that the cable car was full of people and I could not get to the window to enjoy the views."
Phantastic,Pure nature. In off-season not many people around. For the Lycian Way definately a good trail guide needed.
Sea to Sky cable car,Great half day out with stunning views of the snow capped mountains and the fantastic coastline.  Shakespeare café was reasonably priced for lunch.  Take your gloves and wrap up during early season as it was minus 7 at the top.
sea to sky,"beautiful view from the top of the mountain Tahtali and excellent service with the sea to sky option,"
Pick your day,"You are 7000 ft up a mountain, with great views. Pick your day. Even on a clear sunny day you can have cloud around the summit so check first. Cost around 30 euros (£24) from Kemer. £48 if you book it through a rep."
Sea to sky,"Great morning, You definitely need to check the weather forecast beforehand, But if it's clear or even just a bit cloudy the views are fantastic. We had the added bonus of watching some mad people throwing themselves off the top while paragliding. If you are feeling extra brave you can book it while up there."
wonderful trip with cable car,"Nice trip in the morning to see sunrise! Quite cold, but what a view to rising sun and surroundings  from the top of the mountain!"
Sea to Sky cable car,Brilliant trip .. Pick your day to make sure weather good. Views fantastic on a clear day. Maxwell tours let you book on the day .. Costs less than through your holiday rep too!
Tahtall Mountains Trip,"I guess this trip is worth the money - we were simply a little bit unlucky with the weather...when we were up there it was cloudy and muddy so we did not get the ""full experience"" there ;-)"
sea to air cable car trip,Loved the cable car trip views as we travelled up the mountain - great experience. Mountain top - views not quite as good as the cloud & mist came down quite quickly on the day we visited.
Spectacular,"6 of us were on holiday in Kemer and decided to do something different for an afternoon trip, we were not disappointed !The cable car ride up is quite smooth in a large, modern cabin.  The whole trip is well organised and feels totally safe even though you are a long way above ground.Views from the top are spectacular, you can see for miles and are above cloud level.  The mountain itself is quite barren apart from pine trees which thin out as you get higher up.The cable car station at the top is quite a large building with a cafe and is several storeys tall - how did they get all the building materials up there ?  Maybe they took them up in the cable car ... ?The mountain is spectacular but the cable car is the real star of the show for me, not to be missed !"
well worth a visit,"A trip up mount Olympus on a cable car. Magnificent views and a c o negotiable safe ride in the modern New cable car .cars c a n hold up to 80 people. But I don't t think I would want t o be in with that many. The fewer people in it t h e more relaxing it is as  you can move freely and take a advantage of all the stunning views..takes approx 10 minutes to get to the top. You will have to go through cloudy patches most days but that can add d to the experience. Once at the top three views (if clear) are amazing. You can eat and drink at the cafe bar,coffee shop and restaurant. A little pricey by Turkish standards but acceptable. You can now paraglide from the top down to tekirova..... I will definitely be doing that next year. The only thing to be elsewhere of is the weather..if it is very cloudy you won't see anything at all."
