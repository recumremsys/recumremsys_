Wonderful museum with varied collections,"The building is very fine both inside and out. Booking a free timed entry online is easy and the staff are good at explaining how they are dealing with Covid. We went to the top and worked down with one of the best exhibits being in the 1st room; they had some old artworks and then examples of the work done by students studying painting techniques - the skill displayed is superb. There are plenty of very fine paintings from many different eras and far better than you expect from a museum outside London. There are old timepieces, furniture, porcelain and ancient artefacts including some excellent pieces from Egypt. We ran out of time and after a while you tend to get overloaded so we will be coming back again."
Incredible Egyptian section,I brought my dad for the day as part of his birthday and it was fab! Harriet who was looking after the Egyptian section brought it to life in a way we simply were not expecting. She was so sweet and humble. She was willing to take the time to answer any and all questions. Honestly telling us when she didn't know something. She showed us details that if you were not told or knowledgable. She made the trip worth it 1000% more than the beautiful art and artifacts alone. The building is just as fab too. If you get the chance please go see it its stunning.With covid they have made a very clean and safe one way route and all staff were very supportive.
Too much to see! ,"The museum is a great way to spend a couple of hours in Cambridge. The staff were really helpful and friendly, and they’ve got loads of COVID processes in place. There is so much to see that we started skipping some galleries because we couldn’t fit it all in (there are quite a lot of ceramics and pottery which isn’t really my thing personally). It’s worth the admission price just to see the magnificent main entrance hall."
A must do when in Cambridge,"Despite Corona rules this was a wonderful morning spent at this FREE Museum.An amazing collection covering every area of the world, art and cultural gems from every age. Leave time to make sure you see as much as you can."
More than expected.,"More impressed than I expected, most people will find something to interest them. In one room the ceiling was to me more interesting than all the pictures on the walls. However after a couple of hours we hadn't seen everything and my face mask was starting to dig into my ears, so we'll have to come back another time."
A bit of everything.,"There is a bit of everything here. A lovely place to spend a day. Cafe was very good (covid safe). Loved the Egyptian section, and the items from Cyprus. Very well displayed."
Amazing museum,"Lovely museum, they had some lovely items in to look at, staff were lovely and very friendly, loved it"
Wonderful exhibits,Beautiful museum hosting a wide range of interesting exhibits. We especially loved the ceramic collection. Entrance is free but you need to book in advance.
Something for everyone here,"Staff were very helpful, there were hand sanitiser stations around and lockers to use if you need them. It is quite big so lots of room to socially distance but you must pre book a time slot. I went at 3pm and it was perfect, 2 hours is enough time to see everything but you might want longer if you go to the shop or café.  The museum has an excellent collection ranging from sarcophaguses to paintings by Monet to armour worn by soldiers hundreds of years ago. The downstairs rooms are dedicated to objects and ""things"" whilst the upstairs is dedicated almost entirely to the paintings collection (save for the temporary exhibits)."
excellent venue,"one of the, if not the Best Museum's every visited. something for everyone on 3 different levels housed in an outstanding building.really friendly staff, and its all free but can leave a donation if you wish."
Great Museum,"We have been wanting to visit for sometime & not disappointed as probably the best llmruseum we have seen, with great staff and a wide range of quality exhibits. Malt too large & warrants a  return trip"
"Ceramics and armour, what else do you need?","Visited the Fitzwilliam Museum as part of a school project for my son. If you want to visit, you need to book ahead on the museum website. The staff were thorough with their COVID-19 precautions and directed us around the museum allowing for adequate social distancing. Highlight of the trip are the impressionist paintings - plenty to see, so give yourself a couple of hours."
Super helpful staff,"Online booking essential. You can walk around all day if you wish. No hot food in cafe at present. Everything obviously well cleaned. Good for the less able and wheelchairs available, access al areas. Plenty of seats to rest during viewing as there is a lot to see. Online information will show you how much they have. The staff here appear naturally friendly."
The paintings collection is amazing!,"Italians (Venetian school) British from 17th to 20th century, Dutch Flemish and Impressionists. Just a joy!"
Underwhelming ,"The Covid measures make this visit a little uncomfortable as you have to keep masks on all the time. But there are fewer people to contend with.   The exhibits are a bit dry - paintings are dark and dreary (most from the Rennaisance period) but the actual building is stunning and as it’s free, worth a visit."
Art,"Happy I pre-booked tickets for this museum, definitely worth a visit, so many interesting rooms to see, the Italian room definitely worth it!!"
awesome11,"Really enjoyed spending a couple of hours going round the museum. There were a lot of art on the higher floor, I really like traditional paintings and my hubby appreciates modern art and there were a mixture of both (although more my type of art...hoooray!!). My two teenages were a bit bored of the art floor but got really into the artifacts on the ground floor. The age of some of the items were mind-boggling.....2000BC!!!You need to book a time slot in advance, I had to book a few days in advance but I think that was because it was the bank holiday weekend so it was quite busy. We all felt very safe regarding Covid-19 guidlines. Well worth the visit x"
This place is out of this world!,Everything’s masterpiece from Renaissance to Greek artifacts.Cons: You need to wear a face mask inside because of COVID including taking pictures or selfies with the artwork.
Excellent mini British museum,"Last year visited ""the fitz"" as its known locally, for an exhibition on fans with a friend, a lovely museum and an excellent very good exhibition, there are many other interesting things to see as well, really worth a visit."
lovely place,been coming to this place for the past 40 years  some of it has changed some stayed the same lovely since a kid in school and still enjoy it
Questionable Labels,"I recently viewed the new and rather small, but dramatic and challenging exhibition in Gallery 10.The Iranian artist’s own wall label for his work (Action 125) describes the terror and vulnerability of the person they have sculpted, and the times from which it is taken from.  They are sensitive to the victim it portrays.The opposing museum label compares the bound Prisoner of War against the Saint Sebastian (by Renaissance artist Berruguete), also within the room, venturing that the damaged and bound individuals were erotic.  It seemed completely out of place and insensitive.Each of the sculptures are people who are bound and injured against their will, surely this should not be sexualised?  In any other context it is completely wrong and in violation of human rights to do so.Had it been an image of another suffering man (instead of Saint Sebastian), say Jesus on the cross, would it have been appropriate to use the phrase erotic desire? Furthermore the use of the phrase “Temptingly Vulnerable” to describe the Prisoner of War sculpture is encouraging a disgusting behaviour of sexualising someone who is under attack, and clearly not consensual.You shouldn’t need to venture into the bounds of Major Sadism, on the walls of what I used to regard as a Family Friendly museum!  In the same room that local children had their work displayed only last year.I feel like it’s one thing to challenge perspectives and psychoanalyse in an academic article, that can be hidden using parental locks, and another thing when it’s on a wall to be seen by very young impressionable minds.I had not heard of Saint Sebastian being a Gay Icon before visiting this exhibition, admittedly only knowing that the Saint was sentenced to death for converting Romans to Christianity, and about his miraculous survival (though temporary).  The label did nothing to help explain this point, and simply appeared to state it like it was a known fact.  I was intrigued, but the staff did not know of it either.The exhibition ended asking how I as an observer felt about the objects on display, however, I was more mortified by the museum’s label."
Great for a free visit!,"We didnt expect much for a free attraction and we started at the top with the art section. Initially we thought it was a bit small but as we progressed the galleries got bigger and more grand. We dont tend to read all the material but still managed at couple of hours casually strolling around. Ground floor had a good mixture of galleries, Romans, Egyptian, sudanese, ottomans etc...so something for every interestYou do need to book online in advance....though we saw some people be advised to use their phone to book a slot on the day."
Good way to spend a couple of hours!,"Visited on a Saturday morning. Ticket booking in advance was easy, and ensured the museum maintained a good capacity. There were one way arrows on the floor to help maintain social distancing. Great way to spend a couple of hours in Cambridge for free."
Well worth a visit,"Visited today and what a great place. They have a large amount of collections from many different periods of history and from all over the world. The amount of paintings they have is amazing. Make sure to visit the Greek section as they have some impressive pieces in there and golden ceiling with statues around the outside is outstanding. Younger children may find it a bit boring though. The COVID guidelines are being well managed also, face masks must be worn, one way system in place and hand sanitizer everywhere. The 2 ladies on reception this morning where brilliant and very informative."
A Pleasant Way to View a Plethora of Different Art,"There weren't many visitors when we were in the Fitzwilliam which meant that we could easily enjoy the art and artefacts without having hoards of other people in front of us.The cafe is run by the Tate and is very clean, well organised and sensibly priced. We were pleased that they were participating in the government's Eat Out to Help Out.We enjoyed this museum and  particularly liked the armour and the Egyptian mummies!"
A real Treasure,"This is a fantastic museum which is absolutely free to enter. Some of the local residents do not really know or visit this museum - they are really missing out.  The Fitzwilliam Museum is actually the art and antiquities museum of the University of Cambridge. The treasures of the museum include artworks by legends Monet, Picasso, Rubens, Vincent van Gogh, Rembrandt, Cézanne, Van Dyck, and Canaletto. There is so much to see her, the Egyptian, Greek & Roman collections, the Ceramics, Arms & Armour, really there is something for everyone and it is all housed within the most magnificent building. The main marble layered foyer alone is worth a visit such is its magnificence. The staff are very helpful and made me feel very welcome. Overall an experience that I can thoroughly recommend."
Food exhibition,A very exciting and innovative exhibition. Up to the usual exceptional standard of this marvellous museum - well done  !!
Great Museum,Really really enjoyed our visit here. Was not expecting to see so many wonderful pieces of art. Super Collection.
Quality collections housed in a stunning building,"The building itself is a thing of beauty, range of items displayed in this museum is very impressive and, to the layman,  the presentation and quality match that of the British Museum.  The Greek, Roman and Egyptian rooms overflow with treasures and the Illuminated Manuscripts defy description.   Well worth a half day investment."
Wonderful ,"I visited this museum during a school trip to Cambridge. It was wonderful. The building is very impressive and really big. There is something for all tastes, between painting, satue, vase,... you will inevitably find your happiness. I advise you to often look up at the beautiful ceilings. A guide is not necessary, because there is so much to see. I really loved this museum and recommend it to all visitors of Cambridge."
Huge Museum,"The Fitzwilliam Museum has numerous paintings that retrace each periods. There's painters form all Europe. There's a lot of room and it's easy to get lost. I really like the room with paintings of flowers and the 20th century collection. There's also a lot of sculpture, ceramic, weapon and others things. I advise you to visit this museum. Everyones can find something they like"
nice visit,"A beautiful museum that reflects Cambridge. The exterior is beautiful with the golden and pink pineapple and also this large building. It's a big museum where I got lost more than once. There are so many things to look at that you get lost in it. Museums in England are very different from those in Switzerland. The Swiss museums are more focused on one painter or one country and in England you can find all the countries and all the painters. From a personal point of view, I liked this museum even if it was difficult to stay focused and see everything. A small piece of advice, you should go to this museum when it rains and take advantage of the good weather to stay outside and visit the rest of the city. This museum can be a way to have fun despite bad weather."
Museum,We went with a whole class to The Fitzmuseum last day and visited it. I didn’t find it that attractive because for me the museum didn’t got any logic. The masterpieces inside where amazing but not interesting for me. There where a few floors which all had a different theme but none of them had something to do with each other. Some parts like the Egyptian exposition was very interesting to see and had a beautiful collection of old antiquity.
A beautiful museum !,"I very enjoyed the visit of this museum because you could see everything there. It is not only a museum of applied art but also of sculptures or pottery. The epochs of the works and their origins are also varied. The architecture is beautiful! Don’t hesitate to look in the area because the ceilings are worth it! However, I will not recommend this museum to young children because the visit is long and not interactive enough."
Beautiful art in a beautiful building,"This museum offers different types of exhibitions in a beautiful environment. You will be able to see weapons used from all times, pottery from all eras and paintings taking us back to a not so distant past. I really appreciated the beauty of the building, which did not differ from the beauty of the works of art. There is something for all tastes. The temporary exhibition on food in art was very interesting."
a good travel,"I am a student and i traveled to cambridge for four days to do my study trip. We visited this museum, which i advise everyone, there are a lot of diversity in this one and all the decorations are interesting. There are a lot of paintings, sculptures, but also a lot of plates with different patterns. In short, many things are presented that are pleasant to look at. i strongly advise you to visit this museum and during your visit do not forget to watch the ceiling."
Beautiful ,"If you have to make only one museum in Cambridge choose this one without hesitation. This huge three-storey museum is just beautiful. It consists of several rooms with impressive paintings. We no longer know where to look because the paintings are so imposing and beautiful. This museum mixes several styles of art. We find oil paintings or paintings, contemporary or modern. The decor of the place and equally beautiful with sculptures or decorations up to the ceiling. One also finds pieces on the remains of Egyptes or Greek. And not forgetting the Long corridors of pottery."
visit at fitzwilliam Museum ,"I travelled to Cambridge with my classmates and two teachers and we visited that museum. It was sunday and there were not many people. The staff at the reception was very friendly. We started the visit and we don’t know where starting because it was a lot of things to see. There’s a lot of floors, and the exposition is enormous. I liked the paintings and the exposition of Egypt. That’s a good place to visit. :)"
Art in the heart of the City,"A truly beautiful museum, full of wonderful art and artifacts. There is so much to see here you'll want to come back. The building itself is as impressive as its contents."
Excellent,Spent 3 hours going around all the rooms. Plenty of variety (maybe too many plates and Italian paintings but I'm being picky!) and some very interesting exhibits. Treat yourself - it's free - and get away from the infestation of bikes in Cambridge!
World Class Museum in Cambridge,"We took a day trip from London to Cambridge to visit the many colleges in town.  We ended our trip with a stop at the Fitzwilliam.  This is an excellent art and antiquities museum in Cambridge, very similar to the British Museum, if not nearly as large.  The building itself is magnificent, with an amazing entry foyer and many exhibition halls arranged in a grand, classical manner (as opposed to the minimalistic design generally favored today).  One could easily spend several hours browsing the halls.  During our visit in the later afternoon, the museum was not very crowded.  The staff were very helpful in directing us around the maze-like interior.The museum has a small café, serving both cold and hot dishes, and we enjoyed a nice meal there.I hope to return someday soon for another visit.  Highly recommended."
Good,"Good location, nice gardens and casual tour, stopped for tea and cake, nice end to our day. Good stop."
Interesting museum,"Great building and amazing foyer.  Very interesting items on display here, Fascinating Egyptology section"
Very interesting with some good collections. Convenient location in Cambridge,Convenient being so central to Cambridge centre.  My wife loves the Fitzwilliam but this was my first visit.  It took us about 2-1/2 hours to cover half of the exhibits including a coffee break in the excellent cafeteria.I will be returning to complete the visit.
A Cambridge Gem,"In a wet day in Cambridge this has to be one of the best places to visit, Well laid out a good balanced range of exhibits."
Fascinating Building,"This museum is well worth a visit - when you enter the building - look up to see the amazing domed ceiling & climb the ornate staircase surrounded by marble sculptures.  Such a stunning building. Photographs are allowed except where stated. A varied collection including ancient pottery, art & even Egyptian mummies."
Facinating with a wealth of exhibits,"Having lived locally for over 30 years we decided that it was time to visit some of the local attractions so we chose this for our first of hopefully many.The museum is easy to find with two entrances, one with steps the other at the footway level making it easy for access with wheels.Full of interesting artefacts from Egyptian to porcelain and picture, a taste for all displayed in sections which you can stroll through at your leisure.Well worth a return visit to see the areas we missed."
Great museum,"This large museum looks very grand from the outside. It covers 3 floors of history from Ancient Room/ greece, including European and Far east (and other) paintings/ artefacts, coins etc. A massive collection that cannot all be on display at the same time.I was a little disappointed that lots of the small displays in the middle of the rooms were empty, particularly noticeable as some rooms were close for renovation.It's a lovely museum, with something for everyone. Best of all its free"
Great ,"Located in an impressive building, and the good thing is the museum is a free of charge museum.The staff was quitehelpful with maps in multiple languages and other criteria too."
A treasure trove,The museum’s collection contains some real gems. I particularly enjoyed the Pre-Raphaelite paintings and the modern ceramics. We only saw a fraction of the collection so will definitely have to return.
A must,"Definitely worth a visit, it is a lot bigger and so much selection. From different periods of history. Very friendly staff😊"
Intriguing place,At first I was more fascinated by the actual building which in itself it a grand and elegant building.  As soon as you walk in you are presented with a grand staircase with a beautiful ceiling.  The museum itself is also interesting and has a number of artefacts going back to hundreds of years.On the upper floors there is a nice gallery of paintings with an explanation of their significance.  When we went we also caught a rehearsal on the piano which was a nice atmosphere.  I think the best part of the whole place however is the fact its free!  So you have nothing to lose.  The only reason I have only given four stars is because the cafe area was too busy and not enough seating.
Fabulous!,"Located in an impressive building, this is a free museum. Really helpful staff, with maps in multiple languages. Cost racks free to use. Larger bags can be safely stored away too. There are fold away stools around the museum which you can take to rest on to look round- it's a big place!Really interesting to look round- art, Greeks, Roman's, Egyptians to name but a few of the  amazing relics to look at. Great shop too!Definitely worth a visit whilst in Cambridge"
Stunning museum and free,Some great archaeological finds and lovely paintings and ceramics to be enjoyed in a range of galleries. Greta shop and restaurant. Interesting story about the visitor who managed to smash some Chinese vases after tripping on the stairs during a visit. They were worth over half a million!!! Pieced back together again they are now out of reach.
Woooo,"Such a collection - pottery & paintings, ancient through to 20thC, so much to see and of course free admission."
Absurdly helpful staff. Free. Large collection,"Collections include pottery, sculpture, paintings (including El Greco, Stanley Spencer), armoury and Egyptian art.As well as the permanent collection there are big temporary exhibitions, often free. Currently FEAST & FAST: The art of food in Europe, 1500 –1800. And there is obviously a huge collection of prints and of coins and medals, Which are exhibited in many free temporary exhibitions (for example print exhibition opening March 2020 Virtue, Vice & the Senses: Prints 1540 – 1650) There's a shop and a cafe.I can't think of a time that I haven't been offered a floor plan on the way in, and it would probably help, as it's not obvious.Wheelchair access within the museum is good with almost all exhibits accessible. Just go in the disabled entrance further south down Trumpington road from the stepped entrance. Outside the museum itself the uneven pavement is a challenge for a manual wheelchair."
Impressive,"It was free admission. The building itself is very impressive.There are many art galleries inside focussing on different eras. The museum houses artworks of the likes of Monet, Renoir, Picasso, Van Gogh, Rembrandt etc.I particularly enjoyed 'impressionist' paintings by Monet, Renoir and 'realism' themed ones by John Millais.One painting that particularly caught ny attention was "" The Twins"" ( by Millais) and the description provided gave us insights into the ability of the artist to depict hyper-realism. Another awe-inspiring ones  were ""The Gust of wind"" and ""La Place Clichy"" (both by Renoir).In the former, what is striking is how he has captured the most unpaintable of natural's elements: air. And in the latter; the blurring of background scene to highlight the principal figure; an elegant woman, is stunning.The museum has a cafe and a well stocked souvenir shop.It was a wonderful experience. While i had felt overwhelmed  at the sheer size and number of artworks on display at the Louvre;  this was just the right size."
Nice museum ,Nice museum to visit while in Cambridge. We entered for free. The architecture is nice an a good variety of different styles of art inside. Nice way to spend a couple of hours.
"Amazing museum, Beautiful building and free",Easy walk from the colleges. Beautiful building and not too big to see everything. Loved the entrance stairs and ceiling. A must see in Cambridge.
Amazing and free to enter,A very lovely way to spend the day with artefacts and art from by gone eras including Mesopotamia and Egypt and free entry.
Must visit in Cambridge,The building itself is just as impressive as the various artefacts and artwork. Entry is free and you can easily spend a couple of hours wandering this museum.
Majestic museum,"Cambridge’s Fitzwilliam Museum is in a class of its own. The exhibitions are endlessly brilliant and there are many different galleries to peruse. I especially enjoyed the Armoury collection made up of weapons and suits. Highlights also include inlaid furniture, clocks and Rome / ancient Sudan. Free admission!"
Fantastic Museum,We visited the Fitzwilliam Museum during half term as it was forecast a rainy afternoon. We were not disappointed at all. There was plenty to look at with our favourite exhibits being the Ancient Egyptian area and the art collection. We also had some lunch in the cafe which was excellent. We would definitely recommend this museum and we would visit again.
Beautiful museum. ,"Exhibits from around the world, but also local history and art. The building is stunning, a must see when visiting Cambridge. You won’t need more than 3-4 hours to see everything inside, depending on the preferences"
Food: it's more than eating!,"We went to this museum to visit their exhibition, ""Feast and Fast"". Long before the modern fascination with master chefs and bake-offs, food in UK was delicacy, medicine, symbolism, religion, and sometimes, controversy. And the artistry! Foods were made to look like other things, pottery and other materials were made to look like foods, and fine dining could delight the eyes as well as the taste buds.But food also was an opportunity for self-discipline and self-care. Fasting, guidance for healthy eating, vegetarianism, all were present in previous centuries and are represented here. This exhibition has it all. Don't miss it!"
Fabulous and free. ,"To he honest we went in to get in out of the rain, but what a find. Many floors of interesting artefacts, quite confusing as there are so many galleries. Great gift shop with wonderfully helpful staff and some unique gifts. A very small cafe but good cakes and drinks.Free concerts some days. Upstairs was an interesting display on feast and fast. It had a film, and a chance to try to draw some of the objects. One gallery had a really interesting display on copying famous art. The whole building is stunning inside and out. Highly recommended"
It may not be the Louvre but its fascinating and free.,I really liked the explanations in the classical archaeology secction. Some brilliant British portraits and interesting impressionist paintings. The Rodin and Epstein bronzes are top class. Even the shop was interesting and well priced.Loved the pineapple!
Amazing,"A stunning place, really interesting architecture, great displays and the cafe serves good coffee!   Really good."
First Class art collection,"With art from all important movements on floor one ,  this is a truly wonderful experience. Location and architecture is stunning and sense of light and space abounds.Bonus of music in Gallery 3 last Sunday.Didn't have time to see ground floor so will have to return."
Simply stunning,"A museum worthy of a capitol city, here in Cambridge. Fantastic! On this visit we enjoyed parts of the permanent collection, as well as temporary exhibits including Rembrandt etchings of nudes, an exhibit about food through the ages as represented in art and artefacts, medieval manuscripts with a wintry theme, and more. We also enjoyed the café and gift shop. An enriching and enjoyable Cambridge experience not to be missed."
Typical British Museum ,"Good museum for a wander round, rooms are a good size and easy way to spend an afternoon. I want enamoured by the food section but the main gallery was nice."
Lots to see,Very varied and lots to see from pictures to Egyptian relics. Very good that it's free to visit. Large shop and nice cafe on site.
"Free, Fascinating and Fabulous!",Great exhibits from old masters to school children's work with lots of free information alongside. Innovative clear displays without over crowding the space available. The people on room duty were very helpful and informative. Building is a bit of a maze - Way Out signs a bit like a Las Vegas casino in that they were sparse!! Enjoyed the visit and the cafe/shop always is good value.
"Very Good, Just A Few Complaints","The Fitzwilliam museum is a brilliant museum. It has countless artefacts, all with detailed explanations. Presentation and cleanliness are flawless, and it is great both for learning new things about older civilisations, and for getting you out the house. And to top it off, it's free!* My only complaint is that younger children will struggle to appreciate it, so i'd advise to take children from y6 onwards. All in all, a good way to spend a day!*- While it is free, voluntary donations are an option"
Great if you are into religious paintings,"I had high hopes as this museum was listed in most of the top 10 lists of places to visit in Cambridge.  Having been to the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford I was hoping for an eclectic collection of artefacts to rival this one.  I was disappointed.  A great deal of the collection is made up of paintings, which I do like to see but many were religious and it became a bit tedious to see yet another interpretation of Christ on the cross.  You could be mistaken for thinking you were in an art gallery not a museum.  There was an Egypt section which was fine and an extensive porcelain collection, but again not to my taste.  This museum may appeal to some but for me, I would have rather visited one of the colleges instead.  The cafe was very good, however, and a lovely place to relax and chat with friends."
Interesting Museum,"A great range of exhibits, nicely laid out. We spent 2+ hours here, could easily have spent much longer."
So much to see and free!,"Really interesting collection of works and artefacts.  Great place to visit on a wet day, so much to see you could be there all day if you want"
Fascinating Egyptian Collection,"This is a fantastic museum with lots to see. It's big and you can spend an afternoon there and still not see it all. Great thing is it's free to enter (although you can make a donation). The Egyptian collection was my highlght, followed by the Greek statues and pottery. There is a LOT of crockery from a wide range of places, some religious artefacts, jewellery and art. There is also a cafe and shop. The staff were very helpful and there are rails to hang coats. There is something for everyone to see and I would go again as we didn't get round to seeing everything on our first visit."
Impressive!,"We are not really Museum people and to be honest we popped in to get out of the cold and grab a refreshment in the Cafe, however it is a very large building with collection after collection of art and antiquities that you cannot fail to be impressed by. We stayed longer than anticipated and did enjoy, what was a small overview of the vast array of artifacts. If you like Museums, this will not disappoint, however the prices in the Cafe just might!!"
Iconic collection of paintings and other art,"Well worth the visit to experience an amazing collection of ancient Egyptian, Roman and Greek art together with renaissance, European and English art. It’s possible to get up close and view the details of masterpieces and really appreciate them. Security is good and staff are watching in every room all the time.  The museum doesn’t allow shoulder or other large bags, better not to take in but these can be checked in for safekeeping at the reception."
An amazing place!!,"The Fitzwilliam is a fantastic museum. Its galleries are packed full of old favourites and exciting new pieces of art. There is plenty  of space to move around, seats for when you get tired, and lots of extras to make your visit worthwhile. There is a little cafe selling coffee and cakes galore! The museum shop has a wide range of themed gifts where you’ll find something suitable for just about anyone. We saw a small but fascinating exhibition called “Fans Unfolded”Join the museum tour if you can as it’s well worth the £8 and gave us an overview of the museum and we also learnt a lot from our guide, Cathy. Many thanks,"
great museum,a lovely place so much to see we go there as much as we can as there is always something to see. its the feast of europe food which is very good
I love this place,"I love this building and everything is hidden in it... beautiful, space full, amazing exhibitions... I visited this place probably 10 times and I will do it again."
Classic! ,A pretty obvious must see if you’re in the area and an art lover. Honestly the building itself is just as impressive as the displays. A really great mix of old and new. What with it being free entry and so huge it’s definitely somewhere you can visit again and again.
Too big museum :),"Huge museum with many paintings, egypt section; overall very nice, but after ~30 mins everything start looking very similar and a bit boring. Maybe that’s because I am not deeply interested in history and all painters."
"Quite the collection.  Definitely worth seeing if you're in Cambridge, not necessarily worth a special trip.","The span of the collection is impressive.  It's like a small British Museum.  And the pieces were quite good.  A bit long on ceramics and a bit short on later paintings, but they're at the mercy of what gets donated.I did appreciate their goal of getting more of the collection out on display by having the furniture and decorative arts spread throughout the entire museum and not just in one room."
Alright,"Some of the contents is great. Some of it a bit ""Oh I've seen that before and better elsewhere"". Worth it because it's free. Bit cheeky of a super rich university like Cambridge to ask for donations though.The shop was a serious disappointment. No posters of any kind."
Fantastic museum with a bit of everything,"Been coming here for years,they have everything you could want to see from knights armour to Egyptian mummies,art from all over the world and after going to the British museum countless times as I lived nearby,this place does not disappoint."
Wow what a building,From  3-5000 BC to near today.Very good English civil war and more Far East and rest of the world and it's Free.
"Small, free - you’d be an idiot to miss this gem in the centre of Cambridge","This is a lovely, small, free museum in a fantastic building.  It has something for everyone and a must-see whilst in Cambridge."
Brilliant museum with a large collection,"There are some unique items at this museum and it's a real gem.  Beautifully laid out so you can appreciate all the items, and the staff are real friendly too!"
Wonderful place,Great visit to this super museum. Definitely worth a visit The Feast & Fast exhibition is great. Fascinating.
Spectacular foyer!,"A good little museum with a truly wonderful foyer, seen on this site in many ways. (It is not clearly stated that many of the statues in the foyer are reproductions - but they still look superb in a lovely setting). The museum has a good and diverse collection, and is worth going beyond the foyer. Not quite in the same league as Oxford's Ashmolean Museum, but certainly worth visiting anyway. The building itself is quite lovely in places too."
A Short Visit,I decided to spend my afternoon at the museum after my interview at a nearby college. The museum has a wide range of collection!
Impressive museum,Worth having an explore in here when in Cambridge - makes for a nice change from the university grounds and they have an impressive collection.  Good way to while away an hour or two.
One to savour!,"This is not my first visit here and I certainly look forward to a return visit. The building itself is worthy of a visit in its own right. Simply stunning and easily identifiable with the large golden pineapple at the entrance. There are a wide variety of excellent exhibits. Upstairs the art galleries are divine, Rodin, Monet, Pissarro, Degas -to name just a few of the great and good.I particularly loved the Roman Swiss Army knife. Clever, delightful and in such great condition after 1800 years. Highly recommend this wonderful free museum and art gallery."
Jaw dropping exhibits,"Such a fantastic place to visit when in Cambridge. It never fails to stun with the antiquities, exhibits and even the building itself. Lose yourself for an afternoon."
A truly an excellent museum.,A magnificent building with multiple treasures from near and far (?). Truly a worthwhile visit. Great personnel to guide you when visiting.
Amazing free museum - here are my five highlights,"This is an incredible museum that presents a pure feast of history for its visitors. It has so many breathtaking exhibits and it is set in an absolutely beautiful building. And its free.I went with my elderly dad and we had a  wonderful couple of hours. (There was lots we didn't see and we could have done with more time.) Our favourites were the ancient Egypt displays and the wonderful medieval armour. The museum wasn't over-crowded, compared to much of the rest of Cambridge. And the bonus is that it is on the park and ride route from TrumpingtonIt is interesting to consider that this museum was created with a £100,000 donation (now equivalent to £10m).David's personal highlights1) The Roman version of a swiss army knife made from silver almost 2,000 years ago2) The 7 tonne sarcophagus lid from Rameses III grave3) Some of the coloured tiles from some ancient Egyptian palaces4) The 4 metre high golden pineapple outside the museum which is great selfie5)The great works of art including stunners from Pissarro, Monet, Rembrandt and Bruegel.I'm going to go back and experience the best of the museum tour on a Saturday afternoon, which sounds a bargain at £8.The only reason that I haven't given five stars is that some of the interpretation signs are very small and quite hard to read, unless you are small and have owl-like eyesight."
The Museum is one of the best i've been,"Immaculately kept, Variety of Collection, Not excessively crowded and.... free! The museum captivates you as soon as you walk up to the main entrance. Visited twice in a week! Must go. Leave a generous donation!"
If you love art must visit,I love this Museum!! You can spend half day inside this museum and Free(I highly recommend to donate money). Make sure you enter from main entrance and see beautiful stairs.Walk upstairs and visit gallery 3 which just finished renovation and make sure you look ceiling as well.
"EXCELLENT museum day, would recommend to everyone!","My best friend who studies Museum Studies wanted to go to the Fitzwilliam Museum, so we went. Both my best friend and I were absolutely amazed. There are several sections; the Egypt section, the armour section, the Italy painting section... we stayed in the museum for 5 and a half hours, and could easily stay for an extra day just for experiencing the museum more in-depth. No matter what age you are, this museum is fantastic!"
Wonderful Food exhibition,The Fitzwilliam has a very good standard collection and interesting special exhibitions. There was an exhibition dealing with food from the 15th to the 19th centuries that was fascinating. The cafe is also a good place to have lunch.
More than one in a million - a museum that sets the bar high,"What a place!? We were planning to do something different on the afternoon we visited the FitzWilliam Museum and boy we were glad we didn’t . We parked on the Cambridge inner ring road but you can use the park and ride or hire bikes to get around. As you arrive to this free temple of history you are immediately struck by the scale . Once inside you are rarely disappointed with the eclectic nature of the museum with a range of incredible artefacts and loving history . The first door we entered through offered weapons through the ages from swords, sabres to muskets in immaculate condition . We headed off into ancient Egypt , Greek history and also across to stunning paintings and artwork . All the time the building provided the backdrop for the history with stunning architecture and detail . The galleries included Monet , Cesar, Rembrandt and many others . We were blown away that this museum offered so much and all for free. Bargain x 100 so we made a suitable donation . Also a great cafe and shop on site Once you leave there are a multitude of great eateries to allow time to chew over the experience and reflect on all you have seen . Simply one of the best"
Excellent museum. Free to visit.,"Excellent museum, with limited time we concentrated on the 'Feast and Food' special exibition, but will certainly re-visit when next in Cambridge."
Amazing way to spend an afternoon....all for Free..,"This is such a glorious place to be..tells you about History of Cambridge, it's Culture and its people. There are so many artifacts and you will not have enough time to take in all the knowledge and information. Such an enormous collection of everything!"
Fascinating exhibits,"We spent 2 - 3 hours browsing the exhibits and art works.  Cafe had a good selection, as did the shop."
A great free attraction ,Stumbled across this fab museum - absolutely beautiful outside and In. I personally found the ancient Egyptian section fascinating. And it’s free to visit!!
Excellent exhibitions,"We were fortunate on our latest visit to Cambridge to be able to see two excellent exhibitions at the Fitzwilliam Museum: the Feast & Fast exhibition and the fan exhibition.The Feast & Fast one is all about food, its production and its importance. There are paintings, books, culinary implements and decorative ceramics.It is all wonderfully curated with helpful printed explanations beside each exhibit and rolling slide slows.The fan exhibition is smaller, but interesting too.The people of Cambridge are very lucky to have this magnificent treasure trove on their doorstep. We never tire of the place.The shop and café are expensive (postcards of the exhibition are £1 each!), but we feel that as it is free to get in, the least we can do is to buy drinks in the café and gifts in the shop."
Fabulous experience,"Went primarily for the “special exhibition” - Seeing Sound: Music, Imagery and Inspiration. Only small exhibition as this was part of a larger exhibit which did not form part of our visit. Very interesting exhibits here and extremely fascinating. ( see couple of pics )While here had time to take in Rembrandt exhibition and the Impressionist GalleryA very worthwhile trip to a lovely museum and fine old building. Plenty left to see for a subsequent visit. A fabulous experience."
Cambridge Fitzwilliam Museum & nearby,"The Fitzwilliam in Cambridge is a fabulous museum to visit.  I love the variety of ceramics from Persia right along to the UK and beyond! The exhibitions are always beautifully presented and there is a shop which is fun to have a look through. Of course they have a nice cafe and an outside area for children to have a run round. The latest exhibition is Feast & Fast - food throughout the ages - and I have heard it is very good. I can’t wait to make time to go and see. The museum is situated a five or 10 minute walk to the city centre, near Kings College. It is a lovely area to visit (and shop). Lots of fabulous independent shops too! If you live out of Cambridge, Trumpington Park & Ride would be the best option, but there are parking spaces outside the Botanical Garden (five minute walk) or blue badge parking outside the museum!"
Wonderful museum,"This is a wonderful museum with so much to interest everyone. Superb Egyptology, paintings, watches. You can sail lose yourself for a day."
Impressed on a wet day,It's free grap some history here there is all sorts in there for all interest. I'm not a museum person but I liked it.
School Visit to the Egyptian Galleries,"The Fitzwilliam is a real Cambridge institution, I love the impressionists gallery but the Egyptian displays are superb - I have been many times but this time was helping with a school trip - there are a great variety of artefacts and superb descriptions - well worth it for a quick visit on a rainy day or an afternoon mooching around looking at the many galleries."
Wonderful place,What a find. My daughter and I stumbled across this amazing place. It would give any museum a run for their money - you don’t have to part with any money! Well worth a visit.
A cool breath of inspiration,its far out not dimensionally speaking but intellectually...I like the egyptiana and the modern paintings best
Attention London visitors,"Fitz as called by locals, hold collections that reflects the world history and arts based on British empire map, so if you would like to avoid lines, pay nothing and see all that wealth, come see the fitzwiliam"
Another free activity to do...,"This is one the aspects of England I love: Free museums.  This activity I recommend after eating lunch. To walk around and digest the food because it requires time. It is an interesting museum,. one of the few that I visited. It reminded me of Victoria & Albert museum in London. Even though Albert museum has a vast collection, the similarities were striking. We enjoyed the time noticing various collections. Take the time to visit this place and enjoy!"
Better than the Uffiizi!,"Visited on a Wednesday morning at 10.00. The museum was lovely and quiet with no queues and friendly staff. We had visited the Uffizi in Florence a couple of months back, and can say with absolute confidence that we enjoyed the Fitzwilliam far more. The quality and display of the exhibits were top class and the lack of people meant we could enjoy the ambience and building at our own pace without feeling under pressure. A far cry from being treated like cattle at the Uffizi. Forget Florence and visit Cambridge to experience this hidden gem and the treasures it contain"
"Oustanding museum, woth a couple visits","My daughter has lived within an hour of this gem for 4 years and on our most recent visit my wife found it online and we decided to go.  The admission is free but donations are accepted.  There is just to much to see and appreciate to get it all in on one visit.  The Egypt and early civilization sections, the armory, the art the glassware and pottery just so much to see.  If I get back to Cambridge again I will be back."
Chinese collection well worth seeing,"This is a very interesting museum founded more than 200 years ago with a broad range of exhibits. Having recently visited China, we were interested in seeing the Chinese collection and consolidating our understanding of development from the Shang to the Qing dynasty. Most of the Chinese is on room and is largely set out chronologically with some anomalies in organisation. Nevertheless the compactness of the collection is helpful - there are probably only around 200 objects  on display which is quite helpful in terms of not getting lost in the detail."
Better than London,Spent a marvellous 2 hours in the Museum spending time in the basement with the Egyptian mummies etc and the many artefacts from all over the world. Lots of items held from Iran. Fine china and pottery room is exceptional. Great galleries of pictures and they hold pre- raphaelite and impressionist from many of the great artists.All free too and without the large crowds often experienced in London. A true gem!
Beautiful -  must go,We stumbled upon this museum on the way back to the railway station and I am glad we made the stop. The building is beautiful with many amazing Italian and Spanish paintings.
Monumental old museum with many treasures inside,"This cavernous museum had a wealth of ancient artefacts from various periods and was a true treasure chest of wonders. The grand old museum loomed at the end of the street as I approached. A mass of Corinthian columns at the grand entrance labelled it firmly in the Greek revival period so common across England for a couple of centuries. The portico has a carved roof that is worth stopping and looking upwards. Inside were cuneiform tablets from Mesopotamia, a Roman equivalent of the Swiss Army Knife, a beautiful Roman niche from one of the villas obliterated by Vesuvius, incredibly complete Egyptian sculptures in clay of life in Egypt in 2000 BC, and so on. A wonderful museum."
Fabulous museum,An excellent museum with fantastic collections and lots of variety.  Really well laid out and well worth a visit.
The Gentleman,"Great place to visit,plenty to see. Art and Artifacts, great Weapons and Armour room.On site facilities, Restaurant and Gift shop. Disabled access and Lift.Car parks within 10 min walk. Limited parking on street (Pay and Display)."
Quick hours tour,We came in here before our walking tour. Very interesting artefacts. It is really great that this is a free Museum. Plenty of Staff on hand to ask questions.
Museum,"Good collection, well maintainedEnjoyed our mid week visit - not too busyReally liked the paintings by Pieter Bruegel"
Fitzwilliam Museum,Beautiful collection of paintings and objects from around the world.Well-decorated. Free entry everyday.Kind staff
Art,Excellent museum and gallery.  Well worth visiting . A wide wide range of art from 17th century master to pre raphaelites.
So many antiques in one place!,The range of items at this museum is unbelievable! For a relatively small museum there is a lot to see! Its extremely informative and very enjoyable. We spent around two hours there and didn't see everything. We will definitely be coming back and will be bringing our three children!
Fantastic art!,"Had only enough time for a short visit but I was so pleased I made the effort as the collections are absolutely stunning. For me the highlights were the Egyptian gallery, the Mesopotamian reliefs, and the artworks produced by Monet, Gainsborough, Hogarth and Gainsborough. Free entry and staff were very helpful. Rembrandt exhibit was ok but much preferred the permanent galleries. Highly recommended!"
"Closed on Mondays, so we almost didn't get to visit","We were on a short (two and a half day) visit to Cambridge and had planned to visit the Fitzwilliam Museum on Monday, but late on Sunday afternoon we discovered that the museum does not open on Mondays. A quick dash enabled us to spend the final half hour there on Sunday before it closed at 5pm - better than nothing. We confined ourselves to the Egyptian section, located in the basement. It is an impressive collection, but one which is curated in a rather sterile format and which in my opinion fails to adequately bring history to life. Admission is free, but donations are welcomed."
A perfect afternoon! ,"This museum was wonderful! Reminded me a bit of the British Museum but smaller and more importantly far less crowded. I had the opportunity to see several Monet, Renoir and Cezanne. There are also some superb pieces from before BC Egyptian pieces and many Roman just entering the Christian Era. A def must do."
2 hours well spent,A very good museum with a wide range of artefacts and art work. Loved the French Impressionists. Good for children. It's free as well. Housed in a very impressive building.
Good collection,"Didnt think this place in a small town would have such a wonderful collection. The art, armor and pottery is very well kept"
Pretty amazing,"To begin with, Cambridge is the most beautiful town, there isn’t a corner that won’t caught your eye. We heard about the Fitzgerald Museum before arriving but did not know what to expect. The museum holds a beautiful variety of art. It was truly surprising to see a lot of ancient Egyptian and Greek objects. You can find quite an amazing collection of the classic impressionist artists and even a Rembrandt! I will not spoil the rest, but the museum is in a beautiful building, with wonderful galleries and if it were not marvelous I would not even think about writing this review. So please GO!! Plus it’s free, what could be better?"
A lot more than I expected,It is a very impressive building.  Everything is well set out e.g. Roman and Greek things together.a lot of pottery but some extremely good gaskets from Egypt. Most of the items I have never seen before.very interesting. A lovely cafe and shop has well. Will be going again soon as it is free to go in.
Wonderful collection.,"The Fitzwilliam has always had a great reputation which continues until today. Wonderful collection of art, ancient military weapons, ceramics and Greek, Roman and Egyptian relics. One can always keep coming back, and see new things."
Spectacular museum,"The first floor mainly exhibits statues and ancient Egyptian things, while the second floor displays oil paintings in the terms of French and Italian genre."
Great Exhibition,"Had a really good couple of hours exploring the ground floor historical artifacts, and the upstairs galleries. The Fitzwwilliam is big enough to always find a new section to explore in more detail and hold your interest, whilst not being so large as to feel overpowered.Would highly recommend it!"
Hop off guided tour bus gor a real treat.,"Saw some interesting artifacts and the members of staff were so friendly, I certainly want to have another visit."
A definite must to visit,"What an amazing place to visit its free entry and there is so much to see we we're here for about 3 hrs just wondering from room to room the best museum I've ever been too. It has paintings, sculptures and lots more from all over the world"
Good Museum,We went here after a walking tour of Cambridge so were quite tired. nd maybe were not able to fully appreciate everything. But it certainly has a good selection of English and European paintings both potrait and landscape. It has a good Stanley Spencer collection (if you like him). The Middle East and Roman section was also good in my opinion. Nice grounds too.
The architecture of this building is so beautiful,"The Fitzwilliam Museum is located in a stunning building with an unbelievable number and variety of paintings, ceramics, Egyptian objects and so much more. We spent three hours enjoying each room of treasures."
Wonderful museum!,"Not only a rainy day, but every day, this museum is a great experience! No matter your taste, you will certainly walk away with lasting memories of your visit."
Hidden Gem,My husband and I called in here on the spur of the moment and spent 3 enthralling hours looking at fantastic exhibits and works of art.  We were limited on time and both wished we’d had more time to spare.  Fitzwilliam operatey on a donations onlybasis which we didn’t mind donating at all.  Well worth a visit.
A great museum to while away a few hours in Cambridge.,"Set in Cambridge in a stunning building, (the mosaic floors and stunning staircases and ceilings are beautiful), this Free to enter, (a £5 donation is 'suggested'), museum is great for any lover of collectables and fine art from around the world throughout the ages.  My favourite gallery was the one with original Monet's in, great to see these famous paintings in person.  There was also some interesting armoury, original etchings by Rembrandt and collections of some ancient pottery.  There is a cafe, gift shop, toilets and baby changing facilities, a bag check, lockers and audio guides.  Worth a visit even if for the stunning interior and exterior of the museum building."
Do visit!,"Beautiful building, small museum (i.e. kind on the feet and legs), impressive art, and it’s FREE. What’s not to love? A “must” in Cambridge. (I thought I’d see ONE Monet, but they had several! A very nice Impressionism group, if you like that. But lots of beautiful/interesting works in the museum.)"
Great historic place full of beautiful things to see,"The museum is an excellent way to learn about history but also to see the ancient and Medeival stuff that people created and obtain by mixing cultures and creativity.Decent amount of paintings, old vessels, historic artefacts and much more in there.You feel like you traveled back in time and you're stuck there with all that history floating literally everywhere in the air.Reccomending this to everyone in Cambridge."
Wonderful gem of museum,Loved walking around this museum. Beautiful collection of Impressionist paintings and excellent ceramic department.
Lovely to dip in to occasionally,"As a local, the greatest thing about the Fitz is the fact that it's free.Not directly, but being free means that I can visit again and again, short visits taking in a little of the vast collections each time. You can get round the whole museum in one visit, but that would be a heavyweight drag. Being able to nip in for half an hour whenever you feels like it is fantastic."
Best Museum Outside London,"This is a must see on your agenda for Cambridge. Immediately you enter, you should look up at the stunning staircase and ceiling in front and overhead. By any measurement this is a magnificent entryway. The museum has something for any taste. Plenty of Chinese artwork and ceramics. A great selection of European paintings spanning several periods. A very nice selection of impressionist paintings. Arms and armor from medieval periods. A great cafe and gift shop. Even lockers for your coats, etc. Cost is £1 but you get in back when you retrieve your goods. Free admission. Great staff."
Great art and a touch of history,"A wonderfully free museum to visit in the centre of Cambridge. Great works by some very well known artists past and present. When I visited it was a gloriously sunny day and the museum was fairly quiet, just perfect to enjoy paintings and historical artifices without feeling rushed. I am not an art connoisseur but I know what I like and a few pieces certainly caught my untrained eye. A great afternoon spend."
Aberdeen uni reunion ,We all loved walking around this astonishing and beautiful museum. The artefacts collected are extraordinary and precious. We are very lucky to be able to see such things so carefully displayed. The shop was also filled with delights to buy.
Half a day of art,"I spent a fair amount of time here, a lot to see, tons of pottery from all over!  The building itself is a work of art!"
A littel gem,Went in on the off chance to find a museum filled to the gunnels with items ranging from across the world.  There was a specialist exhibition of Saadi (Pesian poet) books and poetry which was extraordinary. Could have soent hours there.
World class collections,"The Fitzwilliam Museum houses world-class collections, the like of which you would see at the Louvre or the Victoria and Albert Museum. Today I saw amazing suits of armour, medieval crossbows and some beautiful Torah holders.  Another visit and I might relate to you the pottery collections and French, Italian and Dutch paintings.  One gallery I never miss is the small Rothschild Gallery, a darkened, enigmatically lighted display of Medieval and Renaissance objects.  The building itself is grand and columned and quite a spectacular sight, inside and out, in itself.  This museum is free but it’s hard to resist spending something in the alluring shop,"
Brilliant building 8nside and out,"Not always a fan of museums but the entrance to this is museum so beautiful, breathtaking. Some very interesting exhibits as well"
A gobal world of culture and art,"Excellent , discerning and very diversified. There you can compare for instance the same view of Venice by Canaletto and his nephew Belotto, and understand why this last one is much better."
Fantastic place,"After seeing the Monet exhibition at our local cinema. We decided we had to visit the Fitzwilliam museum and we were not disappointed. Amazing collection of art. The impressionist paintings were sublime. We also caught the Whistler exhibition again great. However, the real surprise was the Egypt collection.  The shop is really reasonable and has some lovely things. The cafe had a good selection of foods and amazing cake again really reasonable. Free cloakroom facilities.I would recommend this museum."
Great place ,Really enjoyed a family trip here. Great old building. It's a very well presented museum with some very interesting pieces. Kids loved the knights.
Fabulous Museum,"Its paintings are the least of this museum with many artifacts in it. Note, however, the wonderful Stanley Spensers."
Interesting experience,"A big variety of piece of art and history. A lot of things from ancient Greece, Italy, Cyprus and Europe. You can also see paintings, German weapons and skulptures from all over the world. It is free entrance."
Great museum,Fabulous museum and wonderful collections. Porcelain exhibit is worth to see and amazing paintings. Staff is knowledgeable and helpful.
Beautiful!,"This museum is well worth a visit, if only to see the beautiful interior architecture.  The entrance, staircase, ceilings, etc., are incredible.  Lots more to see than one might think, you can easily get lost here for a few hours.  Paintings, special exhibits, porcelain, and so much more.  Everything is well laid out and identified.  Really enjoyed this museum and can highly recommend."
Must see if you are in Cambridge,"The atmosphere definitely takes you back in time, if you are in the center, definitely stop by and see the amazing variety of artefacts."
Rock hard scones!,Had a fabulous visit to the museum on Tuesday 3 September. Wonderful collections. However the scones in the courtyard cafe were rock hard. How many times had they been frozen and thawed I wonder? Simply the worst scones ever! Bad practice and just not acceptable.
A Gem!,Loved this place. Manageable size and very complete and interesting exhibits.  The porcelain exhibit was amazing...and if you go ask about the three large vases..I found the staff exceptionally knowledgeable and helpful.  And its free!
Incredible!,This is the best free museum I think I have ever been to. Took the boys recently and it kept a 15 year old and 11 year old enthralled.
Great Museum - and it's Free,Wonderful museum to kill a few hours as there's so much to see.  Free to get in though it's worth leaving a generous contribution for the upkeep of this lovely building.  Very well kept with a wonderful marble staircase.  Loved the Whistler exhibition.  Good café and shop.
GREAT MUSEUM,"We have visited the museum several times. There is so much to see. Something for everyone. We prefer to do a section at a time and then revisit, giving us a chance to fully appreciate the exhibits, paintings, sculptures  etc. This time we focused on the Whistler exhibtion, Degas and Monet. Really love this museum. Staff are friendly and helpful. Well stocked shop. Cafe and toilet facilities available. Always worth a visit if you are in the area."
Oh my...,They have Van Gogh's and rodin.  Not a lot of crowds so easy to meander at your pace. Staff extremely helpful and the building itself is beautiful.
A hot day at the fitzwilliam,"It was a hot day in July. So it was very pleasant as we walked into the front entrance.However, as I walked around the mseum with my mother, it was very noticeable that there were some very large fans in some of the rooms, and air con in some rooms. There was a large difference in temperature between these rooms. Some of the rooms were almost overheating, which, I suspect is why there were large fans.My point, well I would have thought that a museum of the calibre of the Fitzwilliam would have suitable temperature controls to help preserve some of these paintings and other items."
Lots to see,So much more to see than you’d think. Recommend a visit. Lots of history and information. Take time to roam around. There are lots of people with great amounts if knowledge to assist with any questions. Great place.
Fantastic museum,Love this museum - especially the Egyptian sections. It's intimate (in these areas) and really effective. Brilliant!
Something to everyone,"Painting, pottery, glass, old and new items.  Lots to see.  Do a floor, or your passion, at a time and come back another day.  Free entry but give a donation."
Wow! Massive Free Museum,"The museum is enormous and free! It is definitely well worth a visit. There are tons of exhibits, paintings, sculptures, etc. The cafe has decent food, and the gift shop is reasonably priced. Great museum to visit if you have a few hours to use."
Wide ranging collection of art from all eras,This museum is free but has so much to see. I especially enjoyed the huge range of porcelain and ceramics especially Iranian and Turkish tiles and bowls. Also some very interesting paintings with Dutch flower paintings and Stanley Spencer to name but a few. Very stylish gift shop and nice little cafe.
A stunning Museum!,"Centrally located and highly accessible, the Fitzwilliam Museum was very worthwhile to visit. There were so many interesting exhibits that it was a total 'head trip' to try to come to intellectual terms with them all."
Wonderful selection of various paintings and mix of artefacts from all periods,"It really is a must see collection of a wide range mix of artefacts to interest everyone and to see it all make sure you allow a good couple of hours, as it really is amazing collection"
Incredible museum with amazing objects,"There are an amazing amount of interesting items in this museum. Paintings by Monet and Pisarro. Sucltures by Moore, Rodin and Hepworth. Sections on ancient Asian pottery and egyptian mummies.All this and it is free. A great place."
Great,"I had a great time exploring the Fitzwilliam Museum. Although, I was conscious of other places I wanted to visit I was unable to easily extract myself from the Museum with so much to see. An eclectic mix of artefacts collected from around the world and through the centuries keeps one absorbed and fascinated to learn more.This Museum is a must-see!"
"Amazing, incredibly knowledgeable staff","The employees can answer absolutely any questions you ask them. They are so incredibly knowledgeable, helpful, and kind. They will talk o you about anything. This museum has the largest, most beautiful, most diverse collection I have ever seen from across the world and across the ages."
Rude staff,"If you are travelling with kids or groups, please dont go as they will tell you off for every little thing that you did wrong! I brought a group of 8 kids to the museum and had been watched like prisoners all the way through. Kids are kids, they are nor perfect. Even though we tried our best to look after our group and being polite at the door to let everyone come in, the reception guy had to come and tell us to ""move out the way for other people"". What a terrible experience! I just feel sad for our kids who came all the way from China and being treated like that. We left very quickly as we did not feel comfortable at all. Although the museum is awesome itself, being ruined by the unprofessional staff."
A real gem; not just a rainy day option,"The Fitzwilliam Museum is a real gem with a wide range of collections from a range of periods. My personal favourites are the European and Asian Ceramics and the armoury, but others will have their own preferences. The building itself is also worth a visit. As well as the permanent collections there are frequent interesting temporary exhibitions. Entry is free though you are encouraged to make a donation of what you can afford. The cafe is clean with some good offerings of sweet and savouries and the visitors shopis well stocked with quality items. Far too much to take in at one visit and the residents of Cambridge are lucky to have it on hand to dip into whenever hey like.We have now visited four times and are still making discoveries"
"Wonderful quirky selection, all great - and its free!","Loved the paintings - Monet, Seurat etc - and some terrific statues especially the Rodin of a young torso (see my pics).And the Egyptian section was amazing with a number of different styles of sarcophagus, plus other artifacts.Massive ceramics section too."
Great museum in a beautiful building,A great museum - it is worth going in just to see the inside of this beautiful building.It is very well laid out with many different collections to look at.  We particularly enjoyed the Egyptian section.The museum was fairly quiet when we visited and it was nice to be able to take as much time as we needed to look at the exhibits.  It's a nice place to visit when you want to get away from the crowds for a couple of hours.Well worth a visit when visiting Cambridge.
free museum,"well worth a visit, even for an hour.  Right in the centre of Cambridge.  very interesting exhibits and artifacts.   A welcome surprise if the weather is rainy."
Beggerstaff,"Always enjoy a visit to the Fitzwilliam. It never disappoints. Went on this occasion to see a specific exhibition - Beggetstaffs, William Nicholson and James Pryde. So glad I did not miss it! Amazing collection of their work both together and solo. I had not seen James Pryde work before. Such  talent for ruins and darkness and creating an atmosphere of doom and foreboding. I saw the talent of Ben Nicholson who's work I know better,  shine from his father William and mother Mabel Pryde though it would have been good to see more of her work. I shall seek her out. Thank you to the Fitz for putting this amazing exhibition together."
A gem,"I really enjoyed my visit here. There is a tremendous variety of rooms, so there will be something for everyone. Highly recommended."
A must have,"This museum is the perfect place to spend any day with the family. The have so many activities for little ones all the time, and helpful staff through out."
Small but interesting,We were at a loose end on a Sunday afternoon and whiled away a couple of hours.  There is an interesting Egyptian section.  We also had lunch here which was good value.  This is a good little gem where you can avoid the crowds.
Two Hours of Heaven!,"We got to the museum a couple of hours before closing, primarily to view the Monet and Rubens paintings in the collection. We spent the majority of our time on the top floor and were blown away by the exhibits!The museum staff were engaging and informative and were more than happy to show people to specific pieces.We will certainly be returning for an extended visit."
"Building Structure, Both Inside and Out, More Striking Than What Is Inside It","Well Organized and Impressive Building. After seeing all parts of the British Museums and other museums in London, it is somewhat difficult to get overly impressed with these exhibits, especially those things that have been recast. The Greek and Roman things seemed to be the best. I prefer the ancient Middle East, but found it lacking. The Egyptian things did not teach me anything new. I sensed a modern bias against things which would have highlighted the significance of both ancient Babylon and Palestine well before the introduction of the biblical myths and superstitions."
good,"was a nice museum staff very friendly ,its free to go into ,plenty to see and do ,can be in their for a good couple of hours some beautiful paintings and loved seeing the armour  ,and knights what they used and wore xx"
"Beautiful, full of treasures, interesting traveling exhibitions","I chanced into this museum while in Cambridge on a research trip and loved the Greek and Roman collections, (Hello Marcus Aurelius!) and the special exhibit of the Beggarstaffs, (Nicholson and Pryde, two English artists working around the turn of the last century) both master draftsmen with an art nouveau style.  A wonderful gift shop offers beautiful cards, puzzles, jewelry and books, and it's a very pleasant place to spend an afternoon."
Nice Museum and Good Cafe,"This Museum has some art and some historical things. I'm not too much of a museum guy, but when with someone who is interested, this is a cool place to go to in Cambridge. It's free which is cool, you can look at art/ artifacts for an hour or two and then head to the cool gift shop and really good Cafe (it might be worth a stop even for those two)."
Lots of see,Impressed with what they have for children. I'm glad that they are inclusive. Portraits and artefacts going back thousands of years and entry is free! Amazing
The building is a work of art!,"Do not miss this amazing (and free) museum. Schedule plenty of  time because the collection is massive! It's a beautiful building, too, well worth seeing. Pop across the street to Brown's afterwards, the site of the old Addenbrooke's Hospital."
Needs more Investment,"I think many reviews over rate this museum.  Yes it is definitely worth a visit and the short walk from the city centre.  Its collection is also both interesting and varied but this museum is not in the same league as The Ashmolean (Oxford) or Birmingham City Museum for museums outside London.  To be fair to the Fitzwilliam it is better than average for such museums - good but  not 'very good'.It holds a very good collection of armour and extensive ceramics, including many 20th century examples.  The Art Collection too is rewarding with a number of significant British and European pieces by major artists.  The relatively small Egyptian, Greek and Roman collection of artefacts are also of interest.  The small Medieval collection was my highlight with some lovely illuminated manuscripts and other pieces in a well presented display. However, the material is not always well presented and would be improved with more information and narrative.  Many pieces and works assume that the visitor brings quite extensive knowledge with them and the museum does not seek to 'fill in the gaps' to ensure the history, relevance and background are clear and accessible.  There is a need for secondary narrative.  Saying a piece is from the Second Kingdom without further explanation is not as helpful as it could be.  Saying a painting shows a particular scene from classical myth or 'history' would be more engaging if a brief explanation of the event were added.  The museum would benefit from investing time, rather than a lot of money, improving the accessibility of its collection to  general visitors.The cafe and shop are very good with a choice of drink, snacks and purchases available.  There are a number of other cafes and places to eat nearby."
Beautiful,"Visited for the first time and loved it! One of the best museums Cambridge has to offer, and the best part: it's free 😁"
Beautiful museum,Went in here and glad we did such a beautiful building and with a beautiful collection worth the while especially since it's free
"Various visits to general exhibtions and indivdual ones of varioius French Impressionist painters, and Darwin also.","Great building but too many steps leading up to entrance, also a bit out of the way of the centre to some extent although near to market square and guildhall building whi"
One of the best museums I've been to,"If you've visiting Cambridge, you MUST visit this museum! It's honestly one of the best museums I've been to."
Fantastic,There is enough in this museum to spend a while day.There are three floors a nice little face and lots of staff around who were very helpful.
Devine museum,Brilliant collection; free entry; wonderful knowledgeable staff; great location to explore Trumpington Street cafes and restaurants too. Brown’s restaurant is my favourite across the road from the museum; Hot numbers cafe up the street is good too.
Interesting museum,Nice to visit. Interesting italian paints. You can manage the visit in a couple of hours or dedicate more time to study the different artists.
Beggarstaffs ehibition,"The current exhibition features two brothers-in-law who in their separate ways, were very prominent in Britain from the turn of the last century to the 1930s.  Their distinctive poster designers are timeless and totally relevant today with their clear outlines and strong message. Also on display are their individual works of landscapes, portraits and imaginary themes.  It's an extremely well curated exhibition giving equal prominence to each artist and his distinctive style.  However, I have one major complaint: the notes relating to the works are often displayed beneath the pictures and in poor light.  They are a strain to read. In my opinion, these notes should be at eye height so you can read the information and then look to the picture to understand what is stated.  Otherwise, this is a fascinating exhibition."
Well worth a visit,Fitzwilliam museum is well worth a visit. Surprising to view such an eclectic display of historical items. The cafe and shop are also good.
Amazing collections here,"The Galleries of Egyptian, Greek and Roman artefacts are mind blowing. And then there is Arts of Korea, Medieval and Renaissance Art and.......etc..There is so much to see. But there are also special exhibitions too. At the moment the Beggarstaffs are on display showing how Pryde and Nicholson were leading figures in Modern British Art. The cafe serves excellent tea and has a full and wide ranging shop."
"Excellent Museum, Important Egyptian Collection, Free access","This is a very strong regional museum with a good range of galleries and a must-do for Cambridge.  Amongst others the Ancient Egyptian collection is important including a range of material from Predynastic to Roman including part of the sarcophagus of Ramesses III.  The galleries are well-displayed but it would be good to give this important material a bit more space, some items are quite high up.  Photography is permitted without flash.  Try to avoid school group timing, toilets at both ends of museum, lockers available, cafe may be best avoided (see separate review)."
one of the great museums,Despite regular visits there is always a work of art you had not noticed to discover as well as special exhibitions and modern crafts thanks to a generous donor. Good cafe and shop.
Just immerse yourself in one room,So much to look at and though it is free you can leave a donation. Quick visits are a bonus with the free entry. This time we looked at the money exhibit which has a fascinating social context. Always good to wander through the permanent collection.
Thoroughly Recommend,We spent a day in Cambridge following a wedding and after visiting some amazing locations in the morning the rain came down and we retreated to this wonderful Museum.  What a treat.  I still can’t believe it was free - gaining finance through various grants including The Arts Council.  A beautiful Museum and much to see with a multitude of famous artists from Monet to Gainsborough.  Well worth a visit.
great museum,"one of the finest museum experiences in England. Everything from Egyptian mummies to poster art with arms and armour thrown in. My personal favourite was a French revolution metric clock. !0 days ,10 months etc."
Worthwhile,"A chance to escape the hoards of tourists thronging Kings Parade, relatively few seem to venture in to sample this museum's eclectic collections. It is probably best to pick an area of art or history you are interested in, and focus on that rather than traipsing into every room. Disappointingly a couple of the galleries are closed currently. A recent extension has added a cafe and a little more gallery space."
Terrific museum,"I've been going to 'The Fitz' since I was a kid. My first favourite area, back as a nipper, was the arms and armour area. Then I moved on to the contemporary art galleries, in my teens (around secondary/sixth-form age I used to love to go and sketch there; learning from the masters in an inspiring environment!). More recently my wife and I have been getting more into the medieval, renaissance and suchlike, and enjoying such a temporary exhibitions as appeal to us, and these can be very varied: from medieval illuminated manuscripts to early gold coins, or Dutch paintings of Vermeer's era, etc. There's a nice cafe and shop area as well. And they even put on talks, concerts, and all sorts. We've moved further from Cambridge recently, making trips to The Fitz less frequent, and I/we miss it. It's like having a London style museum out in the 'the sticks'. Highly recommended."
Great but Manageable Collection of Art and Antiquities,"Spent about 3 hours here while on a business trip.  Think of it as a manageable British Museum with art as well.  Very good, but not overly detailed, descriptions of the items on display.  No big crowds to deal with, and you get to see a wide range of different things without needing to spend 2-3 days."
As befitting a major university town,"We accessed the museum by catching the city centre Park & Ride bus from Trumpington Park & Ride, and the bus stopped immediately outside the museum’s entrance.It’s a well-stocked museum, as one might expect for a leading university town. We particularly enjoyed the rooms of Italian paintings. It was sad to see that several strategically placed buckets had been placed to catch water leaking from the museum’s roof. The museum could obviously do with a cash injection, but we appear to live in straitened times.The café looked interesting too, but it was impossible to find a seat at lunchtime, so we went elsewhere."
Wonderful free museum ,A massive awe inspiring museum covering lots of topics from Greek Roman and Egyptian antiques to paintings of all ages
Museum visit,It was rotten weather so we decided to visit the Fitzwilliam.  They had a wonderful exhibition of fans on display.  It was fascinating to see the different styles and the work that obviously went in to making them.  We then had a good look round the pottery section.
Nice Museum,Fitzwilliam Museum is fairly small but offers a variety of exhibitions from arts to Egyptian history. This gives you a variety of options what to enjoy. It is nice that it is free admission so everyone could have a walk and get an idea of England''s history and the exhibitions of the time. The building itself in and out is impressive so worth visiting.
Amazing architecture ,"Stunning building housing an interesting collection of antiquities and art.Egypt section was very interesting. The entrance hall, staircase and ceiling are breathtaking.  Well worth a visit if only to see this."
Need to visit again to see more of the collections,"To do it justice, I think the Fitzwilliam needs to be visited often, seeing a couple of galleries at a time, there's too much to take in at one visit. I enjoyed the Cyprus, Greek and Roman and Eastern Art galleries, although I was very disappointed that none of the museum's collection of 500 netsuke are on display.  (I did get to see some at the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, though!) I also made a point of seeing Pedro de Mena's  extraordinarily lifelike Virgin of Sorrows, with its glass eyes and tears and real hair eyelashes."
Browsing,"I love the Fitzwilliam, its  a place that can be visited time & time.The architecture is amazing too make sure you look up at the ceilings"
Amazing Museum,"As it was raining we visited the Fitzwilliam Museum. It is an amazing place with all sorts of collections from Greek and Roman antiquities, to textiles, furniture, jewelry, statues, artwork, and porcelain of all types. One of those must see museums!"
Impressive French Impressionist collection,"Cezanne, Renoir, Seurat, Monet, Courbet, Degas, Gaugin and more. Exhibited in beautiful, stately gallery rooms."
Pots and paintings ,"Free to get into, which is great. Building incredible - lovely marble columns and lovely interior - very nice. Exhibitions themselves slightly boring though. Mostly pots, various European China and obscure Dutch artists. A few Monet’s and a Gainsborough were good though but some very weird art too. Medieval gallery good but felt out of place to rest of exhibits. Wouldn’t hurry back and certainly wouldn’t take kids"
A must see Museum.,"Visited here during the recent wet spell. Fantastic museum, Lots of Classical artifacts and a good collection of Art. you could spend hours here. Nice shop and café."
Fascinating Museum,The decoration of the entrance hall is stunning and the painting collection on the first floor well worth the visit by itself. Saw some wonderful pictures by Sir Stanley Spencer
Visit,Interesting place with some fine art. Well worth a visit and a very imposing building.Very easy access
It was great pleasure! ,"A must-see in Cambridge. amazingly beautiful museum, a rich collection of artifacts of ancient civilizations. Good art collection, particularly I liked very much impressionists hall. Free admission. Highly recommended!"
Amazing Entrance Hall,"Only had a short time in here, but a great variety of art and artifacts and all at no cost.  The entrance hall itself is a work of art.  Absolutely stunning.  Worth a visit, especially if you need to escape rain!"
"Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge","Rated among the top tourist attractions in Cambridge, the Fitzwilliam Museum was founded in 1816 by Viscount Fitzwilliam, a life-long collector. The museum is one of the best in western Europe for art and antiquities.There are permanent exhibitions and regular, short term displays built round a theme or a particular artist. I have recently visited exhibitions of the paintings of the American artist James McNeill Whistler; and of art work inspired by Virginia Woolf and some of her contemporaries. One of the most popular permanent exhibitions is of ancient Egypt. This has a particular appeal to school age children. A tour of the whole museum lasts between two and three hours.There is an excellent shop selling high class books, greetings cards, postcards and children’s books. Adjoining the shop is the restaurant/café which is one of my favourite eating places in Cambridge. The home-made soup is excellent and the main courses predominantlycater for vegetarians and vegans with unusual, imaginative salads (not a lettuce leaf in sight).  The museum is a ten minute walk from the city centre and is served by two regular bus services. It is open between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. every day except Monday."
GLORIOUS ART IN A DRAMATIC AND STUNNING SETTING.,Once inside you have the   breathtaking view of a vast lobby of a country house with a sweeping marble staircase.adorned with classical statues and   works of art. No you have not entered the   wrong building this is the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. Allow plenty of time for there is much to see. A cafe on the ground floor canbe a good start! Maps available and are useful guides to  what to see. Whichever entrance you use you are in fora fascinating experience. Disabled access.
Closed on Mondays...,"Fortunately we were able to go back the next day, but the visit was disappointing as four main rooms were closed as was the special exhibition. Some of the more famous paintings were not on display. It was barely worth the effort but at least it was free."
Must see whilst in Cambridge ,Highly recommend a visit to the Fitzwilliam museum whilst in Cambridge.Great way to spend a few hours and the children enjoyed it too.Some brilliant exhibitions and fantastic Art Work.
Great museum ,"Lovely museum, reminds me of the British museum but cosier. It wasn't overcrowded which meant that you could spend time looking at exhibits. I liked the sidebars of information on the subjects, possibly because I didn't know much about some of them. The staff were very friendly and helpful."
A real treat,Totally blown away with ceramics. I could have stayed much longer. Nice environment helpful staff and lots of rest areas.
Far too much to see in one visit!,Much more impressive than anticipated!  Amazing displays and could have done with a second visit to see everything
Awesome collection... for free,"A really well-balanced collection, going from ancient Egypt, Rome, Greece and Cyprus to more modern times. For me the highlights were the Egyptian collection and the beautiful Flemish and Dutch paintings (including various works by Bruegel, Rubens, Van Dyck, Bouts...). Entry is for free, you can leave a donation at several places throughout the museum. You shouldn't miss this when you're in Cambridge. Also very handy for the moments when it's raining..."
A treasure trove of excellence and depression,Naturally visited the Fitzwilliam on a short break to Cambridge. a vast array and of things to see from a range of periods lots of it genuinely interesting but we found some of the art collection fundamentally depressing.Well worth a vist though
Breathtaking,What a museum. The building itself is magnificent before you even get to the exhibits . The coffee shop is good as is the museum shop.
Well worth a visit and time.,This is a beautifully presented and imposing building with well presented and exciting exhibits.  The staff were friendly and helpful.  Could have spent days here.
Stunning,"I was recommended to come to visit this place while I was Cambridge for the weekend and I must say I was not disappointed. Free entry as well, that almost knocked me down! The museum overall is huge and breathtaking with a lot to see inside. Definitely somewhere you can spend a few hours just walking around. I also like that there is something for everyone inside. Whether you're interested in Ancient Egypt, Weaponry, Art, European History or the Modern Era there’s something for everyone. My only comment would be to perhaps have more of a guide or path to follow to ensure you see all the rooms. While visiting you often came to a fork in the road and had to choose left or right. Depending on which way you chose you would either come to a dead end and have to walk all the way through things you’ve seen to continue on. The alternative was that you carried on and then felt like you had missed things so you either left them behind or once again walked back past things you’ve seen. However overall a brilliant place and I would pass on the recommendation to another as someone else did to me."
Worth a visit ,"Lots to see and its free, plenty of art wortk and artefacts from throughout the ages. The Egyptian relics were quite impressive. Would definitely recommend"
Fabulous,"So much to see!  We only did the top floor and will come back to see the rest another time.  Amazing paintings, beautifully displayed"
Excellent,"If you are interested in historical and cultural objects, this is a worthwhile destination.Many of the exhibits are stunning and I found a surprise around every corner.Best visit on a cooler day as it was rather hot and stuffy when we went.It's also free which most if not all museums are in Cambridge."
Free to enter,Beautiful museum that is free.. do not confuse with the ‘Cambridge museum’ that charges and is in main city centre.This museum offers amazing artefacts throughout different eras in an amazingly kept building.  Highly recommend!
one of the best museums,"stunned by its variety of collections, some of them go back long long time ago, in some senses it is better than some most notable museums in the world."
Wonderful Museum,Fabulous museum inside and out. So much to admire. Stunning art collection. I would recommend if you are in Cambridge to visit here.
Great for visit,Love Cambridge so much to offerDay & Night safe and lovely cityEasy to get arround we love itTry the Punts or trip on Open bus  if in a shirt visit
Tour of museum,"It's fairly big inside, stayed longer than planned, can be quite tiring walking around and no where to rest up. Queues long for the bathroom well only the ladies.. Lots of interesting stuff to talk pictures and selfies. A very informative museum full of history. Kids will love coat of armour model and also real guns on Display..."
Nice,"It was a spur of the moment type visit,  wasn't what we had expected   had hopped for more artifacts on old Cambridge and local areas."
See impressionists without the crowds!,Their collection is small but well worth the visit if you are in town. Money’s Springtime and a gorgeous Renoir.
Nice museum ,"Went their due to bad weather and could have stayed there for hours. Nice visit, some great artefacts. Sculptures ancient and modern and some great paintings. Worth a visit"
Worth a visit,"Very good collection of varied subjects, particularly the Greek Roman and Egyptian antiquities and some fine paintings. One down side is the amount of armour on display, for somewhere that has over 400 items of armour and 350 items of weapons there is one small room with a few examples on display. Would have liked to see much more of this area."
Enjoyable museum with very good cafe.,Easy to walk around and see exhibits.  Friendly staff.  Clean toilets.  Lockers to leave back packs etc.  Good cafe with fresh reasonably priced food.  Well stocked shop with prices to suit all.  Child friendly.
Absolutely amazing,I could not believe this musuem is quite big and with fantastic collection around the world. There are actually so many to see and at least three or four hours needed.
Lovely building with some nice collections,This is worth a visit if you're in the area. The building is very impressive inside and they have an extensive collection of art works and china amongst other things.
"A massive, impressive museum!","The Fitzwilliam is huge! There's so much to see. And, admission is free! If you have the time, it's a great way to spend an afternoon (especially if it's raining)."
"""Grand Building""","I cannot understand why (very few) people leave poor ratings for this grand museum.We were greeted with a warm welcome and given a free map. The entrance is totally free as well.The staircase is incredible and I believe entirely made of mable and the place is massive.I'm sure we missed a couple of rooms but the various artefacts we did see, were very interesting. A word of advice for the museum. On the first floor it is incredibly easy for visitors to miss the rooms due to the hidden entrance, maybe some signposting would be useful. The whole place was very clean and tidy and the grounds outside fabulous (check out the 2 lions down the steps)!All in all I would definitely reccomend this venue."
What’s not to like?,"Everything was good, right from the start - friendly and helpful staff welcomed us when we arrived and others were on hand to help throughout the museum, which was excellent. I really liked the art (a lot of great artists) but there is other really interesting stuff (ancient Egypt for example). The building itself is lovely - and a nice cafe to boot. This was my second visit, not having been there for years, and it was definitely worth the trip. Entry is free although they encourage a donation of £5 - I think that’s excellent value."
Museum,A great free museum with plenty to see. Photographs are permitted of the exhibits providing you don;t use a flash.
Amazing art,"We had the pleasure of a free guide around the museum, curtesy of my old college reunion organisers. I can really recommend having a guide because we got a lot more out of it than we would have otherwise. Ancient pottery, Egyptian and Parthian artefacts, and some wonderful paintings were the highlights. The impressionist room above all was my preferred area. Highly recommended."
My 2nd Visit in Two Months !,"Open to public “ free” but leave a donation.  A brilliant collection, something for everyone; artifacts 3,000 years old, delicate porcelain artwork, old currency money, horses & knights, armor, weapons, huge painting, architecture.  Could easily spend 3-4 hours there."
What a surprise!,"We stumbled across the Fitzwilliam Museum on our way to a Official Guided Tour of Cambridge (strongly recommend), in many ways this museum rivals the British Museum.  The rooms hold many works by famous artists.  The curators have taken interesting risking in including some paintings.  The rooms of sculptures will stop you in your tracks even if you have no interest in sculptures.  Also the docents are surprisingly knowledgeable and approachable ."
Incredible!,One of the best museums I’ve ever visited! There was so much too look at and laid out very well! Can’t wait to visit again!
A |Great PlaceTo Vist,This was our first vist to the musuem and were very impressed with all of the areas we visted  . We did not have to pay to get in and the special exhibitions were free .
Great,"Great pieces of art here and definitely worth a visit. Stanley Spencer, Renoir ,Picasso and all sorts of religious icons. A very worthwhile place indeed"
Nice and compact museum,We’ve visited before but this return we enjoyed the coins and medals exhibition and also modern art. Definitely worth a visit.
Great museum - miserable staff,"This is a great museum although it it sadly let down by the staff. On arrival we were greeted by a very rude unwelcoming woman. In each room sat a member of staff, quite often browsing through their phones. The staff did not appear to want to ‘show off’ their museum. There was no acknowledgement or interaction offered in the slightest. A fine museum let down by the staff. Not even a smile in the cafe!"
What a great day at the Fitzwilliam Museum!,"Me and my mum went to the amazing Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambrige and we thoroughly enjoyed it and would defiently recommend it. There was lots of different and unique art to see and lots of art for all ages to see as well. If you get the chance to go, I would recommend a visit!"
I never even knew it was there! ,"Wow, the outside of the building was impressive, so much we stopped and realise it was a museum. It was a tad damp out so in we popped and it was free!  (I did make a donation) Some interesting stuff, great art pics and would certainly return."
Amazing collection yet boring curation,"It's rare to find a museum which such crazy collections from Egyptian sarcophagi to Monets, however, it's a shame that the curation hasn't changed one bit (it least it seems so, very old-school museum design). However, indeed worth visiting for £0!"
Good variety,We were pleasantly surprised by the various exhibits at the Fitzwilliam Museum. 3 floors from french impressionists to ancient China. Well worth a few hours visit. I would have said the cafe was a bit pricy but remember this is free entry they need to raise funds various ways.
A lot to see,"A well organised museum you do  need time to devote to see everything, well informed, helpful and friendly staff. I think you need to know what you want to see before you go as there is so much to view and study."
Wide range of artefacts!,"This is one of the best museums in England where you can find artefacts from around the world: from Egyptian mummies and sarcofagus to Ming vases. The collection was distributed in different rooms based on their origin: korean, chinese, greek, eqyptian, roman, german or japanese. There is also a nice collection of paintings at first floor, a souvenir shop and a coffee shop. Museum admission is free and there are also lockers where you need to leave your luggage bigger than a purse size."
Somewhat underwhelming ,"This was one of our key reasons for visiting Cambridge, but we were underwhelmed by the collection. Admittedly, the top three rooms were closed for construction purposes, but we have seen a lot better at a more local level, elsewhere. Style over substance in cafe"
Clean and cool,"Relatively small but with a terrific Egyptian section,  nice art and reasonably priced cafe.  We just spent a brief hour but you could easily spend two or three."
Fascinating,Went on a father-son trip. The son really enjoyed it and it was a really good day out. It had a good balance which made it an interesting visit. I would definitely recommend it if passing in Cambridge.
quick visit - we shall be back,"We had too little time (just a little bit more than one hour) so we had to rush and see the highlights of the collections, with the help of friends living now in Cambridge. The museum is nicely organized and has a lot of interesting and valuable collections. We focused on the art sections (Rothschild collection, Renaissance and Impressionism). We had no time to use an audio-guide, leaving this for the next time. Nice museum store."
Great free educational place,This museum is wonderful for children to explore. It's a great free day out and they always have maps or activities for young children to do around the museum.
"Simply amazing, should be the first thing to see here - and free to visit","I read some deeply rubbish one line reviews here saying this place is not worth visiting and I assumed that I will be done visiting everything in under 30min.  How wrong was I?  This place is simply amazing and I highly recommend it as it should be the first place to visit in Cambridge and one day is not enough to see everything:- this museum is located on the southern part of the road packed with colleges (the name of the road changes 3 times) and at this moment in time the entrance is not via the main building as they are doing some restoring work, so you have to take the side entrance- the entry is free and you can make small donations if you wish so plus take a map of the building showing you what to see- spread on 2 floors at this moment in time, this is an amazing Aladdin's cave with items stuck so densely, plus unique items I have never seen or knew existed!!!!- a section dedicated to paintings on the first floor, with Canaletto, Rubens, Rembrandt, Cezanne, Monet etc- lots of medieval armoury as well as Persian, Ottoman etc; daggers, swords etc- several sarcophagus in their Ancient Egypt section together with smaller items- some unique China I have never seen anywhere before, some reminding me of the Habsburg porcelain in Vienna.  Simply stunning British made China!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  which I have never seen anywhere before and I never thought they existed- lots of pottery dating back to the early centuries of of the first millennium or even BC- lots of Chinese, Japanese, Indian pottery- Greek and Roman sculptures etc- you can take pictures but cannot film unfortunately- I had a peek at the ceiling from the main building and it looked simply amazing; once the renovation will be finished I am sure the entrance is going to look stunning- the staff is also very friendly; by comparison how stuck up and nasty the staff in London museums come across as they bark they 'orders' at visitorsJust refreshing, I found this place clean cut with also a great cafe, shops and toilets on the lower ground.  If I was a local probably I would spend hours every weekend here.  Do not miss it."
"Beautiful buildings, fantastic exhibitions!",I love this place!!! I have been visiting it for over 40yrs now since I first came with my father at the age of 5yrs. I highly recommend it to any visitors to the city!!!
Nice visit,This is a free museum. It is very interesting. I don’t give 5 stars to it because the staff at the reception wasn’t very kind. We wanted to go there with a group of students but they didn’t like the idea and tried very hard to put us off.
Short Visit,Well presented museum which is free with a suggested donation of £5. Lockers available for free. Cafe and shop good. Exhibits well labelled. Armoury display excellent. If you are interested in pottery there is a huge display. Overall a very interesting museum in a beautiful building in a fantastic city.
Lunch at the Fitzwilliam,"My cousin and his wife came to visit Cambridge and we took them along to the museum, which they enjoyed very much. We had a very pleasant lunch together there."
lovely museum,"The are quite a few lovely painting by famous painter, the museum is not as large as it looks and there is free entrance"
Very good,"Large, nice, lots of topics, well organized, quite informative, sort of old fashioned, and making over all a pretty good impression."
Fitzwilliam Museum,"This museum contains a large collection of items. The displays include Roman and Egyptian items, paintings and armour. It’s worth visiting as entry is free."
Okay,"The weapons right at the beginning were interesting to learn about. Hand crafted guns, swords and armour with historical context. Past that there was an overwhelming amount of Italian and French fine art. There was a section for Egyptian artefacts which was interesting also. I got bored after about 15mins upstairs; seemed like the space needed to be filled so the art up there was very samey. I wouldn’t go out of my way to visit it but if you’re looking for a free motive it’s worth a look in."
Lots to see,"Armour to paintings, a few decades ago to millennia. Something for everyone. Some of the paintings  do make me smile. Is that really celebrated art? However, each to their own.  A nice place to look at the great and the good all in one place. Nice staff. Happy to help.  Younger children could get a little distracted but there are numerous activities to keep them on track."
Good collection,"Good collection, especially Egypt, greek sculptures, flemish masters and impressionists. Free entry."
Amazing Historical Artifacts,"We saw so many interesting various artifacts from knights armour/military equipment, pottery, glass, ceramics, pictures etc that dated as far back before the birth of Jesus Christ. Every item in the museum had an amazing story to tell. Staff at the museum were very helpful and welcoming."
Beautiful and relaxing,I visit the Fitzwilliam often and it never fails to amaze. Helpful staff with alot of subject knowledge. There is an exhibition room upstairs which often has special events that are open to the public.
Full day visit needed,"This famous museum never fails to capture the imagination!  Have visted it several times but always see something we previously  missed.Admission is free, and the great staircase of the main entry hall always captures a spirit of grandeur however many times one visits!   Thoroughly recommend a visit to anyone, it is  right in the City centre with a extremely imposing palatial facade along side Kings Parade & city bus stop right outside."
Fantastic,Absolutely brilliant definitely worth visiting wonderful to look around seriously interesting also a really nice cafe to have a piece of cake and a coffee when you have finished exploring
Birthday,"Wonderful , amazing, lovely, stunning,big, great cafe,live music when we went😁 Fabulous paintings,great pottery,so much to see 😁😁😁"
