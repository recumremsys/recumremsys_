Soothing river,I felt like in heaven when I saw the sight of the Beas River. It captivated me at first sight. I and my friends loved the sound of the waterfall and the river. Seeing the river made me calm and serene.
Just keep flowing,"All throughout Manali right from Start to end you will find Beas river flowing along. Water gushing through rocks and greenery is a scene to behold. During rainy season, the water level is quite high which might be dangerous to stroll around the river. Other times, the river can be visited at various designated places throughout its course for a peaceful sit out and some awesome photography shots. Many river sports are also organised at several places. Enjoy."

excellent for meditators,its more than words for those who SEE BEYOND the world. It makes me speechless and takes me direct to THAT STILNESS  and i love to sit right in the middle of that divine flow of love of god...One has to experience IT oneself.
Bubbly gushing river,"Beas river invoked mixed reactions in us. After experiencing the beautiful Teesta in Sikkim, we were looking forward to having Beas as our companion during our jouney to Manali. The river was beautiful at times- gushing, bubbling, like a playful girl, flowing over the pebbles and rock. But most part of its course, the river has been reduced to a narrow stream, littered with plastic waste, clothes and what not. In Manali too it was no different. People have made it into a waste dumping ground. Many places we saw that nearby restaurants/hotels/home-stays dispose waste and sewage water into the river. At Club House when we we went down to the river to get a better view, we were heartbroken. It was stinking. Sewage water from nearby establishments was flowing into the river. So much plastic and clothes dumped in. River was hardly flowing.It was so lifeless and dark- not her usual self. We couldn't stand there for a minute. We wish the administration did something to save her from this painful death, that they take stringent measures to ensure that she is kept clean. Enforce rules and laws to prevent her encroachment. Or else, very soon she will cease to exist. And that will be a crime by us-each one of us will be responsible for her death."
Purity,"the River is lifeline of Punjab, on the bank of the river a holy town Beas is built which is headquarters of RadhaSwami group. the River has fresh water and high flow passing from Manali and entering Punjab"

Breathing taking,"A very nice neat and clean river.It has some water activities as well like Rafting, river crossing."
Never ending cold water river,This river is a sure no miss.  The cold water from the mountains just travels through the path and just flows along hundreds of kms.

Beas wild river rafting - must do in Manali,The sight of beas river flowing in Manali-Kullu valley is a treat to watch. Wild river rafting is a life time experience. Never miss this. There are government authorized agencies with well trained personnel. You can have short or a long course. Take long course (about 8 km in the river) if possible. It is worth every penny you pay. The raft guy takes videos while rafting from a good quality helmet camera. They are worthy but little expensive. There is a scope to bargain but may not get great discount since government has fixed rates. Carry one set of clothing. You need to change after rafting.

Spoiled beauty,"What should have been a serene and scenic walk along a Himalayan river was not.  While the view from a distance is amazing, as you approach the river, the debris, garbage, and smell was off putting.  I had liked forward to this from the photos posted in travel guides, but found that stretches of the river were very unclean, especially near the larger towns of Kullu and Manali."

Set right in between stately mountains on either side of the river, our 12km rafting was absolutely thrilling and breath-taking, enhanced by sights of glorious eagles soaring just above us! Definitely a must for all! Be prepared to be in awe of God's endless beauty in creation!"

A long walk down to the banks,Banks of river Beas is a nice place to stroll in your spare time. Some places have some sports arrangement like wire crossing. However mostly it is a steep walk down and up the river banks from any point and the boulders on the bank calls for extra caution especially for kids.
A magnificient river,The drive in Manali is right by this river and the sightseeing is a treat for the eyes. There are countless number of rapids that you will see. The water looks really clean and pure to the finest.

Best Beas,"At times we don't have any words to express our feelings , the river flows from the mountains running down at gentle pace and making its royal way towards the other. It was such beautiful and fascinating sight to view for a lifetime.The cold breeze will touch you gently creating an experience of a lifetime.. It was so pure !"
Beautiful River for rafting..,"The Beas river adds to the natural beauty of the Himalayas. The Beas River flows from a height of 14,308 ft at Rohtang Pass, & Beas kund, Manali District- Kullu, Himachal Pradesh, from where it flows through the Kullu valley towards south, adding from various mountains bound tributaries.River rafting in Manali is one heart-racing adventure that gets thrill-seeking travellers on their toes. Easy and abundant water in the Beas River, Fishing at Beas River in Manali,  is a delightful activity that enables you to fish in the clear waters of the river."
Angling experience for grandsons at river Beas ! ,We  tried fishing for trout in Beas river on our way to Manali but were unsuccessful ! Maybe we will be able to catch some the next time ! 😁😉
Sceneric place to enjoy the time,You can easily spent 2-3 hours at Beas specially during sunset time. It is flowing thought out manali and kullu. From any point of the river you can enjoy view of mountain. I visited during rainy season (June) and the atmosphere was excellent. Location near manali was the best.
flows almost through kullu manali,nice river with lots of round stones on the sides. River rafting is an adventorous experience there though you have to bargain and fix the rates
Serene beauty,Rivers always amaze me. Flowing water is mesmerizing. Beas river provides lot of scenic beauty to your journey to Kullu/Manali. It goes along the road for a long distance. Have pictures with river background and of course river rafting is another must have experience.
Being Tourist Channel Review - A place where you are driven by nature,Amazing and the place all around in so close to nature. The water is chilled and feels so fresh here. Come with you friend and family and enjoy. You can watch my video on Being Tourist youtube channel where explored this place and also manali
River of the Himalayas,The Beas River begins from near-by Rohtang Pass and  flows to Manali - Kullu and on and on..You need not visit this place as you can see this river all along manali... Many of the locals / tourists have been polluting this river by throwing garbage/ablusions.
Beas at its best,Major attraction of manali is it's centrally located Beas river. From van vihar's backside you can go to sideways of river & can spend some good time on the bank of river with tea & maggie :)
Peaceful and clean place to sit in manali,"Beas river in manali is the most peaceful and clean place to sit and chill with people. the water waves and, tress behind the river and the mountains behind the tree. everything just makes a perfect view for the place in manali."
Nice walk next to the river,"When you go to old Manali, turn right after the bridge and walk next to the river. Nice walk. Good places to eat."
Old Manali,Sit on the banks of the Beas and watch people enjoying themselves tied up and jumping in the water.The serenity of the the river;the trees around and small cafes is a site to remember... Have a beer;steel a drag and forget the traffic you face daily...Beautiful place to be...

Spending some time near the bank of the river will make you philosophically reflect on life. DO PAY A VISIT...... you will love it.
Good spot for chilling,"Went to the beas river and experienced icy cold water on our feet. Had snacks near the river and tea, excellent."
Rocky River,This is just another which is very Rocky. It looks treacherous in case you have a fall on smooth rocks. This river flows along the road from Manali to Kullu and makes a nice travel companion should you need one. There are locations where there urchins running White water rafting dinghies. I did not feel encouraged to try any such adventures though.
Scenic river with quite cold waters,"Probably the most picturesque river I have seen.It keeps flowing through Manali.There are some location on the Kullu - Manali road where you can spend some time admiring the beauty of the river while your feet are immersed into the waters.Water rafting is also quite popular but over priced, 5000 Rs for the 20 minutes ride for the family of 3.Photography and video shooting charges were extra and again over priced."
Serene experience,Breathtakingly beautiful. We sat by the river for sometime and got some nice pictures too. It's a beautiful experience just sitting by the banks watching the river roar by.
Water water everywhere ,Just spectacular place . Even my 8 year could go for rafting . She loved it . We also sat for 3 hours near river bank with lot of adventure activities like zip line which was enjoyed by my daughter
MOST BEAUTIFUL.,Beas river all along is the highlight of MANALI. we had RAFTING in the Beas for the second time(earlier in 2008 visit) and its memorable.
"Nice clean cold water, great for river rafting","Did River rafting here, it was an experience to remember. Make sure you opt for the option to record the video on GoPro camera, as it captures great memories. The water was clean and really cold. Don't forget to pack extra pair of clothes, we you will need them after completing this activity. I would strongly recommend doing river rafting, for the great experience it provides."
very good flow and clean,must sit there and listen sound of water flow. It gives lots of peace. The flow was of good speed and clean water
Beauty!,"You can't miss this in Manali and often will come across this river. Beas was flowing few hundred meters away from our Vashist Home Stay and the river sound in the night was soothing. Used to sit in the Balcony (cold though :-)) and listen to this sound. As per the law you are not supposed to enter (what we heard from our driver) but there are some open spaces where you can access the river and touch and feel the water. There are few adventure activities organized by private operators - river rafting, hot air balloon (just goes up and comes down, not a actual flight though) - i tried to book but the wind direction was suddenly changed and was a bit scary. so we gave up. this is near Vashist. Otherwise, go down, touch the river, feel it and more importanly take few pictures."
Commercialized,The activities in these areas are quite commercialized. Not recommended for anyone looking for actual adventure
family,on summer vacation running river is an added attraction to iced manali lust greenery proves it to be devbhoomi
Awesome views! Running all through the major Manali Road,"Beas River has mesmerizing views and runs parallel to the Mall Road and Naggar Road so that we can enjoy the beautiful river even when going from one place to another. Also used for rafting, but in May the water levels are not that great in the river. We did not do the rafting for the same reason."
It guides you way upto Manali and up,"The Beas river will accompany you from the bottom (Bilaspur) till you reach Manali. The river shows its various forms, curves, depths and much more as you travel along side to Manali or from Manali to down. The river is also used for river rafting at multiple places."
Manali vist,Good place with excellent secnaric beauty with in good valleys if Himalayas. Place to be seen and visited.
Beas River Manali.,"This fast flowing river consists mainly of snow melt from the surrounding mountain ranges, and provides both irrigation and fresh water supplies, cascading downwards between New and Old Manali.Impressive against the backdrop of snow cladmountains."
Great for river rafting ,Very good water rafting...please carry clothes for changing ... changing room is not so good totally wet.... safe water rafting for family

The river rises in the Himalayas in central Himachal Pradesh and flows for some 470 kms to the Sutlej River in the state of Punjab.The Beas River marked the eastern most border of Alexander the Great's conquests. It was one of the rivers which created problems in Alexander's invasion of India. His troops mutinied here and refused to go any further. Alexander shut himself in his tent for 3 days, but when his men did not change their desires he gave in, raising 12 huge altars to mark the limit and glory of his expedition.The river flows all around the path to Manali and is very scenic and beautiful. The river bed is very rocky. The water is cool and fresh. One can enjoy doing rafting at several places around the river, especially near Kullu."

Wonderful,The river Beas flowing along the path everywhere in Manali is a wonderful and soothing sight. The view of Beas from the trail at Van Vihar is superb. Loved it.
Flows beside the road for halfway from Shimla to Manali. Offers Rafting points on the way,"The Beas river flows almost parallel to the road from Shimla to Manali in the latter half of the journey. If has few Rafting points on the way which have a slightly lesser turbulence and offers a small, plain stretch of current with relatively clean waters for rafting."
Adventure,Had a great time rafting here ..2 times actually once while going from kullu to manali & then back from manali on our way to kasauli...it was a great adventure .had ultimate fun absolutely.The just sight of river also makes u happy.Rafting depends on the current & flow.

Gem of Kullu Manali,The river is simply priceless. We travelling by road from Kullu to Manali and practically found every twist and turn of this river that runs alongside to be abundant with natural beauty. Feels like heaven on earth.
Beauty in abundance,The picturesque route was one nice thing to see on the day from Bilaspur to Manali. Manali is 108 kms from this diversion in Mandi – one leading to Manali and one to Pathankot – 208 kms. River Beas was flowing by the side and was a very relaxing view all around.
Sound of Nature,"A place to sit back and relax, watch the nature, the snow-capped mountains,the pine trees, the rustling sound of water flowing, the colors of the water is as pristine as human soul indeed a place to rejuvenate your mind and soul."
River rafting is excellent experience,River rafting from Kufri is a beautiful experience. Charges vary from INR 500 to 900 depending on the season and demand. Flow is unpredictable.

Clean and cold touching every village in HP,"One of the main rivers of India.Just clean and very cold.We spent some time getting down in riverside at Kullu and Manali.Water was so cold that we were literally freezing after getting into water within few seconds.River runs down many cities/villages in HP.However, it has been restricted to get down in the water at most places as it very risky."
Hotel Facing is direct to Beas River,"Hotel Facing is direct to Beas River & Mountains  which is very awesome view , The hotel provides u almost every facilities i say food was great(i mean it :))Overall experience was awesome.I'll recommend this hotel to every couple,solo,friends and families:). You wont regret,just be there:)"
Rafting isnt as fun as in Rishikesh,"Water isnt that deep and river isnt as wide as Ganga. So for those who have already done the rafting in Rishikesh, this experience will be pretty 'meh'."
Enjoyed,Very good place.We visited Van Vihar and there is a way to go down to the river from there.But be careful because the water level can rise anytime.
Mind-blowing ,"After coming to Manali a person should stay at left bank especially in Patlikul and Ghurdaur, where you can enjoy the best of White River Water Rafting & Paragliding. And see the best Roses of this particular place. It's worth it. Beas river here comes through the wild water tributaries of water falls coming from top mountain on Left Bank"
Peaceful and Beautiful,"We went to see the van on mall road but discovered that you can get to the bead river from inside the park. It was a little track ,with lots of pine trees and the area smells so good because of leaves and wood. It's beautiful and I love the sound water makes. We sat their , had snacks , soak up the sun and enjoyed nature. But to my disappointment the area need to get maintained and cleaned. Otherwise it's good place."
Rafting ,"Good experience,exited, happiness reloaded. It is in Kullu & they also take photos & videos. We have to pay separately for rafting & videos"
Love you BEAS!......,Awesome!... Speechless!......BEAS river takes us with catching scenery towards Manali from Mandi. River BEAS flows all the way along with us making the place between huge mountains. A lovely and wonderful place to see..
Majestic and beautiful,This is a prominent river which flows through manali... The views of the river from the mountains are just amazing... A lot of adventure activities such as rafting are also organised in this river... highly recommended
Near to My Hotel,Had good Photo Shot. and nice place to hangover in free time in search of peace to go through inner peace
Charm of Manali.,"Probably you have seen various river in Himalaya. Now how Bea's is different! Still now the river is not polluted in the name of religion (but anthropogenic affect is there).The greenery along the bank, the colour of foliage, serene view of snow capped mountain and the clear and colourless water is something different from other rivers. Enjoy the beauty of Beas enroute Kullu to Manali. Higher at Manali it's more clean. But it lost its charm after the Dam near Mandi. Few places rapids are too good. I was coming back from Manali on Buddha Purnima, during evening the river was like flowing molten silver. It was the high point of my trip. That view I will never forget in my life."
Unfold the peace of your mind,Calm & serene...the timeless flowing of water will enchant your mind & heart. Look at the snow capped mighty Himalayas at the backdrop. Enjoy the local fish cuisine at any riverside restaurant. Great experience!
"Fast, Lively river.",This falls throughout Manali..with lovely White and Grey round  pebbles. Falling beneath beautiful snow mountains. People do river rafting as well. Very broad river. Most places so many BIIIIGGG stones and makes river falling noisy and exited.
"best in evenings , get candid and keep clicking",its nice to visit beas in evevning times. its better to visit while going before manali. just get down on the way and spend some quality time as inside city its quite crowded.
Awesome ,Visited Manãli for 10 days. This river was the second amazing thing after the mountains sights. Gave it 4 😁
the constant companion,"Beas river is your constant companion in your trip to Manali. If you are coming from Shimla, view from Mandi is amazing, with Beas river is the constant feature, right upto Manali. One could have the fun of river rafting in the Beas river at Kullu. There are plenty of options for river rafting at Kullu. One could also have the fun of enjoying his/her meal/snacks at many hotels, situated right at the bank of this fantastic river."

River rafting,"The sound of it is simply awesome in the night and just makes your experience a pleasurable one., One must avail the rafting experience which is worth."
beautiful,Beas river makes the kullu valley complete. without it the valley will look empty. tourists love to go near it and feel its flow. just dont do it during rainy season. it changes its mood quickly.
Get lost in the murmur of beas river.,Who doesn't love the sound of the flowing river? There is a peace in that sound and beas river is the perfect. Take time out in evening and sit next to the river bank.
Beautiful river flowing throughout Manali and HP,"A very beautiful river flowing throughout Manali and various parts of Himachal Pradesh. It is the backbone and identity of Himachal Pradesh. Lots of fun activities such as river rafting done. Certainly it is the lifeline of Manali. It flows through steep mountains, with high and low streams of water, making it a very beautiful view for photography. You will find lot of natural habitat around it."

Chilling and thrilling river,Ice cold water..very thrilling and chilling..some places on the way to manali has beautiful valleys and dam constructed for Beas river
A must see in Manali,"When you are in Himachal, Beas River shouldn't be missed,especially in Manali.The river in Manali is very close to the famous mall road and people can walk down the side walk path near Aleo to get to the river. The very cold and clean water and the great view of surrounding mountains certainly shouldn't be missed.However,people should be cautious while getting close to the river as the water flow is quite fast."
beautiful place,"awesome place for photography, full of enjoyment very clean  water, enjoyed a lot at this place. highly recommended."

Rafting experience,We had amazing rafting experience in the ice cold water of Beas river. It filled us with thrill and gave us lot of memories to cherish
River Rafting,River Beas originates in Rohtang pass in Manali and flows down through Himachal and merges in Sutlej in Punjab.The water is clear and clean.We visited  Manali in november.Water flow was normal.After completing sightseeing we wanted to try some adventure sports.We opted for river rafting.We were four persons and they charged Rs 4000 for rafting and Rs 1000 for Vedio.We did rafting for 40 minutes.The charges vary based on the distance of ride.This was medium ride and is sufficient for first timers.It was fantastic .Enjoyed fully.Every one should try it as it is reasonably priced.And you get such opportunities not very often.
Beas river,"This 470 km river originate from Beas Kund and after passing through Manali,Kullu etc complete its journey in Sutluz river in Punjab.The Manali and Kullu are located at its Bank.You will find Beas every where in Manali and while goingto Solang valley.Several water sports and river rafting at Kullu is very famous.The water is clean and cold and beauty of this river is superb and worth watching"
Wild river rafting on the Beas is some experience!!,"As we traveled from Naldehra, after a while the Beas snaked its way beside us. Its flow was interrupted by dams at some points.The high point though, was the wild river rafting activity!!This was the very first attempt for us and frankly, I was a bit hesitant.Fortunately, the activity providers were professionals and eased us into the experience. Sensibly, we were made to change into an all weather outfit and don a life jacket and helmet. We chose the 'medium distance' ride, that is a good 30 to 40 minutes.Initially, the ride appeared to be easy going but as the boulders came up ahead, we tasted the real stuff! Being dumped by roaring waves and the raft being tossed about by the wilds was some adventure!Something one just has to experience!!"
Wild north advanture,Best river rafting agency in kullu Manali contact for all kind of ADVANTURE sports in kullu Manali. Special packedge for river rafting and paragliding. Contact wild north ADVANTURE . Gautam thakur 9816303004
Very forceful,Worth visiting places like this you can experience nature differently.Water falls and other scene should be photographed during evening
An Amazing Experience!,"An amazing experience to stay by the river Beas. The roar of the river takes you to a high. Along with that surrounding snow capped mountains takes your breath away. Though Rishikesk is considered as the white-water-rafting capital of India, but one can have some fun-time here too, tough not as much."
Rejuvinating,You can sit all daylong and enjoy at the riverfront of the resort.they served us with the snacks on the river front which was the best Part.
Beautiful River!,It's  nice to see that it's clean for the most part. River flows really well and could also go rafting.

Very Good place for kids,"There are several areas for river rafting, bungee jumping kid play area including a shopping area for Himachal Souvenirs."
A must-visit place when in Manali,"Did not do river rafting this time around when visiting Manali, since we had young kids, but this is an extremely beautiful river to sit around and enjoy the natural beauty.Since water from the dam can be released any time without prior notice, you are now barred from entering the waters at many scenic spots. So keep a note of this."
Calm quiet river! ,Visited river Beas on our trip to Manali. It is a calm quiet river providing nice place to relax along its bank and enjoy the nature’s beauty. One can enjoy the rafting here as well. Also good place to click pictures.

Nice place to visit,It was awesome visit to Manali. Weather is good and nice place to visit during winter time. we often used to go to beas river
Best thing to do in Manali,This river is the main attraction of Manali. It's gushing sound can be heard all across Manali and its sheer ferocity is worth watching. The river front is not as neatly developed as one would have hoped but definitely its the best part of Manali.
Amazing ,When we are going to arrive manali we saw this river in a sangam.Cleaner than ganga.Must do the sports on river like zip linging and many more.Have fun.Happy journey.
Great river with icy chilled water...,I visited in with family. In Rohtang Vyas cave is said to be origin of beas river. You can enjoy beas river at club house and behind van vihar.
Enjoy river rafting....tremendous enjoyment....nice view along,The river spread across Himachal and its source is Rohtang Pass. You can relax in the side of river but be careful to get into the water. Most of the river has stones...and you cannot imagine the depth of the water. You can enjoy rafting either in Kullu or Manali...It was fantastic experience for us. Children would not be allowed to raft...Your clothes will get wet when you go for rafting...please plan accordingly before you go for it.

Beautiful and cold water,Good place to be at if u love to hang around near river areas...the water current was ok and once could spend good time here. Activities like river crossing is also being arranged here
Beautiful river,Most beautiful river in this belt. Water is really Crystal Clear. Water flowing from mountains and leads to fertile Area of Punjab. rafting is very popular here.
River Rafting @ Beas River,We booked a hotel near Beas river and it was a wonderful experience for all of us. We did rafting also and trust me you will enjoy like anything after that experience of water rafting
The best place to chill out,"The coasts of Beas river offers amazing views perfect for photography and videography. The cool breeze and music of nature makes anyone feel comfortable and forget their problems. It was even shown in the film ""Yeh jawani hai deewani"""
Meandering river in Manali,"Throughout my trip in Manali this river turned into a good companion. On the way uphill towards Rohtang I noticed that there were many resorts that were located along the river bed. If you plan to go river rafting then there are many centres that offers you this facility. Though I didn't go for rafting, a tea break along this river was memorable."
Raffting in Beas,You should not miss Raffting in beas. Families can also raft in beas. We did rafting at 7am. It was too cold.
B E A utiful,"Vyas river or Beas river, call it whatever you want.  It's beautiful.Breath taking viewBlue and crystal water cutting through mountains.I had to stop several times just to gaze at it.I would suggest finding non popular spots so that you can actually enjoy the view.And request: don't throw garbage in and around it.Popular hangout areas are dirty but otherwise it's  awesome."
River rafting in freezing cold water,The river was constantly flowing with us throughout our trip to Manali as it flows next to the hilly road... it was clean and freeezing cold. We opted to do 9km river rafting on the river and bouy we had awesome time and thrilling experience. We were charged 6K for 4people including video and pictures. Must do for any adventurer.
An excellent rafting experience in the river,One must avail the rafting experience which is worth. The captain of the boat was professional and helpful.
Beautiful river with a lot of sound,The river was quite close to our hotel and we could hear the sound of it in the night when it was nice and quiet. The sound of it is simply awesome in the night and just makes your experience a pleasurable one.
Clear waters,"In most parts of Manali, the Beas river has some of the clearest water I have seen of the rivers in Himachal Pradesh.One of the top reasons you enjoy Manali, as the sound of running river water is itself therapy. Find a spot on the side where they serve maggi and hot chai(I suggest the spot below the bridge to old Manali), and settle down. Bliss!"
River Rafting,"Great to do River rafting. Please ensure that you do not overpay. the drivers of your vehicle have tie ups here and will take you to the place where they intend to. Do your research. Pay the price that is appropriate for the season. For Dec, it is around 3K for 2 people in an individual raft. if you share, max 6, it will be less."
A scenic and relaxing drive,"Starting from Mandi all the way to Manali which is 110 kms, the drive amidst valleys and ridges, from uphill to downhill on mountain roads becomes a pleasure cruise only thanks to the Beas river flowing alongside the whole way.Indeed a very relaxing and pretty drive all the way to Manali."
The mostly beautiful lifeline of Manali,"Beas river will be any traveller's companion in Himachal Pradesh. You can enjoy the river at every turn of the road, at every valley gushing and glittering silvery blue throughout its path. The water is very cold. Several places are advised as No Swim zones due to the calm but deeper waters. RAfting is allowed in some places in Manali. Choose professional and recognized service providers. The river makes every place scenic."
Talkative companion !,"From the moment you enter Manali , or even before that , River Beas, becomes your companion. And everywhere you go , River Beas flows by your side , sometimes on your right and then suddenly it will appear on your left. Looks like it’s playing pee-a-boo , teasing you. Sparkling , gurgling , full of life ! So many tourist , rush from one spot to another , ignoring this beautiful flowing river . Make sure , you spare some time to sit by river side and listen to it’s soothing sounds. It’s nothing less than meditation that will refresh you , washing all your stress.You can choose variety of spots to enjoy it’s company. Adventure lovers can go for rafting too , otherwise enjoy Hot tea and Maggi as you sit dipping your feet in playful waters. For sure , this is one thing most of us can’t dream of doing in our home cities.Just one word of caution - This river tends to swell all of a sudden , due to rains or increased water flow. Do not venture much deep into it , unless the spot is inhabited with locals."

Beas river,Very scenic view with voice of flowing water.i visited three times this river in my one manali trip. At some places you can also get snow peak mountains in your pics along with the river view.
Clean naturally flowing water....,The river Beas runs alongside the road from Kullu to Manali....You can park your car on the roadside and sit near the river for a relaxing afternoon....Just be careful with kids while sitting besides the river as the flow can be high on certain days.
Just wow,For me it was the best thing in Manali. Going early morning and enjoying the sunrise sitting near river is mesmerizing.Must visit.
