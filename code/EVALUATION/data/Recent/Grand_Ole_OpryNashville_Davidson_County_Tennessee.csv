Wonderful ,The grande ole Opry was well worth the back stag tour.  Just knowing all who has walked the halls and dressing rooms at the Opry.  I got so excited when I walked up on stag and stood in that circle.  Picture to prove it.
Great tour,This was our first stop in Nashville and it didn’t disappoint.  Our tour guide was very enthusiastic and she had a lot of knowledge to share with us.  I believe she was the manager of the tour department.  The intro video helped immerse you into the history and the importance of the Opry.  I wish we could have walked into the dressing rooms as the photo shows - we were only able to go into 1.I would advise pre-paying for the stage photo as it was slightly cheaper than buying it there.  Our photographer was great and even retook our photo when asked.
Great History and AMAZING guide!,"I happen to have very little knowledge of country music and it’s history, but I was honored to tour this historic building and learn all about its past in other locations. My tour guide was enthusiastic and it was contagious and fun! The Opry building was very well organized and beautifully designed! I think it’s an ‘American MUST SEE’ when in Nashville and I’m thankful to have learned a few things in the process!"
Great tour!,This tour is well worth your time and money!  The staff did an excellent job tailoring the tour so we all felt safe during the pandemic.  I appreciated it when one man in our group would not wear a mask and the staff did not allow him to continue with us.  Enough about covid...you will walk where the stars walk and hear back stories that you will remember forever.
Pandemic visit,"Even though we went during the pandemic, we were able to walk around and enjoy the music being played. It was closed, but you could still go around and there was a gift shop that was awesome. Well worth the stopping."
Grand Ole Tour,"Starts with a video and the you take a guided your. Our tour guide was very good and informative. You definitely are back stage on the tour, seeing the dressing rooms and lounge area's etc.  You also go on stage and get your picture taken ( not included in the tour price, I believe it was $25).  Overall not a bad tour, even for someone like myself that isn't a country music fan."
Fantastic,My husband and I thought the $30 price was a little high. But I am glad we went. The opening segment was soooo good that it gave me goose bumps.
May the circle be unbroken,"Fantastic guide, fantastic access, just the right length at an hour. A great way to experience a magical place."
Fantastic back stage tour,One of the most enjoyable tours I have ever taken. As a fan of country music this was the epitome of that genre for for me.  The tour guide was excellent. The venue is spotless and a walking museum to Country Music.  A must see for all country music folks.
Pickles are on point!!,Big thanks to Sarah for the moonshine tasting!! She open my mind to the wonderful land of moonshine pickles!!
Wonderful Grand Ole Opry Tour,"Even with the COVID pandemic my wife and I made a quick trip to celebrate our 31st wedding anniversary and decided to come to Nashville. To us this is the primary landmark to visit and it dis not disappoint. Their COVID awareness and deterent was good, ensuring masks were put on and sanitizer everywhere. The staff was courtious and well prepared to handle such a culturally rich tour. We enjoyed every minute as we were taken through the venue. All along the way you were guided and not rushed. It is a must see for any music fan, especially a country music fan."
Classic spot for anyone who loves music! ,"A must-do, quick, relatively inexpensive experience for anyone visiting Nashville. The food and drink options were limited but the service was friendly!"
Wonderful!,"This was a MUST do for us on our trip to Nashville. What an emotional part of Country music history, to be able to tour the Grand Ol Opry. The videos were great, and the tour guide was full of information."
History ,"Only had time to snap a picture but, thinking of all the famous people were drove that rode was inspiring. It was closed early morning didn’t get to tour it but I’m sure it would be interesting to see."
A Grand Experience!,"The guides for the backstage tour were very knowledgeable.  We enjoyed seeing the auditorium and especially all the backstage areas and dressing rooms.  Even with social distancing guidelines, the group tour was well managed. We enjoyed posing on the stage and having our individual photos made. I am glad that we received information about the Saturday night free online shows.  We can't wait to return to Nashville when the Opry is live on the stage again."
I’m sure our country music forefathers aren’t happy.,"My family visited September 6, 2020 and was very disappointed. Hannah was our tour guide and she only knew what she was scripted to say. She couldn’t  answer your questions, even when she asked if you had any. She had no idea of all of the history in the walls. We were rushed through because they schedule the tours too close together, so that they can have more people coming through to make more money. I understand that, since we are in a pandemic and they are not making what they usually would, but still disappointing to pay for the full tour and be rushed along. You will watch 3 videos and see the backstage dressing rooms. Then at the very end you can stand in the circle so that they can try to sell a photograph of you. The photographer was rude and rushed us along. We did buy the photo because I wanted a picture from there. You are allowed to take pictures with your own camera or phone, but only from the sides. If you want a nice picture front and center on the circle, you have to buy their photo package.  The photographer takes one picture quickly, and you either buy it or not. I’m glad I got to go but was very disappointed because since I was a little girl it’s been a dream to be there. Very sad to see our great country music history wasted on uneducated tour guides!"
Stand on the Wooden Circle,"If you want to feel the grandeur of country music, this tour is for you. We were able to walk out on stage and stand in the ""wooden circle"".  Tour was fast paced and I wish I had more time to take it all in, but a great experience."
Always Fun! Book it! ,Loved the backstage tour & the history of the amazing country artists. Try to get on the original circular wood stage.
Awesome ,We took the tour and it was awesome and very informative. The place is full of history. Our tour was great.
A must see for country music fans,The Grand Ole Opry and is synonymous with Country music’s greatest artists and performances. The tour of the facility is filled with rich Country music history and artifacts. The highlight of the tour has to be standing on the circle where the performers stand and having your photo taken. This circle was moved from a prior location of the opry and the distinction is noticeable.
excellent,we took a tour - worth the money so exciting to be able to hear and see all the rooms where the famous people that sing go.  was interesting about the flood - loved the dolly parton stories and so much history - what a great place.
A Great Country Experience,"There are few experiences in life like the Grand Ole Opry. We began the day by going to the Ryman Auditorium, which I highly suggest before going to the Opry itself, to better understand the history behind the creation of the iconic Opry. Once we arrived at the Opry, right across the street from Aquarium Restaurant in the Opry Mills shopping plaza, we were greeted by beautifully maintained hedges/trees that were interspersed with little monuments to country music. Before the two story exterior were dividers that either led to the gift shop (which was still open after the show) or the entrance to the Opry itself.Once you enter the Opry you can't help but be impressed with how much thought and care went into the construction of this magnificent structure. The amenities for food or liquor are about what you'd expect at a venue like this, but the barn themed show piece around which the stage is built gives a feeling of being back in the Hee Haw days of TV. The massive signs to either side of the stage with ON AIR warnings take you back a bit too...it's strange sitting in the middle of a live music/comedy performance realizing millions of people around the world are sitting by their radio's listening with you. It really does pull you back in time a bit and make you feel connected to those who listened to Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton, Loretta Lynn, Waylon Jennings and so many other greats perform in the center of that same circle.I highly recommend buying the Post-Show Guided Backstage tour once in your life. Going through the same doors that modern stars go through, seeing the wall of Golden names who have joined the Opry, looking at the uniquely designed rooms where the greats have sat before going on stage and finally being able to stand in the Unbroken Circle itself, looking out into the lights of the audience, you feel for a moment what it must be like in their shoes. It was an amazing experience for me knowing that I was standing on the same ground walked by those I watched as kids and who have passed beyond. You don't have to get as surreal as I did, but I think it brings you out of this being just some place once you take in the enormity of what went behind its construction and what was created by it.If you're in Nashville this place, to me, is an absolute must. If you'd like to spend a day then go across to the Opry Mills shops, take in the Aquarium and visit Madam Tussauds Wax Museum. There is plenty to keep you occupied before a late night show or after an afternoon one. The acts are also a mix of talent but generally have a Hall of Fame singer with top end young talent."
Stood in the circle,"Having family as a part of Hee Haw naturally made a visit to the Grand Ol Opry a must.  We were taken to stage A where the show was taped which was worth the trip in itself.  We toured the dressing rooms, saw where the guests entered and we're welcomed by Minnie Pearl's fountain. Then we were led out on the stage and had our picture taken ""in the circle."" My husband quietly sang Amazing Grace so he could say he sang on the stage at the Grand Ol Opry.  Well worth it."
A Must See,"Madeleine was our tour guide and she was great.  The tour was phenomenal and honored face masks and social distancing.  It starts with a video/movie that is so well presented you'd think Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood were standing in front of you.  Very moving and very informative.  LOVED this tour and getting backstage. From the Walk of Stars, Studio A, Center Stage in the  to the Circle to the dressing rooms and auditorium. Don't leave Nashville without stopping here!"
Enjoyable tour!!,We really enjoyed the tour.  The only thing that occurred that was not the best was the tickets purchased did not match the ticket date requested.  We had to exchange the tickets for the correct date.
Lot of country music history here,"Very modern venue for the Grand Old Opry. The back stage tour was informative, definitely aroused a desire to see a show, though due to covid-19, I will have to pastpone.  There us free parking across the street at the Grand Old Opry Mall in front of Dave and Busters."
Must-Do in Nashville!,"Well-run tour considering what's going on with Covid. Our guide was delightful and it was really fun to see the building, dressing rooms, stage, etc. Very cool to stand where so many country music stars have stood. The opening video with Garth & Trisha was really neat, too."
Opry House Daytime Backstage Tour,"My boyfriend anx I visited the Opry house on 7/30. It was a great experience. We loved seeing the inside of the Opry house, and all of the behind the scenes things that go on. It was a really nice tour, well worth the price!"
The only reason I didn't give it a very good is because of confusion to first timers as mentioned above.,"While the new Grand ole Opry facility doesn't have the history and old atmosphere of the old Ryman Theater, but it does have air conditioning.  I can remember the days in the old Ryman when the heat was drastic. .  Actually the Ryman has been reconditioned is now also nice venue to see music acts.  One thing that is awkward for most experiencing the Grand ole Opry is that is not just a concert, but actually a live performance of a radio show.  With commercials being read by the announcer and pauses for other pre-recorded spots.  And it has always been this.  And for those not knowing they wonder what is the world is going on.  But each show presents the very top country music performers and some of it's legends.  So it is really a wonderful overall experience.  I was fortunate enough to be invited to sit on the stage during one of these shows.  It is a special honor they bestow on friends, relatives and those in the music industry.  I was there because I was producing that year's Country Music Awards for Dick Clark."
Must see,The highlight of our trip while in Nashville. It was an incredible experience that you should for sure do if you are a country music fan. To stand in the circle where so many great musicians have stood was amazing!!
What a Great Place to Visit,"This was my 4th. consecutive year visiting the Opry,  and each year and show has been a spectacular event.  The behind the scenes tour was also amazing,  The history of the Opry is awesome.  2019 was also the 2nd time I visited the famed Ryman Auditorium.   What a place.   All I can say if ever in Nashville, Get to one or both, you will not be dissapointed."
Tour during Covid exceeded all expectations,"We initially only planned to tour the Ryman, but I am so glad that we added the Opry to our agenda when it reopened for tours just a day prior to our arrival in Nashville.  The two venues really need to be experienced together.  Combo tickets can be booked through the Ryman website which saves about 20 dollars per ticket.   To find the deal, click on ""buy tickets"" and then on ""packages""  The website will allow you to customize the times for both of your tours, either on the same day or on consecutive days.  I would highly recommend booking the tour online ahead of time.  Currently the Opry is operating at reduced capacity, and only a few tours are offered each day.  When we visited, no same day tickets were available, and this was on a Tuesday.  The tour begins with a multi media, immersive presentation hosted by Garth Brooks and Trisha Yearwood, that you watch while seated on comfortable couches and armchairs.  Glance at the pictures on the wall while you watch, they actually change along with the movie.  Following the movie, a guide takes a small group of people throughout the whole building, including the artist entrance, the TV studio, the dressing rooms and backstage area, the gallery of Opry members and their mail boxes and lastly the stage and auditorium.  A picture is taken of your family while standing in ""the circle"" that you have the option to purchase. (Country music fans will know about the circle.  If you don't know, you will find out during the tour).  You even have the opportunity to sing into the microphone.  We passed on that challenge but another young woman in our group did a great job after being volunteered by her mother.  Our guide was very personable and enthusiastic, sharing several funny and heartfelt stories.  The Opry came alive as more than just a building.  Masks were required, and it was easy to keep apart from other members of the group.  In the larger areas, markers on the ground were provided and when entering tight spaces like the dressing rooms, the guides send in one family at a time.  We felt perfectly safe.  The guide was very upbeat and respectful about the restrictions, so it didn't feel like we were ordered around.  The gift shop had a nice selection of souvenirs.  One last tip:  Park behind the Opry Mills mall (close to the movie theatre entrance) and walk over towards the two big guitars.  It's very close and you can save yourself the parking fee charged at the Opryland resort and the Opry itself."
When in Nashville see the Famous Grand Ole Opry show!,"After visiting the museum, we booked tickets to see the show on Saturday night 7-9.  It was definitely an experience.  There were no famous people performing.  It was very lively.  Some of the acts not as good as others, but I would definitely recommend it if you've never been."
worth it even if you are not a country music fan!,"This was our first trip to Nashville.  We did not know much about the Grand Ole Opry except that's where country singers dreamed to perform.  It was a 1 hr. guided tour.  We got our tickets online before we went.  The tickets cost $33 + $3/tix fee +2.50 etix fee.  It's about a 19 min uber ride from downtown Nashville.  We were all pleasantly surprised.  The tour was timely, well organized and very interesting.  You went backstage where the dressing room were and then you got to go on the stage and they took your picture with a guitar.   We are all not country music fans, but we loved it so much that we booked tickets to come to experience the Opry at night.  No one famous was playing, but in case we never got back.  It was a fun night!"
Awesome,The backstage tour was incredible. Loved seeing where the country stars dressed and gathered before the show. Standing in the circle was a true once in a lifetime experience.
Enjoyed!,This was on my bucket list and it did not disappoint! We had issues with our ticket purchase from the website and they worked with us and made it work for our group! The tour was great and made my week! Definitely would recommend!
Tour during Covid,"Appreciated the social distancing measures in place and small group size. Masks were required which was great. The only thing I would change is when the group has to go through a doorway to have us go single file otherwise people could be a little too close for different comfort levels. Overall, an interesting and fun tour."
Wow!,Backstage tour was awesome! We learned so much and loved that they take you to the dressing rooms and star’s entrance.  Will go back once we can see a live show there.
An excellent night out,"This was our 3rd trip to the Grand Ole Opry and you are always guaranteed a good night out.  It is a wonderful theatre seating just under 5000.  Allocated seating in padded pews which gives a nice nod back to the Ryman.  The line up of each show is different and the acts slowly get announced in the weeks leading up to it.  It is likely if you book a long way in advance you will not know who you are going to see, but the Opry show is all about the experience and is bigger than any one artist.  There are normally 6 or 7 acts on each performance ranging from up and coming artists, legends, and current mega stars.  We recommend booking as far in advance as possible to get a good selection of seats.There is a huge gift shop with a fantastic range of clothing, housewares, memorabilia, Christmas decorations (all year) and music.  The shop is open throughout the day.This show is a must when in Nashville and we cannot wait for visit number 4."
Nashville Smokies Trip,"Was able to do a tour and visit the gift shop, was closed due to Covid 19. Look toward to coming back for a show next trip!"
Great whether you're country music fan or not!,"I hate to admit it, but the only thing I knew about the Grand Ole Opry before I visited was that it existed. But as a cultural touchstone for so many musicians and their fans, I felt the need to go and see what it was about. It was a moving experience to learn about the history and the importance of the venue. It was one of the slickest tours I've ever been on, with an amazing pre-tour video to an excellent tour guide to an opportunity to stand ""in the circle."" I was also fortunate to be able to visit on the first day that the Opry was opened again after the coronavirus shutdown. I definitely recommend the tour and, of course, a stop at Ryman Auditorium before or after."
"ONE OF OUR PLACES ON BUCKET LIST, GREAT AND HISTORIC","Booked a concert 2 times but both were cancelled due to Covic virus. But we were able to do a behind the stage tour. It was truly awesome. A guided tour with videos at several stops. So much history of Country Music it was unreal. Saw staging section, entertainer entrance. Dressing rooms. Sound rooms. Everything you could imagine. Huge place too. Then we got to go into auditorium. It is really large. We were able to stand on stage in the famous Circle and have our picture taken. Now we can say we had our debut on Grand Ole Opry. This was a great tour. Well worth money. Hope to come back after virus is over to see a concert."
Visit Nashville and see the Opry,"The Grand Ole Opry is the pinacle of country music. If you visit Nashville, you  must visit the Opry, but book in advance. You will hear the best in country music and see a lot of stars. The Opry held is in the suburbs of Nashville, exceept in winter."
Good Time,"Seemed like a blast from the past as we sat in pews listening to good, country music. Although many around us didn't like sitting like that, I thought it added to the ambiance. So much fun!"
Luke Combs,"Took my ""then"" girlfriend to see an array of country music singers which was headlined by Luke Combs.  A fantastic time, which was only made better because of the venue."
Awesome Place,Awesome place. Even if you’re not a fan of country music it is still amazing to visit. The tour was awesome.
Date night at The Opry,This is one of the hot-spots of the Nashville area.  Wonderful shows on a regular basis.Great chance to see some of the Best talent in the Nashville area.
FANTASTIC Show!!!! ,"I called the Grand Ole Opry a few months before visiting Nashville. The agent on the phone suggested I buy tickets from her at $75 and sit in the third row, sold!!! We had such a wonderful night! We got super lucky and knew 4 of the 6 artists performing that night so it was even more enjoyable."
Worth the Visit,"Personally, I am not a very big fan of country music, but I loved this. The performances put on were truly amazing. I loved the heart and enthusiasm that the artists put into their singing. This might have even been my favorite part of Nashville. We attended a fantastic concert!"
Dancing With Stars Live Tour,My mom and I went to see the Dancing With THe Stars Live Tour at the Grand Ole Opry and it's been amazing 2 years in a row! Seats in the Mezzanine section or lower are best. Parking is way over priced in my opinion but you can park in the Opry Mills Mall parking lot for free.
Time well spent for the young & young at heart!,We had a fabulous time!  The tour was filled with history from yester-year up to yesterday.  It was a wonderful story of CW evolution from its infancy at the Ryman Auditorium.  Well worth the time & $ to see this icon of country music up close and personal.
Another Must see and Great Music,"Current 1970's building is a bit ugly from the outside but very functional for the numbers of people attending every show, and the acoustics are fantastic once seated. An endless sequence of performers come on and do three songs each so there's plenty of variety - all introduced by the compare/ DJ that is delivering the live radio broadcast you are part of - including the inevitable adverts between each act. A great experience even if you are not a lover of Country & Western. Watch the drinks cost though - a bit pricy."

Don’t buy ticket insurance ,We had a trip planned for the end of April 2020. Seeing how the Government of Canada and USA are not allowing anyone to cross the borders the trip is off. Of course! Was able to cancel all accommodations and shows for a 5 week trip EXCEPT the Grand Ole Take Your Money Opry. Even paid the overpriced  $45 ticket insurance.
Lifetime Dream Realized,"Visiting and attending a show at the Grand Ole Opry has been a dream for me since I was a young child. That dream was realized in February when we attended the Troy Gentry Foundation show. It was fun, entertaining and an event I'll never forget. Everyone should attend a show if they're going to be visiting the Nashville area. You won't be disappointed!"
Awesome people to deal with,"This review isn't about Nashville it's self.. We had a vacation booked with Expedia.ca We booked a package with them for flights and hotel. Now with the Coroniavires we have had to cancel. I called the Opry and had no problem cancelling, I called the Gerneral Jackson Showboat and had no problem cancelling. Expedia on the other hand has been a nightmare. Called on thursday got a person who said our system is upgrading so you will have to call back in 4 hours, Called Friday couldn't even get on said system was having difficulties. Called starting at 7 am Saturday was on hold and cut off so many times, finally talked to someone at 5 pm who said system was doing an upgrade call back in 4 hours. So this time I waited and called back in the 4 hours, was on hold for 3 1/2 hours which then brought it to mid night our time and still no answer. So here I am on Sunday morning trying all over again. been on hold now for 2 hours and getting really tired of elevater music.. Wish me luck. Beware of Expedia expecially if you want to cancel."
Don’t purchase the insurance when buying tickets online! ,"Booked tickets for a show March 17. Purchased on line and paid for cancellation insurance. When we had to cancel our trip due to the virus, we contacted the insurance company for the Opry tickets and they said it didn’t cover viruses as an excuse... what?? Today, after the venue was declared closed, we were able to get a full refund. Our suggestion is to not waste your $$ on the insurance as it isn’t worth the paper it’s printed on!"
Texas Girls’ trip,Oh my goodness where to start?? I absolutely loved every single minute of our tour!! Kelly was very knowledgeable & upbeat! I never knew how awesome the GOO was until I took the tour!! So many amazing artists & stories!!! Loved the beautiful dressing rooms!! Cannot wait to return!!
A Must See!,We took the whole family to see the Grand Ol Opry. It was a great experience. Our one regret was that we were on the far right of the stage. If we did it again we would get tickets center stage. The lineup was good. Henry Cho was hilarious and the night finished off with Trace Atkins.
Acceded all expectations ,"We initially bought tickets since we figured this was the thing to do in Nashville. We assumed the music would be good given big names play here but it acceded all expectations. All the performances were amazing and extremely talented. In addition to good music, all the acts where also had their own sense of humor. There was moments we were dying of laughter which was sooo unexpected.I would highly recommended going to anyone visiting."
Girls Trip,It was even better then expected. Our tour guide Mikes was very entertaining. It was so cool to be able to take a picture on the actual stage where the musicians get inducted! The dressing rooms were really cool too.
Great tour!,"I wasn't emotionally prepared for the introductory video.  Great intro!  Emotional!  The tour was top-notch.  Our guide took us backstage, gave us a look at all the dressing rooms, and we each had the opportunity to stand in ""the circle"" onstage."
A night to remember,We went to the Grand Old Oprey in Feb 2020. It was a night to remember. Very good acts of country and western.
Almost every part of this tour will give you goosebumps!,"You cannot come to Nashville or the Opry without taking this tour.  The introductory film with Garth and Trisha was a gem. Just seeing all of the inductees names on the plaques in the hallway is worth the price of admission.  Learning all about the history, some well-known and some not known outside Nashville was wonderful. Our guide had been there 30 some years and he knew everything and more.  Seeing the themed dressing rooms was fun although I cannot believe when they rebuilt after the flood that they didn't put bathrooms in each dressing room!  Most crazy of all was being able to stand in the circle on stage.  I really didn't feel any of us on the tour were worthy.  We came back for the show that evening which was also so much fun.  The seating in the auditorium is all pew benches which seems appropriate for such a holy place."
CLASSIC,"We have attended the Grand Ole Opry off and on for years and have never been disappointed. Wether you sit on the lower level or balcony, it is a wonderful experience.  They combine old and new artists in a very relaxed, fun atmosphere. You can dress up if you prefer, but blue jeans and tshirts are fine as well."
Pretty nice,"We got the standing room only tix which worked out fine. The music was excellent. Saw a lot of stars from the past. They go overboard on advertising stuff during the show.  If I pay 80 for a ticket, i don't want any adverts."
Nice evening at Grand Ole Opry ,Friday night at the GOO provided a wide variety of artists. Blanco Brown (outstanding!!) Sierra Hull (Outstanding!!) and Brandy Clark were all new to me and I loved them all.  John Conlee and Connie Smith still have the pipes. No disappointments and what I want to see/hear when I come to Nashville.
GOO Review,"Tickets were easy to get, the show was fun and very entertaining. The new GOO building was awesome, beautiful! The entire venue was just awesome, plenty of easy parking."
Easy to use,Booked the tickets on-line. Printed them at home. Made getting into the building easier. This is the way to go.
Great show,A touch of western music and a nice american show. Lasts about 2 hours and goes live on the air. Good music and nice live touch. Different artists but great music. Is quite far from downtown and the commercials in it are a pain to listen to.
Revisiting childhood,"Loved the night of music - both new and old classics. It felt like a visit back to my childhood. The Opry is an institution and you feel like you are a part of it. I paid for the premium seats and I probably wouldn’t do that again, but I would come back in a heartbeat."
A trip to the Opry isn’t complete without this tour!,A trip to the Opry is an awesome experience and the backstage tour is the icing on the cake! Our ambassador Erica was sweet and kind and we never felt rushed. By far the highlight was to step on stage and stand in the Circle. I would take this tour again tomorrow!
Not very 'ole' at all,"Not exactly being country music fans, we were expecting an old theatre but it is in fact a very modern auditorium next to a shopping mall on the outskirts of town - about $30 in a taxi. However, we really enjoyed our Tuesday evening there - they started with a short history of the Opry and then there were 6 acts who all did 4-6 songs each. We had only heard of one - Darius Rucker who was great - but there was a lot of love in the room for all the artists, especially top-of-the-bill Luke Combs."
George Thorogood and the destroyers,Enjoyed heir performance! Would recommend! He is an amazing musician! Was great! People stood up and it was hard to Really see.
Always Fun,"Took in a show on a Tuesday.  Was great as always.  Comfortable seats, great screens to view!!  Easy parking but hated to pay large parking fee after paying plenty for tickets.  Good star line up!!  Blue grass, gospel and country.  Trace Atkins!!!"
Great experience and above all expectations ,"The Opry is a great experience with world class musicians and a fun friendly vibe.  Starting with the web site and ticketing process, you can select tickets knowing exactly how you will see the stage because a small picture pops up showing the stage from your seat before your purchase.  Prices were extremely fair for a world class experience and seeing top tier music talent.Arriving at the Opry is easy.  We took an Uber, but taxis were also an option.  Getting dropped off at the entrance was beautiful and a short walk into the building.  There are very few stairs and I'm sure there were ramps because everything at the Opry showed signs of accommodating those with handicaps.  The staff and security were extremely welcoming and compared to going to other music venues, this was the best experience from curb to seat.  Speaking of seats, I read other reviews that criticized the church pew seating, but I thought it was great and the pews are padded, so extremely comfortable.There were lots of options for dinner both inside the Opry and at Opry Mills mall which is a very short walk and lots of choices.  If you purchase food inside the Opry, you can bring it to your seat.  After the show, it's easy to get outside and back to the curb, however, be warned...  it's a sea of taxis and limos.  Our Uber driver called us and directed us to walk away from the chaos and we were on our way in minutes.  I've attended many theatre and music events all over the world and I've NEVER see such a taxi cluster even outside grand central station in NYC, so be prepared!Attending the Opry was a bucket list event and although I wouldn't rank myself as a huge country music buff, I thoroughly enjoyed the entire event."
I’ve wanted to go since A Coal Miner’s Daughter!,"...AND I was not disappointed. Awesome. Joy filled. Fun filled. Absolutely fantastic. I have to say, however, that I was sad to not see the WSN 650 history celebrated through more memorabilia. It was that 50,000 watt transmitter that caused the mystique of “The Opry” to explode. I mean, everyone could hear The Opry on Saturday night, regardless of income and location. I can only imagine how the hearts of new performers raced as they approached the Ryman or Opry, and then stood on that stage, at that mic, for the first time. Loved it!!"
Must see if visiting Nashville,This is the original live radio show since 1926 or so. Can't visit Nashville without an opry visit and you will be entertained!
Grand Ole Opry that it is.,"What a Tuesday evening   Luke Combs, Darrrius Rucker and Jimmie Anderson.  Great venue and great entertainment"
Terry Bradshaw steals Show at Grand Ole Opry!,"Terry Bradshaw, the former quarterback and current TV host, received a standing ovation at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville this evening, appearing with The Isaacs.  They brought down the house when they sang “Keep Me Safe” in honor of the victims of yesterday’s tornado in Nashville.   Bradshaw actually has a great voice and stage presence!Other performing highlights included Dustin Lynch and Trace Adkins, though everyone did a good job.  If you enjoy country music, make plans to attend a show at the truly grand, Grand Ole Opry!"
Worth seeing,Took the ride from Nashville and was glad I did. I am a country can and enjoyed learning about the history of the Opry.
A Must see while in Nashville,"The word ""iconic"" comes to mind with the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville.  Even though the theater is very modern (and quite nice) there is a nostalgic atmosphere as the show begins.  An old GOO star is introduced four times and each one in turn introduces three acts, mostly unknowns but a few headliners.  The lineup changes every night.  It is a live radio show so the announcer, Eddie Stubbs, interjects commercials between acts with a voice that has to be heard to be appreciated.  The show lasts more than two hours and is a great deal of fun."
Great time at the Grand Ole Opry!,"Great time at the Grand Ole Opry.  I was a little taken back by the aged commentators they had, I would think they could get some younger blood for those positions, up and comers, etc.  Over all it was a great experience.  I also wish Josh Turner has been able to sing at lest one more song.  Two songs for the show is a bit scarce, but I'm a fan.  I will go again next time I'm in Nashville.  The balcony seats are good, the large screens make it easy to see both the whole stage and close ups of the artist.  Next time I will pay the extra for a close up seat, but that's just for the fun of being closer. I was happy with the balcony for the price.  It's a great value."
Good times!,This was our first visit and we really enjoyed it.  I am not really a country music fan but the whole evening was a great experience with great acts.  Hopefully we will be able to go back soon! Easy in and out of theater.  Bench seating.
Read this before you book!,"Had the girlfriend with me for a quick weekend hanging out on Broadway and decided we needed to go full Nashville experience and hit the iconic Opry.  Looking at tickets online we felt the prices were too much, plus it was going to be a $50 Uber from downtown.   We stopped to chat with the concierge at the Dream Nashville and she got us tickets for only $50!  We were on our way.  Reading reviews before we left, made it sound like the Opry only had basic concessions so we started with some drinks across the street, which turned out to be a bust... Hint, read my review for ClaimJumper, waste of time...  Anyway they do a full bar available inside the Opry!  I got a yummy Tito and cranberry.  My hot baby grabbed a Tito and pineapple.  Yummy.  Our seats were pretty far up in the balcony but still a great view and they do have large monitors to supplement.  The show is you watching the radio show unfold.  We saw 4 separate acts broken up by the usual commercial radio banter.  There were less Ubers available after than expected so plan ahead."
So Disappointed,"When I booked the tickets, my friend asked who was playing and I said, ""I don't recognize the names but if they are playing at Grand Old Opry, they must be good.""  Except they weren't. Two of the acts were pretty good and one was outstanding. Many have been in the business for like 50 years, so they're really old, which is fine but not really what I was expecting or wanted. I would not return unless it was a name I know, I'd rather spend our time at a listening room or even in the bars downtown."
Wonderful show,"WOW! What an experience! Booked this show months in advanced when I knew I was heading to Nashville. The line-up was wonderful, even though I didn't know when I was booking tickets. I will definitely visit again!"
"So enormous, great fun!","Wasn't expecting the sheer size of the place.  For those that aren't sure, its a live radio show from the stage.  We had country singers of all ages and reputations, some I'd never heard of (I'm from the UK) but the locals clearly had.  The hilarious adverts read out in the same tone by the announcer was a delight.  There's raffles, games, its all mad.  Well worth a visit though to a Nashville institution."
True Entertainment!,We try to go to the Oprey several times a year. This visit was typical - Fun and exciting. Definetly will be returning.  And you never know who might show up unexpectedly.
WAY better than we thought!,"Everyone has heard of this place BUT it was sooo much more fun than we imagined! Beautiful building, amazing music and interactive with the crowd Fun! Drinks prices sky high but snacks reasonable."
VERY slow songs - Worth Going Once,"We purchased our tickets and ended up in Row X, which, to be fair, is still an excellent seat with a great view...but WAY up there! :-)  Almost ALL of the performers played really really slow songs, and it was quite warm way up there so it was very hot with SLOW music.  Not a toe-tapping venture to be sure.  However, that being said...it was an experience that we'll always have and we did get to see a first time performer Payton Smith so who knows, someday we may be able to say we saw him (when he's famous)!  Not sure I would go again however, unless really big names were listed."
Amazing!,"After debating if we should spend the money, and what seats to get we are more than happy we decided to see a show! What a great evening!!! Highly recommended! We 5 minutes into the show we both said we were glad we decided to go! Definitely a must see in our book! Each performer did 2 songs and a good variety of music!"
Very cool,"We visited Friday and Saturday night. The shows had several of the same artists, some sang the same song both nights, others sang different ones. Both nights were excellent but we wished they were more different, I’d recommend only going one night unless there’s someone specific you want to see both nights."
Do the backstage tour!,Great tour! Went back for evening show. It’s like a variety show. So it changes every 5-10 min. You get exposed to the old ballads and new names!
Second time with Backstage is great,"Love Nashville and coming here punctuates any stay.   So wholesome with a great stable of entertainers.    No big debuts for our trip and not as many big stars, but stil the magic was present and the lineup of 4 unique programs was special.   THis is the one things I would never miss (beyond Kid Rock, Tootsies, Nudies and BB King)"
Sold out venue,"Show was ""cute"", ""okay"". Last performer Chris Tucker was very good, though short performance at the end. The long time artist's that first, second and third played, had a few cute jokes. A new artist was okay. THE BENCH SEATING throughout is TERRIBLE!!!!"
Great music hall!!!,Famous music hall were Johnny Cash played all his great compositions!!! Very comfortable and nice place to visit!
Awesome.  ,Awesome. Seating is great comfortable. Dont think there is a bad seat. Always amazing to see. Never gets old
Great place,Attended a show here last night and it was a brilliant experience!! The artists were all great especially Payton Smith who made his debut!! Definitely worth going to see a show if in this area!!
Tour and Show,Did the tour on Thursday 2/20 with tour guide Randy who was excellent- bit of history combined with a lot of fun.Went to the Opry on Saturday night 2/22 and had a wonderful time. Great show!Must go if you’re in Nashville.
You Just Have To,There is only one reason Nashville exists as a tourist stop and that's the Grand ole Opry. Another must see and tour while visiting.
Don't miss ,"Went to Grand Ole Opry which is a long drive from Nashville not much public transport so we went by taxi had same taxi and driver for our stay in Nashville The Opry is full of history, take you back stage, show all the dressing rooms of the famous and not so famous the pictures and music is awesome finally you have opportunity to be a star in your own right with photo taken standing on stage with  mike in hand. Well worth seeing."
Great Experience,"Let me start by saying I was not a Country Music fan.  We did not attend a concert but felt you can't go to Nashville without going to the Grand Ole Opry House so we took the back stage tour.  It was fantastic, just to see where country music stars perform and to see how they get inducted is just amazing.  I loved this tour and would recommend to everyone even if you are not a country music fan."
Wow.  Just.  Wow,Such a fun place. The history. The bluegrass.  The country stars.  The bluegrass.  Wait!  I said bluegrass twice?!?   I was fantastic.  They have food. They have a bar.  You bring it to your seats and take as many pictures as you like and just enjoy yourself.  It is. Live radio variety show so each artist plays 2 or 3 songs at most.  The highlight of tour trip and you can’t help but smile ear to ear upon leaving the Opry. Uber Lyft and Taxis are waiting outside the main entrance when leaving a late show so no trouble getting a ride back into town after the show.
You can’t visit Nashville without Experiencing this!,"We had a blast at the Opry. We bought the VIP package and had access to the Circle Room pre-show and during the intermission. Pre-show we had snacks and drinks and had a chance to meet and talk to Jeannie Seely who was engaging, funny and charming. We also had a photo taken.The show was was excellent and worth every penny we paid for it. Our seats were central in the orchestra area so we could see everything very clearly. There was a great line up from very old and traditional country stars to new up and comers. John Oates also showed up on stage which was quite a surprise. Apparently big stars make appearances all the time.The old fashioned radio announcer made the whole thing feel very retro. And some of the ads, read aloud, were so cheesy we laughed and laughed.I would definitely do this again on my next visit :-)"
"Loved the Opry, disappointed in the tour/guide.","We loved visiting the Opry and felt so honored and glad to be able to see backstage, however our tour guide rushed us. We felt we weren’t able to take the time to look at the various rooms/spaces or to even take pictures. She may have been a newer guide as she seemed hesitant, forgetting her lines several times, and she even seemed out of breath herself. Overall, we we’re glad we made the trip, it just left us feeling rushed and disappointed for a $75 purchase for two tickets."
Fun Evening,"My husband and I spent a weekend at Grand Ole Opryland Hotel with our 13 year old grandson.  We had tickets for a Friday night show which was the first night we arrived.  The hotel has a shuttle bus that picks up guests at the hotel and ferries them to the Opry House and then takes them back.  It took a little while for the bus to come on the way there.  On the way back to the hotel, the bus was at the stop.  The show was just great fun: a mixture of country and blue grass music.  We really enjoyed it."
A valentines to remember,"Took my lovely bride of 32 years down to Nashville over valentines weekend . we both enjoy country music so a trip to see a Grand Ole Opry show was definitely on the list.I got us tickets for the feb 14th show and it didnt disappoint!!! We loved every thing about it the building was very nice, we were in the balcony veiw of the stage was great .The way the show is set up with 4   1/2 hour shows with a new host every 1/2 hour  was really cool we saw 12 different performances in the 2 hour show . if we ever go back to Nashville we will go to the Grand Ole Opry again . Wounderful must see when in Nashville."
Incredible,Loved every minute. The nostalgia. It’s a beautiful place. Listened to Charley Pride and my grandparents were in heaven. Really enjoyed the entire show!
Back stage tour,"We took an afternoon tour of backstage Of the Grand Ole Opry. It was very cool, the tour guide was great. It was fun! We also went to the wax museum across the street in the Opry Land Mills mall. That was a great day!"
Never disappoints ,The Opry is a must when you’re visiting Nashville. The talent is always incredible- even the names I didn’t recognize before attending.
Fantastic first visit of the Opry,"We had an absolutely brilliant first trip to the Opry. The venue is superb,  really good facilities and easy to get to and from downtown via Uber or taxi. Had we realised that there was shops and restaurants nearby we would have made an afternoon of it in the area.  We didn't know any of the acts but they were all superb and we thoroughly enjoyed them. This is definitely a must do when visiting Nashville, highly recommend it."
A must do whether or not your a country music fan,"If you’re in Nashville this is a must do event. Although we didn’t get to see a show, we did the backstage tour and really enjoyed it. Our tour guide (I believe his name was Steve but if I got that wrong I’m sorry!) was enthusiastic and extremely knowledgeable. Our group knew very little about country music when we walked into the doors but came away with a solid appreciation of the genre and most importantly the community that surrounds it.One of the biggest insight we got is that the Opry is less a “hall of fame” then a promotional tool. Seeing the set the last seasons of the syndicated show “Hee Haw” was filmed was fun as well."
Awesome Opry,Another one checked off on the bucket list! The Grand Ol Opry was a wonderful experience. We absolutely loved the entire evening. We will be back in the fall and plan on doing the backstage tour. So impressed!!!
Fun night out,"Excellent venue with great acoustics, dancers and acts.The advertising throughout was pretty weird but it kinda added to the evening."
THE BEST SHOW I HAVE EVER SEEN,"In my 71 years, I have attended more than 200 concerts and live performances. Everything from the Rolling Stones, Queen, Bill Joel, Bob Seger and Elton John and every act from Motown and others in the 60's and 70s and beyond. Popular artists and Symphonic too.Nothing prepared my for the experience of the Grand Ole' Opry.  NOTHING !!!!My wife and I were at the Valentines night show with wonderful seats at the front of the balcony (they were a little uncomfortable) and I was entertained like never before. With the exception of the opening act Mark Wills, I had never heard of anyone else on the bill. But, what a great show and so entertaining. I don't think that the 4,000+ seat venue has a bad seat and the sound was terrific.The entertainers were great, a wide variety acts. It was wonderful how they break up the show in 4 segments with a different name personality acting as host for each section. Bill Cody as announcer and host added another dimension to just help the night move along. If you didn't already know that this was a radio show, you wouldn't even notice that his outstanding voice was  delivering commercials on the ½ hour. Seemed like part of the show.We attended the backstage tour which was well worth the expense and time. Lot's of facts about the Opry and a chance to see where the magic starts each night. IT IS A MUST.So, this rock-n-roll fan who only owns one track of country music is now a fan of the Grand Ole' Opry and not sure just what to acquire to start a new collection of country music to add to the 10,000 tracks in my current collection.Your 95th anniversary coming up. I hope that you are there for decades to come.I plan on making it a twice a year trip as long as I am able.Don't know the right words, so let me say, ROCK ON."
Loved it! & Parking Advice...,Highlight of our trip! We loved it. Pay for parking online before you go - Opry House Parking - $12 online versus $25 once you’re there. Parking was sort of confusing. We put in the provided address and it took us to an empty lot. Easier to just go to the Opry House and it’s on the left of the building. The show was amazing! We didn’t really know any of the artists before going. Very entertaining show. We set at the very top and still felt like it was great.
A last-minute perfect decision!,"I only had a partial day and night in Nashville with my adult daughter.  We came upon The Grand Ole Opry after stopping at the mall for coffee on our way out of Nashville. I had my daughter stop to take a photo and on a whim told her I wanted to tour.  We both loved it!I am so very glad we stopped.  What a wonderful young man who provided a tour with passion and great knowledge.To hear Trish Yearwood express what The Grand Ole Oprey experience meant to her as a little girl and how she wanted to provide that very same dream to another hopeful little girl...it was so loving and caring.  To see the history of country legends who stood on the very stage (and then the circle of oak brought to the new performance hall) was electric.  I could almost feel Johnny Cash and Minnie Pearl there. This was the ""Superbowl"" stadium of country music.  I forgot how I used to watch The Grand Old Opry with Minnie Pearl as a child and the slapstick humour of Hee Haw.  So glad to have regained my appreciation to the music that started my love for song and lyrics.I wish we could have stayed for a show.  I will have to return with my husband one day!  It is truly a must see!"
A must in Nashville,"The Grand Ole Opry is an iconic show in Nashville, Country Music and America.  It is a must see for anyone enjoying a trip at Nashville, TN.  The show is about two hours long and showcases talent from just on the stage to performers at it for many decades.  We enjoyed headliners Terry Clark and Sawyer Brown, as well as newcomer Lainey Wilson.  My show favorite was musician-comedian Gary Mule Deer.  I laughed so hard my side hurt.  Great Show"
Nice Friday out!,I was blown away.  This has been the highlight of our trip.  This is a bucket list item before I knew it was!
Back stage tour ,"Wonderful tour,  guide very knowledgeable! Would highly recommend . If we are in the area again would go back"
Darius Rucker,We went to see Darius Rucker and Luke Combs and a few other people.  It was fantastic!  Such a great venue and no seat is really not great.
"What a fun night!  (Trace Adkins, among others)","Not country music fans in particular but hey, this is Nashville, you gotta go to the Opry, right?    We did.Fun time at the new venue (not the Ryman).  About half an hour ($25 Uber ride) outside of town but worth getting to, comfy pew-like seats, great sound and technicals, with food and drinks (including alcohol) for sale that you can take to your seats.   Worth doing just to say you've done it!"
Very Nice,Great down home entertainment.  My wife and I enjoyed it on one occasion and then I enjoyed it again with friends and colleagues from work.
Cya you on the flip side,First time here and even though it was pouring down rain the night we came it was a long walk to get in! Our seats were on the left side of the stage which meant that the bands never looked our way so get your tickets Center stage and you will see a lot better!! Food prices were very high so eat before you get here! We had a Great time and will be back next year!
Trip to Nashville,On our bus trip to Nashville we spent a few hours at the Grand Ole Opry. The backstage tour was very nice.  Seeing the dressing rooms were really nice to see. We were disappointed in the fact we went to a Christmas show and there was NOT one Christmas decoration.
Save your money 💰 ,"Huge disappointment, best part was the intro video! Tour price is ridiculously overpriced. Our tour guide seemed nice enough but she didn’t wait to speak to the whole group. I have taken many tours but sadly cannot recommend this one."
What a thrill,"I am not a country music fan, but I will say that the experience was thrilling knowing the history.  I really enjoyed the show.  I will be going back again."
The Mecca of Country Music!,"Must see. Not just an amphitheater. It's a 95-year old cult. We call it ""the Mecca"", because you must go at least once in your lifetime. Not being Country Music fans, we also believe once is sufficient!"
Dutton,"Very informative.  Enjoyed all of tour.  Excellent guide.Seeing the dressing rooms, stage where Her Haw was filmed and of course the main stage was an enjoyable experience."
Wonderful experience,"The acoustics in the auditorium are great, if there is an event on when you are in town the I would thoroughly recommend that if you are interested and can get tickets that you catch a show first hand"
Grand Ole Opry- FIrst visit,We went to a show on 1/31 which featured Vince Gil amongst others. It was a fabulous experience and I'd highly recommend to anyone visiting Nashville! It was very cool to see a part of country music history. The music was great and the venue was comfortable.
Grand Ole Opry,something else don't miss going if your in Nashville. Great show lots of different Singers and even if you dont like Country Music it is a must see.
Only 2nd to the Ryman - Parking Tips,"If you are like me and grew up on Country Music, then you need to at least once in your life attend the Grand Ole Opry live and in person. The best thing to do is to get tickets way in advance for the best seats, don't worry about who is there that night, the experience of the Opry live is why you go, the artists are only secondary.Parking Tip: Come early, park in the mall across the street and have dinner there, then just walk across the street after dinner and you will avoid the parking craziness."
Great show,"Our first visit to Nashville for just a short stay.  They had just added a Wednesday show and it made our trip.  Great show, great talent and great facility."
Great,"This is a very convinient way to pass up those pesky lines. It worked seamlessly.  We were able to park near to the theater and after a short walk, we went right in,"
Nashville,"This was the highlight of our trip to Nashville, TN.  You can walk through and look at all the memobilia from the well known country singers, Dolly Pardon collection was awesome, and you can really go up onto the stage and have your picture taken."
"If you love music, any kind of music....","See a concert at the Mother Church of country music. See ANY kind of concert, any kind of artist, cause it’s all great! Intimate, warm, up close, Charming and the most amazing acoustics. A not to be missed experience for music lovers, history buffs, honky tonk devotees and looks lous."
Must Do in Nashville,"We had an amazing treat watching a new inductee's first performance as an inductee. In addition, we were treated to many of the Opry regulars. The backstage tour was fascinating and we got to see some other artists who had come to practice. The sound and the acoustics of the Opry is excellent. However, not all seats give a great view of the stage. We were on the right side of the stage. However, given that we had purchased last minute tickets, we did not have too many seat choices."
Grand Event,"I used to live in Nashville so when my husband and I met up with my cousins from Canada, we had to take them to the Grand Ole Opry. This was one of the highlights of the trip. Wasn't cheap but worth the $$ spent. Great entertainment with some Opry history thrown in."
Experience of a Lifetime,"For a long time country music fan, this was a pilgrimage long in coming.  My wife and I saw the last of the winter shows at the Ryman which I understand is cozier than the newer Opryland (and it was).  A beautiful venue located downtime near the nightlife, the tickets are very reasonable and the show was fabulous.  The lineup is often set as the date gets closer and we were extremely pleased it included 3 acts that we had seen in concert including the stars of the recent PBS series (Vince Gill and Ricky Skaggs) - I expected our usher to be Ken Burns.  It's a tight show and each act does just 1-3 songs with numerous old timey elements (dancing and chicken commercials).  All and all a joy to behold and the hit of our Nashville trip."
Performers were checking in!,"A must do! This tour had me in tears and cheers and wows! We were lucky enough to be there while performers for the evening show were practicing, checking in, and just hanging in their dressing rooms visiting amongst each other. I will never forget it."
Great history and tradition awaits you!!!,"Music Ledgends are made at the Grand Ole Opry!!! You are in for a treat learning about the past, the present as well as the ""up and coming "" star. I thoroughly enjoyed the tour."
The Highlight of our Trip ,"So happy we got to see such a wonderful show and back stage tour, that is a must . Show began with the audience getting acquainted and then every artist performs for about 10 minutes . There’s was even a stand up comedian that was hilarious.The back stage tour was great, we took in all the history of the Grand Ole Opry , our tour guide was wonderful and the best treat we got to meet and take photos with Jake Hoot that had just won The Voice and was performing for the first time on the Opry stage . He was so kind . We also got to take a photo on the Opry stage .We parked by the movie theater which was right across the street from the Opry for free. If we’re back in Nashville we will definitely be coming back for the show"
Santana at the Grand Ole Opry!!,First visit to Nashville so had to attend the Opry. Got a fabulous ticket to see Santana and was not disappointed. It is a bit of a drive from downtown Nashville but lots of taxi service available. Great security and very clean. Every seat is fantastic with incredible acoustics.
First time,We just enjoyed our first trip to the Opry.  We only knew a couple of the performers but the experience was something special.   We will be back
Impressive show,"Even though I am not a big country music fan, I enjoyed the Oort show. It’s a great chance to see a variety of performers in one even."
Online Tickets,Location was incorrect and we missed the show entirely. Waste of our time and money. I do not recommend buying show or event tickets through Trip Advisor. Mobile tickets are not supported and paper tickets would not print.
A Must!,"Being in Nashville for a meeting, we only had Sun. afternoon to see the sights. The introduction by Garth and Trisha was very good. Our female guide was very knowledgeable and funny! I would hate to miss seeing where the great country artists have performed! We really didn't know much about the Grand Ole Opry but will now listen to it whenever possible on Fri. and Sat. evenings."
Trace atkins,"The Hawktails , Trace Atkins and the Whites were amazing.bench style seating  tickets are a little pricey $85 a piece, for the floor. Large viewing screens make it easy to see no matter where you sit."
This was the best tour ever!  Absolutely fantastic!,"Honestly, I'm not a huge country music fan. But you cannot go to Nashville and not experience the love for country music. This was a very pleasant surprise and literally one of the best experiences. I chose to do this at the last minute and so glad that I did. My tour guide Jana was amazing, kind, and knowledgeable. I LOVED learning the history of the Grand Ole Opry and by time I was done with the tour, I wanted to be apart of it. It was definitely an A list experience learning about all of the people who have been apart of the Opry and the pride and joy everyone experiences. The dressing rooms were great and we got to see studios that had been shut down for a while. And to actually be on the stage was exhilarating. So much fun, and such a rich culture to experience. Everyone should do this!"
"Amazing. We saw the show with  Terri Clark Marty Stuart, The Issac Sister's, Vince Gill.",AMAZING.....  The other guys had us cracking up.  Such a wonderful experience.  Just good clean fun. Hope to return many more times.  We took the post back stage tour. Strongly suggest doing it...
Best birthday ever!,"It was everything I imagined it would be. We got an Uber so I'm unsure how the parking was but it didn't seem too crowded. There was a small right across the street. The Opry ran so smooth. Everyone who was suppose to be there was there, great atmosphere and great music. I couldn't think of any other way to celebrate my birthday weekend!!! Did I mention Trace Atkins was there!!!!"
A Must See and Good Value,"Even if you are not a country fan, you will enjoy a fast-paced show with a mix of around ten old-timers and rising stars. In some cases, the latter outperform the former. There’s a slightly annoying emcee to keep the show on track and insert a few sponsor ads along the way.To beat the parking hassle, I recommend parking your car with the Gaylord hotel valet and taking the complimentary shuttle to and from the Oprey. If you take a bite to eat at the Gaylord, the valet parking is complimentary."
Great Concert,"Friday night concert was very good.  The seating is not very comfortable, but the music was fantastic."
Too little for too much!,"If you love country music and the Grand Ole Opry is on your bucket list you will be disappointed when you see how they gouge every penny they can. What was a better parking option than the mall average has now gone up to 15.00. You have already paid an excessive amount for your show tickets and they have also taken up 24 or more close parking spots for valet parking so they can make yet more money off you. And they have one parking place for a pregnant lady. Why can’t all handicap spots be available for pregnant women? Their are lots of handicap spaces. Certainly more reasonable that just one spot for the pregnant women. We at one time could take our family and a friend for our daughter and it wasn’t so much that we couldn’t go. The company that owns it now, obviously does not care about families or those that used to be able to come but just can’t pay all the extra cost. Be prepared and come early enough to park a mile away with your kids. Otherwise, bring extra money to give the greedy owners that are using a great family time and popular  place to visit because they don’t seem to have enough."
"A must do in Nashville, but don’t buy through Trip Advisor!","This was a great venue and great show! Not sure ai would book tickets through trip advisor again, the seats were mediocre at best. We called the Grand Ole Opry before cancellation period  and were assured they were full view seats p, but they were NOT! Would definitely buy direct next time to pick seat!"
You have to do it!,"A great final night for our trip to Nashville (and Memphis and NOLA). Wonderful hosts, great selection of acts - we saw ten, and they varied from bluegrass and gospel to modern and traditional country. Highly recommended!"
Backstage tour!,"Excellent backstage tour.  Have not been a country music fan, but really enjoyed this tour.  Tour guide Kathryn was funny and informative.  Highly recommend!"
Great experience,"We did the tour and had a great time looking at all of the backstage areas to include dressing rooms, mail boxers, pictures and the stage! This is a great experience that any country music fan would enjoy!"
Great backstage tour,Judy was a fantastic tour guide! Great tour overall and the pictures taken on stage were a fun addition!
MUST DO!!!!,We took the backstage tour.  It was very informative.  They were getting ready for New Year's so it was quite busy.   The opera house is beautiful and different. The back rooms were so different  and colorful.  Totally enjoyed from start to finish.
Awesome. ,The show was top notch and very professional. The nostalgia was great. Ricky Skaggs was the final performer. Amazing.
Great tour,Really enjoyed backstage view.  Interesting information learned. Beyond glad we did this tour. Can’t wait to go back and see a show
It's the Opry!,Even if a casual country listener this place is a staple of Nashville.  Fun to see the names and faces that have come through.
Great experience for anyone that likes any country music,"I am a casual country listener and still enjoyed the stories, background, sights and sounds of the backstage tour.  Few days later had a company event and got to eat on the stage - so fun!"
Wonderful acoustics,John Prine on NYE played until 1am. Enjoyed the show except for the padded benches and tight seating
Lots of fun and very relaxed atmosphere ,Really enjoyed this show at the Ryman which was more rowdy than expected. Also didn't realise it is recorded live for tv and radio including the compete reading out live adverts which too us British was quite funny.  We sat on pew style seats downstairs and fortunately our row wasn't full as would have been a bit of a squeeze. The show is fun and we enjoyed the music and comedy. A great range of country styles were performed. We eat beforehand in the canteen style  Ryman cafe and the food was good but quite busy so allow plenty of time to eat  before the show starts .
"Fun, lively and a good night out",We saw the grand ole opry at the Ryman and was such good fun. It was loud and rowdy and the array of artists was good.  I didn't realise it was being recorded live for radio and tv and the compere even reads out adverts live.   The cafe adjoining Ryman was good For a pre service meal.
Fantastic Show,"I went to see Doug Kershaw and was pleasantly surprised by the talent of the other scheduled performers. Doug wowed everyone, also!"
See a show there if can,We went to a show there. It was the live show for the radio.   It was fun and interactive. Great show.
Amazing Tour,We did a backstage tour of the Grand Ole Opry and it was amazing. Our tour guide Judy was fantastic and very knowledge. I loved learning about the history and listening to some of the stories. Highly recommend!!
Back Stage,"Very interesting and humble, not glamorous,  but country.  Adults may enjoy the history and vocal legends."
Jan 4th Grand Ole Opry (at the Ryman),Awesome show tonight! Great performers and memorable experience for our family.  Only negative was the after show tour.  Waste of time and money - please see my review under the Ryman tour.
Very nice place to see a show,We were here for New Years Eve 2020 and we saw a great show. The music was not that loud and over bearing. The seats were comfortable at first but by the end of the show it was really getting uncomfortable. The food and drink prices are very expensive so I recommend that you eat and drink before the show.  Plenty of free parking at the mall is available.
The show that started country music,First let me say that I am dictating this review to Siri as I am driving home to Chicago from Florida so please excuse the grammatical errors and etc. as I don’t have time to edit thank youWe were just passing through Nashville for one day so this was a must see Destiination for us even though we did not go inside we were able to see outside the building it was nice to walk around a little bit and also to see the two giant guitars outside as well as the front of the building with the banners and the nice construction as far as parking for the Place we followed the advice on TripAdvisor to park at Opry mills mall buy the movie theater towards the back and then just walk over to Granite Aubrey and also to the hotel that to see inside at the Gaylord resort and convention center so it was free parking otherwise you would have to pay I believe around $30 or so   We literally spent only five minutes there to take pictures and to look at the place but it was worth a stop at least now we could say we sought in person thank you
In to the unknown,"First trip to Nashville. Not C&W fans but when in Rome and all that! Really enjoyed our visit. We had no idea who we would see or How the show worked. This is a good way to dip your toe in to C&W music. The show is split on to 4 quarters with a different host for each quarter and different styles of music in the C&W genre. We’re a family of 4, wife, two sons 21 & 19 and me. We all agreed this is a must if it’s your first time in Nashville. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves."
We walked in “the Circle”,"Pretty cool tour through history... getting a glimpse of country history in a great facility. Took about 45 minutes and ended with a picture on stage with the microphone and guitar. Got to see the changing rooms, backstage, a great intro video, ...."
New years eve,Did the back stage tour which was great behind the scenes and really set the scene for us. I understood the importance and honour performing here is to artists. The stage was closed off due to preparation for new years eve. So we didn't get to stand in the circle.The new year eve show with john prine was the icing on the cake. If your visiting nashville as a country music fan this is a must do.
Mrs.,"Just so cool! I was taken back to fond memories of my childhood when I looked at the names and pictures of some of the all-time greats of country music. It’s so cool to see how they make the opry feel like a home, not only for the performers but also for the fans. Well worth it."
So much fun,We attended a New Year's Eve show featuring John Prine. We had a great time and the show was great. The one complaint is the seating would be much more comfortable if they didn't try to pack us in like sardines.
Great Tour,"Although I'm not a country fan I throughly enjoyed the tour, the guide was very knowledgeable and took us through the route all the musicians would take on entering the building and the various dressing rooms, there was a photo opportunity if you wished on the original circle of flooring from the original Grand Ole Oprey CIRCLE. I found it a way outside the City limits but you do have the Mall to visit for shopping."
Grand Ole Oprey,"This is the one place not to miss steeped in history, a band was rehearsing at the time which gave you a real sense of what a live performance would be like, you were free to roam around at leisure would go back again if I was in Nashville"
Lovely venue - a must if coming to nashville,The grand ole opry. Honestly I was always more partial to the ryman. But I finally made it out to the grand ole opry for a show - and it was worth it. There is a lot in its design that is an homage to the ryman. But also with its own flare. It’s out of town at opryland which I can honestly miss - but it’s a nice venue for a good ole show.
Rudolph the Musical,So excited to get to go to the Grand Ole Opry and loved that they had Rudolph the Musical.  It was such a nice addition to our Christmas festivities.
A must see,"Whitney Houston still good and the radio ads just add to the experience ,the staff are outstandingly good used the restaurant prior to the show and the food and service were excellent"
Backstage tour,"Great chance to see the beautiful theatre, to stand on the circle. Tour guides are knowledgeable filled with fun facts insight into the theatre. The beginning of tour presentation is very cool."
Gary P Nunn,First visit to the Grand Ole Opry to see good friend Gary P Nunn play there for the first time.  It was an exciting experience and I’m ready to go back again.
"Great talent, underwhelming show","We splurged on Opry tickets at the Ryman, taking our 3 kids (ages 8, 11, 15), b/c it was touted as “the” thing to do while visiting Nashville. We are all instrumentalists & country music fans, but sadly the show was underwhelming. We were seated right in the middle of section 1 w/ a TV screen sitting on the stage blocking an entire portion of the stage: couldn’t really see the square dancers (except on the tv) & couldn’t see the band at all. We could easily see all the radio advertisements (on the tv) that seem to take up a large portion of the show. The lineup of performers was what I expected: very talented musicians. But, I’ve been to many other shows w/ much talent, and this show really didn’t compare to other shows I’ve seen...I expected more energy, more crowd engagement, & less “down” time. The Station Inn on Sunday night, bluegrass picking circle, didn’t disappoint though. And, it was free!"
A memory never to forget,"Not only Nashville but a grand tour of the southern USA takin Atlanta,Mobile,Memphis, New Orleans,Dollywood and finishing at Chattanooga Sites included  Mardi Gras,civil rights museum,sun studios,Graceland Beale street,etc etc too many to list. Took us three weeks but what a memory!!!!!!"
Great show and fabulous atmosphere,This was a item on my bucket list and did not disappoint. The atmosphere was electric and the show fantastic.
A must visit,The only thing my family was disappointed about was only getting to see Carrie Underwood for 15 minutes.  We wanted more. But that’s what the Opry is about and respect about it.  Glad we got to experience it.
A must see,"Great music, great atmosphere, great evening. This is a must see for anyone visiting Nashville. This was the start of it all."
A fun night at the Grand Ole Opry,"My family and I were lucky enough to see the Grand Ole Opry at the Ryman Auditorium this December 2019. Not being a country music people, we weren't sure what to expect, but we knew this was must do while in Nashville. We had a fun and entertaining time at the show. There were 11 performers, including the ""hosts"" who also performed. A good mix of country, bluegrass, and western, as well as a corny, but hilarious comedian. I was worried my teenage daughter would get bored and while she didn't love it, she did say it was ""kinda fun"". Great to see the Opry in the storied Ryman."
Quick Visit,We didn’t go inside but we ventured over to the GOO to see what it was like. We also visited the gift shop & the mall across the road. I would’ve loved to check the whole place out but we felt the entry price was steep & we didn’t really plan to visit in the first place.
Grand Ole Opry,Saw this on my last day and I was so excited. It was very pretty seeing it at night. It's very close to the mall and the resort and it's right off the highway so very accessible.
Grand Ole Opry !,Another item checked off my bucket list - the legendary home to Country Music and its finest.  SO MUCH HISTORY in this place.  Make sure you do the back stage tour when there - you won't be disappointed.  All the legends have passed through those doors.  And if you can catch a show while there.
Excellent ,We did the back stage day tour as we weren’t able to see a show while we were in Nashville. Staff very knowledgeable & it’s a great tour. Well worth it but I’m also glad I had been to the country music museum the day before so I knew a bit more about country music before getting in there. It’s a bit out of the way in regards to the town but totally worth a visit. I tried buying tickets online & one night it didn’t work but I tried the next day & was still able to get same day tickets.
This was OK,"We visited this and while it was great to actually be in the Ryman to us honestly most of the acts were very old old people from years ago.  I guess if you were born and bread in USA you may have known them, but we were from Australia and only know 2 acts.  I'm not sure we would go to it again."
Backstage Tour,It was a pretty cool tour.   Lots of country music history.   I would say if you love country music and history it’s a must see.
"Excellent guide, fascinating tour","I'm not much of a country music fan, but I still enjoyed this tour immensely, not least because our young guide did a superb job. Before we took this tour I believed that no backstage tour could possibly be as good as the one at the Coleman in Miami, Oklahoma. I was wrong. If you get the chance to take this tour, do it."
On the gotta do list,"Take the tour n gain a new perspective on the family of the ""big circle"" of fame. The ole opry s history is a tribute to country and those who have wowed us fans. Stand at the mic and feel the spirit of those stars n idols who have performed the organized chaos that is opry"
Overall a Good Experience but felt a bit rushed,"I enjoyed the tour but I felt pretty rushed the whole time. The tour I was on, at noon on a Sunday, was the last tour of the day as they had an afternoon Christmas event/performance. The tour guide was very knowledgeable. It was cool to see backstage. As someone who isn’t a huge country fan, but I don’t mind it, touring backstage once was enough, but I had a good experience."
The “New” Opry House,"I feel that I should preface my review by saying that it was my first time to Nashville. Before you make any plans to visit the Opry House, make sure you know which one you want to visit. The Ryman House is the the older venue and is downtown. There are two tours there- a self guided and guided. Both came highly recommended for the more historical content. Unfortunately we ran out of time to visit the Ryman House. We stayed at the beautiful Opryland Hotel (outside of town)which had a shuttle to the “newer” Grand Ole Opry House. We could have walked to it also.  This venue is directly across from the huge Opry Shopping Mall. As far as the tour, our guide was delightful and throughly knowledgable. The tour duplicates what it would feel like to be an entertainer at the Opry. We started out by the entry access door that the stars use, then moved on to the dressing room areas. Last stop was the actual stage and a picture taken with the option of  holding a guitar and feeling like a Star!!! The pictures were available in the gift shop for an additional $25🙃"
What a great perk behind the scenes!,"Five stars! Our tour guide was wonderful... and the tour itself was informative, interesting, and so exciting. The guide took us through the actual steps of how the stars enter the Opry, all the way through dressing rooms, the green room, and the entrance to the performance stage. The Opry is filled with history, joy, music and excitement..... and I loved every minute of the tour. Highly, highly recommend this tour for lovers of country music and even for those who are interested in such a special, hallowed ground of music in general!"
Lack Luster,"I really expected more. The trip out to this place, the fact its in a mall, and the tour was so short made this such a so so. For the price, you can walk past dressing rooms, stand on the stage, take a picture then get dumped in the gift shop. Not worth the travel out to the place. The Rynam was much more interesting."
Dolly's 50th at the Grand Ole Opry,"I went for a once in a lifetime experience and purchased a ticket for the celebration of Dolly Parton's 50th year as a member of the Grand Ole Opry.  Staff were polite and helpful, they had activities and food/beverage trucks outside to keep us occupied as we waited to get seated and the store had a wide selection of items.  The theatre is a good size for an intimate show - no binoculars needed! Highly recommend a stop at this iconic location while you are in Nashville!"
We attended the afternoon performance and wish our seats had been better.,We booked our trip through a local travel business.  Due to various situations our seats had to be changed from the 6:30 show to the 3:30 show.  In spite of the fact that the 2nd balcony was less than half full our reserved seats were as far to one side as possible making you look across instead of straight into the stage activities.  After the show started we were invited to move to better seating.  It does seem our seats could have originally been in a more centered location since those sections were not half full.
Very cool,"Very fun, enjoyable time.  It wasn't terribly crowded when we were there.  Had center stage, fairly close seats.  Which I would say was nice, but not a necessity"
Just OK,We can check Nashville off the bucket list.   I guess we just had high expectations for GOO.    The Singing  Contractors and Margo Price were great.   The others not so much.
Hidden on front row,Enjoyed seeing Trace Atkins but show was constantly being blocked by camera men. Paid top dollar for front row seats on left side  only have view constantly blocked. Will not buy seats so close again. Also felt like front seats at a theater only to have to be constantly looking straight up all night as if at a air show.
Grand Ole Opry:  A Potpourri Of Country & Western Music,"The line up of several performers made the show interesting:  there were newies and veteran performers, including folk music performers.  The variety meant it should have catered to wider audience.  There was no toilet break, though, so people tended to go during advertisement or dialogues, from emcee or co-hosts (the whole show had several hosts, each of them also performing during the show).  The end was abrupt:  there was no grouping of all the performers, taking a bow, etc etc.."
Fantastic place ,Great place to visit and see the history of country music and the like of the legendary Johnny Cash and his mates
Fun at the Opry!,"Hubby and I took an Uber from the hotel, throughly  enjoyed the Opry.  We took pictures with the giant guitars, sat under the outdoor lights and had a drink.  It was relaxing and fun! Every night the Opry changes the line up, but always a great mix!!"
"Rudolph, A Great Musical","Right next to Opry Mills Mall, we went to see Rudolph, the Musical. The performers were wonderful, especially Rudolph. It was light hearted and fun. It is a literal retelling of the classic television show of Rudolph. I would have liked to seen some additional content to make it stand out. But no, they were very faithful to the lyrics and songs of th television presentation. Enjoyable and at a lovely theater."
Grand Old Opry At the Ryman,"Great show, lots of fun. Perfect place to see the Grand Old Opry at the Ryman. Vince Gill was the host for the second half. Lots of variety, and fast paced. Great show for the price."
Rudolph,Saw Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer show here.   Classic place.   Clean and open venue.   Would come back again.
Outstanding night for my family,"Outstanding show, even our 2 years old grandson enjoyed the music. Different performers, and an excellent comic relief. Be there early as the line is long to get in."
Must do variety show,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this experience.  It turned out to be a fast moving fun evening.  The two-hour performance is a live radio broadcast (650AM if you want to check it out to see if it's something you'd want to attend live) broken up into four 30-minute segments.  In general, one act opens the segment with one number.  This act (or one of the people in it) will introduce the second act, who performs two numbers, then the third act, who performs two numbers.  Finally, the first act comes back with a final number.  In total 3 acts and 6 numbers in 30 minutes.  Repeat three more times.  With a big name, it may be two acts with the big name getting an extra number.  What I did not expect was the variety of performances: this night there was yodeling, Christmas music, Christian songs, and a comedian (who wasn't very good).  Most of the ""hosts"" of the segments are pretty funny themselves.Seating is the biggest downside.  The seats are like old wooden church pews.  By the end of the two hours, my rear end was ready to be done."
Buy at box office not on line!,"On line you pay a big premium for the tickets plus a $38 service fee per ticket.  Block tickets are released between 3-5 the day of the show.  For the routine show. About $400 on line; $160 at box office.  You can buy cheaper seats in the box office ($110) and  and then up grade in the afternoon when the blocks are released from the 3rd party.  Too bad the Opry does that......  anyway, the show was Great for outsiders, like us who know little about county music."
Better off just going to hear local music ,"We booked this even though the names of the singers were not available.  What a disappointment.  Only 2 of the acts were good.  It was not located at the Grand Ole Opry, it was at Ryman Hall.  They pack you in like sardines into hard wooden pews that should accommodate 4 across, but they sell 6 across.  It was so hot, and stuffy, and my sons legs didn’t fit in the seat.  We left before it was over, and I’ve never done that before.  The music in the bars was better, and free."
Bad seats ,We went to watch Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer. The seats are poor from every angle unless you are front balcony.. period I understand keeping the Old original feel but one pays to see the show.
Awesome experience! ,"Totally enjoyed the show.  Great musicians — very professional.  The acoustics were very good.  We sat in the center section in row G and I felt our seats were very good.  There is no experience like the Opry! My only two suggestions are: 1) that they close caption the opening video for hearing-impaired customers and 2) that they have some kind of sign or backdrop somewhere that says “Grand Ole Opry” so people can pose to take photos.  The bright floodlights in front of the entrance to the Opry ruin any chance of capturing a good picture in front of the building itself. The show is a live radio broadcast. There is an intermission midway through the show.  A comedian performs about halfway through the evening, too. It was exciting to attend a concert here, no doubt about it!"
Really interesting,"Great! (and not too long either!) As soon as you get to Nashville you get a feel for how important the Opry was way back when, so to go round it is a real experience."
Bittersweet,"The Opry house is a beautiful venue and I highly recommend the backstage tour. Unfortunately, I didn't know the regular Grand Ole Opry lineup reverts back to the Ryman for the winter months. I have no regrets about my experience at the Ryman but I would have definitely enjoyed myself that much more had it taken place at the Opry house. Either way, you won't leave with any regrets."
Loved it even though not into country music,"My wife grew up in a country music environment - her father had dated Brenda Lee. I did not but I still thoroughly enjoyed the first show, so we went back for another one two days later. I will admit the level of enjoyment depends to a degree on who the performers are, in particular who the headliner is. We were lucky to get Little Big Town and Ray Stevens one night and Crystal Gale the second."
Great tour,Very much enjoyable. A lot of history and very knowledgeable tour guides.Convenient location with a lot of parking. Would go again
Nice sight lines,I’ve been here at least twice and thought the view from both sections was really good.I have not seen the Grand Ole Opry show however.Seats are comfortable too.
Great entertaining show,We are not especially country music fans. But the show was so entertaining and energetic and fun a-positive experienceWe loved the variety of the different genres of music and all the commentators. A truly delightful experience. We would highly recommend this to anybody passing through Nashville.
Amazing experience ,This is a must see when you visit Nashville!!! You learn so much and get to tour it just as if you were a singer getting ready for your show.
Grand Ole Opry Review,Very interesting and informative tour. IMO I thought the group should have been smaller. You are shown several dressing rooms the famous singers use while visiting the GOO. Opportunity is given to look into the rooms through a standard sized doorway. Imagine a group of abt 20 people waiting to look into the room and take a pic or two. So if u are one of the last ones to do this then you will miss the explanation of the following room. The end of tour I thought could also have been better by taking us down one of the many aisles leading to the front of the stage to take pics. Just my opinion.
Great!,"Great to see, especially if you’re a fan if country music. A little expensive for the experience, it’s literally just a tour then out."
Beautiful to see especially during the holidays ,So nice to tour around the Grand Ole Opry property. It wasn’t to busy as we went on a Monday in the late afternoon. The property was decorated for the holidays and it looked so charming.
Road trip with my granddaughter ,This was enjoyable but surrounded by such commercialism. It was kinda a turn off. GPS sends you in to Mall. We needed to ignore its suggestions
Christmas show and shopping,"We enjoy visiting the Opry for the Christmas shows - this year's offering was Rudolph. We all thought it was great! It was for children but also for those adults who grew up with this classic Christmas show. This stage musical made its New York debut in 2016 and tours at Christmas. Attendance on this Tuesday night in mid-November was low and we were encouraged to forget about our balcony seats and sit on the main floor. It was great to see the action up close. Everyone was just wonderful in their part - great singing and puppet work. At the end Rudolph flies out over the audience and there is a sing-along. After the show we visited the Opry Shop. They had Rudolph themed items and a lot of country gear - hats, music, ornaments, jewelry, collectibles. There are circles on the floor in front of flat screens; if you stand on these spots under a cone, you can hear the music from the artist on the screen."
Ok tour,Tour lasted about 45 minutes. Got to see some of the dressing rooms used by the stars as well as the auditorium. Not sure if it's worth it though.
Nashville Trip,"What an awesome tour! I knew when I made it to Nashville I wanted to tour the Opry, and I was impressed! I loved hearing the stories and seeing the dressing rooms. Its simply amazing to stand right where some of the biggest stars stand and perform."
Never thought I'd enjoy going again being from Chattanooga and raised on the Opry...,LOVED EVERY MOMENT! I loved being there again. It was so well run up until waiting to get into the venue. Standing on the concrete for over an hour waiting for the over run from the first show to exit was hard on everyone and it was a tad chilly. I recommend going to the first show available and get center located seats so you can see. We were on the end stage left and although they have TVs so we can see it was a bit too far left. I loved seeing everyone I grew up hearing but they only sang 2 old songs and I wanted more hits than new stuff. But I still enjoyed it thoroughly and will be going back for sure!
Backstage Tour,"This was a very interesting tour. Got to see behind the scenes of the Grand Ole Opry. Our guide was very personable and had great knowledge, her personality was great. Answered all of our tour group questions. If in Nashville and you love the Opry you will find it worth your wild."
Fascinating,Took the backstage tour and was very impressed with the place.  I learned the method plan for who performs there and what and why they use certain dressing rooms.  A very fascinating plan that ha been carried on from the beginning.  Also learned about Minnie Pearl's place...
Evening show,Although we didn’t know most of the performers still a very good night. Very enthusiastic MC showing the passion for the music industry.
Great guided tour,"The guided tour lasted less than 45 minutes but included time in the hall as well as visits backstage and quick views of each of the 18 dressing rooms, each with its own theme and history.  Our guide, Lynzee, was very informative and super exuberant.  The tour starts off with what may be one the best introductory movies of any place I’ve been to, with a 3D Trisha Yearwood and Garth Brooks commentary with  multiple videos and music on screens both in front of you and on each side.Large gift shop too with lots of merchandise.  Bypass the $15 parking lot for the free parking at Dave and Buster’s at the mall which is actually closer to the Opry entrance anyway.Opryland resort and outlet stores are across the street and Willie Nelson and Friends museum and airport are just minutes away."
Great Show,"We took in the early evening performance and enjoyed several musicians who played there. Very good time listening to the music from the musicians and the hosts of the show brought a lot of audience participation during the performances. It was a pack house, reservations advised."
Fist time visit bus tour,Wonderful place to visit and see the concert.  Our show was  fast paced and the entertainment was lively. Was not that familiar with the entertainers but still enjoyed the show and experience. Acoustic sound is great.
Awesome time,"Went to Grand Ole Opry with another couple and we had amazing seats and a really good time.  The show was awesome, and we got to see alot of good artist when we were there. We went to the early show and because it got sold out they added a late show later on.  Get there early for parking and just hang out by taking a bunch of photo's.  Also I'd recommend if you want any souvenirs to buy them before the show (since you will be there early for parking)"
Pleasantly surprised,"I had no idea what to expect when I ordered tickets for the grand old opry. I was sort of expecting an old fashioned, older crowd, in older building with old country singers. Boy was I surprised. It was in a brand new building, with most of the crowd being fairly young. The acts were all contemporary country singers, and thee lineup was jam packed with one after the other famous country western singers. Seats were super comfortable and there were 3 gigantic tv monitors to view the acts close up. No bad seats in the house. The highlight was Carrie Underwood joining special guest Brad Paisley to sing a beautiful duet. Highly highly recommend while in Nashville."
Nashville Bound,"We were in Nashville to see Mumford & Sons, and decided to go to the Grand Ole Opry.  It was very interesting and sort of a 'throw-back' in time.  Very enjoyable and a fun evening.  Plenty of good places nearby for dinner and then just walk on over."
LOVED BEING HERE!!,"This show will always be something I remember.  Even though no big name artists, they were all big in my eyes and phenomenal!  We laughed, we cried, we clapped and enjoyed our $20 beverages!  Haha. No seat is a bad seat.  We did the backstage tour which in my opinion they allow too many folks to attend.. interesting but also a lot of wasted time just standing around while other groups got their tours.  Did enjoy it and glad we did it.  So worth seeing a show and I will always go when in Nashville!"
Second Opry visit,"On our second trip to Nashville, we decided to go to see the Opry again. The show’s format was similar, however the acts were different (except for the return of the amazing Ricky Skaggs). This time there was an hysterical comedian, Henry Cho, who had everyone rolling in the aisles! The Charlie Daniels Band closed the show, and was truly wonderful! A very enjoyable time at the Opry!"
Wow...what history!,"Sitting in the theater where Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton, and so many other Country Music Legions preformed makes you feel the history once inside the building. They have the actual flooring on stage where the greats once stood. Artists want to preform there and pull you into their presentations. What history. A must-see when in Nashville even if you are not a country music fan!"
Great Memories,"A visit to Nashville must include taking in a show here at this multi-level auditorium.  We took in a great show that included Larry Gaitlin, Oakridge Boys, and Carrie Underwood,  two screens on the right and left of the auditorium for easy viewing.  Vendors outside sell food and drink that you can bring into the show.  Good old time was had by all."
Backstage tour at the new Grand Old Opry outside of Nashville,We showed up for the designated tour time and there was no one there.  I had to go to the ticket office and was told the 2pm tour was canceled because they were setting up the Christmas reindeer show.  The ticket agent indicated that I was the 8th person who had run into this.  I bought the tickets on line the week before yet no one contacted us to let us know it was canceled and we had driven out from Nashville just for this.  I then had to work on getting a refund from Trip Advisor.  It was difficult finding a customer service number for this but eventually I was able to get through and am now awaiting the refund.
Opry,Wonderful show at the Grand Ole Opry 9/11 eve finishing with Lee Greenwood singing God Bless the USA. Unforgettable night!
Great ! ,Great entertainment for the family or alone. We loved it. Wasn’t too pricy and the tour is amazing in itself just the history of the building.
Great time at Orpy,What a grand time to be had by all even those who don't think they are country fans. It's a live radio show with many acts. Surprises to be had and don't always expect the original artists. Performers only do 2-3 songs each. Just a fun time! And the back stage tour is a must! History full and you might see a STAR or 2!
Country Music at its Best! Know the venue and details in advance however.,"Even though I am not a huge country music fan, going to the Opry was high on my list of things to do. It's an institution after-all! First some logistics so you are aware. The new home of the Opry is about 25 minutes outside of Nashville by car and there is little else around Opryland to justify staying there unless you want to enjoy the expensive hotel grounds nearby. Also, they move the Opry in the Winter to its former home at the Ryman Theater which is right in downtown Nashville so when planning your trip be sure and verify which location the Opry Show will be and what days it is operating. The Ryman also has other kinds of live music shows not just country. Ok back to the Opry itself. We went to the new home at Opryland and booked seats in the first row of the first balcony which gave us a birds eye view of everything and great sound. The seating is pew style and you are able to bring food to your seat and eat during the show. There are numerous concession stands outside and inside the building including beer and wine. The show itself normally features about 8 performers who are often not fully advertised until a week before the show. They publish a list online of the lineup for each day the Opry is running, it can be hit and miss to see one of the superstars there but regardless all the performers are excellent, they have to be to make it on the stage! The show is live on radio so you get to hear the commercials and announcements, total time is 2 hours with a 15 minute intermission. Regardless of which of the two locations you attend or who you see, I think you will have a really good time listening to top quality entertainers and outstanding back up musicians. Finally we used Lyft to get there and back, worked very weil but there is lots of parking if you have your own car. Enjoy ya'll!!"
"What a Nice, Old Fashioned Country Show","The show itself was excellent. They have a variety of acts who play about 2 songs and talk a bit. It gave you a full country feel of years ago to current. The Square Dancers were a fun throwback!  The reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because I paid a total of $65 to see this show which was at least 2 hours long which was great, but in between guests, the speaker advertises their sponsor each time. It was tacky and annoying and ruined the flow of the show. People were actually laughing at it when it became ridiculous. They need to add some class and decorum to their format because they are charging quite a bit for that show. I paid $55 for a concert there with Elvis Costello and he played for 2 hours. But as far as the country show goes, it is worthwhile as it’s nostalgic, fun and entertaining!"
Non Visit to Ryman Auditorium- No Sympathy,"I purchased tickets for the Sat 2 Nov 2130hrs show as I was due to arrive in Nashville at 1700hrs. Unfortunately shortly after leaving Heathrow the engine on our aircraft malfunctioned and we had to return. This meant I was unable to arrive at The Ryman Auditorium in time for the show and eventually got to Nashville late. On Monday I visited the Ryman and was directed to sales where I explained my dilemma. The ticket sales person can only be described as totally unhelpful and showed no empathy or understanding. I didn’t purchase the refund policy, which I understand was my fault, however I did not ask for a refund but instead some replacement tickets for either another show or tour. My request was met with a blunt refusal to assist in anyway whatsoever and was told in not so many words ‘tough luck’   I was utterly disappointed with this response from a supposedly world renowned venue. So folks my advice would be if you ever plan a visit to The Ryman Auditorium in Nashville make sure you don’t require any assistance or understanding with a problem as you won’t receive any help whatsoever from this world renown famously hospitable venue. Good luck!"
Checked one off of my bucket list,"We purchased our tickets to the opry months ahead of the show and therefore had pretty good seats. All the singers were great and we got to see Crystal Gayle. The next day we did the backstage tour, it was great and worth the money. A great experience in Nashville."
Friday Night Live,"My wife and I went 10/18. We stayed at the Gaylord Opry Land just a few blocks away. The show was sold out but were told to check with Graline Tours because they always have a ""block"" of tickets. Sure enough they did. We were seated in row 18 on the right side. The show was fun with a couple new acts, Bobby Bones and some old faithfuls.I recommend going at least once."
Tourist Trap,"Nice place but wouldn't do again. If you have ever been to Ireland the thing to do that is recommended is the Guinness tour. Basically a museum that you pay $35 for a beer, but you can say you were there. That is what it felt like. You can't not go to the Grand Ol Opry while in Nashville.  You would think on a Saturday night they would stack the lineup but no one we knew performed  and each performer was older than the previous. We were better entertained by the opening act at he Garth Brooks concert."
Good time,Had a great time. The building was everything I could expect the staff was terrific and I think I got a good price on the concession items I purchased
Spectacular,This was my dream to attend a concert here and I was certainly not disappointed. Simply amazing. Just a hint - it is far cheaper to purchase a ticket at the ticket office than purchase on line
Bucket List,Just pulling into the Grand Ole Opry had my heart fluttering!! parking was a breeze! The Opry was fantastic!! And getting to see Dolly Parton's 50th anniversery show awesome! There isn't a bad seat in the whole house!!
What fun!,"Took the backstage tour at the Grand Ole Opry. I would highly recommend it to anyone who visits Nashville. One country fan and three not so much, thoroughly enjoyed the backstage tour. It was informative, fun, and we had an awesome tour guide, which I’m sure made it that much better.  The tour helped us to better understand where the stars are coming from and what it means to them to become a member of the Grand Old Opry. Highly recommend!"
Become a country star,"This is one big resort area and the smallest part is the Opry itself. Easily accessible by car or bus tour, its an iconic place, especially to stand on the stage. Well run and organised the tour is informative and interesting and when in Nashville its a must do."
45th Wedding Anniversary,Visited the area surrounding the Grand Ole Opry and took in a show starring Vince Gill and Whispering Bill Anderson.  Great show.
Fantastic Show,"There is no place quite like the Grand Ole Opry! It is no wonder it has been going for 90 years! Been loads of times, and never seen a bad show! An absolute must if you are in Nashville."
Nice to see,"How many times have you watched programs from this historic landmark? The grounds are clean, plenty of parking (free), mall nearby, the credible Gaylord Marriott nearby......fun to see. Back stage passes are about $50 each with tax.  Decided to skip paying for a back stage tour.  In most cases, if you’ve seen the stages and back stage area of other nationally known facilities, I can6 imagine its worth the price to see this one.  Gift shop is ok, but really gives you the feel that there really isn’t much to see inside the facility.  Might be worth the tour price with a show if you are a true die hard country music fan."
great show a must see when in nashville,we had a group fo 35 that went to see the show.......be careful the concessions are very over priced.
Grand Ole Opry Tour,"We decided last minute to book a tour of the Grand Ole Opry and boy are we so glad we did. The magic and history of going backstage does not disappoint. The tour was the perfect amount of time (about 45min) and allowed for plenty of photo opportunities. It was such a unique experience seeing firsthand the dressing rooms that country's greats prepare in prior to performing. A special thank you to Randy, our tour guide who led with heartfelt enthusiasm and extensive knowledgeability."
This is a must see,We stopped here when we were on our bus tour.This is a must see when you are in the city.We took the backstage tour and got to stand on the famous circle and we got our pictures taken as well.We got to see where the performers get dressed and where the level was when it flooded years ago.I would go back again.I did not get to see the live performace as I was sick that night.Maybe next time whenever we are in the country again.
Gotta See It!,"The Grand Ole Opry is a must see and hear!  I could almost hear Carrie Underwood, or Alan Jackson in the tjheatre.   I was a little disappointed that I didn't know any of the performers, but it was wonderful none the less!"
Grand old opry,An outstanding experience. We had a fantastic time listening to the country music. Brilliant value for money
Opry show,Everyone should visit the grand ole opry at least once! Very neat experience. The weekend we went it was very crowded but still enjoyed the show.
Iconic,"Bucket list for sure. Key is to watch events closely leading up to your trip. Guests and sows shows constantly updated ... can get some killer deals. We happened to be able to book the night of Luke Combs induction. Un-flippin-believable. Got to, got to GO to Grand Ol Opry."
Great Time,Fun time went for Del McCoury's 80th birthday. They do have metal detectors to enter the building and they took my very small pocket knife and would not give it back.
A wow experience even if country music isn't your thing.,"Ok, this really should be a 5 star because of the overall experience is amazing but is getting 4 for a very good reason. The seating are like church pews of 50yrs ago and they pack you in there like cattle. If you are not dainty you will be sitting side ways in the pew like seats and squished by someone you will be soon making as a friend. Get over that or a non packed house and its something you will always remember forever."
Great tour!,Went on a girls trip to Nashville and a trip to the Grand Ole Opry felt like a must do item. I'm not a country music lover so I wasn't sure how I would like it but the tour was great. They shared a lot of information and you could just feel the iconic vibe of the Opry House. If you are on the fence book it next time I will try to see a show there to get that experience as well!
Ushers were so kind. ,"The show was fantastic. Trace Adkins was certainly the highlight but ALL the entertainers were incredible.  We are repeat visitors. The Opry never disappoints!!I want to give a shout-out to the ushers. My 5 yr old special needs niece loves music. She has visited the Opry before. She has physical disabilities and is non-verbal.  However, she does find her “voice”.  My sister didn’t want my niece to bedisruptive to others, so she when she got loud, my sister quickly moved from her handicap seats and took my niece to the area near the upstairs elevator.  I think the usher’s name was Patricia who was the usher working the 2nd floor area near the elevator exit. She was so kind...checking on my sister, asking if she needed anything, offering her water, etc.  All the ushers that my encountered my niece and sister were so nice. For the last set, Patricia asked some “Opry family members” if they would move so my sister and niece could finally sit down but be near an exit should she get loud. Patricia then sought me out across the auditorium to let me know where my sister and niece were sitting.  Thank you Patricia and all the ushers that encountered my niece and sister for being so kind and respectful. Thank you again. Well-done."
FRiday Night HoDown,If you go to Nashville you have got to go to the Grand Ole Opry. It was entertaining and we saw a few first time GOO acts. The show was sold out but we were told to contact Grayline Tours because they have a block of tickets and it worked out. The price included a ride to the show and back. The bus was running late but we made the show well be fore it started.
A must do,Going to the opry is a must. We had great seats in section 4..row 6 ..seats 5 thru 8...entertainment was good and a great show.
Well worth the drive,"We had so much fun on the backstage to work. Our guide, Tyler, was fabulous. He really provided an inside view of the shows. I highly recommend it."
First time visit ,I thought the backstage tour was great. A few too many people in each group. Lots of waiting. The grand ole Opry Friday night show was a total waste of money. Sooooo many commercials!!Most of the singers were not funny and were not good singers. I don’t recommend this show! Sorry ☹️
Way better than I thought it would be,"I didn't think I'd love it this much since I'm not even a country music fan. It was terrific and so entertaining! It's not just listening to live music, but also you get to enjoy square dancing, yodeling, comedy, and trivial questions for free prizes. I laughed a lot, and was in awe of the wonderful performances.We arrived about an hour before the first show not knowing what to expect. They had many places there to get a quick bite to eat even before entering the building. There was a Yee-Haw Brewery truck as well as other diner type food trucks. There's even a shopping mall across the street with lots of food options. Go early and just walk around. It's actually a very relaxing walk and entry through security. You also might want to get your cocktails before the show. I say that because a rum or whiskey drink will cost you $22. I was in shock. That's more than stadium prices. I mean really! The drinks were good with plenty of alcohol but not worth the sticker price.The show was amazing! It was a mix of old and new country singers. Some famous ones like Trace Adkins, Jon Conlee, and Hunter Hayes. There was a young girl from Canada who sang her heart out during her first Opry stage debut. Madison Kozak got a standing 'O' for her performance. She had the voice of an angel. The Riders in the Sky comedy group were so entertaining. I loved them! This particular show was broadcast live on radio channel 650 AM and on SiriusXM. It was such a cool experience. Our seats were front and center on the mezzanine level. I'd get these same seats all over again. Everyone was so friendly (staff and patrons). The Opry brings together people from all over the world. I can see why country music is popular now. Don't hesitate to get a ticket to a show while you're in town. You won't regret it. It was worth every penny and it was the highlight of our trip. A must when in Nashville."
Loved every minute ,"Have always wanted to see the Grand Ole Opry and it didn’t disappoint, did the tour and watch a show so much fun a must for any holiday in Nashville, These Aussies will be back!"
Grand Ole Opry backstage Toutr,"Absolutely a must do in Nashville.  The tour was separated into small manageable groups.  We had a wonderful guide.  The holographic hosts of Trisha and Garth and their musical guests gave a heartfelt and emotional introduction. The tour was super, the Opry beautiful, the stage held a reverence.  We had tickets to a Tuesday night show and were very pleased to enjoy Charlie Daniels among others."
Exceeded our high expectations!,"My wife and I recently finally visited the Grand Ole Opry. Wow! We expected a great show, but the performers, sound system (magnificent!), and venue were all even better that we could have imagined. We sat on the main floor, but every seat is probably fantastic. We loved this show and plan to attend again on our next visit to Nashville! Don't miss this whether or not you love Country Music."
Grand Ole Opry ,What a great piece of country music history.  The tour is very informative and fun.  Take as many pics as you like and see what happens behind the magic of the stage.
Excellent!!!  So glad we went!  ,"The Grand Ole Opry never fails! All star lineup every time!  We saw Jeannie Seely, Exile, Ricky Skaggs, Rhonda Vincent, Henry Cho and Chris Janson WOW!!!  Amazing!  Our first time to do the backstage tour and very interesting. Judy was our guide and did an excellent job. What a great experience!!"
Mind blowing!!,"Pretty much speechless! If you visit Nashville and you haven’t come to the Ole Opry... you haven’t been to Nashville at all. The backstage tour is expensive but so worth it. Billy our tour man, was delightful, patient and extremely enthusiastic and knowledgeable. Standing on the circle looking to the stalls... sent chills through my entire body!"
Classic Country Venue,"Its not downtown so plan accordingly.  We took an uber from the middle of downtown and it was about $20.  You can only plan so far ahead as acts can change even at the last minute.  We were happy with our seats and with our performers..some were just writers of famous songs so the singing was not stellar but the song was familiar.  Brad Upton, the comedian, was there that night and he was hysterical..loved him!  Heard a guy named Craig Campbell which I was not familiar with his music before then but I am now a big fan.  Kalie Shorr was supposed to be in the Opry Shop after the show to sign her new CD but we left well after she was supposed to be there and no sign of her so we gave up.  Overall a pleasant night."
"Great Time, Great Show","I have wanted to get to Nashville for years to visit the Grand Ole Opry, ever since seeing the movie, ""Coalminer's Daughter.""  Didn't really like the movie much but was always wanting to get to the Opry. We got front row center mezzaine seats and they were fantastic. I do think they could advertise better on how to get taxis to and from, even form a taxi line. They should also be more specific about all the food options there, as there were many, not to mention there is a major shopping mall right next door. The drink prices were outrageous--more than $22 for a double whiskey and pepsi, but I guess that is to be expected. I didn't recognize most of the singers but they were all good, and everyone was so polite and friendly, on and off stage. Great time!"
Great Fun,I was very hesitant to attend this event BUT I absolutely loved it! The music acts only play a few songs each so if you aren’t sure you love one act....another is coming soon. Getting in and out of the facility was efficient. I would highly recommend this to anyone visiting Nashville!
Awesome!,Was not disappointed; saw Marty Stewart and the Gatlin Brothers. Great seats and great performances by all.
Grand Ole Opry Fun. ,"It was great to walk around in such a gorgeous indoor venue.  The foliage is beautiful, lots of food choices and cute boutique shops.  I felt like I was in a modern country style museum but not."
A bit disappointed,"Enjoyed the two main liners, but the rest were ancient. It was like they had to pull from the near grave to find singers."
Anniversary trip ,"I bought tickets to the Opry to see Toby Keith, I checked back later to see the line up and he was no longer listed. When I chatted with the Opry, they informed me he had canceled! I was very disappointed to say the least. His replacement...Crystal Gayle! Really, are you kidding me? The Opry is something to see, however you should see the headliner that you paid to see. Upon arrival we decided to have a cocktail,  only to discover that a double was $24! A little steep for any venue! I advise buyer beware from purchasing tickets to purchasing drinks!! At least I crossed this experience off of my bucket list. Oh, and this was in the day of our 39th wedding anniversary, not the celebration we expected."
Great place for history ,We stayed at the Opryland hotel and walked over and decided to do a tour but there weren’t any available that day so we got tickets for the next morning. We had a young gentleman for our guide. He was so knowledgeable and funny. It was really neat to walk the same paths the stars walk to go to their dressing rooms then to the stage. You get to stand where all of the greats stand/have stood to sing at the Grand Ole Opry. They take your picture in the center of the stage with the microphone and you have the option of holding a guitar in the picture.
Girls weekend,I throughly enjoyed the show we attended at the Grand Ole Opry during our girls weekend. The show is a must see while you’re in Nashville
