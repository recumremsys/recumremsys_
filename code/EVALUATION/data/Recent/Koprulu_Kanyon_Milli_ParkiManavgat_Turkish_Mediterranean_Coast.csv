waterfalls,The road we took was well worth it.  Very nice and clean place.  Wonderful waterfalls lurk high in the mountain.  We took a boat ride down the river and enjoyed the outdoors.
"Great views, lot of rafting possibilities","The environment is awesome. White water all around, great cliffs and lot of waterfalls. Really worth visiting. When you arrive at the main area, you will be overwhelmed by Turks who want to sell you a trip on a boat, or raft. Make sure you compare, because prices can be very different. Especially the Turks who approach you while parking and calling you 'my friend', those will be the most likely to scheme. You can also find some rafting/ zip-lining companies online. Perhaps that is the better option.If you do not like rafting, you can take a boat, or just take a seat in a restaurant and enjoy the view.Absolutely worth to take a drive to this area."
Breathtakingly beautiful,"Visited for a day excursion including a speedboat through the steepest part of the gorge, off-road Jeep Safari & white water rafting. The gorge is absolutely stunning with amazing steep cliff sides and crystal clear aqua water. The river where the rafting took place is also beautiful and when we weren’t screaming through the rapids it was very tranquil with the mountains and forest all around. We have been to this part of Turkey several times but for some reason never visited the canyon before. However, we all agreed it was one of the highlights of the holiday. A definite for adrenaline junkies and for those who want to get away from the coast and see some beautiful scenery.On a separate note - we booked the excursion through TuiGo. The activity centre staff were superb but our trip guide spoke only German, despite half the coach speaking only English and us all requesting an English speaking guide at time if booking. However, the canyon, gorge and surrounding scenery was beautiful and hence the 5 stars for the NationalPark."
River rafting 20$,Best day activity in Antalya under 20$  river rafting food trasnpotation  all inclunding .it is highly recomanded tour
Taurus mountains: Kopru Park,"Luscious green mountainous park consisting of many pine trees, cedars, olives, apricot and fig trees. great cappadokian style rocks and splendid views. Kopru gorge and eurodymon bridge as well as Selge old city are to view. Worth a day trip, and then spend some time cooling off in the river."
The best canyon ever ,"I visited thiz place in 1990 and it did not change much which is the bestIt is still untouchedThe nature, the river, the canyon and the fish restaurantsI would spend a whole day"
Rafting,"Anyone looking for a decent rafting company - Fortune Rafting were great. We spent ages looking at the different companies offering rafting, but ended up going with Fortune. We contacted them via Facebook. We didn't need transportation as we had our own car, so it was 20€ per person, with lunch included.You need to take your own shoes you're willing to get wet, or you can buy a pair of wetsuit style shoes from them for 8€ at their base camp. The instructors were great, really informative and entertaining. Decent English spoken by all. Very professional outfit in my opinion. Would thoroughly recommend to anyone looking for a rafting company."
must do in Manavgat,"Koprulu Canyon is a unique place and if you don't want to be entrapped within your hotel, this should be in the first rank of your 'To Do list'. Approx. one hour driving distance from Manavgat city center. You can pass through the Canyon and visit the upper part, Tazı Canyon, if you want to see the beginning of the Canyon from above. This place is half an hour from Koprulu Canyon by car and you have to walk 10 min more. Koprulu Canyon is an easy rafting route and you can complete it even with your baby. This is really a nice place but expect some crowd. Also be aware of bad organisators. We were lucky and had a private rafting activity with our family. We preferred a small family facility called 'Side Restaurant' and satisfied with the service."
An Unforgettable Rowing Adventure,"Beautiful adventure with the Antalya Homes Team in amazing areas, Canyon. An unforgettable rowing adventure with cold river water in scenic nature. It was very amazing experience :)"
By far the best place we visited - a must visit,"We hired a car via Pandora Car hire so was very easy for us to get around. We drove to the Kanyon, did a round route of the whole area while making frequent stops on the way. The weather was great and the view was beautiful at all the various points. There are some low points where you can sit with you feet in the water, the water is a bit cold but amazing experience as it's exceptionally clean. Loved the whole experience. There are restaurants and rafting providers on the route round. The road is great so no problems driving around.A must visit - we definitely loved our day trip to here!"
Nice region to to some hiking,We did a jeep safari of the area in the morning and a rafting trip in the afternoon.Nice way to spend a day.
White Water Rafting,"This is great fun. Have done this twice and I'm 66 years old, my Husband has done this 3 times and he is now 76 years old. we went with Prestige Rafting and have had no problems with them. My husband went with them again in 2018 and some of the lads recognised him. When we are in Side this year, I might go rafting again, but it depends on how my knees bear up. Great outfit Prestige Rafting. Thanks Mustafa!!!"
schön,"authentic, populer tourism place. you should visit this canyon. you can go for rafting at this area."
Brilliant day out,This is well worth the trip.Beautiful scenery but be ware this can get crowded as its a popular place to visit.
Beautiful scenery,Take a wander up the mountain Road beyond the canyon for wonderful views. We enjoyed visiting out of season when the river and roads were quiet.
"Amazing scenery, beautiful place for rafting tour","The water is so beautiful and clear, we enjoyed the scenery drive along the canyon and enjoyed the rafting trip, we went in may when the water was not so choppy and I took my 21 months old for rafting trip, we both enjoyed it."
Creative Nature,"Manavgat is a fantastic natural area , water is very cool and green mountains are everywhere, i suggest to stay at least two nights to participate in the amazing activities around ."
Novaraft,An excellent day spent in the professional and attentive care of Hamil and Mumeht at Novaraft. Although we’d not booked for canyoning (we had two children aged nearly 7) we were taken to join a Dutch group. The experience for adults and our teens was amazing and the scenery stunning. Our little ones however (11 to 6) found swimmming in the river too cold (7 deg C) Hamil organised a boat transfer for them for the last 100mtrs or so and then took the trouble to buy them a chocolate bar to help warm the up ❤️. Rafting was also great fun and although it looked challenging we found it safe and exhilarating. Its a long day and we all tucked into a late fish / chicken lunch after. We stayed at Ali Bey resort in Manavgat and If staying in this part of Turkey it’s well worth the 1.5hr transfer. Things to bare in mind....you need trainer or jelly shoes for canyoning (we had to buy them there for 5 E). Unless your young children are very hardy and confident in cold water the canyon swim is a challenge.
Beautiful natural scenery ,You can enjoy your day with your family great lunch and the weather is wonderful and river makes everything soft and pleasant
Excellent entertainment for whole family,Rafting on Koprulu River is a must have activity for whole family. Before we had some concerns for safety of small children but is perfectly suitable and safe for 7 years ols and children loves it. Guide will adjust level of attraction to the crew on board if there are small children he will take light course to avoid serious obstacles. You will get wet though. There are breaks provided and the meal half way through. Views on surrounding mountains are spectacular and water is Cristal clear.
Stunning,Went on river rafting there in June 2018! Blu marine water make place look magical! River rapids quite steep in some places but over quite calm and pleasant
interesting area not known to all tourists but locals,there are many restaurants along the course of the river where you can linger and eat at decent prices.
Rafting and Natural Beauties,"The Canyon is located at the north part of Manavgat-Serik Area through the Taurus Mountainous Region. The river rises from Isparta and ends up in Antalya seaside. It is especially suitable for rafting with 25km length of it. You can also go for a visit and make a stopover a restaurant at the riverside. The restaurants generally offers fish (trout) and gozleme (Turkish crep). you can also ask for other types of grills and snacks such as french fries and salads. If you like to take photographs, the scenic view of the canyon will be very helpful. Especially summer times, the canyon offers you nice time due to cooler atmosphere. However, you can also make a visit during the fall and winter seasons."
Rafting Day Trip,"The highlife of our holiday.  Also very cheap for what you get.  It take about an hour to reach as they collect guest from other hotels.  We used Tornado Rafting and were very happy with the rafting. Also jumped into the ice cold water which  in it self was an experience as well as the jump of point.  The rapids are level 2 or 3. I took my 11 year old son and it was the first time for both of us, an amazing experience, something not to be missed if you are in Antalya.  The scenery is amazing. You will water shoes, towel, change of clothing.  If you don’t have the water she’s then you need to buy from them for €5 which are basic quality.  Worth buying some decent one from the local shop of before you travel to Antalya.  The rafting company will provide you with wet suites, helmet, life jacket.  Photos and DVD are extra budget about €25 for both.  But worth having a they do take decent photos and movie at strategic locations.  Would definitely do it again on my next Antalya vacation."
"A fantastic day out with the most spectacular scenery, great atmosphere, singing and splashing fun all the way.","Who would have believed Turkey had even more to offer. The scenery along this river is stunning. This trip is full of fun and excitement, we chose to kayak and got regularly attacked by the rafters along the river attempting to fill our kayak with water.......all in great spirit. The leaders running the day are friendly, experienced and full of fun. Lunch is chicken, rice salad and beer or water coke etc. Wear boating shoes or buy the plastic shoes on site, take a waterproof camera although a few pics are taken by the team to purchase after, there's also a video. Wear plenty of sunscreen as you have to leave belongings in the minibus and pay for extras at the end. This is a fantastic day out and the rapids are really exciting!"
Time to chill at Selge Allie pansiyon,"Spent two days here in the gorge staying at Selge Ailee pansiyon. Room was basic and clean, plenty of room with air con and en suite. Booked rafting through Selge at TL30 per person! A lot cheaper than other prices quoted and it was an amazing experience. We also got rowed up stream by two guys to see the waterfall, hard work for them on the way up! Got a tour of Selge by a girl who found us looking lost in the mountains which was fantastic. A great place to unwind"
"Amazing destination, awsome rafting experince","We had a rafting round here as a family. We chose the Express team (blues), and another team (reds) was also running successfully. The route was so exciting and the guys guiding the boats did everything to make the people have fun. Lunch was included, drinks were not expensive. All costed around 20-25 USD per person, being lower for the kids."
MUST GO! ,"This place is the best day out from the hussle and bustle of the city! Picnic by the river, swimming, whitewater rafting! OMG you must do it! ❤️"
Great scenery,"We went there with our private car, it is almost a 1.5 hours drive from Side. The old bridge is just fascinating. We also took a boat tour, with Yasin, and went against the flow and saw the source of the water. The power of the water was amazing. The tour took around 1 hour, we had a chance to swim in the water too - it is ice cold. We did not do rafting but people sounded enjoying it too. Highly recommended place!"
Adventure,Went to visit as part of a rafting excursion.  The scenery once you get of the highway is beautiful. The little villages you drive through are idyllic. The canyon is very scenic. We had a lovely time throughly enjoying and the rafting was one the best adventures we've been on. Our tour operator was wonderful so was our group.
Great get away from the fancy hotels,Rent a car a drive about 40 min from Belek to the Koprulu national park. reach the roman bridge and take a 50 min paddle boat ride into the canyon. Views are magnificent. It is not walkable. In the winter most attractions are closed but you can find restraunts offering fresh fish and typical food.Had a great day out.
Good for adventurers,"Nice and strong current , chilling water where you can enjoy 12km rafting. Pickup, dropoff and lunch included. You must rent swimming uniform, gloves and water shoes, always bargain or else you will get them at high price. Even when buying photos and video after rafting you will find them expensive but keep on bargaining and they will give to you at the end. Kinda aggressive guys but you can manage them. Lunch is average. Our bus was not A/C. Long distance from Kaleiçi to the canyon. In general it was good and suitable for all ages"
Breathtaking,"What  a wonderful and breathtaking experience. Stopped here for an hour or so and just marveled at the beauty of the natural wonders. The water here is clear but cold, lovely for a brisk dip to cool you down in the height of the season. The Ancient Bridge is a marvel to see."
First time Rafting,"I booked a rafting trip with canyon visit during my tripp to Antalya. It was the best thing ever! First we visited a little towm with old houses, a beautiful new mosque and then we arrived at the Canyon. Beautiful panoramas, I took great pictures there and was just wonderfull! At noon we had a meal included, no beverages. The guide showed us how 2 salads were made and I prepared them home also, he was a good teacher. We picked fish from fish or chicken and it was the best fish ever eaten, and I love fish! After lunch, the rafting was in plan, we rented a neoprene suit, and I recomend to do so also, the water was freezing! The guy  that was with us during the rafting was so funny, we played a bunch of games in the boat, the hour passed quickly and I had the best time! I recomend the tour to everybody who wants something else then just an all inclusive tripp."
Amazing day by the river!,"If you want a great day out with stunning views, ice cold water, brilliant guides and a whole lot of fun you have to try Koprulu canyon and the rafting. You can go up river and see the waterfalls or you go down river, white water rafting. We did both and both were great fun. The guide was excellent and allowed us to do as much (or as little) as we wished. Definitely best day of our Antalya holiday so far...."
Awesome Fun,"Organised via our Thomson Rep, we had an amazing day at the canyon followed by a jeep safari. Took around hour and half from our hotel on Lara beach with couple of pick-ups en-route. Stops at a local mosque, followed by the canyon rafting (ours was with ""Air Raft""), a lovely fresh lunch and jeep safari in the afternoon. Don't worry its not the white water you see in the movies, I would call it a little choppy with most of the splashing coming from the oar fights you have with other boats. For the warm bodied like me, the water seemed freezing, but you do strangely get used to it especially if you jump off the platform. Watch out if you buy the DVD/Photo CD, we did and neither work, luckily we had our own footage from a action camera. Take lots of small notes for tips, drinks were not included in the trip so either stock up from your all inclusive hotel or you can buy for €2. Enjoy its a great day out."
Rafting along the river in kopralu canyon. Brilliant!,"We did a 2 hour rafting trip as part of an all day trip, combined with jeep safari.This was an excellent day, not to be missed. Excellent instructor/guide on the raft meant we safely navigated our 16 person boat through a series of white water Rapids along this breathtakingly beautiful river in the Antalya province. There were several opportunities to cool off along the way by jumping into the alpine water, I chucked myself over the side. Getting back in the boat is a little more difficult! You will see the mountains and countryside and it is so much fun. Great times. We went with our 9 year old and she loved it. There were 2 non swimmers in our group who joined the rest of us in some body rafting. You jump off the rocks and are carried in the current downstream. You wear life jackets, it is safe."
Fantastic Day,"Just come back from a day down the Koprulu Canyon Rafting experience. It was a fantastic day! Amazing views going down the river, numerous times the raft guide stopped for us to jump in the crystal clear (Freezing!) water! Couple of bits of advice, bring some fitted footwear and some change of clothes for the trip, it's 3 euros to rent some rafting shoes otherwise."
wonderful place,the rafting in the river was a great experience . you never get bored of it . the landscape is amazing ; forests and mountains and a clear blue sky. I loved when I got cooled because of the cold water ... the guide promised us to  fully get wet and we had it .. all in all I will do it again if I have the chance:)
Great memories. Must see place..,You must visit this place for rafting.I went rafting with my 2 years baby. Its not dangerous and very funny. Water temperature is very cold in June July August September. Water is very clean and You can drink water from river.You can eat fish near the river. Otherwise;Some proffessional divers jumped to the water from Historical bridge of Koprulu Kanyon. MUST SEE PLACE IN ANTALYA.
Fantastic day out,"Really wonderful,everyone who visit Antalya / Side need to try this, well-organized entertainment all day which is acceptable even for smaller children (8 years in our case) .Just be prepared to cold water ...:)"
Amazing experience!,"Going white water rafting was an amazing experience! I stayed out in turkey from the 9th-23rd July at Pegasus world between Side and Manavagat and decided to do some of the activities in the area. The journey lasted all day, we got the bus at 8:30 arrived down there about 10 as had to pick other people up from different hotels. Free lunch was included and you could buy plenty of drinks there if needed. Top tip- book online as at my hotel Thompson charged £49 and I got it for £16 online, absolute bargain day out! 5 star!"
Amazing experience ,"Everything was great and the trip was full of funFood is v simple but very deliciousGuide was very helpful and friendlyTrip is suitable for families with childrenThe transportation to and from the river was on time but the bus wasn't comfortable and very tiny seats, its a long way to reach the river and we advise to have better transportation In all i would go rafting again and again and again!Im in luv with it"
Rafting trip at koprulu antalya,"The trip was so nice, it was the highlight of  our antalya trip, the kids had a blast.The water was freezing cold and swimming in it will make ur blood flow.The captain of our boat was nice and funny and we had great time.The rafting  trip took around 9 hours with around 3 hours of actual rafting, the adventure  is suitable  for kids as they r put in the middle and are safe.The only draw back is the bus trip from and to the river, the bus seat are so close  to each other to accommodate more passengers and is so uncomfortable taking into consideration that the trip takes around 1 and a half hour.If you go to antalya you MUST go rafting."
Amazing,"Loved it, could hav don this every day of our holiday. Raftin was great, will def do it again. Beautiful place"
"Fun, joy and lots of laughs we loved it","I loved my trip with Air Raft, was arranged by our travel agent and was a day trip to include also Jeep Safari and all the rafting equipment, also wetsuit and lunch. All for 79 euro. Fo the DVD another 20 euro, was not mandatory but I am so glad I have it - is the best memory we have, includes our jeep safari experience, some games before lunch and the rafting. Plus pictures, we loved it don't miss it. We got really wet right from the start but didn't felt cold thanks to the wetsuits (take one to really fit you, not to be large). We make some river battles with other boats and had the time of our lives. We even jumped in the river from one platform when we made a break. Ugly recommend if I will come to Antalya again for sure will try this once again.Tip: if you make the trip with Air Raft, from the captains, just to know: Omer is very calm and only takes you a few times close to a rock which is amazing, Jay loves to share impressions about history and show you the area, the mountains, etc and Abdullah, the youngest is to be followed by adrenaline seekers as he made all his team jump in the river more than once (he also took them out of the water, sometimes two at the same time). Everybody loved the experience :)"
Mustsee,During visiting Antalya one of The best place to see.If you are intetested in rafting definitely you should go There for adrenalin
Nice views,Bit dissapointed as our trip was ruined by 2 salesman literally having a fight over who got to sell us a boat trip so after only 5 minutes we jumped in the car and left. The rafting looked fun but nothing special. Glad we came and had a look but we didn't think it was anything particular special.
The best part of the trip to Turkey,"Highly recommend! we only regret we didnt go with rafting option. Convenient location (only 1 hour drive from Kemer). it was really hot out that day, but we didnt even feel it."
Was lovely trip until a salesman pounced!,"Like most of Turkey the salesmen really spoil it for the tourists!we were driving and exploring the area in our car then a bloody salesman stopped us. He was a young man on a motor bike pretending to be working in the National park and was trying to sell a guided tour of 4 hours, told him we didn't have that much time as we  had to get back... but like most of these pig headed Turkish salesmen there, he just wont bug off -  real pests! There are a lot of rafting businesses on this river and same number of restaurants. We had lunch in one, were presented with a small fish cooked in banana leaves, a small portion of chicken cubes and a plate of chips - Bill came to £40! yet again rip off the stupid tourists approach... We ended up with food poisoning as an extra!"
Rafting at Köprülü Kanyon.,Awsom place if you are in the area this is a must. There are tour companies and they organise the rafting groups.  I've done few raftings  but I enjoyed this one very much.
Rafting - Great day but beware of DVD con,"The rafting with Prestige was awesome. Although the 2 hour transfer from Titreyengol, with toilet breaks, may not be for some. The guide was fab and made sure that he involved all guests on the raft, including my 9 year old son who was too young to have a paddle. The experience was great but BEWARE DO NOT BUY THE DVD for 20 Euros, it is empty! Hence the bad review"
great fun for all the family,"Really well organised , our guide Mustafa was very engaging and mixed excitement with fun. He was clearly very experienced.   Be warned -  you will go in the river , several times!  And it is cold.  Kids have to be over 15 to sit on the outside and paddle -  this is to keep the safe from being thrown out on The rapid sections.  Lots of opportunities to ""fall in"" or jump from diving platforms at the rest stops.Best to have closed toe shoes or trainer. Don't forget some money for photos, drinks etc. Enjoy it!"
Expect for adventure!,"Koprulu Canyon is a great river for rafting in Antalya. Flow rate is proper nearly during all the year. You can buy a rafting tour from anywhere in the city, hotel transfer and lunch is included. We gave 30$ per person in summer season! First enjoy the group rafting! Expect for the adventure! If you are not good with cold water jokes, than don't go on! Because there severe water wars with the other boats, there some ""pirate"" instructors who jump one boat to other and choose a victim to throw the river! Of course these are all safe! :S But who knows :D After you've experienced group rafting, later you can hire single lane boats which can be used by alone or two people."
the best in the hot summer,"this is activity i like it very much in the hot summer days. even if u are with more friends much fun. last time i take my son (8 years old) with me also he like it very much. nature, cold&wild water...."
Great outdoors activity ,"I went here with my family for water rafting, the canyon is beautiful and the water is amazing and ice cold, lively swimming and stops along the rafting, and at the end great food is waiting for you, we had fish and chicken and watermelon,"
Not just for rafting..,"you will see there Amazing nature,wild river,every type of green colour..İf you dont interest to join for soft rafting tours, it is still best option spending a day outside with beautiful view"
It is a must do trip,We didnt plan for thst tour yet it was wonderful the scenery is magnificent and we did rafting for 14 km but we stopped for lunch in between the water was very cold and the safe guard try to throw me from the boat he it is their way of joking we enjoyed very much and we bought our picture and cd for 50 lira i showed them to everybody
Earth paradise,I and my wife go there for three times. We refull our life energy back which exhausted in citylife. we take our friends there and they said that is the best vacation. and also beşkonak residents are the most hospitable people ever seen.
Colourful Köprülü Kanyon,"Then things got very dramatic as the river and the road go through a narrow canyon.  The road hugs a cliff then crosses a beautiful stone arched bridge 27 m above the gorgeous green river. But wait the sign says this was built by the Romans in 2nd Century CE!  Wow, and it still supports cars after almost 2000 years.  Köprü means bridge, so clearly this was an engineering feat even in its time. www.terraencounters.blogspot.comTips: Rent a car and stop at least two viewpoints: (1) the narrow pull-off on a hill overlooking the river just before the first river rafting place (2) near the bridge to walk on the stone stairs downwards or climb the rocks near the bridge for dramatic views over the green canyon."
Breathtaking,"While the canyon is a favorite for rafting,  we did not do this.  We did see rafters,  but we went for the views and the Roman Bridge.  But turns out there are 2 bridges.  One you drive over and another you see from water level, the bonus bridge. It was such beautiful scenery,  lots of nature,  including a herd of goats crossing the road. If the bridges could talk, the stories  they would tell. There are a few tea cafes set up at the lower level,  as well as a restaurant  or 2 that cater to the rafters."
A Great Experience,"If you have a chance to go rafting or canoeing in Koprulu Canyon, then don't miss it! We took the canoes instead of the raft. We were provided life jacket, helmet, wetsuits and we asked for the normal paddles for canoes. We were the only ones with the wetsuits (we saw groups of people from other organisers with only bikinis and board shorts on). We were glad we had the wetsuits! The water was cold! The scenery was really beautiful. The car ride took less than an hour from our hotel in Belek. If you've never tried canoeing before, rafting will be safer for you. We followed the guide on the raft (some people in our group chose rafting instead) and yes, we splashed the water at one another. That was part of the fun. Lunch was included. The organiser we've used was X Dream Adventure. We were happy with the services, these guys know what they're doing."
Alanya Rafting,"First of all, you should know that wherever you stay in the Alanya area, there is only one rafting place. In my case, it took 3 hours to get there. Upon arriving at the rest stop near the launch point, one of the guides came on and told us we had to wait while he ate breakfast. He later came on and began his spiel as we traveled to the actual launch point. Now, I know he was trying to be entertaining, but I was traveling with my 11-year-old son. All of the ‘humor’ was about sex and the girls losing their bikinis or rafting naked. This was spiced up with the ubiquitous use of profanity. I was not the only one who had kids along, but, as an American, maybe I was more aware of the discomfort of the situation. Had we all been adults, it wouldn’t have mattered much to me.At the launch preparation site, we were given jackets and helmets I had canoed before and done a long white water trip as well. I asked for a “kayak” (which was actually more like a rubber canoe) for my son and I. I thought the 8 person rafts to be more on the order of riding a sofa down the river. However, they refused to give me a normal paddle, insisting that I use the double-ended kayak paddle which I was totally unfamiliar with. Nonetheless, I was pushed onto the river with no recourse. Now, if you’re expecting a quiet trip through a natural area, forget it. There were hundreds of rafts and ‘kayaks’ at the launch site. Guides began yelling at me to go and then to not go as I tried to figure out how to use the kayak paddle. The first rapid you go over is right at the beginning. It is the most difficult rapid on the river and is called ‘the waterfall’ for good reason. With the new paddle and a son who had never been on a canoe in any river before, I barely survived it. I then realized that I had one goal: to survive going down this river without causing any harm to my son. It no longer seemed like a fun trip. After the waterfall, you are corralled onto a beach and told to follow your guide. You are then commanded to stand in a line, holding onto the life jacket of the person in front of you. I finally realized this is for the $35 cd they will try to sell you at the end of the trip. All the while, the guide kept yelling at us to “shake your ...”. None of us did. We were then led to a small waterfall where our pictures were taken, yes, to be sold to you later for $10. Then we were told to hold onto the life jackets of the person in front of us and told to wade through a deep mountain stream. The water was over our heads and I began to see the person in front of me going underwater. I felt my son trying to climb up on my back. I let go of the woman and began to swim to the opposite shore despite the guide yelling at us all not to let go. The water was quite cold and some of us were shivering on the opposite bank. The guide, then, jumped off a bridge into the river to entertain us. Unfortunately, he survived the plunge.Upon the river again, we were continuously screamed at to go faster or slower. You should also realize that the highest form of humor here is to splash other people with water. Whenever I heard the cry, “hey, kayak” from one of the guides, I realized it meant that when I turned I would get a face full of river water with the guide laughing hysterically. As I said, all I wanted to do was to survive the trip with my son. I accepted the fact that I would be routinely hit with water. However, one time when I did not turn my head to the “hey kayak” call, the disgruntled guard struck me over the head with his paddle. That was the last straw and I told him that when we got to shore I would have a few words with him (this is a paraphrase of what I actually said). Realizing that he had overstepped his bounds, he apologized; however, the damage was done. To all women thinking of taking this tour, be forewarned that you will be pushed off the raft at some point. Yes, this is considered as hilarious. The younger and more attractive you are, the more you will be the target for various forms of abuse. At one point you will stop and be told to climb a 3 meter platform and jump in the river, whether you want to or not (don’t forget they are making a cd). If you happen to be an attractive young woman, you will be picked up, carried to the platform, and thrown in. I realize that those traveling in the big rafts will have an entirely different experience as there is really no danger involved, unless you cannot swim when the guide pushes you off the raft. It’s too bad. If you were allowed to travel at your own pace without the guides, this could be an enjoyable experience. As it was, I was happy to be done with it and to get back to my hotel. No, I did not buy the cd."
Awesome Rafting Experience,"This is a beautiful canyon. I booked my trip online. You just have to search Koprulu Canyon Rafting. There will a list for you to choose from. I paid 18 Eur for it.It includes transfer from/to your antalya hotel, rafting activities, lunch. You should try to search around this price range. Antalya is a very hot city during summer. Koprulu River will be a great cool place to hang out and do rafting. Please don't worry about the safety. It is rather safe given the shallow water."
Rafting!,"We went for the first time on a rafting adventure type trip and we rowed for 6 hours or so. It was amazing! The organizers provided us with helmets and all that was needed and the lunch was included. We had some barbeque. The water is crystal clear and warmer than expected. The river is ok for participants of all ages. So, if you want splashes and fun, prepare to get completely wet, but extremely happy. A lovely day!"
amazing rafting experience,"the canyon is beautiful I had an amazing time rafting and canyoning here! the water is so clear and warm and not even salty! it's so picturesque , a great way to spend a day! I would of happily spent longer there though!"
Fantastic Canyon - Great Day Rafting,"The canyon is very scenic - you can enjoy this more if you drive your self rather than just go with the tour bus to the rafting center : It is worth spending time exploring the local area after the rafting trip (they finish at about 3pm.There are many companies that offer rafting - We went with Mega Rafting : the did the day for 45TL including lunch.Most rafting trips leave the centers at about 11-12pm : So if you get to the rafting bases by about 1030-10-45, you should find a company that can take you without bookingWell recommended as an activity."
rafting at koprulu canyon,"this was an extremely thrilling experience. KOPRULU RIVER IS A BEAUTIFUL FAST FLOWING RIVER AND RAFTING ON IT IS AN ONE IN A LIFTIME EXPERIENCE. Guide was there at all times and was English speaking  and it is completely safe for children to go for rafting. children sit in center of boat. adults have to raft on both side of boat. boat falls from height to down into fast flowing uneven river. it was an amazing and breath taking  experience. our travelling from rixos down town hotel Antalya  took  3 hour to reach destination .food was included in package. there are three stations during rafting. on first station we wore life saving jackets and guide gave briefing about whole tour in details. for rafting one has to bring swimming suits, rubber shoe or sandal or jogger. electronics like camera can not be taken with you as water will damage. it would be better it you leave your belongings like passport visa money at hotel or  leave some body at station who take care your belongings and he will be shifted from one station to other by guide provided to you via road(you have to talk about first with guide so he can arrange transport ). there are many photographers who on riverside makes your video and snap shots so try to sit on river side and keep expose your face toward camera side during rafting. in the end of tour on last station pictures and video of your journey during rafting available for sale 20 llra and 50 leera respectively. drinks have to buy for 6 leera each."
Rafting at Koprulu Canyon River,"I booked the rafting tour from dailytoursturkey  . they pick us up from hotel and after drive around 50 min. we arrived to the rafting point. it was a good day out. it was my and my families first rafting experiance. they gave us helmet, life jacket and other security equepmant after their short brief. in the hot summer we made a lot of fun at the köprülü river. at the end of the tour meal was great. lm looking forward to go there again."
Make sure you go rafting whilst visiting the canyon.,"We decided to visit the canyon whilst coming back from Apendos and we were very glad we did, as this ended up being one of the best days of our holiday.On the way its quite funny how reps from the rafting companies keep jumping in front of you for business.Once we had seen the canyon which is beautiful and pristine, we saw many people below rafting so we decided to give it a go. We went with a company called Yayla rafting, the whole trip took three hours and the price included a fish dinner at the end which was great. The reps are right the best way to see the Canyon was to actually be in it. We went as a group of five which included a 6 & 2 year old and we all loved it. The rafting isn't too taxing but the rapids are fun and your rep will stop and give you areas where you can swim (the water is the cleanest, most pristine fresh water you will find). During parts of the rafting you could easily forget you are in Turkey and as the environment is similar to British Columbia. We even stopped at a point where you can climb a tree and jump in the water which was great. Looking back, if you don't do the rafting, driving all that way to see the Canyon isn't really worth it. Overall we took some great photos, saw beautiful views, the kids had a blast and all topped off with a fresh fish dinner looking over the river watching the sunset, and all that for what worked out £20PP!!. If you are the Antalya area it is worth making this trip as you really shouldn't miss it."
Vigorous but Safe!,"We booked this adventure via our Travel Rep for €23pp (two adults). Depending on the location of your hotel, it can be a long drive; apprx 40mins from when you leave Side city, but be sure that the bus will stop for a 15min ""refreshment"" break along the way. Arriving can be a little chaotic as rafters are coming in while others are leaving and you're not given too much instruction on where to go/what to do, but it is well-worth the commotion as it kind of adds to the excitement. Once you have your life jacket, paddle and helmet, you will drive another 10 mins to the launching point where they will sort you into groups of 10 (families are kept together). The beginning starts with a small-medium rapid, which gets the heart pounding! Then you will have some nice quiet pauses, which often leads to a splash war with the other rafters. Then, should you choose to enter the ice-cold water, you can take a little swim. You will soak in some beautiful nature whilst paddling your arms off to the sounds of cheers, laughs and adrenaline filled gasps. I highly recommend bringing some bottled water and sunscreen, as you will be out under the sun for roughly 3-4hrs."
Nice rafting trip on köprülü river,What you surely need to do is an active rafting in the köprülü kanyon. Pictures on the internet more then enough. We had the opportunity to do this with our 6 years olmd son and he loved it. We went with the company NOVARAFT and I must say it was nicely organised. Congrats to the complete team and THX Muzaffer for the great fun in and around the raft!! Next year we will be back...
more than just a boat trip,"The Aqua Rafting attraction in Körpülü Kanyon near Antalya is great for many reasons. Firstly, it gives you quite an adrenaline rush, especially if you choose a two-people boat instead of the big one. It is not too dangerous, but still exciting enough to pass through the most rapid places. Secondly, the nice cool water of mountin rapids is the best thing ever on a hot summer day in Turkey. Also, the instructors are experienced and can be trusted, however, some knowldege of Russian language is usually necessary to communicate. And make sure you are on good terms with the person you get into the two-boat with, because it is a team effort first and foremost. Lunch was included in the price, but you have to pay extra for photographs and video."
Fantastic nature but an obnoxious guide,"We went rafting through Nirvana travels during our stay in Antalya. The canyon and the river together make this place indescribabley beautiful. When you get close to your starting point, you'll see the ancient bridge, the river and the small waterfalls around. These things are great contributors to the beautiful scenery. The driver that took us from Antalya to the rafting area drove like crazy and didn't slow down much when we were driving around the mountains, on very small roads with steep falls on both sides. When we arrived at the rafting area, a company named Dallas rafting took over. You can rent wetsuits for a cheap price if you haven't got your own with you. The lunch is included if you buy this trip from Nirvana travels.The rafting itself was exciting but we didn't like our guide because he made everyone on the boat feel totally unsafe, in a bad way. His name was Mustafa, aka. Alex, so if you're going rafting with him, be ready for some unpleasant experiences. For example, he tried to throw everybody overboard, even though two of the participants in our boat were scared to death. When he was ""calm"", he spent his time threatening us, and said that he was going to throw everyone off the boat. The whole atmosphere at Dallas rafting was just too Macho. In total, we were left with a feeling that the experience was more for show, cameras, video and attitude than of the nature, calm, and learning how to raft."
So wonderfull,"You cant imagine the area. In the mountains, old bridge and picnic place and jumping to hard river. The perfect raft,ng place. and long river for rafting"
Turqoise Waters,"We rented a car and drove into the national park all the way to Selge ! The river is turqoise blue/green, the landscape empty and beautiful and the canyon spectacular! Unfortunately Selge is in a sorry state, but lying on the mountain in solitude without any tourism is a different experience and wonderful!"
Exhilarating drive,"We didn't go rafting as it was late in the season, but the drive on a sunny January day was spectacular.  From the blue water to the breathtaking scenery; a fantastic place.  I was quite apprehensive on the section after the bridge crossing the canyon, but it was well worth the drive."
Enjoy the views,"I didn't go river rafting, but I enjoyed my coach trip to the Canyon.  Beautiful views, ancient bridges, trees, waterfalls, and an excellent trout lunch.  Perfect contrast to the hubbub on the coast."
Koprulu Canyon experience,"River rafting in Koprulu Canyon was an amazing experience, especially if one wishes to enjoy adventure, a dip in the river, rafting and enjoy raw scenic beauty. If I visit Turkey  would not hesitate to get the feel again. The scenery is soothing, the water is crisp blue and one feels the tranquility in the ambience. Recommended if you wish to get high on nature!"
Amazing and a Must Do,"I visited Koprulu Canyon multiple times, and the main reason is river rafting. It would be best described as safe, amazing views, and adventurous. I came across many first timers (including my wife, friends, and tourists) who were reluctant to raft, and I had to provide them with basic advice for better results and experience... My advice is to purchase special rafting shoes (TRY20) and avoid slippers or going barefoot. You could ask the tour bus driver to stop at any shop on your way. Small rocks and pebbles could cause minor injuries. Everyone must wear the floating jacket, although I find it useless because most of the journey you can actually stand while in the water (or if you happened to fall in the water). Most rafting tours provide lunch (dont expect much of quality) and remember the purpose is rafting! You get to jump in the water from 5 meters (only for the brave ones). Water temperature could be between 5 and 9 degrees Celsius in May. Bring some extra clothes and a towel. Dont bring valuables or cameras/electronics. You could leave your bag in the vehicle (generally safe). There are changing rooms available. The entire journey is recorded on video so you might want to buy it at the end. There are also photos taken during your rafting adventure and you get to choose which one to buy. Other activities are also available, trekking, canoe, etc. If you are going to ride a canoe, make sure you are a good (not professional) swimmer and travel in groups."
Beautiful!,"Unlike most reviewers we didn't go rafting, but simply drove around in the car enjoying the lovely scenery. Really recommend doing this trip - very tranquil and scenic. Can only really be done in your own car though."
River Rafting at Koprülü Canyon,"We took a half day trip and paddled in a boat with six other people (8 in total plus guide). We had a lot of fun together, but the water was freezing cold! Anyways we jumped in a couple of times. Our tour guide was fabulous and we had a great time!"
Rafted with Air-Raft,"We booked this trip through our Thomas Cook Rep at our hotel who use a company called AirRaft. It was a brilliant trip rafting through stunning scenery. The guide we had was superb, making everyone feel safe and at ease. We were divided into groups based language - our instructor spoke very good english.  Lunch was included. A change of clothes and shoes is recommended. Thoroughly Recommended!"
A must do trip,"What great fun, 14 km paddling down stream, some rapids but not too serious, great fun having splashing competitions with other boats. Reasonable lunch. About two hours drive from Antalya. One word of advice. Don't buy this of the reps in the hotels. I was quoted £49 by Thomas Cook, £45 by Thompsons, and $45 by a Russian rep. I then spent €2 on the Internet cafe in the hotel, found a travel agent that offered €35,kept on looking and eventually found one of the companies themselves who run the trips on the river. Price? €28 yes that's under half the price that the two British companies were trying to rip me off for. Don't forget there are dozens of businesses up on the River, each with a few RIBS and kayaks, which go downstream together as a fleet. Forget the stories from the reps that their trips are better than others, it's a load of eyewash. Also some of the trips, which seemed to set off basically from the same area, simply go straight downstream. The one we were on however, includes pulling the boat upstream for about 500 m right between the cliffs of the Canyon itself on ropes suspended above the boats, to see a great waterfall before then starting the trip down the stream. Really worthwhile finding a tour that includes that. Overall a great day, you should really try to do this."
It was the worst rafting I did in my life !,"I have booked with (Dallas) company, every thing was very good during paying time . Next day I was surprised with the delay happened .Then when we met at the grouping area they divided the people according to races!!  and In the grouping area they assigned me and two of my friends into boat most of the riders are chIldren. When we asked for changing they ignored us and we just had the worst trip. Generally I will never ever repeat that trip and I don't recommend this agency , if necessary try another company to arrange the trip ."
White water,went white water rafting and fully recommend it if you like thrills and a giggle and don't mind cold water - wonderful scenery
Breathtaking,"We had a great day white water fafting. The mountaing scenery is breathtaking. The price can very so be prepared to haggle. We paid 45TL (£18). This included pick up from hotel and lunch which made it great value. Once in the raft we journey about 15Km down river. Thankfully it's not rapids all the way which gave us a chance to take in the beautiful mountain views. Be warned, the water is very cold. The we're many other inflatable rafts along the route. Be prepared to give and take a soaking from other rafts. There are a few diffrent franchises operating the rafts and although they all provide life jackets and paddles not all of the provide safety helmets."
rafting tour,we had a rafting tour in this great mad riverit was the most amazing experiment in my lifewe made rafting in largeelastic boats in the river and moved over small speedy waterfallsthis was amasing the water temperature was 8 c i strongly advise u ta have the same expirement
Great place to visit and not just for rafting,"A great place to go to and to get into the canyon. It is a long drive but scenic. When you reach the top you can get into a boat and go up the river to the top and climb into the water falls and caves to feel the power of the water, warning it is very cold( like a plunge pool) but great fun. The views are awesome and the free!. The rafting down the river is from many points and is well worth the day out. The river runs all year round but is obviously higher when the winter thaw happens up on the mountains."
Rafting at Koprula with Thomas Cook,"We booked the White Water Rafting trip to Koprula Canyon via Thomas Cook whilst staying at the Perissia Sentido in Side.Overall it was a great day out, making a pleasant change to the beach and pool. My 16 and 12 year old children also enjoyed it, although I was expecting it to be more exhilarating, as there were only a few places where it was really 'white water'.The rep selling the tour said that the coach journey there was an hour - it actually took two hours with all pick - ups. It was on time, arriving at 8:30 and dropping us back at 16:30.The rafting company Captain, Mwatch from Airraft, was very good with us, giving a safety briefing when we arrived and kitting us out with helmets and life jackets. Then it was into the rafts, about 10 people in each and off we went. The scenery is fantastic along the way, and there is plenty of time to look around as you paddle between white water sections. After about 45 mins we stopped for a rest and swim in the cold spring water, then on for a further 30 min and we stopped for lunch.Lunch was average for the price we paid, it was included in the trip price, but drinks were extra. A further hours paddling and another break for a swim bought us to the end, which seemed to come far too quickly. After getting changed we were shown photos and a DVD that had been taken by a photographer at various points along the route. We didn't buy either.In summary it is a great day out for a family, but not an adrenalin junkie. At £45 through Thomas Cook it also seemed expense for what it was, I am sure with some shopping around it can be found cheaper."
rafting,"I did rafting at koprulu, the scenery is beautiful and rafting experience was mixture of action, adventure and sight seeing. I would recommend it to everyone traveling to antalya"
adventurous day out,"we booked from a travel agency €25.00 per person, bustrip and bbq-lunch included.the travel agent asked for €35.00 per person, but when i told him i had the same trip in 2011 for €25.00 pp the price dropped immediately...the trip from kaleiçi to the canyon takes about 90 minutes.the rafting is not dangerous and is suitable for adults and children and takes about 3 hours, but there are two drink and eat stops. beware:beer and soft drinks are very very expensive !afterwards you can buy photos and a dvd."
Great day on a hot day,"Fantastic day on a hot day. A tour organized by Nirvana travel agency cost us 25 EUR/person including transfer, lunch and rafting :) Lots of fun. Rafting was an easy one :) The river is not a wild one :) but still the boat did a few nice jumps:) There are a few stops during rafting- one for jumping from the rock, one for swimming in the river and one for lunch. really nice trip on a hot day."
White Water Rafting - Awesome!!!,"We arranged a trip to do the white water rafting with a small travel shop within Kaleici. We paid 25Eur for this and it was the best money spent all holiday! We were picked up at exactly the time said, provided lunch (very nice) and all the necessary equipment. Not for the fainthearted but brilliant fun!!!!!!!"
Good fun,"I also booked this trip through Thomas Cook.  I had the same positive experience as many did.  The life jackets & helmets were provided & used.  Water socks or shoes are best, because you need to secure your feet in the raft & these types of shoes hold you in best without rubbing the tops of your feet.  The meal is simple but tasty."
Rafting - very thrilling experience,"I participated with my family (5pax) for a half day rafting and it was amazing.  It was our first experience with rafting and it was great.  The water was freezing, I recken it must have been around 10 degrees, having said that, we couldn't resist the thrill.  Few things I disliked, the quality of the food served for lunch, prices for drinks very expensive, price for the photos and video also very expensive.  They know that the tourists are found of keeping pics of the trip.  Anyways, definitely will do it again."
Copper Koprulu,"Well worth a visit. For the adventurous, there's a hairy hike upriver from the bridge. For the less able, the view at the Roman bridge is fine, and there is a nice resting spot at the lower Roman bridge, and a restaurant a little further downstream. Finding a suitable way to get upstream proved impossible. I'm sure this is a ploy by the locals to ensure that one local can guide you for a small fee. I don't blame them for this, but having been led 50 yards or so upstream and then insisting that we did not want to be guided further, it proved difficult to shed our local lad. Eventually he relented, but only after a 5TL payoff. The route is by no means easy, and there is much scrambling. There are only glimpses of the river for long stretches, and there are no safety barriers. But it's worth the effort. The river was in full spate in May, and as with the Aksu Cay and Manavgat Cay, the rivers are full of silt. This gives them that lovely green coppery, verdigris, colouration. The upper falls are a large rapid rather than a waterfall, but that doesn't detract from the scenery. Next time, I'll go rafting, which, sadly, a torn back muscle prevented this time. There are restaurants near the Roman bridge for bites and drinks."
rafting,had a great day rafting but i organised mine before i left home via the internet and got it a lot cheaper than those who did so when they arrived
The Best Rafting Parcure Level 3-4,"I was there for 3 times. This time flow is so well. So much cold cold and cold. I advice it to children, families and adults."
Rafting,Rafting in Koprulu canyon was nice. however I preferred more thrill and danger. It was very safe rafting.
Not the experience I expected.,"We are a family of five (2 teenage boys) and i wasn't content that my son wasn't able to participate.  We paid for him but when we got there, one of the instructors took his oar and seated him in the middle of the boat and when I protested and asked about him joining in - I was ignored :-("
Fabulous for White Water Rafting,Great day out for white water rafting here or just to take a picnic and marvel at the vıews away from the beach scene.
Koprulu,I went walking in this area and scenery beautiful. Lots of swimming areas for when you get hot but mainly used by whitewater rafters.
Well worth the hitch-hike,I stayed at the Eko Motel which is fairly basic but a nice location right by the river.  Meals were small and not very exciting.  I ended up hitching which seemed to be the only option when the bus dropped me off at the turn-off for Beskonak.  The weather was very wet while I was there and the river flooded out the motel's restaurant area.  The canyon itself is amazing with a narrow roman bridge across it at the far end of town.  It's a very pleasant 11km uphill walk to Selge passing 'fairy chimneys' - not in the same league as Cappadocia -  and a cedar forest.  You may not meet many other travellers there although I should add that I was there at the end of the tourist season so it may well be a lot busier in summer.
Oh mamma miaa!,"One of the best activity to do! Definiyely should do! İ come to antalya every summer and rafting didnt seemed an attractive activity to me but when i did i reaaly enjoyed a lot! Beatiful landscape, and it s reaaly fun ! :) i ll take all my friends there! İt s 4 every age! PLEASE DO! Also very cheap for all day activity, included delicious Turkish food!!!"
we did a great rafting day there,"we did a great rafting day there,marvelous views ,a day cannt be forgotton."
Fantastic day out,"Booked with Thomas Cook for the white water rafting, enjoyed every minute of it.  The instructors would good fun and we felt safe after their instruction.  All were given life jackets and helmets.  The lunch which was included  was fine, I did wear flip flops but not ideal, trainers or water shoes are a better option.  We did purchase a photo and DVD at the end as a good keepsake of the day but there was no pressure to buy so up to the individual.  Great value for money and good fun even if you have children."
fntastic,"We went rafting, having booked it though Thomas Cook.  They took us with Air Raft.  It was absolutely fantastic, we had a leader in our boat called Mustafa and we felt safe straight away.  I was quite apprehensive beforehand but even by the time we went on the first rapids I knew it would be fine.  Fantastic trip really enjoyed by all 4 of us.  Would definitely do it again."
"Best day of our holiday, don't miss this!","We stayed for 2 weeks at the WoW Topkapi Palace on Lara Beach, Antalya. The best day of the holiday was when we went white water rafting in this beautiful canyon, and National Park, Koprulu. We would have gone back again. We rafted with some really funny, wacky instructors, with whom we felt very safe. Our 11 year old twins found it fantastic, and so did we! Day well  divided into brief training, information, rest stops and good lunch with clean loo facilities. We thoroughly recommend it. We felt we'd really achieved something by the end."
Rafting Köprulu river - amazing experience!,"What a perfect way to spend the hot day - rafting in a cool water. A definetly must to everyone, the scenery is absolutely beautiful and rafting is so much fun. The best day of my holiday! The guides of Ideal Rafting were so nice and funny and they made our day unforgettable :)There are numerous travel agencies in Alanya and in Side who take you to rafting. Bus will pick you and drop you off to your hotel. Well worth the money paid!"
Amazing!,"for unknown reasons, I didnt see any old bridge!lol ... The rafting part was very exciting and i really enjoyed it ... remmeber not to wear alot of cloths! ... although they let you leave your clothes at the transfer car but it is recommended to go there with the least required clothes because you will get wet a lot! ... take some money in order to buy the pics and videos they will sell after rafting is over ... never ever forget to bargain because there is no fixed price ! ... they gave us special kind of shoes for rafting and also life jackets and a helmet ... although it is very safe activity but i recommend you to take care of your children ... our guide in boat were very busy flirting with two russian chicks that he almost forgot about two children and their father swimming ! because there are special parts where you are allowed to get out of the boat and swim but he forgot to get them back ontime! fortunately nothing bad happened! ... you need to know just a litlle about swimming because there is possibilty of falling into the water ... and it is really fun! the water is very clean and very cold! ... this is the only thing that I would like to do again if back in Antalay again ... really enjoyed it ... dont forget to soak in Sunscreen creams before going if you are traveling there at hot season ... and it is a rather long way from Antalya almost 1:30 - 2 hours ..."
Awesome white water rafting Koprulu Canyon!,"On a cruise stop in Antalya, we decided to forgo visiting ruins and instead opted for a white water rafting trip of Koprulu Canyon.  What an amazing day!  The water was as blue as the sky and refreshingly cold.  Our rafting company was spectacular and the fun part:  we were the only Americans!   Most of the vacationers were from Germany, Russia, Poland.  We luckily met a wonderful family of 6 from Scotland with whom my husband and I shared a raft.  We had a blast!  Our Turkish guide, John, spoke excellent English.  The other rafters were also grouped with guides who could speak Polish, Russian, German, etc.  They loved that we had come all the way from America to raft the Koprulu Canyon.  We were on a cruise that had added Antalya to their itinerary for the first time.  I had looked up Antalya before leaving the states and found out about the rafting trip beforehand. They sent a private vehicle to the ship's port to pick us up and drive us the 1 1/2 hour distance to the canyon.  We waited for the other guests who were being picked up from their respective hotels to arrive.  In all there were about 40 guests from all over Europe. After a brief introduction to rafting, we were fitted with helmets, life jackets and given our oars.  We were then driven to the start point where we first were encouraged to get into the water and pose for a picture with a small waterfall behind us!  Beautiful. The water was cold but pleasant on a very hot June 23 day. Then we got into our rafts.  Our guide, John, was so much fun.  He really made sure we all were enjoying ourselves.  The class of river went from 1-3 in places, so a very easy river for beginners and families. After about an hour down river, we stopped for time to swim and also buy a turkish cheese pastry and soda.We then got back in the raft for another hour.  Our next stop was for lunch which was buffet style and included grilled chicken shish kebob, couscous, pasta, salad and bread.  Soft drinks and beer were extra.  After lunch it was back into the river for another 30 minutes.  Members of Neva Raft took pictures of the rafts as we went over rapids and at the lunch stop we could jump into the river as well and have pictures taken. They also video taped the trip.  At the end of the tour, pictures were posted on the board and could be purchased for 2 Euros each.  They then played the video which you could also buy.  We needed to get back to the ship by 6:00, so we didn't stay to watch the video.  Our new friends from Scotland did and they are going to send us a copy.  Our driver, who had waited for us, drove us back to the ship's port.  The total cost for the day?  145 Euros!!!  I highly recommend this activity and would love to hear from others who do go!"
Amazing dingy ride through the canyon,"Definitely worth seeing. All the better if you are willing to part with 50 euros (just us 4 in the dingy with one guide and two helpers) to get one of the locals to take you on a dingy into the canyon to see the waterfalls that are fed by spring water. It was a good break from the hot day and since we went around 5pm, the weather was perfect and the tourist buses and crowds have already left. The young chap who was our guide spoke pretty good English and I understand he doesn't always work there. He helped us get past the narrow bridge (a 2000 year old structure partially restored from Roman times) with our car. He also helped us take pictures and stopped us at one of the waterfalls during the ride where we could take a closer look at a cave and taste the very cool spring water. Definitely a much more worthwhile sight than the tourist traps in the cities. Enroute, you will get glimpses of the villages in the mountains and if you are up for rafting, there are stops along the way for you to try it out."
What a great day out.... get there in a car if you can!!,"We had a car so made the most of it. We sorted our own rafting out when we got there from one of the restaurants just before the roman bridge (20TL each) We then went in search of Selge. Cross the Roman Bridge (which is a bit of a squeeze)... the road is spectacular, if a bit scarey. The sign posts to Selge are poor  ( to say the least) and its not one of the best sights I've been to."
wonderful place,"We stayed in Koprulu Canyon in June 09 - we stayed in the perge pansiyon in a little log cabin - which was brand new complete with ensuite bathroom!  We were fortunate enough to ask them about rafting and they put us in touch with a local guide Adem, who took us rafting - in the afternoon he took us to see more of the canyon - we visited selge (his father in law lives in a house at the bottom of the ampitheatre! ) and then to various view points and finally to the swim/hike along a canyon. We had a  brilliant day, our guide Adem clearly loves his country and knows the area inside out ( apparently he is a local guide for a number of welknown adventure holiday companies) . I could have spent a week in this area trecking and generally enjoying the scenery. If you visit Turkey this area is a must."
A great way to cool off with stunning views !!!!,"Yesterday we took a cultural family trip to visit the sites east of Antalya. After visiting Aspendos we continued to our next destination of Koprulu Canyon which was 37 km off the main Antalya -Side highway. Offically it is called Köprülü Canyon National Park and is in the mountains 49km northeast of Antalya. The road was good, a bit narrow at times and very curvy. As we approached along the road we started to noticed a few small hotels or pansiyons, fish restaurants with decks jutting out over the gorge and rafting companies. Rafting is a very popular sport in this area as the waters are perfect and the scenery is very beautiful with rich vegetation. We then came upon the first bridge call the '' Roman stone bridge '' and I was surprized that you could still drive across this bridge allthough very narrow. The bridge was built in the Roman period in the 2nd century A.D and is about 20m long.We parked up top the hill and then made our way down to the river's edge. The water was awesome and even we noticed some areas where spring water was flowing out from cracks and gizers. The water was cold but on a hot summer's day I think it would be very refreshing. There is also a second small bridge called the Insuyu bridge with beautiful bright blue pools of water.The canyon stretches for 14 km along the Kopru River and is 400 meters deep in some places.Other places of interest include the ruins of the Roman city of Selge, 12km away but we did not travel there. If you are travelling around the Antalya area then this would be a great day trip."
SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL!,"Visited Koprulu Canyon October 2005. This place is simply and stunningly beautiful. The small twisitng winding roads up and through the mountains are a force to be reckoned with but all the while you cant help but take in the scenery and the tiny villages going about their daily life.The white water rafting here is very straight forward and suitable for all the family (except teeny weenys ofcourse!) We rafted with a company called Air-Raft and had a really good day out. Their guides are proffessional and your safety always at heart, yet they have a wicked sense of humour. Even if you are not 'into' scenery you cant help but be in awe as you splash your way down the canyon.Go see it, have a great day."
