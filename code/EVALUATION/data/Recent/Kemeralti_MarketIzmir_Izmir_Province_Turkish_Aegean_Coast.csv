A huge market but watch your valuables,"Loads of stalls for clothing, shoes, Jewellery, fish, and anything else you may need. Be careful as there are teams of children out to pick pocket you. Ladies keep your handbags tight, gents leave your watch on the safe and hands on your wallet and phone. Still a busy market and everyone wearing masks which was reassuring. Worth a visit for sure."
Smothered for the start,Absolutely massive bazaar and so easy to get lost especially in the side alleys. Great for shoppers but be prepared to be hassled from the very moment you enter. Very persistent touts who will not take no for an answer. Worth a visit though
Fun to explore,"We spent a bit over an hour wandering through the Keremalti on a cloudy February. It was busy but definitely not crowded. We drove in (which was a bit tricky) and parked near Konak - needed to leave the keys as they pack the cars in and move them about to get in and out.We saw almost no other tourists (or souvenir tat) when we visited - Kemeralti felt like where the locals shop. Prices weren't marked but we didn't any attempt to overcharge us - 10TL for a pack of children's socks, 6TL for tea for two. Only a couple of shopkeepers, spotting us as tourists, tried to tout.Recommended!"
An interesting mix of East and West,"A busy place, full of traditional Oriental and modern shops, sellers of ice cream and freshly squeezed juices, salep and traditional sweets. An experience not to be missed."
Authentic Turkish bazaar,"You can find anything here if you look , although it Is easy to get lost.  The shopkeepers are very helpful and just ask which way the sea is and you can navigate yourself out of the maze.  A smaller version of the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul.  Warning it gets very crowded and extremely hot in Summer. A must see."
Tripadvisor map directions took me to the wrong place,I used your map directions to go to the Kemeralti Market and they took me to a point about two miles uphill from the market.  Check it out.
Never disappoints...,Another fantastic visit...Durunlar for my silk flowers and friendly staff in all shops...definately the place to get a wedding dress. .can't wait for my next visit
Good for shopping. Less cheating than grand bazaar.,"If you are looking for shopping for souvenirs, or chocolates or Turkish tea/coffee, and you have planned for Izmir then instead of buying these things from grand bazaar in Istanbul, buy them here at Kemeralti. Just like any other local bazaar there is always a scope of negotiation and you still need to bargain here but the prices here are much more realistic than grand bazaar.Also, the vendors here do not force you to enter their shops or try their commodity. I found shopping in Kemeralti a much peaceful and pleasant experience than grand bazaar. I simply cannot stop comparing the two. Also, you can find almost everything here. It's huge. There are branded showrooms, great restaurants, small shops for souvenirs and there are dedicated streets for specific type of goods. Like there is a small street with only shops selling shoes. There is a street full of shops selling seafood, one with all the restaurants and so on.Overall you can easily spend 3-4 hours here even if you do not want to shop much.Also, it is at a close proximity to Konak metro and bus station so it is very easily accessible through public transport."
Low prices and various stuff,Dont miss this market .you can buy what ever you want except luxury brands.its live and if you need any kind of scarfs or shawls the prices are REAL BARGAINüëåüëå
Amazing Hidden Place,"Wee stumbled across this indoor market with lots of different shops, jewellery etc. A lovely feeling and always people very helpful. Again close to lots of things"
Sightseeing or Shopping,"If you are interested in busy and historical places Kemeraltƒ± is a must part of the city. Kemeraltƒ±  hides lots of historical stores, church and buildings. Not the best place for shopping but to wolk aroud, discover interesting 'Han' 'mall of old times. treat yourself turkish coffe."
Shopping,Best market in izmir.. U will find everything and i mean everything u want... The problem is u dont know where its begin and where its end.. The prices are good.. But some store try to up the prices and benifits from the tourists so u should be very alert when buying clothes
Bad quality,Many shops didnt have specific prices and they could sell it expensive as much as they want.but the whole market architecture was good
a Bazaar in the city of Izmir,"a very busy bazar , with places to eat , shops or simply  drink a turkish coffee . It is the small version of Orient bazar in Istanbul ."
Not impressive,small market compared to Istanbul‚Äôs. was not impressed by the variety of handcrafts. It is more a place to have lunch as locals do.
Vacation ,"Visited several years, ago great place for shopping can get everything and anything you may need at great prices also plenty of places to eat and drink well worth a visit when in izmir"
Great place to people watch,"The Kemeralti Market is a wonderful mix of sights, sounds and smells. It‚Äôs a great place to experience local foods, music and people. This is a ‚ÄúMust See‚Äù when visiting Izmir for the first time. You can also find great deals on all kinds of merchandise just be ware of the typical tourist traps. If you are really serious about purchasing things, the streets surrounding the market are full of vendors that usually have better prices than the covered market."
FIND WHATEVER YOU NEED,"Kemeralti is in Konak District. It is a long way, miles long I would say. It has many entry points. The streets attached to it are also form part of the market place. It is similar to 'covered bazaar' for those who know it. You can find lots of things at good prices. Moreover, the place hides a good number of local prodcts you cannot find anywhere else. This is specifically true for textile items. The merchants sometimes are grouped like fish market or fruit sellers, though you still can spot a fruit bench in the middle of painting material selling shops!Surely it is worth to visit, but beware it may take all your day.Just limt yourself in time, divide by two then first half go, second half come back to place where you have started."
Decent Turkish market,"We arrived at 11 and it was busy but easy enough to get around. The market offers something from everyone, from your fake designer handbags to local produce. Stalls everywhere so easy to get lost amongst the hustle and bustle. Overall it was a lovely experience with lots to see so make sure you have your walking shoes on."
Put on your walking shoes,"This market has so much to see. You will surely get lost and found in the hours you spend there. I am sure one can get a map of sorts but I couldn't find one! There is a lot of locals shopping here as well as tourists. Make sure to negotiate and many are happy to provide discounts on purchasing more than 1 product. There is a mishmash of different items on sale from spices, to leather. Some items in this market are cheaper than in Istanbul. If you going with kids I suggest you be extra careful only because its so busy and chances of getting lost would be high as one can get distracted with the many items on sale. People in the market ae very friendly, a lot speak English and assist with directions or a specific item you looking for."
A treat to behold !,"A definite must for all that visit Turkey.Allow plenty of time for looking, haggling  and taking in the atmosphere. A unique experience like no other!"
Very wide market,We went walking to this market as it was not much far from our hotel. Uncountable number of shops in narrow streets with a wide variety of goods. No need to mention thousands of people there buying things. Very crowded but exciting visit
Kemeraltƒ± √áar≈üƒ±sƒ± is Izmir‚Äôs fabulous shopping district,"Plenty of shops and stalls selling everything imaginable from herbal teas, to all types of clothes, from souvenirs to household goods to delicate fine gold jewelers to inlaid backgammon boards and smoking pipes to water pipes and many many places to eat delicious foods and desserts. You can easily spend a full day here and not see and experience everything. Well worth many return visits. You will honestly find everything you could possibly want and also find many things you did not know you wanted. A true shoppers delight!"
Worth a half day for shopping,This vazar is worth a half day for shopping during your vacations. Especially clothes and food are worth investigating.
not even similar to kapalicarci in Istanbul,many many shops but for local inetersting with cheap chinese products. really interesting is the small covred market with typical turkish snall shops with souvenirs and kaftans
The flow of life,"The old market of every city is a symbol of the flow of life there.By exploring this place, the tourist becomes familiar with the habits and lifestyle of the people of that city."
Live locally,Very nice local place with a lot of local shops.  Less touristy than Istanbul makes it even better.  Good deals for shopping.  Vendors are less annoying than Istanbul and more honest.
Great place,Have been there many times. Brilliant for rambling around looking for exotic bargains. A must for tourists. Also many places for eating and coffee.
"To all brides , grooms, and guests,worth a plane ride to this market., at half the cost.","When I am in Izmir,the first visit is to the market, as you can get anything, from pencil's to the most beautiful gowns.the only thing is that  after a few hours of delight, I have to head back to my hotel with sore feet, but after a few hours rest, on the go again.Lovely jewellery abounds, and of course the shoes are out of this world. Worth a visit."
lovely place,"very nice place, clean with excellent shops and restaurants. No beggars, none of the Eurotrash you could expect in places on the other side of the middle earth sea."
Real t√ºrk√ºs√º spirit,"You must spend half a daha at that bazaar of ƒ∞zmir. Do some shopping for your family. Nice souvenirs, t√ºrk√ºs√º delight or some jewelery :) Must eat something t√ºrk√ºs√º style like ƒ∞skender kebap, d√∂ner kebap, meat balls or fish at fish market, traditional soups and deserts. Finally drink a cup of turkis coffee at Kƒ±zlaraƒüasƒ± kervansar."
Great market with a variety of things,"I would definitely recommend taking a walk through this market if you visit Konak Square. It is big bustling place. Expect lots of attention and people asking you to take a look at their stall. It definitely had a buzz that my husband and I enjoyed. We were informed by a local market seller that it has as much as 14,000 stalls which means we only scratched the surface! Lots of clothing, handbag and jewellery stalls. It also had a number of mosques in the vicinity which can be visited at the right times."
Lots of hassle and congestion,There are good bargains on textiles and clothing but you will be practically dragged into stores and restaurants and they dont like it when you say no. It‚Äôs like a maze and difficult to navigate and very stuffy and loud. We went twice and I did not like the atmosphere at all.
Disappointed ,"It was too hot, too busy and and too crowded. Prices were not as reasonable as I thought especially for knock offs."
Great stroll around,"fun walk around,very active and buzzing streets filled with shops and eateries..great mix of the old world charm and new age cosmo city culture"
Oldie market stalls with rabbit runs to independent shops.,"Oldie market stalls selling anything from clothes, food, souvenirs oh and puppies! Got some bargains there. Bought clothes, scarves & bags. We went early so not too hot and busy. Didn‚Äôt cost too much via taxi from hotel either, working out at 50p a mile! Be aware their driving isn‚Äôt to UK standard and mobile phones are used constantly whilst driving!Lots of stray cats & dogs too."
A labyrinth of a bustling market,"Wowzers, its like the size of a small town almost, with many shops, people, alleys and god knows what else.There are lots of shops that sell the same thing so its best to look around.  They say you can get lost, you can unkess you have GPS or just follow the main routes.Lots of eat in places and lots of shops accept card payment aswell.People complain its too packed with people, but thats good cos you really would not want to walk there on your own, and if there were few people youd get gripped by almost every shop owner as they fight over your money.Best advice is book at tour with someone who knows the market place."
Kemeralti Market,This was really great but extremely packed with people. Great environment but really busy. Exactly what you would expect from a market
Bazaar,"If you have the stamina, this is a huge market, mostly covered but I think better than the Istanbul Market.You can buy everything here but it's like a maze finding your way round. Places to eat and drink within it too. Easy to locate and well worth a visit but allow minimum one hour to check if out"
Probably the largest open authentic market in Turkey,"This is a large area in the city center - all of it consists of small colorful streets full of shops where you can buy everything. Unlike Kapalƒ± √áar≈üƒ± (The Grand Bazaar) in Istanbul, Kemeraltƒ± is not for tourists but for locals and everyone. This is an open-air bazaar, a labyrinth of narrow curvy streets. It's practically not possible not to get lost in this labyrinth but eventually you get out of the bazaar somehow somewhere. Apart from shops, there are also nice eating places, and I especially like in particular to stop there for a cup of Turkish coffee and Turkish delight."
A fun place to poke around!,"Kemeralti Bazaar is a huge area, with both indoor and outdoor sections. It‚Äôs basically a neighbourhood unto itself, with mosques, food markets, cafes, clothing stores and shoe stores. The curving Anafartalar Avenue forms its main artery, with dozens of colourful little lanes (sokoks) leading off from it. Within the Keremalti area, there are numerous snack bars and shops of every description selling just about anything anyone could want. Vendors are friendly and non-aggressive. You can browse to your heart‚Äôs content without suddenly being set upon by a vendor telling you that the cotton shirt you‚Äôre looking at is made of cotton or that the trousers you‚Äôre looking at are, in fact, trousers. Most of the clothing stalls have nowhere for potential customers to try clothes on and in many cases, items of clothing have no labels on them, so guessing the size/fabric becomes the name of the game. (I got my clothing at a shop along Fevzipa≈üa Blvd., where the items did have size/fabric labels, where I was able to try things on, and where the price of the item was the same price as the same item in the bazaar itself.)There are also several beautiful mosques in Keremalti, my favourites being the Hisar Mosque and the ≈ûadƒ±rvan Mosque (separates reviews). As well, there‚Äôs the enchanting Kƒ±zlaraƒüasƒ± Inn (separate review).Wonderful place to poke around. Morning is better than afternoon. (Far fewer people.)"
Have a wander...,"You can easily spend a whole morning here  and have a delicious lunch for almost nothing which is what I did! There is no need to do a tour just wander around on your own using the three mosques as navigational points. Its fun too!A large number of locals shop here so its an excellent way to people watch and experience authentic local life. You dont have to buy anything but if you do try like I did, you will admire the energy, persistence and industry of the Turkish people. They are also remarkably friendly, helpful and generous. The sights, smells are truly wonderful and for me this is one of the best way to soak up the local way of life. The Agora is also nearby and I did that easily in under an hour and pop back into labryine of soks to have a delicious lunch of meatballs, rice and veg near the Jewish part of the area.Not to be missed, highly recommended."
Afternoon walk ,"Walk along the sea front grab an ice cream and wonder back through the shops. Beautiful, friendly and safe"
Kemeralti Market,Kemeralti Market is not a place to waste time for it.I recommend strongly not to go there unless you want to buy cheap goods with low quality.
Could find almost anything here,We spent a morning here - very Turkish market where you could find almost anything to buy. Also a lot of tourist pieces as well - but then Izmir is a big city with lots of visitors. Good place in the middle for coffee and eats - little stools to sit on at tiny tables - authentic as the locals were there as well. Its how the usual Turkish people live.
It goes on and on and on,"It took us a while to realize we were in it, because it's just a ton of small store fronts.  I think you can buy anything here.  There were some tourist-focussed shops, but also just a lot of what a local would need to shop for.  The salespeople weren't as aggressive (to tourists) as they'd been in Istanbul, for what that's worth."
Kemeralti Market a-MAZE-ing!,"Kemeralti Market is a maze of tiny alleys that connect in different themes... one row is the fish market row, then next is canvas awnings, the next is cotton shops. Beware however, that you can get thoroughly lost in this maze of shops! And do shop around, don't just accept the first price you come across. Compare texture, workmanship and detailing, particularly of clothing. It is all fake, don't believe the shop owners when they tell you that the Nike hoodie is the real thing! But enjoy the banter and take a map and snap up the bargains happily. An early morning visit is best if you want to see the fresh fruit, veg and fish market... the colours are a photographers dream."
Abit confusing and boring ,Most of the shops sell almost the same thing . You can see most of the stuff repeated almost every other five stalls. Nothing exciting but can visit if you wanna kill some time
Turkey Tour,"Thousands of shops, Amazing variety. Superb restaurants. Can purchase anything and everything. Check your prices before you buy. As Prices vary from shop to shop. Turkish delight is 1/5 of the price of the spice market in Istanbul and just as fresh"
Flea market,"Lots of options, from traditional turkish items to copies of original merchandises. Can be crowded on weekends."
Open air GRAND BAZAR,"Many small vendors,  food,  carpets,  local shopping.  Sampling of course.   Near clock tower ( under construction).   Walked around on a rainy day."
"Gorgeous bazaar, with history on each wall","Such a cosy, wonderful, and brilliant place for a bazaar. You need to go to Kizlar Agasi Hani and get overwhelmed with choices of jewellery and enjoy a cup of coffee at Lagora Old Town."
Worthwhile visiting when in Izmir,"Fantastic collection of shops and stalls selling everything from nuts to jewelry, coffee to clothes.  Well worth a visit and not to be missed when in Izmir."
"Don't believe everything, just enjoy","It's absolutely worth to visit, but always think twice, and before you buy anything, check it somewhere else too. Bargening is a must! The crowd is sometimes crazy, keep calm."
You can find anything you need. ,"ƒ∞t is a very large place where you can find thousands of shops. Clothes, bags , any kind of jewellary all you can find in this place. The best price of many items. You can also negotiate for many things."
Nothing to get excited about,"The city doesn't have any remarkable attractions, you need to get outside.The walk (or a run) along the sea is nice, but again - nothing breathtaking."
Typical Turkisch Market,This is a big bazaar! You can find anything that you need for a little price. Please be aware of the hyena's on the market but they are just trying to get you in as a customer and to earn some pocket money. Also all the big designer brands are available for little prices but obiously this is fake. You can buy if you like. This is not my thing but i can imagine if you have kids that this is super good to save some money. You hage good fakes and really cheap fakes so you can choose.
Walking around the old town market,"Had nothing to do on a Saturday noon time and went for a stroll in the old town market, something like a bazaar. Turned our to be very nice. Busy old streets with all sorts of shops, fruit stands, kebab and whatever else one can dream of.We can easily spend a couple of hours there. Very safe."
Time to Bargin!!,"If you love to shop, you‚Äôll love to walk around this market. Be ready to bargin back and forth on price, it‚Äôs customary and expected. Lots of fun..."
Best place ,"Great experience, you can buy traditional stuff or clothes and you able to see the traditional life If you ever visit Izmir , you must go for sure at that market"
Wonderful experience ,"Been there with my son and loved the smell and enjoyed such exceptional experiences at izmir , lovely market great tastes all around you , just leave yourself to the max and get lost between old stores and never old tastes"
Wonderful,A charmous and interesting. Wonderful. I want to back. Very eastern.  Good pricesGood food. Interesting goods
"Colorful, fun, traditional bazaar","If you are visiting Izmir, I highly recommend a visit to Kemeraltƒ± Bazaar. Has been in its current place for many many years, it's a festival of colors, people, flavors and objects. It's a good place to find gifts for yourself or loved ones or do some grocery shopping from the delicacies for sale. Kƒ±zlaraƒüasƒ± Hanƒ± (which used to be an inn, dating back many hundreds of years) is a good spot to have a Turkish coffee and look at some carpets or silver jewelery. As a native of the city, the bazaar is always one of my favorite past times. Remember to taste '≈üambali' desert while you are there.."
not a Must see,"Kemeralti Market is an old Market in Izmir, there are several kind of shops there. clothes, restaurants, bars etc. the prices are from mid-range until highit is not really a Must see for first time visitors to Izmir but it is not a bad idea just to walk in the Market if you are passing there."
"If you are in Izmir, you must visit this open air market place full of culture and traditions",A perfect place for local tastes. A perfect place for photographers. You can buy and taste local tastes. There are a lot of small restaurants and coffees around
Traditional alleyways market,Good place to visit if you are in Izmir.These alleyways are full of shops. You can  find some local cuisine restaurants as well..
"If you have been to Grand Bazaar, don't waste your time","For those who have travelled around Turkey and the Middle East before, there is nothing new/interesting in Kemeralty. It's a place for ""fresh"" tourists."
Nice market,"Nice market if you want to buy some souvenirs, I find shop owners will like you shop at you own pace than Grand Bazzar in Istanbul, good price with better atmosphere, don‚Äôt forget go upstairs for those antiques shops."
Old bazaar,"The oldest and historical place in izmir. There are lots of shops, restaurants, caf√©s and hotels. Some of them nice and old. You should see there when you visit Izmir."
Shopping in Izmir,"Kemeralti is a famous shopping, cafes and restaurants area. It is a great place to be. I had a Turkish Coffee at the oldest Han Kizlaragasi. Recommended..."
A fun day at the bazaar,"The bazaar has been the heart of Izmir for hundreds of years. Although it has changed over the years, still carries touches of the bygone eras. You can find anything from yummy food to fabric, jewellery, towels, coffee ‚òïÔ∏è fortune readings in the bazaar. Kuzlaraƒüasƒ± Hanƒ± is particularly nice. When buy√ºng something, bargain if you can.. it‚Äôs a fun experience! üòä"
Grat Place for shopping,This is a great market with a large variety of shops from Jewelleries to Spices. Very reasonable prices. No fleecing of tourists.
A place to visit!,"An street area market, not far from the Clock Tower square, with plenty of shops offering a significant variety of articles, from jewelry, clothes, bags, etc., etc.‚Ä¶. You can also find lots of small and mid size eateries as well as places where to get a beer or two... When in Izmir, this is a place to visit for sure!..... by the way an smaller version of the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul, in an open sky area!!"
You must see...,"When you visit ƒ∞zmir, first you must see Kemeraltƒ± Bazaar. You can discover many things on narrow streets. Full of ancient buildings. You can shop safely. And also you must visit Kƒ±zlaraƒüasƒ± Han. Full of joy in Kemeraltƒ±."
Around-the -corner surprise,"Stumbled upon the market by pure accident, wondering about after visiting the Clock-Tower. Bargains galore with so much on offer. Mostly fake brand names, but, hey who cares if you can buy 5 fakes for the price of 1 original. Plenty of nooks and crannies offering delicious eats and drinks. It was an unplanned pleasant experience."
Izmir Kemeralti,Kemeralti is the most popular and beatiful market in Izmir. It is also ancient place. You can find whatever you need in this market. All tourist visit Kemeralti Market.
"Fine shopping, but even better food","This place is wonderful more for food than for shopping, even though shopping experience is pretty fine and you can buy some Turkish items like lamps, soaps, coffee, jewelry and hamam towels etc. But food court and neighbouring restaurant offers authentic Turkish cousine at very good prices. If you like meet kebab or fish, bakalva or fresch juice, head to Kemeralti!"
A must see!,"Kemeralti is a lively, inspiring market where you can find anything you can imagine, from mounds of spices and Lokum to brass mosque fittings. It‚Äôs a place to be happily lost for a whole day if you have the time. My friend who is an Izmir native still gets lost in the market, but for visitors and locals, just ask directions and someone will help you find your way. You need to see the karavansaray, the covered market filled with artisans and handicrafts. It‚Äôs near the opening facing Konak Pier and the clock tower. Keep left upon entering the market and watch on your right for the arched entrances to the ancient brick building."
Walking around...,"This is definitely a maze area.  Of you don't pay attention,  you will get disoriented very easily.  It wasn't as crowded as this past summer which was nice.  An area worth visiting."
Mrs,"Something for everyoneI could spend days here!Easy to get lost in the many alleys, but that just adds to the fun. Take an empty bag or two, you'll surely need it!"
All and everything,"Visiting Kemeraltƒ± Bazaar is a MUST in Izmir. Located between Konak and Alsancak, the Basar can easily reached by public transportation (Metro or Trambay). Interesting place at any time of the day/evening, huge and often crowded. You will find everything what you‚Äôre looking for, even things you didn‚Äôt know you were looking for. Be careful of ‚Äòfriends‚Äô who can show you everything... and keep an eye on your belongings/bags."
Lovely place. Hard to put in words. ,"The market is almost like a town on its own and once you are in believe me it‚Äôs different world believe it or not it‚Äôs true even for a 5 years old daughter, we just loved the place. Food, shopping, coffee and much more. Very well organised."
Kemeralti a must visit...,"Kemeralti a must visit, while in ƒ∞zmir. It is huge so if visiting be prepared to spend a good part of your day. Kemeralti has the exciting buzz you expect to find in a Turkish bazaar. You can find anything in this market at very reasonable prices. The restaurants there sell authentic Turkish food, again very reasonably priced. Try Tavuk Sis. If you like chicken you‚Äôll love this dish served with lavas bread,pilic rice and delicious fresh salad. If your a shopaholic like me you‚Äôll love Kemeralti!"
Good but...,Couldn't find anything and it is not as friendly to navigate as the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul. I actually think that I lost my time by going there. Good thing is that I had to go through it anyway because I wanted to go to the Agora
"Average market selling average food, clothes and basics",Just the normal market type things wondering around through the streets with people yelling at you to buy something. Nothing special unless you need something.
Authentic market - good local / tourist mix,"I've been to so many markets in Turkey, including Istanbul's Grand Bazaar - this is one of my favourites.  If you're only looking for fake Gucci jeans and handbags, you may be a little disappointed (although you can ferret those things out), but what you will find is a real slice of the Turkish shopping experience.As in many Turkish shopping areas, many of the stalls are grouped thematically - so you find yourself walking through a whole section of fantastically ornate wedding dresses and suits, then in an area of textiles.  You will certainly know when you've found the fish section (which is thankfully away from the dresses - no one wants a fishy wedding dress).There are plenty of clothes - ranging from casual wear, kid's clothes, belts and jeans to occasion wear (check out the sunnet / circumcision party wear), and sequinned slinky sheaths that a Disney villainess would be proud to wear.Also to be found - lots of silver, gold and jewellery shops, electronics, household goods, soaps, souvenirs, spices and cafes.  On the upper level you'll find record shops and fleamarket / antique goods.The most restful place to sit and have a breather is in my opinion the L'Agora Hotel courtyard if you stumble across it.  There's no point me trying to direct you to it - the place is a maze.  The courtyard has a canopy over the top to shield you from the sun, and the stone arched walls around you will give you a respite from the noise for a while (unless they have live musicians in there).Although the market is very busy and crowded, I found people to be very respectful with no pushing and shoving as I've had in some 'locals' markets.  You don't get to much hassle from shop keepers.  There's a fine line between atmospheric banter, and pestering, but this was the right side of that line.Prices are very reasonable, and we didn't feel the need to haggle.  We usually only do that in very touristic areas or if we're buying something in quantity.  Otherwise, I think it can seem a bit rude - you have to go with your instinct.  But mostly this market is for locals and Turkish tourists, so they tend not to over-inflate the prices to start with.It will take you several hours if you want to see everything.  Even then, I doubt you'd manage it.  Even if you don't buy much, it's worth going for the atmosphere."
Shopping,So many shops...so little time. Kemeralti Market is huge. From jewellery to toys to shoes to clothing. Whatever you need can be found here. Great eating places as well with the most friendly staff.
Overcrowded bazaar,I wouldn‚Äôt recommend going in summer beCause I felt myself melting into the tarmac. There is minimum car parking. The multilevel carpark was closed it was overflowing. I drove around for 45 min  couldn‚Äôt find a park. Drove back to the hotel and caught a cab back. People everywhere. You need to bargain it‚Äôs over priced especially when they realise your a tourist. Bargain down at least 1/3 of the price. Best place to eat was Can kebab salon at the carpark entrance side of Kemeralti. Clean authentic and reliable meat. A lot of knock off genuine copy items. Great souvenirs and wide variety of silver and gold jewellery.
Looking for BARGAINS.......‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù,"This Grand Bazaar is very Old and very FAMOUS BAZAAR.You can find any kind of FAKE BRANDS.VERY GOOD FAKES,One to one COPYS.Historical Building and very very very BUSY BAZAAR .If you ever come to IZMIR ,Make sure go to this Bazaar.I can Highly RECOMMENDATION THIS BAZAAR"
If you are visiting Izmir,You MUST see Kemeralti! It is a chaos yes but you will have an unforgettable experience- especially if you are not from Turkey - you will see a lot of local stuff and food and the prices will be unbeatable- your children will be amazed at the stuff being displayed- it will be tiring but fun !
Favourite place in Izmir. Local taste,"6 years ago I was dissapointed with Kemeralti. Now I find it to be my favorite place in Izmir. Just stroll and get lost in the narrow streets, without a map. Its a place for locals. You will hardly see any foreigners. Shoppers do not bother passers by, not even tourists. Visit before 8 pm. Eat at a local restaurant, smoke narguile in one of the tea shops and get a fruit juice or ice cream. If you see a building with narrow alleys and plenty of stalls, go in. Do not miss Kemeralti"
My Kemeralti,It is a shopping Plaza. Very crowded especially during the summer. But the prices are not good like before to me.
Very interesting activity,Lots of small shops both for eating and dressing... try different food tastes... buy inexpensive accessories... strongly recommended
Historical shopping place,It is an amazing historical shopping bazaar that you can find anything at reasonable prices. You can also eat very nice food of all types especially the traditional ones. It is a must-see place in izmir.
A beautiful maze,"Beautiful historic markets full of stuff to buy, you can spend the entire day shopping, have  a lot of restaurant and caffe with different tastes."
shoppers heaven,"prices are very reasonable but bargain you will get get specials,its big and you can spend the entire day shopping"
Great place to shop.,"This bazaar is full of stuff to buy. It has a open air section and a closed historic section by the Hisar Camii. I love shopping in the closed section because of all the silver jewelry I can buy. Remember to not pay the full price for the jewelry. Ask for a discount. If they don't give you a discount, then walk away and go to another vendor. They have authentic Turkish coffee places that you could buy the freshly grounded coffee. Also, there are stores that sell herbs and tea. I have bought a lot of herbal teas for very cheap. They have yummy kebap saloons too. It is a nice place to walk and shop. As always, be safe and go with some one. It would be helpful if you have your phone with gps so you could use the map while walking. That would help for you to not get lost and not repeat the streets you have already been on. I buy lots and lots of things from this bazaar. So I always end up carrying a lot of things with me. Take a big bag with you to stuff the things that you have bought. I always visit this bazaar any time I visit Izmir."
Excellent shopping paradise in Izmir,"good prices very organised spread out into categorieskeep 2-3 days minimum for this marketit has musical instruments, fruits, dry fruits, bags, clothes everythingMost important, do not let anyone carry your bags around, or if you ask anyone for directions it's fine, just do not let them carry your bags around as after they do for a while they will take you to a leather shop and then you will spend your time at the shop when you don't want to buy any leather goods.Just wander around at your own pace the first time and look around, all the goods are categorised into clothes, dry fruits, bags etc, at the start some are a few mixed shops.Topten means wholesale so if you want to buy in 10's then you will get a better price. some shops are strictly Topten."
So So,This market is not particularly spectacular or anything. Thousands of shops selling day to day goods. If you are looking for quirky things then this might not be the place.
Center is dirty Need more cleaning ,Place in nice but need more cleaning with water and soap center of the market where the restaurants and coffee shop located is really dirty
Interesting,"This big maze of shopping store has everything for everyone. From clothing, shoes, linens, at cheap prices."
Reasonable prices fabulous place to visit,You can find everything you want at reasonable prices. It is adventurous to lost in the streets of market while wandering. Lovely place to visit and spend whole day. Fabulous stuff üëç
Must visit place!! ,Forget Marmaris or Ku≈üadasƒ± bargains are here!!! From wedding dresses to designer t shirts. From socks to shoes they have it all!! You can still hustle on price and yes walking away and find somewhere. Worth a visit ignore holiday reps they probably would say otherwise.
Markets to the Max!,"These markets are massive!A huge array of items to buy such as formal wear, sports wear, sunglasses, toys, electronics, hair care products, souvenirs et Suggest you wear comfortable shoes as you will do quite a bit of walking.Highly recommend eating lunch at Haktanƒ±r Pide situated within the markets - it is delicious and has lovely service!"
Best Bazaar in the world,"You can find everything for your budget. Every little thing clothing, little groceries, fresh fish, food shops etc. Center of ƒ∞zmir . Turkey's 3rd biggest city. On the Aegean Shore. Worth visiting."
Too Crowded but nice.  ,"Nice market full with all different kind of shops ( clothing, wedding dress , antiques...etc ). Also there are many restaurants that serve all different kind of Turkish food specially Donner Kebab. It would be good to have a look at it if you are in town. D"
Must see,"We consider Kemeralti Bazaar as one of the best markets in Turkey. Definitely better than Istanbul. Not so big, but you can spend a whole day here if you like.You can find almost everything here. Restaurants, cafes, shops(for all kind of products), closed bazaar, mosque etc. I would really recommend this place when you are in Izmir and would like to have some local experience."
Discover the place ,The place is very nice and features an old character and variety of goods and traditional restaurants where prices are low and medium. The place is generally very nice
Great place to shop!,My wife found a store with nice cotton blouses.  The owners were very helpful.  The whole area was crowded with shoppers.  Most of them locals.  An interesting experience.  We also stopped for Turkish coffee.

Nice stroll with history,"Historical mosques and other views.  Market is quaint, interesting, very local.   Combine with Konak square."
Biggest Izmir Open Market,"I search Kemeralti in turkish language because it has different meaning, but we think Kemeralti means ‚ÄúPassway with Arc‚Äù but as we know some turkish language, Kemer: Means ‚ÄúBelt‚Äù and Alti means: ‚ÄúSix‚Äù and also ‚ÄúBack‚ÄùKemeralti Market is best open market in Izmir and it‚Äôs very nice to visit there..."
Shifty sellers ,"This place is like a maze, i would only go to a few shops near the main entrance that are really reliable and worth going, they dont force you to buy products. Other stores tend to be very insisting. We tried a few clothes but did not buy anything, the owner got very angry and started shouting at us."
Huge place,You can find all sort of things in this big market. It's very easy to get lost from someone wou are with in here. It's like a maze with small shops with everything to buy. You can find also lots of suvenires in this place.
Old turkish bazar,Anazing area with lot if handmade product. To experience old Turkey you have to visit this excelent area. There are many shops around and old houses with traditiona balcony. You can forget turistic map and get lost in the Kemeralty streets.
You can literally buy anything here,"At this bazaar, you can literally buy anything. From herbs to a wedding dress to toys and jewellery. It is visited by tourists but I was there with a local who told me that she always went shopping there.In a certain part of the market you can find a lot of good fresh herbs.Best to bring cash money to this place. Many shops will not accept credit cards."
A lively market with a bit of everything ,"Not far from the Konak ferry terminal.  It‚Äôs fun to walk the small streets and take in the sights and smells. Eventually the market enters a covered bazaar type setting where you can enjoy a tea or coffee in traditional albeit touristy setting, and shop for souvenirs.  There are also various government offices in the area that require visits if you are staying as a resident so handy to have little cafes about for passing time between appointments."
Everything you look for,"This place is quiet big. Baby stuff to wedding dress, everything you look for. And for a 1/3 price of you see in a shopping mall. One end to Alsanchak  to over Izmir museum. Spare around 3-4 hours to walk around. A definite stop if in Izmir."
Best market ,"This i have to rate excellent. Best market, came here from Greece on over to this island! You can haggle here, though it is packed and crowed with tourists they are not as forceful here then other places in Turkey. Found lots of hidden gem restaurants here also, down back alleys they just do the best donor kebabs then most restaurants found myself wandering the strangest parts just for the best foods and you will find if you wander off üíØüíØüëèüèºüëèüèº"
Crowded but nice,The Marcket place has many shops and small cafes - it took us a few hours to walk and browse around - the tea houses were fun and nice
Historical bazaar,"I love the place totally! You can feel the history, anatolian breeze in every part. Easy to find everything cheaper. Afrer 5 o'clock musicians start singing an playing their unique music. The most beautiful wedding gowns, elegant night dresses are here."
from clothing to spices  to hand crafts ..a very colorful  mix of everything,"from clothing to herbs to hand crafts ..a very colorful  mix of everything . The Kemeralti Market is open every day from 08  to  19  hours  and is usually visited by locals only . There are fancy  shops , as well as simple stands. Each area  offers a different topic ; one area just for clothes , one area for food  and little tea houses , one area for hand  craft , one area for laces , buttons , fabrics .. , one area with fish and meat , one area with herbs and spices ."
Enourmous bazar with more goods than you can imagine!,"One of the biggest bazars in Turkey. You need at least couple of hours to visit.Prices are reasonable since it's mostly bazar for locals. You can buy there whatever you want and even beyound. There is many areas where are similar shops like: diy, crafting, vegetables, fish and seafood, jewerelly, butchers, wedding growns, clothes, furnitures, pet shops, traditional handcraft, flea market, and many more. Worth to visit!"
traditional bazar,"not good not bad , for visit the culture of izmir should visit kemeralti market , you can buy very good spice from there and also visit the mosque in the center of market"
Walk,"Little walk along the market. A big number of small shops with non original products. O some jewelry shops. Nothing special,"
Market for everything ,"It was just walking distance to my hotel,  cheap and you could find all what you need there. I advise to have Turkish friend if you decide to buy."
Very busy,"It's nice to stroll around and there are a lot of small shops, but it's very busy and a bot of a tourist place. Don't skip it, it's worth a visit, but it's not my favorite place of town"
Very cheap ,This is a massive street market and bazaar. You must have Turkish coffee at ‚Äú √ñmer Usta‚Äù and have fish at the ‚Äú kemer6‚Äù just by the silver bazaar.
This is Izmir's Rome! A place where all the roads take you there!,Kemeraltƒ± Market is another Izmir must-to-see points. One can find here whatever he/she would like to find!
"""must visit""","Its is a huge complex of stalls in an endless streets., you can find everything from traditional to knock-off goods.Prefer to get lost (im not kidding).Coffee/tea shops inside are 2x the price. Nevertheless,this is a very nice place to experience turkish market."
Clean bazar,The most clean bazar...with friendly people. A lot of shops  and i also smoke the best shisha there. Very cheap clothes.
Family visit,A good market with good shops and goods. Buy whatever you need with fair prices and enjoy your travel in Izmir.
Must visit,You can find anything you thing of here. Endless streets filled with shops. Must visit while coming to Izmir.
A never ending experience,Everytime we are in Izmir we do not miss the opportunity to visit this wonderful place; especially in order to be able a cup of Turkish coffee at Baycigit at Kizlaragasi Hani. If it is summer taste the wonderful ice-cream at Mennan.
Loved this slice of traditional turkey!,"A lovely place to wander & take in the scenery!Lots going on & very busy This place seems to sell everything from spices , rugs, fish & food!Spent a whole morning strolling around & taking in what the locals are doing .Very lively & lots of places near by to eat"
Average,"There are a lot of low priced textile and shoe shopping places. Also a lot of fast food restaurants and cafes.Very crowded, and must have sneakers for walking."
Cheap shopping,"If you are new to Izmir or just a one day stop over you may enjoy Kemeralti. Its always busy and you should be careful with your handbag or wallet etc. Its interesting but, if you want quality clothes, this is not for you. People like the bargins, but are they ? Maybe because you look foreign you may be pestered to buy a Leather Jacket. Traditional Turkisk food and cheap. Its not for everyone but maybe you should not miss it."
It is the largest market in the world.,"It is a historical bazaar which covers the area extending from the cemetery head quarter to Konak Square. During its first years, the bazaar was partly vaulted, with tiled roofs, side streets and a covered bazaar with its archetypes.As it used to be, Kemeraltƒ± Bazaar is the most important shopping center of ƒ∞zmir. Modern business centers, shops, cinemas and cafeterias and streets are alive every hour of the day, and all sorts of shopping can be done. In this indoor and outdoor market, there are ceramics, tile panels, wooden products, tombak, carpets and kilims, all kinds of leather products from traditional Turkish handicrafts.Street salers, kebab restaurants, sherbet sellers, jewelers, fish markets, spice shops, pet markets, furnishings shops, bookstores, stationery, a market that is still attractive, although crowded. You can also find the taste of traditional Turkish cuisine in the narrow streets. The restored historic Kƒ±zlaraƒüasƒ± Inn is one of the most popular meeting places."
Great way to feel the Turkish culture,This is one of the oldest and lagest markets in Izmir.  Wonderful fruits and spices.  The shopping is as terrific.
vibrant clean friendly,it was the cleanest market i ever see in orient (and i have visit many) not so interesting to buy thinks !!  but nice walk and good cafes and restaurants (day and night). friendly people and they dont push you to buy the market close at 8  dont miss it
Roaming around,Just finished roaming around.  Lot of original silver jewelry stores.  Very reasonable prices.  Clean and safe.
Every visitor of Izmir MUST visit also Kemeraltƒ±:))),"Kemeraltƒ± has the atmosphere of every kind of life of Izmir. At the front streets (west part) normal daily life clothing stores are located. Then shoes and again clothing with very convenient prices are found. As you go on walking deeper to the side streets you will see night dresses, gold- silver- old - new jewelry, night gawns, wedding - party gawns. Then different types of spice shops. And a lot more...One must give several hours to savour the atmosphere and the tastes:)))"
Worth Visiting,"The city market of Izmir where you can literally find anything and everything starting off from shawls, gifts, souvenirs, spices, lamps and even gold. The streets are tightly situated and one needs to careful of the pick-pockets etc. However, its a must-see location of the city and is a lifetime experience."
Fascinating and cheap,"This is the ""Bazaar"" of the city, where you can find anything and everything and at the cheapest prices. Good for a stroll plus some shopping, especially for high quality edibles like dried fruit, coffee, nuts and spices. If you also like history and an authentic taste of Turkish culture, I think this is a must-visit. Be careful not to ask to take any pictures of the parrot the guy at the center of the bazaar has, you'll end up ripped off for sure!"
Interesting ,"This market was so big, even though we went there 3 days in a row we still ended up discovering new entrances and exits. We got a lot of good bargains especially with jeans, which we bought for 25tl (¬£6.00)approx."
A surprise in each corner,"The best market that i had the opportunity to visit.Imagine a huge place with lots of tight streets, selling all kinds of stuff. From food to gold.It's a unique experience walk around the whole market. Take one entire day there, and you will not be able to see everything!Very good deals! I recommend to negotiate with the vendors! They always have additional discount, but most part of the shops does not accept credit cards, and the best prices are always in cash.There are some cash exchange places there if you don't have Turkish Lyra."
Very Nice Bazar,"This is an absolute must see when in Izmir and the prices are much cheaper than Istanbul. You will just indulge yourself in the little walkways of the Bazar (local market). Use your bargaining skills, you might get a good deal."
Izmir kemeralti market,"Every visitor should stop here, they have everything - food, clothes, toys, coffee, and more. Gets crowded at times."
Kemeraltƒ± market,KEMERALTI ƒ∞ZMIR ...It is s√ºrely more than a market place with an history of more than a century. There you Wander around the present and past.. You can either have a Cup √∂f Turkish coffee in an √∂ld Turkish coffee house 0r in other world known ones.. You can have a Turkish Milky dessert with your coffee √∂r  a cheese cake √∂r anything similar. You can buy souveniers  √∂r  the most modern Textile goods among numerous shops selling f√∂r men and women at mOST reasonable  prices. It is an open air market where you enjoy the vividly blue Izmir sky when you look up. Market lovers should spare at least half a day in Kemeraltƒ±.  I am s√ºre they wont regret it.
A good place to get rest after window shopping,After visiting kemeralti shopping Mall we go toward this historical place. It was about 20 mins walking
Wow wow,"Went there planning to go for an hour, ended up going for 4 and coming back for more the next day. This place embodies the true essence of turkey. Super cheap and people are super friendly although they dont speak any english.You can find everything there. Must visit if you are in izmir"
Crowded smelly and hot...,There is nothing special here... it is a chaotic bazaar type market with all kinds of traditional and/or niche products being sold next to eachother.
It is 25 of march but Turkey! ,It is a place where you can find anything. Since gold to bags and shoes. It is a nice place to visit and shopping!
Busy and Vibrant,"It was great to see the market- hustle and bustle was really busy. Local produce and the fish market was amazing. We picked out some right clothes bargains at a very busy shop. Seeing as clothes from Zara are made in turkey, my Partner was pleased with the quality. Picked up great Disney stuff for my niece. It was too hot for me to take my phone out only managed a few snaps."
Do not miss this market!,"Right, so there are two reasons why this market gets a 'very good' review instead of an excellent one. First, it is super hot inside the market. I am from Greece and I am used to very warm temperatures but let me tell you this, I almost fainted inside the market (so please bring water and dress accordingly). The second reason is that no one (and I literally mean no one) speaks english. Hand gestures will do the trick (unless you speak greek, which lucky for me, some people did). Other than that you will find so many cool things to buy and eat, so I would definitely recommend visiting the market."
Must visit ,Ancient area with lots of small shops.authentic experience.You can also do reasonably priced stuff from a wide variety of shops around.You can bargain in some shops as well.Try to walk up from the clock tower is my advice
You can buy anything and everything,Every time I come to izmir I go there to buy cheap souvenirs for friends abroad. I also stock presents and during the year I offer them on occasions. Locals shop here too. It's interesting to see the shops. There's food. But I haven't eaten in a restaurant. I drank Turkish coffee. Interesting to see them how they make. I ate delicious shambolie dessert as takeaway near the mosque   As somebody wrote it's a pity that the beautiful old buildings are covered and we can't see. I visited the mosque too.
Traditional market of izmir.,The traditional market as a place to see where you can interact with local people and know the cultural story of the izmir. Nice place to find a souvenirs.
Kemeralti Bazaar,"one of the biggest markets in the area and also one of the oldest. One can find everything in this market from food stuff to gold rings, gifts etc.Plenty of room to bargain , and you must bargain."
A real bazaar - with minimal touristy stuff,"What I appreciate about Kemeraltƒ±¬†Market is that it is the real thing. Locals go there all the time to buy goods, and you will find wonderful historical mosques, hidden synagogues and good food without the polishing of a touristic place (yet). I hope it remains that way! Also, if you look at the map the market is shaped like a horse-shoe - this is because until around 1700 it was a port, and what is the heart of the market today used to be water. You will need many visits until you finally learn how to orient yourself :)"
"Crowded, but full of life!!!","Kemeralti market is full of life. Every shop wants to pull in every passerby. The streets, and structures have stories to tell. You can find anything old and antique here. Visit the historic Hisar Camii (Mosque), and the surrounding restaurants and doner kebap stalls."
Crowded place,"It is a big market, as they call it ""bazar"". You won't escape sellers shouting and inviting you in, but that is the ""shop adververtisement"" in Turkey :) You can buy all kinds of stuff there from food to clothes or some electronic things. You can also eat there, they have very tasty street and cooked food, you should try iskender, drink some tea, sit there in the middle of the noise around. Don't expect clothes to have a very good quality, but oh come on it's only 2 or less euros for some pants or t-shirts. But in places like this you can feel the real Turkey, so go even if you are just looking."
Excellent market,We visited this  open market  and was good .a lot of stores were there as well as a lot of restaurants and cafes .The over all atmosphere were very nice .
A glance,Pretty crowded area. Similar to TahtaKale in Istanbul. Atractive for tourist just to see the daily market life in Turkey or maybe if you are interested dresses for weddings and cocktails.
One of the oldest markets of Izmir,"The Kemeralti market is one of the oldest and most authentic markets of Izmir. Many shops have been there for a very long time. You can find all kinds of things here, from clothes to small gadgets, from specialty dessert shops to other food places. It is near the Konak Square. It is a busy place so it is a good idea to go there early before it gets too crowded."
Bustling hive of shops with hidden gems,Kemeralti is a must when visiting Izmir. There are 100 of little shops and quaint coffee shops in the bazaar. Prices were comparative however bargaining is a must . The bazaar also boasts a number of old mosques . Take time out to enjoy a cup of. Turkish tea in one of the traditional establishments the bazaar has to offer.
Great oriental market with ottoman flair,Nice boutiques with different souvenirs and great shops .Also very Good small Restaurants and Street Caf√©s . Must see place in Izmir.
Historical buildings blocked with trashy clothes and souvenirs,"It is impossible to feel that this is a historical market. Because the nice historical buildings are covered with cheap t-shirts, shoes and thousands of unnecessary selling items. Therefore the atmosphere is just like an ordinary bazaar. Salesmen are trying to catch customers with by calling them. But it becomes really disturbing when you are called 50 times. Last Word: Not recommended. Do not waste your time. Nothing left from history."
Shoes and Clothes,Didn't have time to explore the whole place but it is full of shoes and clothes and shoes and clothes and shoes and clothes. Nice place to shop for these items and maybe have a snack but not much else to it.
Worth going!,I have been there more than 50 times and it is certain that you can find anything you need in that place. First of all there is a perfect place that is called 'Tugba' for traditional turkish delight or other various food kinds. They have special boxes and wrapping papers. In kemeralti there are many places for clothes and also for turkish coffee. So just take your camera and check there!
big market,"Very big place, with cheap things as souvenirs. The negative aspect is that is like a maze and very crowded. You can get lost if you are not paying attention to the streets."
Great adventurous place for authentic Turkish shopping experience ,"Whatever you want and need is in this busy shopping neighborhood. It is a web of multiple shopping streets and neighborhoods. You can easily get lost but it is a good thing because every street will take you to a different adventurous shopping experience. They don't have high end brands and mostly clothing stores but you can find household items as well as foods and groceries as well. Beware of pick pocketing especially on busy weekend day or before the holidays which this place is packed with local shoppers. This is a must see place in Izmir. Food and restaurant selection is great, try to enjoy small restaurants which serves home cooked meals for the workers called ""Esnaf Lokantasi"" ."
Shopping,Big place to shop. Great variety of goods from touristic parts to daily staff. It is vey crowded. Cheap place.
Pleasant Shopping Experiance !!!!!,"I thought I will wonder around this down town market just for fun , what happened ???is  that I turned back to the hotel  carrying a lot of bags , As my visit was in August the weather was hot ,so we decided to try the fresh squeezed juices , I drank about 3 full cup‚Äôs of freshly squeezed pomegranate, other cup of guava juice, and tasted some lime and strawberry juice from my husband , actually delicious!!!Walking through the market you will find  a mass  variety of everything ,fruits and vegetables which you can tasted  before buying ,sweet shops, clothes ,food ,antiques ,souvenirs  ,spices, home appliances , leather bags and goods ,,,,,,the prices are affordable and negotiable, you can get a good deal for leather,,,i bought a lot of stuff from the market ,among which I highly recommend the bath towels ,and the bed sheets ,the used fabrics are a high quality ,very soft and heavy duty.if you have a full day or more in Izmir ,spend two hours there ,,, A must visit"
Crazy place where you can find everything,Big market with many small and bigger shops hidden food gems and Turkish everyday life experiences within a maze of small streets. A must see when you visit Izmir. Watch your bags!
"A lot of shops, no atmosphere","You can find a lot of shops at this area, but nice oriental atmosphere is out already. It is possible to buy so called turkish genuine fakes as copies of well-knowned marks of watches and shoes and dresses."
Good place to shop,"One can find anything at any price in Kemeralti.  If it is not here, it doesn't exist in Turkey.  Warning: at the Kodak entrance you will pass by a army of hackers who volunteer to take you to a shop that sells carpets or leather goods. The other warning is that it is easy to get lost in the labyrinth of streets. Google maps is helpful to know where you are."
Izmir's market labyrinth,"If you visit Izmir and you don't go in Kemeralti is like not being in Izmir. Kemeralti is the bustling pazar of Izmir, with all kinds of shops. Always crowdy there, you definitely need a map or otherwise you may get lost in this labyrinth. You can always use as a landmark the Hisar mosque. If you want to have an idea about old Turkey then you must visit it."
Fascinating,A fascinating busy maze of stalls beyond just the covered market should not be missed. Just wander around and soak up a real Turkish bazaar
Strolling through,"Used to be my favorite place to walk around in Izmir, it has changed tremendously over the years, but still nice shops remain. You may find anything there from food to buttons."
Lots of jewelry,I think there were many more areas in this Bazaar than I had time to visit. I bought two beautiful pieces of jewelry from Martin that are exquisite. It a good market.
Old TIme Fun,"We had a lot of recommendations to visit this bazaar.  There were lots of nooks and crannies: go right-left-straight.  I encourage you just to wander.  You can't really get lost.  There was none of the verbal encouragements you get at the Istanbul Grand Bazaar.  This was a place real people go to shop.  Clothes, jewelry, spices and dried good, wedding and other Muslim religious resources, some leather goods, kitchenware, it's all there.If you want a fancy coffee and pastry shop, this is not the place, just plain old good Turksih baked goods, both sweet and savory."
"Very west, very civilised, outside the normes of Turkey.",Traditional market place with many cultural attractions. Numerous shops with unlimited choices at budget prices. Hardly tries to keep its popularity against big and ugly shopping malls.
Crowded & old,We just stayed for some minutes and then left the area...Because there was nothing interesting or no brilliant shopping centers.
Authentic and Cosy,A historical bazaar with variety options for mainly silver or authentic jewellery and souvenir. Coffee shop in the middle of the courtyard has very tasty turkish coffee. Ask for mastic gum flavour turkish delight with it ( it is complimentary). Definatelly worth to see if you are  a visiter.
Only fun,I have been there many many times over the 3-4 years and I can tell it's full of fun to see street markets and you feel like is endless as you get from clothing to food And jewellery to toys many many different things and food! Must visit if you came to ƒ∞zmir !
Interesting place,"spent almost 2 hour strolling indoor:  saw a lost of shops selling shoes, bags, clothes, scarfs, sweets & nuts and souvenirs.  I prefer the small outdoor shops that sells spices.  Bought a lot of nuts  and spices.  Very, very kind elderly man.  So friendly and kind.  Language is definitely not a problem here:  we are Japanese (family of 4).  Even my normally quiet mother, had a great time 'chatting' with the shop-keeper/owner with gestures."
Real Turkey,"Here you can see and know Turkey people and their habits. It is big area, and too see it you must plan whole day."
Lovely and historical,You can make some shopping there and buy some souvenirs or decoration for home..everything is very cheap.also u cans taste the coffee which they made in the sand.its very tasty.so many cafes with interesting historical interior.
cosmopolitan and live district,"It has an unforgettable experience walking on Kemeraltƒ±. All kind of shops, eating places, coffee shops. One can easily spend 5-6 hours"
Dimestic place,"Many narrow streets with every kind of small shops like food, wearings, handmade products etc. You can see also see some traditional workshops and you can take real Turkish cafe and traditional food called ""sogus"". You will like area i promise:)"
Everything that is typical...,If you want to find anything typical form Turkey to buy has a souvenir or just to consume... here is your spot.
Good ,Such a nice big bazaar everything is cheap you can do bargains üòúüòúüòä there's a lot of shops available
A shoppers paradise...,"Ever since moving to Izmir in 2014 the highlight of my trips to the city centre is always a visit to Kemeralti Market.  Here you can find anything & everything, from perfume stores to shoe cleaners.  There's an abundance of shops to suit your every need.  The Grand Bazaar is very traditional & mainly houses jewellery shops & trinket shops selling ornaments and whatnot.  Next to the Grand Bazaar is a sokak lined with √ßay cafes, sit here & soak up the atmosphere for a true taste of Izmir & life in Turkey.You will also find a number of restaurants dotted around Kemeralti all serving your favourite Turkish dishes."
Having some spare time to shop.,"I already went some days earlier to the market in Istanbul which is inside a building. This one is in normal shops. Ok, they try to sell you something. But the atmosphere was very nice. A bit cold for the time of year and ofcourse I did buy some nice things!"
i lost everytime in kemeralti bazaar,It very fomous open shoping  bazaar in izmir city.You can find many different brand clothes in this bazaar also you can try many different local foods in this location.it is very old location and streets very small and mix.Im losting alltime when i go there.
Interesting place,Lots of shops.  It is a combination of indoor and outdoor shops and restaurants. That part of town is narrow winding streets so it can be a little confusing to find.  The structure is a bit of a maze with multiple openings so it is not necessarily self evident when you come upon it.  It is an old historic facility and a good place to browse.
The Ancient Kemeraltƒ± Bazar,"This is one of the most famous Bazaar in Turkey, yet It's the most one in Izmir. Cheap and resinablw prices for quality things. Just go there and be lost in this bazar. It will be very enjoyable moments!!"
discover the mystery of Kemeraltƒ±..,"Do you know that there are nine synagogues located in Kemeraltƒ±?Do you know that Kemeraltƒ± is one of the oldest trading center comes from the 12th century !There are plenty of historic inn's located. ƒ∞.E.

There is a coffee house on the garden and very nice antique shops on 2nd floor.Have a nice journey.."
well worth getting lost in,"istanbul's grand bazaar this is not, but it is still welll worth getting lost in for half a day. lots of interesting markets, shops, cafes and restaurants."
The place for the best souvenir,"This place is a very funny/scary place in Izmir, could be like a maze with stores, restaurants, cafes and a mosque, you can find all type of souvenirs so you must be ready to negotiate prices"
Paradise 4 photographers,"in the heart of city ,narrow alleys &many shops,tasteful small restaurants,traditional coffee break points,old town especially for photographers,Kizlaragasi Han good for handmade silver arts & gem stones,some antic shops,Smyrna Agora,Havra sokak ,and many more, must see"
Shopping bonanza ,"Great place for shopping and if you like bargaining it's a shopper paradise. Well worth a visit is the central plaza where there are restaurants and cafes galore. Try the kebab cooked on the open wood fire, it's delicious"
Ready to get lost in a labyrinth of treasures in the heart of Izmir?,"You're bound to get lost ‚Äì even locals do ‚Äì but losing your way and coming across unexpected treasures is part of the bazaar's attraction. It's a bazaar stretching from Konak Sq through to the ancient Agora, Kemeraltƒ± dates back to the 17th century and is home to interesting shops, eateries, mosques, coffee-houses, tea gardens, and synagogues. Those who spend a day exploring its crowded and colorful streets, historic places of worship and hidden courtyards will see the real ƒ∞zmir ‚Äì this is a local market that is accurately described as the city's true heart and soul."
Busy Street,"Its quiet huge market, perfect place for shopping almost every product avaible in the market. keep walking the street you find cafe, restaurant and cloths shop etc."
Bazar,"Great small shops, nice coffee shops for Turkish coffee or tea, eat the local kebab and just enjoy the atmosphere.Fantastic area with a lot of options, however look out for cheap Chinese copies."
"A rabbit warren of cheap goods, cheap food, and hyped up hawkers!","Went to the "" famed"" Kemeralti bazaar expecting something a bit like the Grand Bazaar of Istanbul..but boy was I mistaken!Yes, there are streets and alleyways crammed with any and every type of ( cheap) clothing,leather goods, "" jewellry"", ceramics, kitchenware, wedding outfits, mobile phone covers, nuts, spices, soaps, fish mongers and kebap shops, but there is no real charm to the place, and it all seems like just a big outlet for whatever China can't sell at home. Oh yes..and it is also where you can buy imitation designer goods for a pittance. My wife and I made the mistake of stopping into a leather bag shop, where the owner "" Ali"" proudly showed us his wonderful selection of high-quality, ""best-priced"" ""designer"" ( Gucci, YSL, Michael Ford..) hand bags which he made himself. Around the corner were fake Rolex  and Lady Longines watches ..If you have an afternoon to kill, don't mind spending money on imitation goods, or bargaining with the seasoned stall owners, being plied with tea, called "" my friend"" by every stranger wishing to take your money, or being relentlessly pursued by every purveyor trying every trick including guilt to get you to buy something..anything..just name it!, then this is certainly the place to do all that. But, honestly, I would much prefer to shop from reputable dealers on the high-streets where they have price tags and warranties. But the cheap eats were defnitely tasty, hearty, filling and..well..cheap!"
Old Town/ ancestry feel,"it's a must visit, the old town labyrinth like always a great place to get lost in.. follow the smell of spices, food, coffee and tea, from one alley to another, i'm sure you will love it.. (and don't worry you will not get lost!) and get into the closed bazar with all the turkish handcrafts/ delights... i'd go back right now."
1001 night bazar,"Just take a few hours and stroll around this market. There is nothing  what you wouldn't find there. It's the market for the locals, so luckily not to many tourist traps. Lively, busy and great to discover. Worth seeing!"
Disappointed ,"I am afraid but I was rather disappointed about the market: it is true that is large but mainly provide clothing and leather and fabrics.I could hardly find any ""interesting"" (for me) bits as spices and nuts or Itznik pottery or carpets.Lots of original fakes though!Not what I was looking for unfortunately"
Biggest bazaar,"The biggest bazaar in ƒ∞zmir.  At the same time the oldest bazaar too. There are some  historical  places.  Especially Hisar mosque, kƒ±zlaraƒüasƒ± han, √ßakaloƒülu han, Arap han. Etc. Some other mosques and hammams are waiting for your visiting."
So vivid,"You will like it by all means. Don't forget to go to kizlaragasi han to drink some coffee or lemonade. Walk over the whole kemeralti not only on the main streets, you will find evetything in very good prices. You will love people, they are very friendly and nogle"
too many to pick from,"This is an amazing place to do shopping of anything you want from souvenirs, to party dresses, gifts, bedding, food, tailored clothes, personalised blankets, towels, magnets, party doos and invitation cards for weddings done in minutes, wedding dresses, childrens toys and clothes. Literally anything you can possibly think of. You need a lot of energy for this market however can boost your energy by having meal at the center of it. I think Cinaralti was the place I had a doner wrap.  You will easily be pulled in to the restaurants by managers anyway if you look undecided so be warned."
Shopping !,"In the heart of Konak district, the centre of shopping. The distrcit is full of old style shops food courts, shisha houses and cafes. If you want to buy some souvenirs, it is the best place !"
Old historical pazar,This interesting old pazar with a plenty of things to see and buy in a good price .It took me three days to see the whole pazar.
One place for everyone,"You can find everything you want in here. A bar for a drink or a restaurant with special food for lunch and dinner or nargile and coffee, shops for every kind of souvenirs, shops for your daily needs..."
smaller version of the grand bazaar,"I love the small narrow streets that wind their way through the bazaar. While you can find tourist shops selling souvenirs you still find the majority of people being local. It is a place where you can easily get turned around if you can drop a pin where you entered so you can find your way back. Know that if people hear you speak English or another foreign language they might try to take you to some of their friend's shops, just ignore them and keep on walking. Often they get a cut of what you buy and the prices are much higher then they should be. If you buy something that could be classified as  antique make sure you get a certificate from the seller so you won't have any problem taking it out of the country, same goes for rugs. Most of all enjoy being among the Turks drink some tea and check out all the things you can buy there, from t-shirts to wedding dresses and much much more! There are several mosques in this bazaar and on Friday it can be super busy with men attending the mosques and overflowing into the streets."
Old and new style,Its a cobination of old and new style of shoping in that bazar .also all big brands outlets here .and som traditional Turkish things also available here
Experience historical bazaar and visit Kƒ±zlaraƒüasƒ± Hanƒ±,Kemeraltƒ± bazaar is historical bazaar of ƒ∞zmir. You can find whatever you search .. And after shopping you have to go Kƒ±zlaraƒüasƒ± Hanƒ± and enjoy your delicious Turkish Cofee
Open Market Day,"This busy market has been divided into sections: jewelry, fabric, clothes, arts and crafts, restaurants, fish market and much more. It is fun to walk around the street and feel the energy of the city. Many historical buildings are located in this market. Several local restaurants are well known for their home cooked taste."
Disappointing...,"When we were hearing ""Kemeralti"" we were thinking somewhere like Kapalicarsi in Istanbul. No signs for places, too many things at the same place, No clean Toilets!!!!Apart from some historical and religious places, no need to spent time there:)))"
Very tipical market,Its a must go if you visit IzmirmThe time stoped in this streets. The market area is the same for the last 50 years.
Amazing place,Visit this place more than 10 times So beautiful.. from food to clothing you can find everything.. lovely place to go for dinner or breakfast
big bazaar,"you find very few things in this bazaar, but you can see a lot of people and see the life of Izmir citizen.It is a must."
Shopping fun ,"A nice bazaar located in Konak. You can find basically everything here. The atmosphere is nice and even if you don't want to buy anything it is fun just to walk around. I've been to the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul many times and it has, in my opinion, nicer shops. Other than that you will find good deals here as well."
Always interesting,"The Bazaar is fascinating, there is like nothing you don't find, but bring time, keep your belongings under control and keep an eye on where you are, else you get lost. Don't mind the people trying to do business with you, stay friendly, buy what you need only :)"
Nice and friendly market place,"You can make all kind of your souvenir shopping as well as clothes, shoes, accessories .. etc.It may sometimes, especially at the weekends, get very busy but I recommend you not to forget to drink Turkish coffee. Nice and friendly cultural atmosphere with so many ancient mosques around."
"whatever you need, be sure to find in Kemeralti","You need a guide or detailed map of there if you want to make a full discovery. there are many bazaars, specialist markets and shops in which you can find even a pin or a boat. A cool weather is perfect choise."
Should be visit,"Kameraltƒ±,  like bigger main bazaar on the Aegean province. Good quality, tasting turkish coffee, should be check your future from fortuneteller :)) this around."
A Typical Classicial Turkish Bazaar Area,"The Kemerallti Bazaar is located in the District of Konak. If you are in Alsancak/Konak Area, it is wort to visit to the Kemeralti. There are numerous shops and Turkish Caf√©s. The comodities in Kemeralti are generally inexpensive."
A nice old bazaar,It's an old open air bazaar. Very nice old looking.You can find everything to buy for almost good prices.
Lots to see but nothing unusual.,Stallholders would do better if they left you alone to browse- don't want to show any interest because they won't leave you alone.
A picture into the local life,In the evenings there is some or other musician playing by the tower. It is beautifully lit up in the evening. The market gives an insight into the local food habits - from dry fruits to spices.
a delight - shop till you Die,This is a good market in the beautiful city of Izmir in Turkey and one gets the local flavor and can buy genuine Turkish items of all kinds....
Nice to be visited ,"Cultural market with low prices, located in nice district,  perfect for souvenirs and cultural gifts. The market dedicated for baby showers/birthday parties and weddings preparation."
Disappoiting: Mostly junk goods,"We expected way more but sadly you can mostly find junk goods. In our opinion it didn't deserve the good ranking on Tripadvisor. Although it is good for cheap shopping we couldn't really enjoy most of this area. Quality of offered good is quiet bad and the market is lacking on atmosphere because of ist cheap look and crowds of tourists. There are way better markets and Bazars to go to. Only good thing: The Restaurant area is quiet nice, looks more traditional and has some nice options for lunch and dinner."
Good market ,"Great atmosphere. Lots of small shops with ""one of each of everything"". Coasy coffee bars with Turkish tea. Many jewelry stores. A visit worth."
"Reminds of Thessaloniki, Greece","There is a similar, but quite smaller closed market in Thessaloniki, Greece. There are many common features. Overcrowded and full of smells and noises."
Quite a joy,"The grand bazaar of Izmir. A must visit with antiques, textiles, souveniers and great food like kofte, kumru, doner. Mennan is the place for ice cream and desserts. Renovation is underway in the old caravanserails. Busy streets with locals buying costumes and night dresses as well as every day clothing and shoes. Not high street but a real bargain. Authentic and quite a shopping adventure."
Nice shopping area to find authentic Turkish stuff,You can find various things in this bazaar. Anything from spices to gold jewelry to Turkish rugs to clothing. A perfect tourist destination.
A true Turkish experience,"If you visit Izmir, you must visit Kemeralti. The sights, sounds, and smells are a true slice of Turkish life. The numerous streets lined with shops can be confusing, but if you just keep walking, you should be able to find your way back out to the main street. Along the way, you will experience every type of shopping imaginable----leather, carpets, t-shirts, housewares, Turkish delight, tea, spices, cheeses, juices, wedding gowns, toys, souvenirs, etc. If you can't find it here, it does not exist! Make sure to stop at one of the restaurants for doner, and at one of the dessert restaurants for pudding or baklava. Then walk down towards the waterfront for a nice stroll along the harborfront."
COSY AND HISTORICAL,"Kemeraltƒ± Market is smiliar with The Bascarjiska of Sarajevo, it is a street with old  houses and shops of ƒ∞zmir, you can find hear what ever you want, food, souvenirs, Textiles, etc... It begins from WATCH TOWER at Konak squere and ends at ancient ruins of Angora of ƒ∞zmir... Boyh of them should be seen and visited..."
Well...Some gifts for the family from Izmir.,You enter in Kemeralti road...You have all and quite cheap. Attention...No bargain normally but if you buy many things at the same shop...Maybe 10pc discount. See also the sub roads if you have time. From your hotel you may take a bus to Kemeralti & back.
Very interesting,One of the oldest & the largest market I have seen.the traders are very charming & friendly .Highly recommended
Excellent for shopping!,"What I most liked in Kemeralti market was the variety of things to buy. From a simple belt, to diamond jewelery, you can find almost everything there!"
Perfect shopping experience,"Kemeraltƒ± is very old shopping center,you certainly need to trip and buy some traditinoal things.Especially you may eat Turkish Doner Kebap.You'll never forget this experience:)if you like,please vote:)"
Diasappointing,Maze of packed streets with cheap to mediocre goods. Nothing fancy. Good for locals but no comparison to istanbul bazaar. Half hour is more than enough.
Vibrant!,"Very vibrant market, there a lot of shops from low to medium priced goods, from clothes to shoes and more. There are cafes and restaurants in narrow streets offering delicious food. It's a great experience."
One of the oldest intact bazaars in the world,"This traditional Turkish bazar is the star of the city and shouldn't be missed on a visit to Izmir. Much less touristy than the Grand Bazar in Istanbul,this market includes all sorts of goods and will give you an insight into a real working bazar where locals shop.A feast for the senses! Not to be missed!"
Authentic bazaar,It is the local shopping district of Izmir. The narrow roads are full of small shops that you can find anything (anything literally) It is always crowded and may be a little bit hassling for tourists but you will see the middle eastern face of the city in here. You can bargain with the seller about everything. Make sure wearing comfy shoes.
Shopping #shopping and shopping ,One of the best place in izmir for shopping. Make sure you are comfortable in your shoes!! A little tip : don't go in a big group. This place is almost crowded everyday..enjoy your shopping :)
Nice,"I really liked shopping there. You can find different shops that sells clothes, food , accessories, food , and a lot things , i recommend everyone in izmir to visit it."
Great Market watch out for husslers,"We truly enjoyed visiting the market for sure. Its remarkable how many shoppes are in there..we want to say thousands. Which is understandable why the owners and family members try to hussle you to get into THEIR shoppe. After so many fellas not speaking english well we came across Isaac who had perfect english. We were tired and just couldnt find what we were looking for. He did help us and take us to ""his cousins store"". We were not interested in leather goods but once there we had a beer with the owner tried on some jackets, and ended up buying one after much negotiation AND had it altered on the spot before I could finish the Efes! For approx $175 I walked away with a custom tailored lambskin jacket and wallet. Safe the entire time..but felt a little hussled."
"Almost everything you might want or need, it's here!","Having said that, it's not easy NOT to get lost.So many shops selling household items, school supplies, toys,souvenirs, dried fruits and nuts, baharat (spices), fresh ground Turkish coffee, clothing, shoes and more.I literally got lost and ended up in the surrounding outskirts.Brands like De Facto,Rossman,LC Waikiki all have shops here too (blissfully with AC)!Wear comfy shoes,cotton clothing (things that won't cling to you skin) if you plan to come during summer."
Best place,"I think,Kemeraltƒ± Bazaar is must-visit places in ƒ∞zmir. You can find a lot of shops in here. I strongly recommend go to mosque. I'm so enjoying walk around in this place ^^"
You need to get past the standard junk,"This is a large bazaar extending for many blocks.  You have the inside spaces with lots of restaurants.  On the outside you have  many shops.  It is very easy to get lost so make sure you go with someone or have a good sense of direction. I went with someone.  The inside has many stores with a lot of  the usual Turkish gift stuff.  Most of the stores carry the same things. You do need to be careful if you want to by real stones as every shop will tell you that they have real Zultanite stones. That is usually not true. But, for the most part, they are real stones of some sort and are quite beautiful. Make sure you bargain for everything.  If you are going to buy Turkish rugs study hard before you go.  There are a couple of good tutorials on the net. If you are not careful it is very easy to get ripped off. But it was fun and I did find some good things."
"If you want it ,they will have it..","From the smell of fresh produce, to the taste of same !!!! any wildest idea they will bend over backwards to help you get it"
Most distinguishing place of the city,"ƒ∞zmir is not a city to have a taste within a day or a few because there are not many distinguishing places in the city centre. Kemeraltƒ± is the only one if you ask me. So must see location for a tourist. Go directly to Kƒ±zlaraƒüasƒ±, have your Turkish coffee, buy some souveniours, carpets etc. and walk around a few narrow roads and do not get away from the crowd to the isolated parts especially at night and mind your bag."
you can find any items...,"Kemeralti Market,Izmir 's  a major shopping center. Although it remained vaulted and domed some shops feature mostly modern business centers, shops, cafes and cinemas are gathered here. These are examples of Turkish handicrafts as well as ceramics..."
World's most alive open air shopping bazaar,"Just think a bazaar which you can find ""everything"" in one place... All needs stored in different directions but related to each other. Realy good and cheap to buy thing."
"Kemeralti, where cultures mingle...","Difficult to describe in an other way than typical Turkish market, but then one of the larger ones. On the other hand look a bit deeper and you'll find mosks, churches and Jewish praying houses in the same area, this is Izmir ... Also the surroundings of Kemeralti are worth paying a visit. Just grab a real Turkish coffee on the way and you'll feel the really unique Izmir hospitality."
The real Izmir,"A market that sells everything, and a lovely way to experience the real Turkey and Izmir. Some of the shopkeepers can be a bit insistent, so be firm if you are not interested, and don't go in to a store to be polite - say a firm no and walk on - just like you would do in a similar market in any country! People are super nice and eager to help. If a shopkeeper does not speak english, he will call out to a neighbor to help translate. There is a small hotel in the middle of the bazaar with a lovely open courtyard - a great place to rest your legs and get a cool drink. The proprietor speaks English and is very nice."
Just a typical nice Turkish market,"Really a nice experience if you are looking for the typical Turkish market experience. To us it felt touristic and we've seen these markets in other places like the Grand Bazar in Istanbul, but it's really nice to buy some souvenirs and presents."
Meet with Turkish culture,"For tourists, Kemeraltƒ± is one the best places to visit in ƒ∞zmir. You should walk around the roads and see Turkish culture. Best part is certainly Kizlaragasi Han. Drink a cup of Turkish coffee and eat your turkish delight in traditionally decorated cafes. Shops will probably say high prices for the materials they sell, but you can offer lower prices and make bargains. You should eat iskender or kofte in kemeralti market. For iskender I suggest Peter Doner. If you want to eat kofte, Ne≈üe kofte near kizlaragasi han makes awesome kofte and they have delicious yoghurt. Have a great trip!"
Very busy,Very busy and not ideal to attend when the sun is at its peak. Should definitely negotiate prices on everythinggg. Loved the little stores selling jewellery. Also stopped by a little cafe and enjoyed homemade lemonade.
Historical,Its very nice and historical building nice to look around but shops are a bit poorly couldnt find much things but atmosphere was really unmissable
traditional bazzar,"every one who go to konak square,should go to visit kemeralty bazzar.here full of small shops and every things you want,you can find in good price,i highly recommend visit kemeralty bazzar."
Good price to buy,An old market to get Turkish made high quality dressing with good price. As it was near to our hotel we found it easily by fortune. I recommend there to whom wants unbranded clothes.
Historical place to shop at reasonable prices,"A bit crowded place and difficult to mindmap the roads. You should aldo know how to bargainüòäyou can find lots of items, clothes, toys, kitchen utensils etc."
Market with everything,"If you look for absolutely everything this is the place. From wedding dresses, jewelry, kids stuff up to herbs and spices etc etc. although you need to bargain a bit, you can save at least 30% of original price ;-)Good luck with hunting...."
A bustling maze of shops,"If you're needing something to do in Konak, Kemeralti is full of little shops that offer just about anything you can imagine.  It can be a fun touristy experience but you're more likely to get hassled there because it is in the heart of the touristic district.  There are so many shops and side streets that it can also be a bit easy to get turned around, so it might be good bring a map.In short, if you like touristy shopping,go for it, if you don't, just see the clock tower area then take a walk down the kordon."
Keep your head down!,"A mall of bygone era..Before the small port was filled,Kemeraltƒ± was the waterfront mall of the 'karavans'.You can still see the karavan-saray(palace)s.But for me the most interesting part is by Hisar√∂n√º mosque,mantocular carsisi..(Coat bazaaar)..Colorfull coats are hanging on the streets of two meters wide.A real maze..And the smells..Old coats,new coats,colorfull dressess..smells are coming from these and a real reminder of bygone era.."
Huge market,fascinating to visit this extensive market and it is very easy to get lost. There is a real buzz - so many things to buy. Whilst in the market visit the Hisar mosque.
"Oldbazaar  for textil , cultur And old gastro",Here is old And magic placeThis bazaar alltime full 10:00-19:00 Caution Prices is not last Price You can want to dampingYou should one turkish coffe trink 1 coffe 2‚Ç¨ in kƒ±zlaraƒüasƒ± holl
Shopping ,Amazing shopping great variety and good value for money.Recommend for authentic food and shopping.Variety and culture.Must for any traveller
Very friendly people,"We arrived at the market by accident. They sell everything for a very reasonable price. If you ask dirrection, people will get out of their ways to help you."
YOU CAN BUY WHATEVER YOU WANT,At this historical place you can buy everything very cheap.You can eat kebap and drink Turkish coffee..it is very noisy because many seller selling by shouting..
A hectic touristic spot in Izmir,"One of touristic spots in izmir, there are variety of shops, cafe and restaurants. Nice place to have a nice time. Includes kizlaragasi han for authentic shopping."
"History, nostalgie, everything...","The oldest market place of Izmir where you can find any quality stuff at excellent prices. The best gourmet restaurants are located in the narrow streets of this historical area. In every corner, it's possible to find hidden gems of the city."
Historical shopping mile,"A must to do wile visiting izmir. Take time to visit each street especially the side streets to discover,you will find always some items which will surprize ."
Must visit,"U can find great deals if u look carefully. Always ask for lower prices, start with 50% of the mentioned price"
Many things sell Here,"The location in KOnak near the Saat KulesiKemeraltƒ± Market is ƒ∞zmir‚Äôs heart and soul, and a great place to get lost for a few hours. There are bargains galore, especially in leather goods, clothing and jewellery. Seek out the flower and bead markets, then stop for a reviving shot of Turkish coffee and baklava in one of the delightful cafes at its core. Anafartalar Caddesi rings the main bazaar area and is its principal thoroughfare.Within the main bazaar, the glorious Kƒ±zlaraƒüasƒ± Han caravanserai (1744) is a much smaller, calmer version of ƒ∞stanbul‚Äôs famous Covered Bazaar. It‚Äôs touristy, with many items from the far end of the Silk Road (China), but good for a wander. There‚Äôs a cafe in the courtyard, where merchants once tethered their camels.The bazaar also contains Hisar Camii , the city‚Äôs largest mosque. The interior is quintessentially ƒ∞zmiri: the blue-and-gold motifs on the domed ceiling are simpler and less Oriental than classic Ottoman designs."
do not miss,full of interesting shops with a sense of old era . you can buy everything you need specially souvenirs for your beloved persons.
Cheap Market,This market is very good to buy antique and traditional stuffs. The prices are quite cheap but it is bit crowded
Fun Maze of a Market,"You can nearly buy anything in this market, but be ready to bargain or else you will pay top dollar when you don't have to.  We usually road a dolmus (it will be labeled Konak) to and from the market.  A dolmus is extremely cheap and kinda fun.  A taxi will be more expensive; however I would not drive since there is virtually no where to park."
Love such souq,I really enjoyed being there. There were hundreds of shops. I can say you will find whatever you are looking for there. It has lots of choices . I strongly recommend you to spend 3-5 hours there.
Old Historic Bazaar of Izmir,"Be carefull for not loose your way :) This is historical old bazaar of Izmir, just possible visit by walk. You can buy whatever you want... All kind wearing, shooes, meals, jewelery, gold, meat, spices, salamur, pet (cat, dog,fish,bird), you can find butcher, greengrocer, candies, have lunch, smoke, have meals, coffee, flower.... Whatever you need you can find at Kemeralti. There is one main street and several secondaries, you may loose yor way :) if you do, try to follow up the way that most of the people go. It might not easy to turn back at same way :)) it would be easy if you use mobile maps... There would be too many people even if its weekday. At weekend, you may feel yourself like leave a football match or concert, people would be flow like a river. ƒ∞f you have child, be careful for not loose each other ;) generally the prices might be evaluate as cheap for most of the comodities. How many hours you can spend there? 1 day is not enough to ser everywhere. Even if it's a historical bazaar, most of the buildings are not old or not restored very well. Please do not imagine to walk in a amazing historical buildings... Enjoy your trip..."
Find everything in One place!,"The kemeralti is where ordinary locals do their shopping & therefore is extremely busy. You can find almost everything here from clothes,shoes, jewellery, wedding items, luggage, fabrics, restaurants, traditional tea/coffee shops, fresh fruit juice ...the list goes on and on!  once you figure it out, you will realise that it is divided into seperate areas -ie a part which is mainly shoes or fabrics or jewellery, engraving etc etc. If you are looking for something in particular, just ask one of the sellers and they'll point you in the right direction. Worth knowing too that there are alot of traditional craftsmen here (ive had a brass photo plaque made, clothes altered & even found a vinyl record dealer) You will be pleasantly surprised at how cheap it is. Also worth mentioning, if you are changing money to local currency there are quite a few Exchange shops which give much higher rates than the holiday resorts (Bodrum etc) Like in any big busy city, watch your bag (although many of the locals may very well remind you of this) If you are going in the height of summer, I would recommend going either very early morning or late afternoon as it can be very hot as well as crowded. Also wouldnt recommend going in heavy rain as some of the buildings/pavements are very old and therefore flood very quickly! You really need at least a few hours here to take everything in & there are plenty of lovely eating & drinking places to stop and recharge!"
How traditional can this get?? Ohhh and can't forget the fortune tellers!!!! Oh yeah :-D,"You know how many cities have a place that would be ideal to shoot an action movie where the good guy runs away from bad guys through crowds, jugglers, snake charmers etc? This would be the equivalent in Izmir - except it is not scary or messy :-D It has all the charm of old Izmir with amazing market buys for super cheap clothes, shoes, bags, traditional food, kababs, Turkish ice-cream, simit YUM! It's crowded and busy - lovely! It is very close to Kizlaragasi Hani (old inn converted into a huge bazaar now) which has a famous coffee street where you can drink a cup of Turkish coffee and get your fortune read. I have randomly tried a few of them and it is FUN! Some were super accurate and some not. Kizlaragasi Hani has lots of sweet little shops that will sell you an excellent selection of every single touristy thing you might want to buy. Most quite well priced btw but, of course, do haggle - it's Turkey for God's sake ;)"
Roxan,The place was old and attractive for those who love to walk in a local market with traditional ambiance .There were many small shops selling ordinary stuff you can find in any market.
Goes on and on,"Open air market  / mall. Must be 500 + stores. From - jewelry, clothing, fresh fruit, meats, fish, nuts, dresses, beads, fabric, books,.... You name it. You definitely can get lost. Keep away of how you entered. There is some nice places to eat and have coffee."
Nice market - unbelievably low prices,"We did not get hassled much and were amazed at the quality, variety and value at what was on offer - spend some time here and you'll need to buy extra luggage on your flight!"
KEMERALTI PERFECT,"i have been there, if you want to see history. there is perfect... there is shops, kind people, and good weather."
A main gate to Kemeralti,"This is a nice place to find cheaper products.. From clothes to utilities for your house, you name it, whatever you need it is there."
A nice market selling everything,"We wandered here on a Sunday morning, so not everything was open yet (the stalls seemed to start opening from 11am) and it was still very quiet. Seemed a nice market that sold everything you could think of. We didn't really get harassed and felt quite safe. Very different feel from the Grand Bazar in Istanbul - more open, modern, seemed to sell less touristy things. We found a nice eating area around the big mosque in the middle. I will definitely go back when it is open and busier to get a better experience."
gold gold and more gold,Kemeralti must be the biggest gold area anywhere. There are row after row of gold shops all selling wonderful items. This area is not for the faint hearted ask the narrow warren of side streets are like a maze. It is easy to lose where you are but the locals will point you in the right direction
SHOPPING,Lots of shops and prices are reasonable. You can bargain as you wish. Lots of food and restaurant. Can spend the whole day there to shop for their local goods.
A good way to see Izmir,"If your hotel is close by, it is worth a stroll. The streets are wider than the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul or perhaps there is not as much people. Went here on a weekend tho. There is room enough in between crowds to check out the merchandise."
