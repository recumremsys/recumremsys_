Close proximity to animals and fun,"Then we drove to the second stop of the day: Nasu Animal Kingdom 那須動物王國. It is famous for having many animal shows, including Bird Performance Show, Cat Show, New Zealand Farm Show, and Aqua Friends. There are also areas where visitors can interact with animals closely, such as Capybara Forest, Alpaca Hill, Tropical Rainforest. We had a good time in the park, with the opportunity to interact with the animals, many we had not seen before let alone be in such close proximity. During the visit, one can also experience the nice ambiance of the Nasu Highland. Approaching noon we decided to have lunch at the Yamaneko Terrace, going for a soy sauce ramen while enjoying the gorgeous view in the backdrop."
Unique Experience in the Capybara Hot Spring Bath,"My wife and I bought very reasonably priced tickets for this place through a Tokyo deal book, and our tickets included a meal at the barbeque all-you-can-eat restaurant, a trip to the capybara hot springs, and regular admission.In terms of pricing, we got a good deal - but, I think the all-you-can-eat barbeque restaurant prices (around 2500 yen [22 USD] per person as of October 2018), along with the capybara hot spring bath, which costs a little bit extra (around 250 yen [1.75 USD] per person) are pretty good bargains on their own, without a package deal. The capybara hot spring bath is a unique experience, and there is a little pavilion outside of the hot spring where you can walk around in the buff and admire the mountainous landscape around the Tochigi plateau, as well as the capybaras, who are also relaxing in the buff. There were very few people using the hot spring when we went, so it felt quite private.The barbeque restaurant is lovely. The selections for all you can eat a bit spartan by Japanese standards (vegetables; noodles for frying; beef, pork or lamb slices; yogurt with granola; a drink bar with a range of sodas and a cappuccino/coffee machine; and rice). The best part is really the view on the pavilion seating outside. There, you can enjoy the view of the mountains as you cook your own food at the table. It's very charming, but I'm not sure I'd recommend the restaurant on rainy or foggy days where the view is obstructed. In regards to the animal treatment, I have to agree with many people who have gripes about  the birds being in cages. It is pretty disheartening to see them unable to fly and with little space, so that's why I took away a star from this review. Some of the other animal cages were cramped as well and littered with feces, but I'm going to play devil's advocate and say that there are indeed other places, in Japan alone, that are much worse for animal treatment conditions. You can pet many of the animals, including capybaras (which is another on the list of reasons to go to Nasu Animal Kingdom). The guests were all very respectful of the animals' space and the capybaras make squeaking noises similar to guinea pigs when you rub their bristly fur.Overall, a great experience due to the mountainous background view and staff. The bird show and various animal feedings were a lot of fun, as well as the New Zealand sheep dog experience (the kiwi guy in charge of it was hilarious).Good food, a fun trip, beautiful landscape. A few cramped cages, but overall, the animals really seem loved.Tip: Don't forget that you need to book the pick-up and drop-off bus a day or two before you go."
Nice animal friendly zoo,"You cannot see wild animal but lots of farm animal and friendly animals. People can choose to feed rabbit, sheep or alpacas. Ride a camel or horse. Besides, there are animal show involving dogs and cats and other animal as well as eagles. You can see forest animal and penguin as well. Lovely place to visit."
Entrance fee n restaurant expensive ,"Quite a nice pet zoo. Don't have wild animals like lion , tiger or elephant . Children can pet or touch animals. Show performance are nice . Entrance fee are expensive. We get half price discount as we show them Gondora ticket ( cable car - limited time discount promotion) . Suggest you buy ticket together w barbecue buffet . Restaurant food very small portion and expensive. Barbecue buffet is more worth . It's located in mountain . Very nice autumn leave view in early of November ."
Animal lovers rejoice!,"While I dont disagree with the treatment of certain animals within the kingdom, this is comparatively better than similar places elsewhere in the world. More importantly, one could treat this as a way to introduce small kids to animals, would say this is still better than a zoo because of the interactive experience! You could take a bus ride from Nasushiobara station or a private car/taxi to get here, its a long way off. Dont forget to carry your camera to capture some moments, and please be kind to all the animals. Some animals are a bit inactive, but that could also be due to the season or timing of the visit or the very nature of the animals. No animals should be kept within a constrained environment, but for those that are, lets give them the love they deserve, this is one such place."
Good Zoo for your Children !,Nasu Animal Kingdom has a huge area for both indoor and outdoor animals . I love the shows so much .
A big let down. Cruel treatment to birds.,"We ( my wife, my 12 year old daughter and I ) are all animal lovers and we went to Nasu Animal Kingdom with a lot of expectations. As we first entered the park we were devastated to see a white cockatoo sitting alone chained to a small post. It was all alone in the room with visitors free to touch / pet the bird. It looked very sad and struggled to move as the chain was cruelly short. Few other animals were also alone in their small / bare cages. One unique aspect of this farm was that you could touch , pet and interact with the animals such as penguins, alpacas , reindeers ( that looked pathetic ) apart from cats and dogs. You are also encouraged to buy the animal feed kept near the enclosures and feed them. We still cannot digest the cruel treatment meted out to the large birds of prey - they are chained to a small wooden pole alone in their enclosure unable to fly all day long. They are taken out by the trainers and allowed free flight for a few minutes as a part of the show few times a day. It was such a heart rending sight to see the big majestic birds ( American Bald Eagle etc) flutter and try to fly but cannot..  Interacting with the dogs and penguins was fun though. The bigger dogs did look active and energetic.We would recommend giving this place a miss if you love animals."
I feel sorry for the animal...,"I visited here over a year ago. You have chances to pet lots of animals, and even hold a lion cub! I also got to see a baby wallaby which has appeared in television several times.Other than that, I felt sorry for the dogs that you get to pet. They all look so tired, and bored. You have a chance to walk them, for a price, around the whole park. Adorable, but their furs were greasy and dirty, I felt terribly sad for them... It's very loud around there and the dogs hardly get any peace and quiet. If you're lucky, you'll get to see staff walking an alpaca and get a change to pet it!There's also a 'cat house' thing with lots of cats. of course, inside a spacious building. Lots of equipment and apparatus for the cats and lots of space for them to roam in. Many of them, however wanted space away from people.The cable car which leads you down to the other half of the park, where you will see more farm/desert mammals, like horses, camels, kangaroos, sheep...etc. was a nice trip. Nice views as you go down with the cable car, however, it's quite dangerous, as there's no belts and it's quite steep. I took several pictures of the animals and they're very inactive, and quite sad looking."
Many animals in huge area,"Unlike a zoo, Animal Kingdom is located on top of mountain and the area is huge.  From the entrance there is a cat petting house and dog petting area so if you like animals you are free to enjoy being with dogs and cats.  Many shows are also seen in sequence so you don't have to worry about missing one for because of another show.From top area you will either need to walk a long way or to take a bus to another (huge) zone.  There you will see raptor show, sheep  show, alpacas, ducks, etc.You may either take bus back or take ski lift (costs extra)."
