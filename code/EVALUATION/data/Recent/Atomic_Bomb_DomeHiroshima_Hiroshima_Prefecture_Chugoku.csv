A place for reflection for the world,"The Atomic Bomb Dome is a historic monument in a historic city. The only building left after the Americans dropped the ""Little Boy"" atomic bomb August 6, 1945. By the end of 1945 about 140 000 of the citys 300 000 inhabitants were dead. In 1996, the damaged building was registered as part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site. I will definitely reccomend a visit to see the atomic bomb dome. It is a place for reflection. May it never ever happen again!"
Stark Reminder of Atomic Blast,"This well-maintained shell of the former 1914 Industrial Promotion Hall clearly shows the effects of the nearby Aug. 6, 1945, atomic blast. It is one of only a few structures not totally demolished in the immediate 1.9-mile area. The building remains my most vivid recollection of the monuments and memorials I saw when visiting Hiroshima's Peace Park in October 2019. I found it to be amazing that any part of the 4-story structure, topped by a steel dome, and just 525 feet from ground zero, survived. The same cannot be said for the people inside. They died instantly and fire destroyed the interior.Atomic Bomb Dome stands behind a low fence, across the Motoyasu River, away from the main part of the Peace Park. It is a true landmark and impossible to miss in the distance. We reached the building by ambling down a wide walking path, shared with many others. Information signs in English give many details about what happened here. My initial impression was pure horror, which slowly changed to the hope for world peace and the elimination of nuclear weapons worldwide."
"'Rating this place as an Experience' - Tricky. It simply is a MUST, so deserves Excellent.","No matter where you stand on the Subject or what you though ahead of time, I cannot imagine anyone not finding it moving and thought-provoking - we did.Easy to get to (overlooking the River and opposite the Peace Memorial Park *), get around and take your time & go at your own pace - NOT being a part of an organised Tour afforded one that option / flexibility, so we commend the Guide-Free option.3 + Hrs would be our recommendation to cover the Prime Aspects of the Dom and the Peace Memorial Park.* - Use the Hiroshima Sightseeing Loop Buses (Hop On / Hop Off) to catch about 15 of the Favourite Sights in the City."
UNESCO site of historic significance,Must see if in Hiroshima.  Arrived early in the morning and the place was empty except for a security guard.  It is amazing the place survived.  Some plaques discuss the history of the site.  Most people think this is where the A bomb went off at but it was actually 160 meters away.  Suggest visiting that specific location also if you are here.
a memorial everyone should see and take a moment to reflect on,"The building is impressive and the energy is somber but it's important to come and see, take the time to reflect and appreciate being there."
Moving,"While a wonderful place place to visit during the day, come back at night when the crowds have gone."
Breathtaking,"The Genbaku Dome is, maybe, the center of Hiroshima's Peace Memorial Park. The building wasn't completelly destroyed by the atomic bomb and it's kept to remind us the horrors of the war."
Remarkable Symbol,"Hiroshima is mostly known for its nuclear war related history and unfortunately not for the buzzing, cool city it today really is. People back home are still surprised when I tell them that Hiroshima is a safely visitable place and one definitely definitely worth it. Having mentioned its flourishing present times and surely great future, is it also important to remember the things that should not be repeated (anywhere in the world) and the atomic bomb dome is one of those symbols. It really is a quiet, yet captivating site  that can't and shouldn't be missed. Sadly famous, but still very much valuable as the memorial it serves as today."
............moving.,"Well worth the close-up physical presence at the ""dome"". Nice to walk around the site, is near the river/bridges and Peace Park."
Evocative atmosphere ,This memorial site forces oneself to contemplate how the world came to this awful situation.  No blame but certainly a realization of the outcome of a horrific war. A commitment to see that it never happens again is the best message.
Hiroshima Landmark,"I was at the A-Bomb Dome on a free mini bus ride (it was free because of the JR pass),took a few photos as it was the Hiroshima landmark."
Surreal to stand in its presence,"Nice to see that the community has preserved this site as a memorial. Very sombre to stand in that space and reflect on the horrors if that war time,"
Still Standing,"The structure still stands reminiscent of the grey days of war, and on the flip side, shows it’s resilience from destruction to progress as what Hiroshima is now. As part of the park, walk around it and see the history of this sacred site, an excellent historical learning adventure awaits."
Very nice place,"Very nice place. historical, near Hiroshima St. just take taxi or use trem. or u can walk about 15minute."
reality.,this is the first site as one approaches the peace memorial park. its outside of the park. we visited it after we went through the park and the museum.
The most sobering place I have ever been,Ignore the insensitive people taking selfies and photos of their partners and contemplate what happened here (and started up in the air a few hundred metres above and to the south of the Dome).
Iconic symbol,This is an iconic symbol reminding people of the terrible effects of the atomic bomb. Th JR pass pass here and we used it to come here from Hiroshima station.
a beautiful tragedy,This building is so significant. I was able to see this during the day. it was pretty cold but to see the building standing after what we know about it to be true is inspiring.
A say and rainy day!,"A walk around this site will leave one with sadness and what's more when it rains heavily while walking around the site. The damage of buildings and the emotion cause to the local shows how powerful this nuclear bomb has cause and of course, there were never be a repeat of it anymore. With the sadness and coldness, it s a place to visit. To World Peace!"
A sad reminder of what happened. Must see!,A walk around this building leaves you with great sadness. It is a stark and powerful symbol of what nuclear weapons can do. It is so important to have this structure here to remind us of what happened and hopefully never to happen again. It is definitely worth visiting in the beautiful city of Hiroshima. There is an eerie quietness despite people around as we all reflect on this tragic event. Definitely emotional.
Stunning,"There's an eeriness about this place it's quiet and emotional to see, noone spoke around the building and all had their eyes just watching the building. Highly recommend coming here."
A place of unique history and memory.,I visited this unique place when I visited Japan. This building still stands to remember humanity that Nuclear weapons can destroy everything. My deep feelings to the Japanese people for the terror that they have faced. The museum nearby is a must visit in order to realize the magnitude of destruction that occurred in Hiroshima from the atomic bomb.
Visit the museum first.,I would suggest to visit the museum first to learn the story behind this. Then walk through the memorial park and then the dome.
Visit of reflection ,As for other visitors a humbling experience to understand the magnitude and horror of the atom bomb and its after effect on human life. Important to visit with an experienced guide to understand the full history and sequence of events following this terrible atrocity.
Humbling,Check out the atomic bomb dome and go through the museum are very humbling experiences.  walking around the building and then seeing photos of what things look like before and after make you realize the scale of devastation in Hiroshima.
A message of Peace,The atomic bomb dome is well preserved and a lot of information regarding the history of the actual atomic bomb (nothing about the history of WWII). It leaves visitors the clear message of the importance of peace and the devastation of war. It is an educational place. Requires time to absorb the history which should shape our minds.  A must do while in Hiroshima.
Ideal memorial to the bombing!,"Prior to visiting, and reading the informative signboards, I was not really aware of the division of public opinion that  existed post-WWII, between those who favoured preservation of the remains as a memorial to the bombing and those who favoured the complete demolition of a dangerously dilapidated structure which evoked painful memories.  Half a century on from the decision to preserve the remains (in 1967), it seems to have been the correct one as the Atomic Bomb Dome is today the iconic reminder of the devastation that befell Hiroshima that morning in August 1945.Given the number of visitors to Hiroshima and the Dome's position as one of the top attractions, I particularly liked the way the preservation had been handled and also the way the ""mass tourism"" had been successfully managed.  Several times I circled the building photographing the details which appealed to me from a discreet distance behind the fencing, without encroaching on others taking selfies or indeed others interfering with my own quiet enjoyment of the moment.For me, quite ideal!"
The memories,This building used to be a city hall..however the atomic change the whole thing..although several renovation has been conducted to preserved the building..however the original shape is still maintain as it is. The memory still there..as a learning for our future..
Real life example,Seeing that building brings a brutal reality to the devastation that pictures do not adequately convey.  Seeing the building makes you realize the intensity and enormous nature of the blast.  The only negative is that there is no direct connection from Peace Memorial Park.
Great memorial site,"If you plan on walking through the Peace Park, you won’t miss the Atomic Bomb Dome. I’d recommend going to the museum first to see the history behind it and then seeing it. This way, it’s a lot more realistic. It’s quite a site to see and experience and you’ll just take in so much while standing outside taking pics. There’s a 360° view of it, so be sure to walk across the river and behind it as you’ll get some great pics when walking around."
Interesting,U can either take the streetcar from Hiroshima station or u can purchase the ticket for the local sightseeing bus (free if u have the jr pass). Bus stop 2 shinkansen entrance. Walking distance to the memorial park and also the shopping street..
O! That I were deaf!,"I came specifically for art purposes. To try and get in touch with the Elan... the Spirit... of the place. Do not forget, this Dome is less than 800 metres from the hypocentre of the first A bomb (in recorded history) to be deliberately exploded over human beings (that most of these human beings were civilian is important to 'absorb' in your viewing as well. I must digress a moment - but still staying firmly within the travel 'experience' - and tell you I am an Australian, 73 years old, and only in these weeks gone by, have fully understood how ordinary people, who do not want war, can be dragged into one by the driving force of political malfunction. Political malfunction they can do nothing about. Democratic voting, you ask? Nope. In Australia, the 2019/2020 season has delivered ordinary citizens a leadership that can align itself with Fascis regimes at the drop of a hat, and carry Australia into war... war of benefit to the Oligarchs of this world... As I say, this is not digressing from the travel experience, but to hammer home the bomb's use on civilian folk who were basically just like you. They had Mom n Dads, were Moms and Dads; had Loves and Lovers; had Sisters and Brothers, Aunts and Uncles, Siblins and Children; Friends and Acquaintances; Workmates and Colleagues... on and on... And they had Plans... Just like me... Just like you... That the wrong side of your own political leadership can snuff-out without you being able to do a thing...) So: to the Moment... The Dome... I was there for art, with easel set-up and sketching away, and folk would sometimes wander over and chat, and The best way to capture the essence of both the conversations and the Elan of the place is the Haiku (the seventeen syllable Japanese poem arranged in five/seven/five pattern), I ended-up creating on my sketch: ""Passers-by ask me:/ ""Can you hear the Ghosts from there?""/ O! That I were deaf..."""
Must SEE when visiting Hiroshima,"It's so eerie to see just the dome of this building as a survivor and reminder of the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima in 1945.  I read on the plaque that all the other buildings that were damaged from the bombing were demolished and then it came time to destroy this one and while some people were for destroying it because it reminded them too much of the pain and the war, others petitioned to save it and keep it as a reminder of what happened.  I am glad it is there for people to visit and see.  The Dome Building is located by the water.  It is a peaceful area inside the large Peace Park.  A definitely must see if you are in Hiroshima."
Easy access. Gloomy evening of grim history. ,Easy to access from Hiroshima main station. Walk 5 min to the Hiroshima eki hiroden street car station and take the tram on the very front. Alight at M10 Gempaku Dome and just walk across the crossing And it’s just there. An important grim reminder of a history so horrible which must not be repeated. Good history lesson for all.
Definitely worth the visit,"Part of the Peace Park, this monument brings home the reality of Hiroshimas history. Visit the museum,  wander through the park and then walk to the Dome. Very well preserved and worth the visit"
Best at night!,We did an organised walking tour during the day. But walk past the Dome on our way home from dinner. Hauntingly beautiful at night.
visited as part of a tour,"If you are interested in history, don't skip a visit to Hiroshima.  I recommend taking a guided tour of the city so you can really take in the lessons this monument has to offer."
Piece of history,The dome was the only building that survived the atomic bomb drop in 1945. Definitely a piece of history for the city.Easy to get to this and there are several other attractions in the area within walking distance. There are information boards all around the site.
This building is powerful to put the words in adjoining museum into reality,"For everyone visiting Hiroshima, I'd definitely recommend Peace Museum. However after exiting from there I didn't feel the impact I was expecting of shock and sorrow. However when I saw this dome perfectly aligned at the exit of the peace monument and walked towards it, the raw emotions became more real as here was a building very close to the epicenter which was the lone survivor of the bomb which hasn't been demolished. I learnt about the history of this building, the calls to demolish this as it reminded locals of the trauma of the bombing. This building standing tall as it was just after the bomb is looking straight into history- the horror part of it. I'd definitely recommend to walk till here if you're already at the Peace Museum."
A must visit if you are in Hiroshima,Be prepared to be moved or become emotional at this landmark because it represents the dawn of a time where humans could wipe out whole cities.  The area around the structure is a beautiful park and I highly recommend spending time reading each marker.
Impresive Monument,The atomic bomb dropped right here and wiped out a huge part of the city. This build reminds a the big lose on that day.
Opportunity to Visit,"Easy to get to this structure, by bus or tram from the Hiroshima Station. I got goosebumbs and emotional."
The icon of Hiroshima,"This is the iconic image of modern Hiroshima, and with good reason. Worth visiting during the day, but definitely worth going back at night when it's floodlit for a more sombre viewing."
Symbol of horror yet also peace,"I would defy anyone not to be moved when you see this; it is such a poignant symbol of the horror of war and of nuclear attack. We visited on a gloriously sunny autumn day which somehow made it feel even more emotive. We spent several hours exploring this, the memorial peace park, the memorial hall and the museum, and it was one of the highlights of our Japan trip because everything is so carefully and thoughtfully presented - honest but not sensationalist, and with a clear message of ""this must never happen again""."
Sad to see,"It is not a place to take selfie, like others where doing, I felt terrible pain, it is not a place like  a tourist spot, very sad to see how people perceive this, Oops!"
Heartbreaking!,Must visit and learn all about nuclear destruction! Very well done memorial.. And visit the Peace Museum
Must visit place in Hiroshima,it is not far from the station.  the infomation in the museum is very details and make people understand more about this remarkable historical incident.   Feel a bit sad  to recall all those sad stories but it is a must visit place in Hiroshima
Somber visit,"I went as part of a tour, and this was our first stop.   It was a somber place to visit with a reminder as the result of war.    A few people I was traveling with, did not want to join   they knew they would cry.Only viewed from the outside."
Iconic structure,The forces involved in the atomic bomb are incomprehensible. The pictures in the museum show total devastation for miles around. The fact that it was directly below the airburst was described as the main reason for its standing.
worth visiting,not far from the train station. you can have a 360 deg view of the dome. there is a skywalk/view building beside. price is too high. suggest not to go.
A stark reminder of the devastation caused by man/war,"To get the full effect of the A Bomb Dome, you must ofcourse visit the Peace Memorial Museum, and The Peace Memorial Park. Only then will the devastation hit you.Easy to get to the dome by the tourist sight seeing bus. No entrance fee, as you can only view the building from the outside and not enter it. The best place to photograph the building is from across the river at the peace memorial park."
Sad reminder of the devastation ,"The Atomic bomb done is located at the nerve centre of the A-bomb explosion. Somehow, only a portion of it was destroyed and the dome today stands testimony to the destruction brought about by the bomb."
Impressive,"If you're visiting the dome, off course you'll walk the whole park and visit the museum and memorial as well. This makes for a really impressive Day."
Very impressive,The place symbolizes the tragedy of Hiroshima in a very effective way. It was very smart to leave it as it is to show the horror.
Powerful and Sad Reminder,"The Atomic Bomb Dome is an iconic landmark in Hiroshima. Unfortunately, it's fame is because of a devastating event in history. I am glad that this building was left as is and not torn down, as it is a powerful reminder to all of us on the effects and brutality of war. The Dome is fenced in, so you cannot enter, but it is free to walk the perimeter. The Dome is at the Peace Park, and I highly recommend spending time here and visiting the memorials and the museum."
Absolutely worth viisting,"Get their early! :) Site got very busy, we enjoyed a lovely start at 8.15am when Peace Clock sounds, before coach tours arrived."
Testament to the horrors of nuclear warfare,These ruins of the Genbaku Dome building is the most vivid reminder to humanity of the horrors of nuclear weapons and warfare.
Evocative ,The bombed out shell of this building is one of the iconic images of war. It serves as an important lesson to make sure nuclear weapons are never used in future. It holds an aura that is hard to put into words. Its location beside the river allows for great pictures
Devastatingly awe-inspiring.,"The locals say it best when they say “No More Hiroshimas”. This incredible building, and the surrounding Peace Park are both stunningly beautiful and incredibly moving. Impossible to put into words the feeling in the air."
Interesting,"Thd dome is located withi n the peace park or adjacent to it. All three major attatractions, dome, peace park and museum are located next to eacb other.Well worth visiting. No entry costs for the dome, park and 100y for the museum. Catch the JR tour bus at no charge if u have a JR Rail Pass."
REALLY NICE TO SEE NOT IN THE POURING RAIN,"It is so much bigger than one would believe from photos, it was a few stories tall.  sitting next to the river makes the dome easy to find walking in.  It is a short walk to all other sites associated 6 August 1945."
Impressive but sad,They have done a nice job keeping the memory of this terribel bomb but made it nice. Maybee a bit more information about how things happened and also about the work done to restore Hiroshima afterwards. For an European this is interesting.
A monument for humanity to understand the horrors of war,Impressive that it survived and easy to find as it was on the free JR pass bus routes. There are other monuments in the park to spend time and reflect on life
A horrific reminder to mankind,"There were many atrocities during world war 2, but the ones in Hiroshima and Nagasaki were definitely the worst. So many innocent people were savagely killed. It’s incredible that this was allowed to happen, so many crazy people with power in the world."
Iconic reminder ,"This iconic site is very well presented, providing a poignant reminder of the impact of the war. Would recommend sunset or sunrise as quieter. A must-see in Hiroshima."
Poignant reminder,"Given that most of Hiroshima was built in wood , the old exhibition hall has become an iconic landmark and testimony to the horrific destruction of the atomic bomb. Standing at the side of the ruin one can only imagine the horror of that day"
Sobering,It is a sad place but sobering and you should visit as a mark of respect to all those who die on all sides but mostly to the people f Hiroshima striving for peace.
Iconic,Due to its tragic past this is a iconic shell of a building located right next to the memorial peace park. There are lots of good places to sit and reflect on what occurred here. Has to be seen to be fully appreciated
Historic 20th Century Icon,"A lot happened in the 20th century and this building symbolizes a major event. There are informational signs around the building that explain when it was built and it’s use prior to being damaged in 1945. The information plaques also explain that some have advocated for the removal of the building due to what it signifies. The park around the dome is a beautiful site and is a must while visiting Hiroshima. When visiting, make sure to walk completely around the building."
Just visit and reflect,"Peace park is very tasteful and calm, the Dome is a stark reminder of what happened in 1945. Visiting on a sunny October day when travellers from around the world are mixing does help to demonstrate that we are all a community and are better together than divided"
Haunting,A haunting memorial to the use of atomic weapons. Little else remained of Hiroshima after the bomb. Worth the visit.
Must be seen,Must be seen - one of the most iconic buildings in the World. Sombre and sad but there is still a message of hope for us all
A Must Visit,"Tragic as it was back in 1945, one of the main reasons for visiting here is to witness the aftermath of this tragic event during WW11.  With over 70,000 innocent civilians killed on the day the bomb was dropped this museum is testimony to how little sense wars are."
Poignant Reminder of Man’s Folly,"This was moving day quietly walking around this dome and the peace park.  Met a couple saviours, who spent time explaining their experience and that of their parents. Also met a 80 year old saviour who was quietly seated feeding birds that were feeding off his hands.  He called them his friends. He was 10 when the bomb exploded 600 miles above his city."
"Stark, Sobering Reminder of How Wrong We Can Be","There is little to say about the A-Bomb Done that has not already been written many times before. It's twisted yet defiant shape is a grotesque and powerful message to all generations. It is hard to visit central Hiroshima without seeing it and, I hope, reflecting on a few things."
Hugely significant,"reminder of man's inhumanity to man. Whilst not the only building remaining this has become, quite rightly so,  a symbol of why we should ensure nuclear wasOn are wiped from the face of the earth  Sadly,  whilst the preservation of the building is welcomed it would have been better if there had been more space around it and, not close to a modern building."
Destruction Image,"The building shows signs of horrible catastrophe that took place on Aug. 6, 1945. The memorial stands for the lost and suffering of humankind that imposed by the same race. Almost 70,000 had perished instantly in addition to other 70,000 were victims of radiation."
Intense,The dome is well-maintained and is a stark contrast to the beautiful park and river that runs by. Everyone i saw was respectful of the monument. A permanent reminder of how awful humanity can be.
Stark ,"This was part of a morning spent in the area around the hypocentre of the A Bomb explosion in 1945.It is a sombre and stark reminder of the madness of war and the human toll it takes. Beautifully preserved if I can say that and is well worth a visit as you walk through the peace park. Start here and work your way through the whole park, it's a must see if you are in Hiroshima."
Unesco world heritage site..,Based on wikpedia this is a ruin of the hall serves as a memorial to the people who were killed in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima..I hope in the future this tragedy will not happen again..
Evocative symbol,A haunting sight when the background is known.  Everyone walking around in silence sums it all up.... a place for contemplation and hope that this never happens again.
Father and son on tour,"Taking time out from the Rugby World Cup we detoured to Hiroshima. The Atomic Bomb Dome and nearby Memorial Peace Park are a must if you’re in Japan. A reflective space with peace and forgiveness at its heart. The Dome is a ghostly reminder of the horror unleashed on Hiroshima by Col Paul Tibbets on 6thAugust 1945. 80,000 innocent lives incinerated instantly. A further 130,000 dying in the aftermath."
A must see ,"If you are in Japan you have to come here. I have never spent as much time in such a place. It’s haunting and sad, but beautiful at the same time. As a student of history, the museum was my favourite place I’ve visited in Japan. Spend time there, take it in and think!"
Seeing in Person much more powerful than documentaries,Seeing the outcome of the bomb in a beautiful and peaceful setting give you pause to stop and think about the world we live in.  I was concerned about visiting as an American and now I think everyone should see this first hand
Feelings..,Visited recently on a trip with teens from Australia studying Japanese. This was my personal fav of the trip for the information and history it gave. This place is haunted and you can feel the sorrow of that event and also the way the city rebuilt and pushed forward brings you joy. Haunting.
Haunting,Learned about this during a tour of the museum. Only a few hundred metres up the road. Worth going to.
Breathtaking,"Absolute must visit in Hiroshima. Really puts the devastation of the bomb into perspective, Great for either night or day"
Surreal,A pretty surreal experience. It’s one thing reading about this in history books but its another thing being there in person. A vivid reminder of the pain the Hiroshima people suffered. The atomic bomb dome is a constant reminder of the city that once was. Its really eerie to look that this dome and imagine being there in person back in 1945. A must see attraction in Hiroshima.
A moving experience,Any one who has been here and spent the time to walk the park and see the memorial and museum will tell you how powerful the experience is. I was nearly in tears watching the testimonies of those who survived. the strength of the Japanese character is fully on display. I wondered about the universality of the human experience. And I weep for the children lost.
A must see when in the area,Ground zero for the WW II nuclear bomb explosion site some 600 feet above this central ruin still standing as a monument to this event. The museum is close by in walking distance
Mans inhumanity to man,"This has been left to make people think, it certainly does that, it may be one building on the banks of a river but it has been left so the older generation can remember and the younger generation think."
Must see!,We only spend a couple of days in Hiroshima but the dome is definitly a must see! It is really close to the peace park!
Chilling reminder of the events of WWII,A very chilling reminder of the exact spot where 600 meters above ground the first nuclear bomb exploded.
A place of reflection ,Today there were two people who were descendants of people who survived the bomb and the beauty of it all was that there were not there to ask for money or selling anything  but to share their story. Amazing to see how this building is still intact given the destruction of its surroundings. A scary reminder to us all of how bad war can get
Mans inhumanity to man ,This is a solemn place to reflect about man’s inhumanity to man and our ability to overcome it a move on.  It is inspiring that people of Hiroshima have turned this site into a place of reflection for those that perished and have focused on moving forward constructively with a sense of joy and optimism.  We have so much to learn from our past so that we do not repeat the same mistakes.
Unbelievable that this building is still standing!,"Not knowing what to expect when we first arrived its hard to imagine how devastating it must have been for the 140.000 Japanese people who died when the atomic bomb was dropped on the 6th August 1945 in Hiroshima, unbelievable to think that this building would be still standing today and is a UNESCO World Heritage listed structure.Some see it as a reminder of war whilst others consider it a tribute to the lost that ensures we will never forget the tragic events that took place here. Its just a short walk to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial and museum, which both are reflective and somber."
Stark reminder,A very sobering park to wander through or sit and reflect. An easy walk to the peace bell and museum.
Very striking,"This is such a well known image it is even more striking when you are there.We got there using the hop on hop off bus from outside Hiroshima train station which is free if you have a JR pass.We also visited the Castle,Shinto Temple and Peace museum."
Incredible ,"Now a world heritage site the former Exhibition Hall bore the full brunt of the A bomb, leaving just a shell. Walk around the Dome, cross the river and take a photo of it with the new commercial buildings in the background"
See it up close,"I saw this from a distance and thought “Yeah, that’s crazy that it used to be a giant hall”, but up close you can see all the rubble and what the insides used to look like, which to me was more powerful."
Very Moving ,"The atomic bomb dome, so solemn, need I say more.  The free shuttle from the station to the dome, we left at the museum taking the shuttle out."
Graphic Atomic Bomb Symbol. ,Good to view on a gloomy rainy day walking around the decimated building.  A real contrast to the surrounding vibrant City and gardens.
Well done to the people of Hiroshima,"I have to say that there are several ways to react to the loss of 200 000 lives in one action and in the reconstruction of the A-Bomb dome the people of Hiroshima-Shi have found a way to remember the innocent people who lost their lives whilst also looking forward to a brighter future. This balance is near impossible to achieve and yet they have managed it. I have love and respect for what you have achieved here, well done. For anyone born after 1946, please visit to understand the sheer destruction that comes about through a war where atomic weapons are used to pray that they are never used again."
Trip back in time ,"It's good that the Japanese people decided to keep and preserve the building rather than demolish it. It serves as a reminder of what war's suffering and what humanity can do in its darkest moments. Visit, look and reflect."
Sobering,Standing at this place it is hard to imagine the horror experienced. Unbelievable to think governments still look at possessing weapons that can deal this much destruction.
So very sad.,This was one of the most sombre places I have ever been to..so very moving...I shed a tear thinking of the poor souls who lost their lives after this devastating catastrophe
A piece of history,When visiting Peace memorial park it’s almost impossible to not spot the A-bomb Dome just on the other side of the canal. It’s an important piece of history and a witness to the cruelties of war.
Stark reminder,We have all seen the photos but being there in person is just a stark reminder of the devastation Hiroshima endured.
Incredible to see this in person,We have all seen the photos of the A Bomb done in Hiroshima but it is much more impactful to see this in person. The building is very near to the episode center of where the bomb was dropped and exploded.
Incredible to see the remains,The reason this dome survived the bomb is because the bomb landed directly on the building. There was a debate for years whether it should remain or be demolished. Great decision to keep it. A stark reminder of who and what can get destroyed during wars .
A bomb dome,It is amazing to see this structure which is still standing & is in the condition it was in when the bomb hit. A permanent reminder of the awful events at that time. Well worth a visit.
Amazing ,"What a miracle this building is still standing, particularly since nearly everything around it was flattened by the bomb on 6 August 1945. The outside walls and the metal framing of the dome survived the blast that happened nearly directly above the site. If you are able to visit this site at 8.15am you get the opportunity to hear the memorial bells chiming. Walk further along the path leading to the museum and you come across other memorials like the children’s statue and the flame of remembrance."
Moving experience ,To stand and view the last surviving building from the Hiroshima bombing is amazing and thought provoking at the same time.
Hiroshima,A WHS/Unesco site worth visiting.located in the memorial peace park.this A-Bomb dome is a relic of where the Atomic Bomb fell.A humble experience to see the remains.it looks so small & yet perfectly preserved for generations.Access to dome not allowed but easy to see close up.
Humbling and Moving,"When we were planning our trip to Japan, we scouted out possible festivals and local events near where we would be staying. When we then came across the peace ceremony marking the 74th anniversary of the dropping of the first atomic bomb, I was both drawn to it and absolutely horrified.  As an American, I wanted to show my respects for those innocent lives lost, yet was concerned that we wouldn't be welcomed. My fears were groundless, as every Japanese person we met was kind and gracious to us.The dome, set amongst the bustle of a thriving, modern Hiroshima, is a stark reminder of both the worst of humanity as well as the best of it.  To see how it remains when everything nearby was decimated, is frankly quite humbling.  It's a wonderful reminder of the human spirit and we were so fortunate that we were able to visit during the peace ceremony.  While the ceremony takes place just once a year, it was a beautiful and moving experience.  As we sat on the bank of the river, watching the paper lanterns float by with the dome lit up in the background, we met kind-hearted and lovely people from all over the world.  It truly did feel like a peace ceremony, because everyone was respectful of the surroundings and history.  If you have the opportunity to attend this annual event, by all means, please do.Even if you don't, don't miss stopping by to pay your respects to those whose lives were changed forever on that horrible day.  Like visiting a concentration camp, the site of the twin towers in NYC or Civil War-era slave quarters, it's a part of history that should never be forgotten."
A sense of real horror,"The building transfers a feeling of absolute horror and tragedy. The silence around it,  the crows around it.. a must see."
Heart -touching,A very historical site that touches hearts reminding us to appreciate peace that we currently enjoy.
worth to see,"add on the understanding of the Hiroshima Atomic Bombing devastation, standing in front of it, you could feel the impact and city sufferings."
Historical Site,Well! I would recommend a visit to this site if passing by Hiroshima. Just keep an open mind as history has always two sides to the coin.
Heart rendering,"Absolute reminder of August 1945....so happy to have visited Hiroshima , debated a bit to visit or not but so glad we did itm..to understand history and to know how the area is rebuilt after all these years...the Japanese not bitter about what happened but they say it gave them a chance to rebuilt Hiroshima. The original building that was bombed...must visit Hiroshima to absorb the peace and calm of the place"
Painful reminder,"The Japanese debated whether to demolish this building or keep it as a reminder of the horror they witnessed.  They seem to have looked to the future in all other respects, but I think that they made the right for our sakes to keep this reminder present.  Two tips -1.  There is a free (with a JR pass) bus from Hiroshima Station here called the Meipuri.  The buses are red and hard to miss.2.  There are free tours offered by volunteers of this building and the entire Peace Park.  You can ask at the info desk in the Peace Museum."
Definitely should visit,The whole area surrounding the Atomic Bomb Dome really must be visited on a trip to Hiroshima.  There's a reason it's top of everyone's 'visit' list and it really speaks for itself.  Nothing I write here would do it justice.
A-Dome,This is the symbol of hypocentre of the first A-bomb in Hiroshima and the milestone of our memory in order to learn from our history.
Sad memorial,The Dome really leaves a lasting impression. To think that it was one of the very few structures to remain partially standing in Hiroshima is astonishing. It is really hard to comprehend how terrible the devastation was and how the people suffered. But I was inspired by the fact that it is now surrounded by beautiful parks and a peaceful and vibrant city.
great place to visit,"Catch the tour bus around the area, great way to see everything in Hiroshima and it is free with the JR pass"
An important reminder of the horrors of the war ,After visiting the memorial peace museum walking past this reminds you that the events truly happened right here where you are standing.
Beutiful area with very sad history,Visisted in a hote summer day. It would be good to have a bit more English introduction on site about dome and its restoration.
Extremely heartfelt,"Visiting the bomb dome was an extremely emotional moment for me, knowing the so many people lost their lives and the after effects of the atomic bomb was melancholic"
So pleased ,"You can completly understand the need to forget and remember. The existence of this memorial is not something I feel entitled to comment on, I know for some it's a painful reminder of the horrors for some, and for others a reminder of what humanity must never repeat. It was moving to see this structure as it was."
Passing by,"A very humbling experience, especially if you know your history.  Do not approach this area without first a very good understanding of the mindsets and feelings of the peoples of the time, not looking at it with today's blinded vision of history."
Must Do while in Hiroshima,It is frightening to be at a point where so many people unnecessarily have died through one single bomb
Peace memorial in Hiroshima,"When we were in Hiroshima we did look at the memorial from the other side of the river. And were taking deep thoughts there.Honestly I was very emotional when I was around this area. We did not have the urge to get closer, at least at this time it was not too crowded around and we have been there during the day. The view at night should be ""great""So in general I can recommend going there or at least seeing the last building from this very bad moment in human history."
Hiroshima ,An absolute must see after visiting the museum and the grounds of the park. Many different memorials to see. The A-dome is just unbelievable and really quite chilling.
Visit in the week it all happened 75 years ago!,"Ik was a special week for the people in Hiroshima, and we joint in their grieve.I was sad visiting the museum and wonderen why nobody really learns from these horrible wars!"
Atomic Bomb Dome,This was our first stop in this city.  The sight is quite different in person.  It takes your breath away to know that this survived the atomic bomb blast.  It's very serene and yet very disturbing part of history.  It helps us appreciate peace.
Sadly impressive,Today 6th August I write my review. To not forget what humans can inflict to other humans. We can not travel in Japan without going to Hiroshima.
Atomic Bomb Dome,well preserved site.   The grounds and surrounding area have much historical value and worth visiting.
Get close and think about where the bomb fell,"Get up close and don't just see it from a distance or from the memorial park. Standing next to the structure and looking upabove the buildings, reminding myself that this is where the atomic bomb exploded, awaked some strong feelings."
Very moving place,"I'd visited Hiroshima 10 years ago with work colleagues. Returning now with my family, the building still has the same power.Set near beautiful gardens, the A Bomb Domes stark skeleton cries out .A fitting reminder to the world of what happened to so many thousands of poor people. It must never happen again"
Sinister beauty,"Although partly destroyed, this building still maintains a dignified beauty somehow eternally resisting the horrors of the atomic bomb. Let it be a permanent symbol for all mankind to have peace forever ☮️"
We Must Not Forget,What remains in the memorial park is the what was left of a beautiful European building after the area was bombed.  At this time it is a very nice quiet area to visit.  I ate my lunch here that I bought from a nearby 7 eleven store.  There were lots of shady benches in this area.  I go there by taking the HOHO bus in front of the Hiroshima Station.  It was covered by the JR Rail Pass that we had purchased in Canada before we got to Japan.
Very nice quiet visit,"Someone has written out in booklets what happened that day in many different languages --amazing to see and read.Easily walkable area --free to get to from the station if using the JR Pass.  We walked across the bridge, through the park, and then to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum --which we did need to pay Y200 each.  Still an amazing deal for that museum."
Hauntingly captivating ,"The captivated stares from my teenage kids’ eyes on the Atomic Bomb Dome spoke volumes as they tried to imagine the devastation of the atomic blast while at the same time, amused at how much of the building survived being so close to ground zero. Located along the bank of the serene Motoyasu River just across from the Peace Memorial Park, it’s the most conspicuous monument. No matter at what distance or angle you view the Dome, it’s a hauntingly captivating sight that can keep you spell bound. It’s free to visit and you can get up close to it."
Sobering memorial,"As an American, I felt this was an important sight to see during my visit to Japan, and indeed, it was definitely thought-provoking and somber to see, and I would recommend spending some time here, reading the various information plaques near it and near other bomb-destroyed sites in the general area."
Unbelievable!,Unbelievable that this structure should survive almost directly below the point of explosion of the atomic bomb.  It is a reminder. It is a monument.  It is a skeleton laid bare after the horrors of the attack.The bell tower nearby is directly at the epicentre of blast.Something like 90 % of the buildings in the city were destroyed - it feels like this one was meant to stand as a reminder of the horrors of nuclear conflict.
Very sobering,As you stand and look at the remainder of this building you can't help but think how devastating this bombing was for the Japanese people . It is a very sad and sobering well preserved structure.
Must see,The Peace Park is so well done and the museum is fantastic. It's hard to believe what happened here and that this dome remained as intact as it is. I found the museum to be extremely well done and so interesting.
Must see in Hiroshima,"After spending the day in Hiroshima, it’s hard to believe that 74 years ago the city was a burning wasteland, 90% of it wiped out in an instant by the atomic bomb, ‘Little Boy’ dropped by the B-29 bomber, the Enola Gay. This single building, in the midst of the modern city, serves as a stark reminder of the devastation."
No. 1 place to visit,"Main priority to visit when in Hiroshima, all the tourist there treated this place with respect, calm and quietly. The hypocenter just a few hundred meters from the dome. The museum also in the same area and need to walk for few hundred meters. It's easy to reach by tram with the stop at Genbaku dome mae station."
Must see,Definitely must see in Hiroshima. A place that awakes thouths. 75 years passed but it is steel one of the biggest tragedies in the world
DARK TOURISM AT ATOMIC BOMB DOME HIROSIMA,"Atomic Bomb Dome which was completed in 1915, to be one of the buildings that survived from atomic bomb attack. This building was originally a Commercial Exhibition Hall and changed to the Industrial Promotion Hall in 1944. When the bomb was dropped all the people inside were killed. The Bomb Dome became Unesco Heritage Site in 1996,that keep showing the original building after being bombed. Which only the main structure of the building and the dome frame remains, so that we know how powerful the impact of the atomic bomb is."
Must see,"No visit to Hiroshima would be complete without this moving, humbling, saddening & incredible monument. If you have a JR pass you can enjoy all the sights for free on the hop on hop off bus that leaves the railway station every half hour. It will drop you @ the dome, museum and every other major attraction."
Real life reminder of the of blast,This is a sobering reminder of the effects of the atomic bomb. It’s amazing to think this building still remains. Best viewed from across the river in the peace park. The afternoon sun shines on it from this side for good photos in the afternoon.
A must-go in Hiroshima,This is a must-go UNESCO site. Easily accessible with the city tour bus. Suggest take photos there during day and night separately ... different feelings. A great location for taking selfie is from across the river.
Must see,A powerful reminder of the ugliness of war and hopefully a reminder to never let history repeat itself.
Place to feel intensity of Nuke,The building is a very telling tragedy of what a Nuke can do 600m above the ground to burn and incineration that is caused to human and even buildings. I loved the way the people of Hiroshima take this as their duty to educate people on the consequences of this.
Powerful Historical Statement,Words cannot describe this historical artifact. You cannot leave this place without a touch of sadness. The Japanese government did the right thing by preserving this building.
Every Global Citizen Must See,"The Atomic Bomb Dome, nearby Peace Memorial and Hiroshima Atomic Bomb Museum are a must see while in Japan. While each country may have its own interpretation of WWII events and responsibilities, the world was forever changed by the atomic age. The devastation, lives, lost and ultimately saved, and the end of World War and the rebirth and restoration of Hiroshima and Japan are highlighted here. Well worth the trip by train from Tokyo."
Harsh remembrance of the power and devastation of atomic weapons,History and WWII buffs should definitely stop at this site.  Together with the museum it draws a stark picture of the horrors of nuclear weapons.  It is easy to get to from the train station.
A Stark Reminder...,"This had been a famous office building in the city, and was devastated but not completely destroyed by the atomic bomb blast in 1945. It has been strengthened to maintain its current state as the ultimate reminder. From photographs, I'd always thought the dome was circular, but in fact it is oval. You can walk close to it but not inside.You should visit the Dome building, the memorial park and museum together; all are within walking distance of each other, and all can be reached on the hop-on, hop-off buses."
Visited In 2018,"Its an iconic building and probably high on many travellers ''to do lists'' Glad I have been, but not really for the building itself. All around you will find peace emblems. People salute you with the peace sign which began with The Beatles. The Japanese are so apologetic for their part in the war that they almost plead with you to forgive them. Nowhere moreso than this part of Hiroshima. You will leave with the memory of this place forever."
Must See,This is a must see when you're in Hiroshima or in Japan. The preservation is phenomenal and the story even more so.
Thought provoking ,I am so glad they’ve kept this shell of a building- it really adds so much to the story of Hiroshima.
Humbling,"A ""must see"", but very humbling. World Heritage site preserved to commemorate the dropping of the bomb. The dome is iconic, but the most striking element is the rubble that's been left in situ. Thankfully the crowds are respectful."
Go at night,Go at night to see this iconic structure. The place is lit up with floodlights and gives off a different vibe at night. Take a good camera and you'll get some excellent photos. Also see if you can spot the cats that now make this their home darting about in the shadows.
Stunning and Humbling,"An absolute miracle that this building survived the Atom Bomb blast on August 6th 1945. It was the former Industrial Promotion Hall built in 1915 and every single person in it on the fateful morning when the bomb was dropped was killed instantly.It has been preserved to this day as a fitting memorial to those who died and is part of the beautiful Peace Memorial Park complex A very moving experience to be here, as moving as any I can remember and an absolute privilege."
Silent moment ,"So odd, selfie was not in my mind when visiting here. Respect in silence. A must see in Hiroshima, worth traveling from Osaka."
You Open The Page of World World II History,"August 1945 the first Atomic Bomb drop here, maybe this is a good sample of what the Atomic Bomb destruction can do to a city and it's people, viewing can be a sad experience, we were there in the day time and night time, to experience the difference feeling, glad that we did."
Mind blowing ,A must visit site if travelling japan and Hiroshima. A really touching place to see and read about. How so much damages and destruction was caused from one act of war. Beautifully surrounded by memorials and stunning views! It’s a credit to japan how they have re built this great city and are using this event to promote hope and peace!
Provides some sober moments,"It's probably best to visit this place after brushing up on some history of World War II and stories of Hiroshima. But then most probably anyone who has come to Hiroshima has already done that. With this in mind, this place then is a good spot to sit quiet and think about what humanity has done and must do."
A morning at the A Bomb Dome,It is a very good place to visit. Highly recommend it to everyone. It was quiet. It is good to go with family.
Iconic site,"Looks just like guidebook photos. Not too crowded; nice breeze from the river. Not to be missed, IMHO."
Definitely Must see,"It was definitely worth the ride all the way from Osaka. I would recommend visiting the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum to better understand what happened and also see what stood there before the bombing to better appreciate what you see. The people of Hiroshima are torn on whether to keep this monument. To us, it is a piece of history, to them, it is a painful reminder of the loved ones that they lost."
Amazing,This is definitely worth a visit to and seeing the history surrounding this building. definitely something you must visit when in Hiroshima...
A sombre monument,"To preserve the remnants of this Government Building, was the bestway to illustrate the power and horror of nuclear warfare. It is achastening thought that this devastation was caused by an early atomicbomb and that current devices are many times more powerful.The huge force and intense heat generated by the explosion meltedmetal and glass and this ravaged building bears silent testament tothe terrifying affects of atomic weapons."
Must See,This is a sobering reminder of just how much power mankind unleashed when we learned to split the atom.
a symbol for what a bomb can do,This building is probably the most famous building in Hiroshima. This building was standing almost in the middle of the bomb and they left what is still standing after the attack. A place to remember and hoping that something like that will not happen anymore!!
Must go-For those interested in history ,I did a day trip to Hiroshima from Osaka. It only takes an hour to travel the 200-300km between this two distant cities. There atomic bomb dome is an easy tram (streetcar) ride from Hiroshima station. You will know you have reached the station when tourists alight and you can see the dome from the tram. Certainly worth the visit. My family walked around the dome to try to figure out which direction was those world war photos of the done taken. It is a sobering sight and you know that you are in a place with historical significance. Certainly worth a day trip to visit from Osaka.
Evocative,A landmark symbol in the city. On the edge of the peace park/museum. One can only view from outside but a poignant reminder.
Free Tour,We arrived to be greeted by a local  who with a group of others were providing free tours which they do occasionally.   The tour was extremely informative.   This is a must location to visit.
Amazing,"An experience not to be missedThis structure has been tastefully presented for all the world to see, destruction we should never have to experience again.Our few hours here spent amongst hundreds of Japanese school children who are so well behaved and enjoyed communicating with my husband and I Australians.The gardens surrounding this park are well designed and the view from the cenotaph is beautifully designedAn emotional place"
A MUST SEE,"The Atomic Bomb Dome is the ruin that remained after a nuclear bomb exploded, on August 6, 1945, The bomb exploded almost vertically 600m above the police station and the structure was able to withstand the almost vertical blast, everything else in the radius of approximately 1600m was erased. About 100,000 people died in the blast including everyone in that building.The Dome now stands as a memorial to this horrible event and is part of Hirshima Peace Park. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a place to visit and imagine what happened there. Don't miss the Museum that brings more background on the event. Remember that today nuclear weapons are orders of magnitude more potent than this ""tiny"" 15 kiloton bomb."
Majestic view,"A reminder of the attack, this building left in tact after the bombing close to the bridge which was the original target.  A poignant reminder"
Must See,This is very interesting and easy to see on your own. The historical story is well explained on markers as you walk around the dome.
Well preserved,Went as part Inspiring Vacations tour.The Dome was orginally  Hiroshima Perfectual Industrial Promotion Hall and one of the only buildings which was left after the atomic bomb was dropped.
Japan Holiday 2019,"On the 6th of August 1945, at 08:16 the American B29 Superfortress named ""Enola Gay"" dropped an atomic bomb named ""Little Boy"" on Hiroshima.This action transformed WW II, into a nuclear war, Pray we never have another one.The Atomic Dome is located about 100 metres from the Hypocentre, where a hospital has now been built. This is a reminder of the destructive power of an atomic bomb.Just stand at the Dome and close your eyes, and try and imagine what it must have been like. The Shock, the confusion, the chaos. Where would you turn, where would you go, there is nothing left.  This is a very solemn place, and a must to come and see."
Amazing sight really,"It is quite a moving experience to stand for a while and pay homage to the events that took place so long ago,. The city made the right decision to leave it standing."
Moving,Unless you have lived through a bombing you cannot imagine the destruction.  Here you see the result of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.   It was a monument to the ravages of war that I found very moving.
Looks as it does on the pics,Very interesting and amazing it’s still standing. Visited after the museum and peace park and the whole thing was well worth the crowds of tourists and school children.
So moving!,You see the A-Dome as you get off the tram and cross the street. While the building is not large it has an immediate humbling and somber effect and you could see many people tearing up at the site. There are plaques in English explaining the building’s significance but nothing can really convey the emotions it installs. Definitely a must visit.
Impressive when you see what it was before the bomb,"This iconic building is in itself nothing much but it’s instantly recognisable and gives you some idea of the destruction wrought on the city. It’s been preserved as it was immediately after the bombing, including the rubble, and will remain that way as the most obvious reminder of what happened.You can only walk by it but that’s enough. Start here and then visit the Peace Park and the Museum."
Must visit,"I was able to visit the dome area a few times over my 3 days nearby. A walk around the dome area at dawn was a very peaceful, meaningful experience.  Also, the of the end of the day is a good time to visit too.  During the day, the place buzzes with school groups."
Not ever again,"The human race is stupid.  War and hatred thrive. This is a stark reminder that most people just want to live in a peaceful environment. This scene and scenes from the Nazi death camps shows what devastation war brings. This is a somber reminder of lives lost, especially children who have perished through no fault other than being at home or being the wrong religion. Unfortunately it still continues. Take your children and show them this place in the hope they will yearn for peace not twisted hatred imposed on them by governments or dictators. A must see"
Stark reminder of our history ,"We were dropped off at the Atomic Bomb Dome from the jump on jump off bus.When walking up you immediately feel sad, this is literally the last standing structure from the atomic bomb.It was quite heart wrenching as their were Japanese people sobbing as they were standing there.You must come here if you are in Hiroshima-Shi."
DIFFICULT TO EMOTIONALLY ASSESS,"This is a highly visible and, dramatic example of the destructive force of the first atomic bomb used (against civilians) in world history. Certainly a must see after visiting the museum. One of the few structures / city features remaining after the destructive power of ""Little boy""."
Monument to mark the place of the bombing,The remainder of a big hall shows how everything has been destroyed on 6th of August 1945. It marks the place where the a-bomb was dropped. 140.000 people were killed immediately. Seceral other monuments are present in the neighbourhood. Worth a visit
Heart wrenching,Very grounding few hours wandering the Peace Park gardens and dome. Just trying to imagine what it may have been like for these people. 😔
Must see,"Its one of those iconic sites/places that is a must see.    It is startlingly beautiful in some ways - apart from what it symbolises - but the memorial and park hopes for better.  Lots of foot traffic around the base -make sure you cross over the bridge into the park to get the views from there as well - as almost better.BUT this is NOT ground zero of where the bomb actually struck - that is about 150 metres away in a small side alley, just commemorated by a small 'monument' - more a plaque.   Worth googling to 'see it' as this fact in itself was interesting ie the site of ground zero recognised by most as ground zero is not ground zero."
All that's left of the big city.,"The famous genbaku house became a symbol of world war II. It was left in ruins, as was the Kaiser Wilhelm Church in Berlin and the St. Nicholas Church in Hamburg. The former building of the Hiroshima chamber of Commerce and industry was designed by Czech architect Jan Letzel. Being only 200 meters from the epicenter of the explosion, the structure withstood the impact. The only building in the epicenter...Most of Hiroshima was made of wood and burned down. People who were in the epicenter of the explosion, instantly evaporated, enveloped in red-hot plasma, the temperature of which was about 4000 degrees Celsius. Powerful light radiation left only shadows on the walls of houses from human bodies. 9 of the 10 who were in the 800-meter zone from the epicenter of the explosion died instantly. The shock wave swept at a speed of 800 km/h, turning into debris all the buildings in a radius of 4 km, except for a few built with the increased seismic hazard. Letzel building withstood the shock wave thanks to the steel frame. It didn't just melt. As well as high-quality reinforced concrete. After the war, when the citizens of the city began to rebuild Hiroshima again, it was proposed to carry Genbaku. The anti-war movement of the 60s saved the memorial. Activists raised money to strengthen the structure, and collected half a million signatures in the 90's to make the house a world heritage site in 1996. The US government has actively opposed that, because It put Genbaku on a par with Auschwitz and perpetuated the problem of military expediency and compliance with the rules of warfare of the bombing of Hiroshima. The nuclear house continues to be a symbol-a warning to humanity about the catastrophic consequences of the use of nuclear weapons."
Nice park,"The park is well kept and has info about the building and area. It is a nice, somber walk though the park."
peace park,What waste of life’s young and old when the atomic explosion went off the park is awesome place to see the monument to children who died is with paper cranes made by the local school children and the museum is a must see to see the photos
A reminder,"The memorial is free to view with informative information boards in multiple languages available. It is easily accessible from the Hiroshima streetcar network and can be viewed from a relatively short distance from all sides. Some of the efforts made to stabilise to structure for future generations are not especially well hidden, but this may be necessary given the nature and degree of damage to the structure.Unsurprisingly the memorial is free to view, and frankly if I could only visit one place in Hiroshima during a visit, it would be the bomb dome, simply from the significance of its history and what it represents."
Excellent reminder,"This is just a stop on your way, but take a few minutes to contemplate. Its a terrific symbol of the potential horrors that await us if certain irresponsible people are allowed to get their way. View this image from several angles as you walk. It will stay with you."
A somber reminder of war,Amazing that the almost destroyed building has been secured for reminding visitors of the brutality of a war.
Iconic building,"It is a famous image, located next to the river and just across from the memorial park. At risk of collapse, you can just take photos."
War Reminder,"It's one thing to read about atomic bombing of Hiroshima, it's quite another to see the results first hand to see the scope of the devastation."
Unbelievable ,This building was a tiny insight in to what happened on the 6th August 1945 at 08:15. The shell is still intact and the rubble that fell is still where it fell. I felt incredibly overwhelmed at the thought of all the buildings and people that were destroyed. There is a lovely memorial with a burning flame. If you are in the area this is a must see but make sure you pack a tissue!
Enjoy a piece of history! ,"A-bomb dome is what remained after the nuclear bomb on Aug 6, 1945. This is sad reminder of the history. You van located the dome conveniently if you take a sightseeing loop bus from Hiroshima station. It’s about 10 mins bus ride and there’s no entrance fee. Highly recommended to absorb this piece of history..."
A must visit in Hiroshima ,"After went to the museum, came out and walked around.Very sad with what happened in the past.I questioned myself earlier why they keep it to remind themselves everyday but i got the answer now.Great place to remind everyone how bad war is.No matter what there is a better way ti sort it out. #Peace Since not far from my hostel so i also walked there in the night time still not sink in yet"
Memories and thoughts!,"At first I was a bit reluctant to visit the atomic dome or anything associated with the WW2. My father and his family had suffered a lot during the war in Burma and the subsequent. Japanese occupation of Burma.However when I got here and saw the structure, my feeling all changed. It is very well preserved  and presented with a big board detailing the relevant events. Must see if in town, plus the peace park next door."
Sad testiment to the horrors of man,The A Dome is a memorial to how horrible man can be. It is a skeleton left to remind us of the horrors of war and what one nation can do to another. Very moving as it is set against the backdrop of a bustling very alive city.
Quite like nothing on Earth...thankfully,"Visited Hiroshima on a day trip by bullet train from Kyoto and wasn't really sure what to expect.  What I found was an unbelievably vibrant city that tells a story about the dropping of the atom bomb without any self pity or anger towards those responsible.  The Atom Bomb Dome is haunting and strangely enigmatic as it remains a very real memorial to all those killed and effected on the day and aftermath of the dropping of the bomb. It really has to be seen to understand what it represents.  The city have done an amazing job of preserving it and building the memorial park and peace gardens around it.  A short stroll through the park takes you to the museum which tells the story of the atom bomb through the lives of those involved in its development and those killed and affected by it. Just a couple of hundred meters away is the plaque identifying the hypocentre of the explosion, again worth going to see if just to recognise the understated way in which the events of August 6 1945 are remembered. All the signage is translated into English. To get there from the train station, take tram 2 and alight at stop 10."
A bit lost in modern Hiroshima,"This building anchors one end of the Peace Park, and is a bit lost in the background of modern Hiroshima. We found the Peace Memorial Park and Museum to be more significant and memorable, but one must see the atomic bomb dome when in Hiroshima."
Dome still standing tall,Heartwrenching to see the building in it's aftermath.  This building was directly in the path of the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima
Haunting Reminder of Peace at a Cost,This line standing remanant to the A-bomb that decimated this city is stunningly well preserved. It is well worth even a brief stop just to understand first hand the terrible damage done.
Great ,A good view with limited but good signage explaining its history. Nice monuments around the Dome. A must see.
Sight to see and remember,"My wife and I were here on a Gate1 tour, Optional Excursion to Hiroshima and Miyalima. We had never been to Hiroshima before and I was glad to get a chance to visit this place, as well as the various Memorials and World Heritage Sites.The Atomic Dome, all that's left after the atomic bomb (Ground Zero was the Shima Hospital - the Aioi Bridge WAS the original target of 'Enola Gay') exploded.  It is a sight to see, and remember the terrible effects of nuclear weapons.  Very symbolic"
Symbolic,Our visit to Atomic bomb dome was particularly interesting. This is both symbolic of the destructive powers of war and of the resilience of the people of Hiroshima as this building survived.
World Heritage site,This is the only remnant of Hiroshima following the bomb in August 1945. It was decided to leave it stand as a permanent reminder of the atrocity.
A sight to be seen,It is amazing that the building was not completely wiped out and remains in such great condition after the bombing. It stands as as an iconic reminder of a horrific event. At night when light up it is beautiful to see.
The story behind it is very sad..,Guess it is something I've never really considered but a visit her certainly made me think. I hope for no more wars!
A must see ,The atomic bomb is a must see to remind us of our horrific world history and why we as a society should not be using weapons of mass destruction.
Absolutely fantastic,Easy to access with jr pass by using the red hop on and off bus. The dome is an amazing piece of history that is an absolute must see. Close to the other monuments an museums relating to the a bomb. Makes you think about the grief caused by war and nuclear bombs.
"Very somber, moving memorial","This, along with the neighboring Peace Park, is a must-see for visitors to Hiroshima.  It's an eerie monument to a horrific event.  There are pictures and descriptions of what it was like before the bomb hit, and it is worth taking some time to contemplate."
Sobering View,"We traveled here with our ten year old son to see the dome, park and museum.  I think this building had the biggest impact because of the man who came to speak to us who was a survivor.  He has written books that are laid out on the curb by the Dome explanation board in several languages.  His book answered many of our ten year old’s questions and provided background, pictures and his family’s story.  We spent lots of time talking to him, reading and just absorbing the scene.  He said he has come everyday for several years.  If you get the chance talk to him, otherwise take a look at the books."
A must visit in conjunction with Peace Memorial Museums & Park,It is a sobering place to visit and contemplate.  Easily visited in your isit to the Peace Memorial Park and Museums.
Sad,Sad place but visit is necessary to remind the mankind about the danger of nuclear weapons. Worth visiting.
Worth a visit,"This is a must see, even if it is just a building and nothing to see. Brings home the whole history of the place."
Solemn Reminder,It is really humbling to see the stark reminder of the first ever nuclear bomb to hit humankind in 1945......and for generations to come a lesson not to use nuclear weapons that only cause destruction. Hiroshima city has now been rebuilt and is a testimony to Japanese perseverance and hardwork
Better in person,"Even though I've seen many pictures of this structure and seen it on tv, just being there gave me a different experience and appreciation for what this area went through at the time of the bombing.  Glad the city preserved this historical landmark for others to learn from it."
Very Sombre and surreal,An impressive yet sombre reflection on the history of Hiroshima. An eerie reminder of the power and destructive capability of these devices.
no more than a photo opportunity,it's an historical monument and you simply can't ignore it but other than taking a photo there is nothing else to do here.
a moving place,it is hard not to cry when standing in front of the atomic bomb dome. It brings the horror of the bomb close to one's heart.
Must-see in Hiroshima,"This is the must iconic picture of Hiroshima. Last surviving building of the atomic bomb.  Much more impressive in real-life than pictures.  From Hiroshima train Station, easiest to get to by JR bus with takes you to main sights throughout the city.  Get on & off at your leisure. Three different color buses with slightly different routes but all stop at the Atomic Dome.  This bus is if you have the JR West region train pass or just purchase day pass at the station."
Such a moving memorial,I went there with my guide Jasmine from Maction Planet. Of course this is very powerful spot. I cried thinking about the devastation. I hope never again anyone has to experience the horror.
Chilling ,"This is of course a very chilling place to visit. It avoids the mistake I’ve felt has been made in some other memorials visited to give them a theme or even a bias. Here it’s left for you to decide how you feel, which makes it all the more powerful. Of course it’s right by the Peace Park but by being across the river it feels independent of it. It’s certainly the most depressing place I’ve been to, especially when put into the context of there now being tens of thousands of these weapons, most more powerful than this one was, in various hands around the world. I can’t imagine too many people come here and leave thinking nuclear arms are a positive development for our species."
Excellant / sobering ,Trying to imagine what happened and how it felt to survive and see this catastrophe... the dome the only surviving building ? Lots of reading with  history very good !
A reminder that shouldn't exist,"The Atomic Bomb Dome is a straightforward visit if you are in Hiroshima. However, you are keenly reminded that it is something you should have never had to see.It certainly brings the horror of war to the front of the mind."
Sombre Rememberance,A profound experience.  It is a reminder of the horrors of war and weapons of mass destruction. Hard to believe the horror that happened here when visiting on this sunny beautiful day some 73 years later.
Very Unique Place,"The Atomic bomb dome is possibly the most recognisable structure in Japan and is almost unique in human kind. I'm a keen photographer and the site has many opportunities for excellent photos , however I'd say be respectful, I saw people taking selfies , in my book of ethics this is wrong.If you walk around the site you'll often see school children paying homage at the children's memorial, something that I found quite touching .There is a ""walk"" you can do of structures relevant to that day , structures which are still present either in part or complete which help to colour in the story."
human exprience,"we had a walk at evening of the 6th of august, just arrived from europe. A very sad commemoration day. A very silent atmosphere, all the people were lifting lantern to the sky and small paper boats floating on the river with a candle in. Every human shall experience such unforgettable lesson, goose bumps on my skin!"
Unmissable,"Part of our Riviera Trip to Hiroshima, the whole place was very moving and a must see for all visitors to Japan"
Interesting place,This is a really interesting place to visit considering the history. It is by the side of the river and close to the peace park and is well worth a visit.
Haunting,"I walked around the atomic bomb dome a few times. For me, it was haunting and symbolic seeing this structure still standing. It represents the horror of what happened but also defiance and hope. A must see."
had to be done: very emotional visit.,It's very moving. Makes you think about that nutter in the White House. Let's hope we get him out and away from buttons.
One off the bucket list.,"It has been my desire to visit this historic site for many years and I was not dissapointed. Remarkably the structure of the building withstood the atom bomb blast, this has been preserved and the rubble still lies around the building where it fell on the day.A somber reminder of the effects of war."
Monument to commemorate A Bom dropping Hiroshima,"This remember anchor as a result of the A bom dropping on Hirosima is one of the most impressive existing icons of that event. Sitting on the othe site of the Motuyasakawa river, sitting on a bench with eyesite directly on that Dome building, one might contemplate on that event, what it did to the citizens of Hiroshima and the world as a whole, responsible for the blast.....you would wish that there will never ever happen such a thing ever....anymore..... but Nagasaki was there to be targeted...... days later....."
Awesome ,"It really hits you as to how horrific the bombing was, vaporizing people and buildings.  This building was extremely close to ground zero and stands as a reminder of war."
WOW...sobering,The Atomic Bomb Dome was the only structure left standing in the area where the first atomic bomb exploded on 6 August 1945. It is a skeleton of a building and serves as a symbol of both the horrors of atomic war and the hope for world peace. This needs to be seen inconjunction with the Memorial Peace Park and the Peace Museum.
A must see if visiting Japan,"This spot is eerie yet beautiful, sobering and educational. One is impelled to pray for peace in a new way. The museum nearby is very well done and was inexpensive to enter. Spend two hours in this area."
Moving sight,"A place you have to visit, but such sad memories that go with it. The Peace park is an oasis of calm in a busy city"
A moving experience,The site of one of the most significant events in human history.  There is not a lot to do here except soak in the somber and emotional feelings this place invokes. A must see. I loved it and it is worth watching a number of documentaries available on you tube about the dropping of the bomb.  I watched them whilst I was here and it certainly enhanced the exoerience.
Special sight,I guess it’s more about what it symbolises rather than the structure that remains but I found it very moving and the view along from the peace gardens very cleverly thought through. If you visit Hiroshima you would visit.
Very moving monument,"Out of all the monuments in Hiroshima,  this building gives the best appreciation of the disaster that took place when the Atomic bomb sell a few hundred yards away from the building.  It remains untouched,  apart from help to make it safe. It marks the spot where 70000 people died in an instant. Let us never forget"
Bomb Dome,"We visited recently, staying in a nearby hotel. We were in awe of the presence of the building and how they have preserved the structure. A fantastic walk along the promenade of peace, a must do to understand the history and effort Hiroshima has put in to rebuild their community."
Must see,Go to this peace monument area to see the building which was one of some still standing after the atomic bomb detonated. It’s the last building and now a monument for peace.
Very sober,I guess it's a must see if your coming yo Hiroshima. The place gives you shivers but the park around is very peaceful.
A somber reminder of the events of 1945,It is good that the decision was made to retain this symbol of the atom bomb that hit Hiroshima. It is definitely a place to remember all those who died and hopefully a reminder to never let such a terrible event ever happen again.A definite symbol of Hiroshima.
Very sobering,Definitely worth seeing. Surprised it was still left standing considering location so close to ground zero. The photos nearby showing the devastation certainly make you think about the hazards of nuclear war.
Emotional,A very emotional experience - desperately sad but the people have a huge air of hope. Worth a visit - just expect tears if you start thinking about it too much
Unreal,"It's just unreal that this was still standing after the atomic bomb and still is standing today. Even in this condition it's a beautiful building surrounded by beautiful grounds in a growing and vibrant city. There's a plaque telling about the building in both Japanese and English. It's free and within walking distance of the peace memorials and museums. Plenty of parking garages, taxis, and food options. We were there when cherry blossoms were blooming and the parks were beautiful. Lots of people, but it didn't feel crowded."
Very moving,Unbelievable to see that this building survived the bomb. A real must see if in Hiroshima.Near to the museum and other memorials. Looked simply stunning with the cherry blossoms.A poignant reminder of the devastation  unleashed in this town.Lest we forget.
Harrowing.,It's absolutely gobsmacking that this building has survived. It's obviously a stark reminder of the tragedy that occurred but it's also symbolic of how the city rebuilt itself from this awful disaster.
Serene,Visited as the blossoms were coming out. Very pretty. A lot of people about but as the area is huge it did not feel crowded. Went to Sogo nearby bought some sashemi and had a picnic in the park under the Sakura blossoms
Stunning ,Worth a visit de to the historical importance. The building is also along the river and next to the Peace Memorial Park which makes the area a nice open space to enjoy picnics and viewing the cherry blossoms that line the river
Very moving,"Incredible moving area of the Hiroshima which childrens peace park, and other monuments recognising the devastation of the atomic bomb in close proximity.  Do not go to Hiroshima without visiting.  Well documented"
Sobering but beautiful,Part of the visit to the park and museum. A good long morning walk through with many places to see. Not worth stopping for solely but everything is all together anyway.
Take a moment,Really important to have saved this feature of devastation for warning and reflection and awe. Lest We Forget
Historical Site,Looks best at night when it is lit up with lights. Good for photos and there are some plaques that tell its history.
the atomic dome was one of reasons to come to Hiroshima,"We came as a family of 5 and lol of us felt humbled to have visited, it makes you think but is not so depressing that it would make you sorry to have come, it is fantastic that it has been preserved -"
Well preserved reminder of the results of our actions and choices.,This is a beautiful and popular destination. You can walk along the river from Peace Boulevard to the structure.  There are a few statues and reminders spaced along the river walk between restaurants as you approach the site. And then you are there. It is a popular location for tourists and school children. Just be sure you treat it with the respect it deserves. Across the river is another part of the site that you really should take the time to explore. If you pay attention you will find street maps on the site that mark the epicenter of the blast. The marker it self is underwhelming considering the importance of it but is worth the effort to find if only for your own sake.
This is the reason you came to Hiroshima. Right?,Obviously the reason we made the trip here. A memory of the last standing before the A-bomb hit ground zero. A symbol of the moment before everything changed
A stark reminder of the devastation,It's hard to imagine just how devastating the damage was until you see this stark reminder. It's somehow both haunting and beautiful.
Who give it an average?,"The place has all the significance possible, you can give it any meaning you want and it’s an image tattooed in everyone’s brain about the atomic power, probably next to the mushroom. A must see, period."
Awesome sight,The whole a-bomb area makes you think. Its a must visit place. The museum to the dead was another stunning place but everything is worth seeing and walking around
Educational remains of war,We spent less than 15mins at this monument as there were not much materials other than this building/ dome that stands till this day. Would hope they will provide more information material of the war.
atomic bomb dome,very solemn area need time to soak in the area especially memorial  need at least i hour alone to cover it all
A very Solemn place,"Always wanted to visit the Dome at Hiroshima. The place is peaceful and sites around the area make you feel the destruction that was caused on Aug 6 1945. I would recommend you visit this site, it will leave you amazed."
historical,A very nice historical relic from world war 2. Must visit if you are in this city to learn a bit more.
The A-Bomb Dome Experience ,"It’s a place of horror and unspeakable sadness in broad daylight. That day in August of 1945. Right at the moment you gaze at what’s left of what used to be a convention hall.Be prepared to be disheveled as soon as you see the structure. The intensity of disarrayed emotions gets stronger as you try to peek into the inside of the building, looking at the pieces of charred bricks scattered on the floor. It’s as if there are eyes looking back at you from the inside."
Amazing structure,This structure must be one of the most famous sights seen after the atomic bomb created such devastation on Hiroshima. A must see for anyone who has read about or seen pictures of the atomic bomb attack.
Wonderful to see,"Walking around Hiroshima, you'll pass the bomb dome frequently, and it's a reminder of history. It is fenced off, so you don't go through the building or learn much beyond some signs. But perhaps the point is it serving as a reminder, and it that way it serves well."
Impressive,"This is rather simple monument, but the environment and its history makes it very impressive. This reminds us of the dangers of war and especially nuclear ones."
A must see,We spent an afternoon walking around the gardens and the bomb site. The way it had been presented is beautiful and the place is so peaceful. It a great place to reflect and learn. If your in Hiroshima visit here first.
Iconic reminder of war horrors,I first visited Genbaku Dome in 2015 but it was scaffolded and covered up for restoration works. Now finally able to admire this magnificent building which somehow survived complete destruction despite almost directly underneath the explosion. Am glad I made the right decision as to whether to detour to Hiroshima on the way back to Kokura after a daytrip to Hagi.
Moving memorial to the tragedy of the atom bomb,"An iconic building and survivir of the atom bomb attack, you need to see it on any visit to Hiroshima."
Incredible to see in person!,Everyone should visit this part of Hiroshima and see such an important part of history and pay respect to all the victims.
Emotional visit but I would not have missed it.,"We all know the story.  We've all seen the pictures.  I read up on the war in preparation of my visit, but my emotions got the best of me when I saw this building.   War is never good, and many good people die as a result on both sides.  We had several Japanese approach us and want to talk to us and know where we were from.  Others just wished us a pleasant time in their city.  The people are warm and welcoming and the dome is a reminder that their hope for all mankind is Peace.  The entire Peace Memorial grounds are beautifully done and this is worth your time."
Think and reflect,"How on earth does one rate this as an ""attraction""?  It's one of those sites that everyone who is able to should visit just to reflect on the horrors of war.  A short way (about 200 metres) from the hypercentre of the atomic explosion the remains of the building stand as a stark reminder of the horror inflicted on that day three quarters of a century ago.  At one time there had been plans to pull the remains of the building down but now it has been perserved as a reminder.  I just stood and reflected and felt an over whelming sense of sadness at the cruelty and awfulness of the human race and the horrors people inflict on each other."
A haunting experience,"This is just the shell of the building which can only be viewed from outside the fence. It's the most well known memorial in the city. You make of it what you will, I found the best view was on my own on the otherside of the river. I found though walking around the city the small memorials & descriptions probably more moving as they talked of real lives & what it cost as well as heroism as at the railway station."
The little that remains,"Just off from the epicenter of the attack, the dome’s remnants remind us of the people and buildings vaporized when the bomb detonated 600m above the city."
The A-Bomb Dome in Hiroshima - Somewhere the mind comes!,"This monument / building entered the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1996 to remind everyone in future generations of the cruel consequences of using nuclear weapons.The building from 1915 was designed by a Czech architect as a signal building. It was initially an exhibition / trade fair hall, but contained in the final phase public offices and especially in timber trade.On August 6, 1945, at 08:15 AM, most of the city was transformed into dust and dirt. The reason why this building was relatively good was its close proximity to the 0-point of the bomb. This point was 600 m above and 160 m southeast of the building.There was a great discussion among the population, which was split if the building was to be destroyed or preserved. In 1966, it was agreed and decisions on conservation and continuous maintenance were implemented the following year.When you turn your back on and leave places like this, the mind comes and it takes some time to get back in again."
A World Heritage Site not to be missed,"Combined with a visit to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum this is an iconic landmark that you must visit. I read on a sign that the government of the time had debated whether the ruins of the dome building should be demolished or preserved, and I'm so glad they chose the latter. It is a fabulous, albeit sobering, memorial to the terrible tragedy of the worlds first atomic bomb attack."
Moving experience at the Atomic Bomb Dome,My family traveled from Tokyo to Hiroshima and spent a day touring the Peace Memorial Park and Atomic Bomb Dome.   to say it was moving is inadequate.   I am incredibly grateful that we were able to visit this site and reflect on our history.   This is a very walkable experience and one can see the Museum and many monuments in a half day.
Emotional visit,"This is a MUST SEE place.  It left me emotional to think of the devastation caused by August 6, 1945 - 8:15 AM event."
Sad,A painful and sad lesson to learnt. Hope all people in the world will not let it repeat again. We all do a part to Ensure this will never happen again
Memorable,Very emotional  historic building. A must see at night when lite up. Can be a bit crowded during the day but patience will reward a good view close up or cross the river to the peace park for just a good view.
A world treasure and symbol,"Looking at this structure, I see birds on its walls, beams, and stones.  So glad that nature and life returned.  I look at some of the rubble and stones on the ground, and think anywhere else this would be decay and something in needs to be disposed of.  Here, these rocks are world treasures."
Make the trip if your in Hiroshima,Combine your visit to the Atomic Bomb Dome with Peace Memorial Park. There are lots of signs around in English and Japanese to explain the history of the place.
historical tragedy,This building is the evidence for the historical tragedy. I think Japanese government has done well for the heritage preservation.
