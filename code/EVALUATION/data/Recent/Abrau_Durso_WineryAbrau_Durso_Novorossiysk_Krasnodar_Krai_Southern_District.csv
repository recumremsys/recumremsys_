Sparkling wine heaven!,"Interesting historical and winemaking  tour and extensive tasting of their methode champenoise and Charmat sparkling wines. Arranged beforehand for an English speaking guide which was great! Nice shop to buy bubbly and other items eg their own cheese. The site also has a hotel, lots of restaurants, a boat trip on the lake, art exhibitions and a park. Could be an outing for a whole day!"
Best sparkling wine in Russia,Can highly recommend the wine tour and tasting. This winery has a rich history and has elegantly transitioned to a 21st century quality wine producer. Had an interesting experience in the virtual interactive art studio. All round memorable experience.
Russian spark vine production place.,"We were in the place already 3 times – and we will definitely come again. The vine factory located in a beautiful place, you can take a tour on the factory itself – you will see all production cycle of spark vine? After vine tasting you can purchase what you like what we did all the time."
Fascinating glimpse of modern updating of Russia's answer to Moet & Chandon,"This 19th century winery provided 'Champagne' for the Czars. Today, it's one of the most popular tourist venues in the country, incongruously set a small lakeside village"
"Something from your ""must"" list.","It isn't ""on the way"" destination and more likely you'll not be able to do a lot after the wine testing. The cradle of the Russian Champagne and Sparking wine beside the wine testing and the excursion has a lot more around to look at! May I just suggest to the winery directors to extend their 'exclusive' excursions to one more hour at least? And yet NEVER insist to accomplish the excursion unless glasses are not empty.The time we had was quite limited and it was really pity to leave."
Amazing winery in Russia,". It is not quite easy to find a place as you need to fly to Anapa or Krasnodar and than travel for couple of hours in a taxi, but it worth seeing! I enjoyed the tour around the tunnels built in 1870 and was delighted by a very pofessional guided excursion through all the stages of making one of my favortite drinks. It is not an ordinary sparkling wine, but exclusive ""champagne"" made using the procedure implemented in Russia by the French champagne producers.You can stay in a cosy 4* Imperial hotel ( btw, they serve Champagne for breakfast ;) and enjoy friendly and genuine service."
worths to visit,a very interesting excursion for someone who is close to abrau durso. you will learn some things about wine and champagne and you will see the procedure of making champagne. In the end they give you to taste 5 different champagnes.. there is a shop outside where you can buy drinks with fare prices.
Great Place to Visit,"I have visited the winery with my girlfriends and was pleasantly surprised. Everything was at ""european"" level. Very knowledgable guide, great wine, definitely something to pay a visit whilst at the Black See. I would also recommend to get a bottle of Brute and drink it at the sunset on Abrau Lake (right outside of winery).P.S. Excursions can be walked both in English and Russian"
Champagne,"A well worth while visit to this famous winery that has a long history. You might get lucky and find a person who can speak English otherwise presently it's all in Russian. At the end you get a free taste of 6 different Champagnes and prices in the shop are good. The area is now well developed and has a range of restaurants and cafes, a small market and the lake for a boat trip. Pick summer though."
"as with 3 mechelin star restaurants, this place deserves a visit on its own","swimming in the lake, underground tunnels, very knowledgable guides that have sparks in their eyes when talking about Abray rather than mumbling routine words, weather,  sparkling wine, sparkling wine, sparkling wine."
