So good! ,"Great place to have a walk, ride a bicycle or even a horse. A lot of attractions for kids, spots to have a launch and so on!"
"An interesting walk through en route to, ummm nothing.","Firstly, my visit to the park was purely an accident as I was looking for the suggested location of the Memorial Complex to Defenders of the Motherland, which for some reason in July (it may still do so) was shown in completely the wrong place by Tripadvisors map application.Anyway, back to the park, it was featuring a decorative rather large football/globe whilst I was there, during the World Cup; a modern amusement park, and a relatively unspectacular memorial to Tula's Soviet Hero City status, attained as a result of the Great patriotic War as it is known locally, or the superpower abbreviated World War as the USSR and USA should know it. The memorial featured a couple of small artillery pieces on plinths/come gate posts and the usual 12/13 smaller plinths featured the Hero City Star and city or in Brest's case the fortress name.The park was well maintained, and had lots of seating; it was definitely a nice place to stop for a rest en route to my non-existent target, and if you were in Tula with children on a nice day would certainly keep them entertained for a while.The park also seemed to include a petting zoo for children, and a couple of pleasant lakes, along with well maintained and segregated cycle paths, for anyone wanting a relaxing, traffic free cycle ride in the city."
One of the largest and the best parks,"Tula citizens and guests love to visit the Central park. It's huge and offers divers activities for all ages, genders and tastes.Moms go there with their children, couples walk there and friends chat and enjoy amusement rides. One can practice any sports there even the moxt exotic. Last time there I was jumping in kangoo shoes with my gym peers. Not to miss!"
excellent place for kids and all,"Very green, clean and joyful place with lots of rides and eating points.  Skates in summers and sledges in winter are quite popular.  must visit place in the centre of Tula."
"Huge park, full of attractions","A lot of fun for families: bicycles, scooters, attractions, carousels for kids. Nice park for amazing family weekend"
All in one place,"The place for any kind of activities. You can work out here, play chess, even taste a huge number of food. You can find what ever you want here."
Fun for all ages ,"The roads have recently been fixed, now it's a park that's perfect for skateboarding, biking, rollerblades, scooters - you name it. lots of attractions for kids and adults alike. Good place for a picnic, a romantic day out, for a meeting place with friends. I love it"
Good for walking and for sport,"This is an old Tula park, which was recently greatly refreshed - all roads are fixed and new places for the rest appeared. This park is great for everything - walking, playing with kids, riding a bicycle, sports. The must see place in Tula"
Very nice place in Tula,"The best place for sports like roller skating, ice-skating, running, jogging, playing table tennis, football, etc. You can hire bicycle, rollers in summer, skates and sky shoes in winter. You could also swim in the pond in summer: clean, safe, beautiful )) There is a small amusement park for children.Very nice atmosphere and clean air, especially in the morning. It also nice to take photos there! Great fountains!"
Park in the town center,"Quiet and pleasant place for walk. It is located practically in the downtown. Very green, it is well planned. Pure and convenient paths. Squirrels run.Shortcoming - schemes of park. It isn't enough of them and they aren't really convenient."
