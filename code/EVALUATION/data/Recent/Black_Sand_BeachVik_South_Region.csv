Interesting experience,"We have visited the Vik black beach when stopping over in Vik. It is just like a ‚Äònormal‚Äô beach, but then the ‚Äòsand‚Äô is pitch-black.Not a place to spend time, but interesting to see"
Great beach with lots of interesting cliff faces.,"A lovely beach which is unlike any other, a bit difficult to park but apart from that it‚Äôs definitely worth the visit, however I‚Äôd recommend going to Vikurfjara instead as it‚Äôs much better and is the other side of black sand beach behind V√≠k."
cool place,the black send is just amazing. But it is best with glaciers on at the diamond beach. But still it would be a good stop if it is on your way.
Must see!,"We were supposed to be snowmobiling, but it was cancelled due to the weather, so had no choice but to join the rest of our tour group to this beach. Never have I been so grateful for a cancellation. What a place this is. Mother nature at her absolute finest. Loved it!!"
Unique place,Vik is amazing place.  Beach and the view of the rocks is stunning. A long strip of black sand under the rocks and impressive cliffs overlooking V√≠k.The scenery is really beatiful and will give you some great photos.  You can get a nice view of the whole by entering a small church on the hill. Absolutely beautiful picturesque beach.
"Crowded, limited parking, tide came in fast","We had a difficult time finding parking, and this was around lunch time. Once we walked out there, there was a TON of people, which we found surprising in March! Also, the tide was coming in quickly, and there are warnings about ""sneaker waves"" everywhere that will take you out to sea, so we had to make it a quick visit."
Overall A Highlight of Our Trip,"We visited Vik in early March on a sunny, cold late afternoon. The black sand beach, washed up volcanic rock, rough ocean surf, and scenic snowy volcanos make this a beautiful stop. We loved the ‚Äúfeel‚Äù of Vik and would love to visit some day again."
Pictures don‚Äôt do justice,We arrived to angry weather. The old man in the sea was pissed. Waves crashing with scary winds in tow. Next day was calm and scenic.  Black sand offset by sea foam and a snowy backdrop is something the eyes must dance upon once in your life.
TOTAL BLACK,Black is beauty seen is believable. Very nice beach total black. Must visit this place if you happen to be in Iceland
What a walk,Stumbled upon this location while driving the island. Decided  to walk the path from the parking to the beach without reading the information  board....2+ miles one way but worth it. The black sand contrasting with the fresh snow made for amazing pictures
Soft find black sand,"Lovely sand, much less coarse than the beaches on Maui. Covered in snow today. A pretty mix. I was expecting it to be little rocks"
Beauty of the nature!,It really takes your breath away! I totally recommend this place for visiting!The only thing is that it is quite windy:)
Watch out,What a lovely location and stunning views. Don‚Äôt turn your back on the sea. It is a very dangerous beach. Respect it enjoy it. Great food at the cafe.
Don‚Äôt pass through without stopping!,"This is an amazing place, unlike anything I have ever seen. You can spend anytime from 19 minutes to grab some photos or many hours to wander and loose yourself. There is a free car park right on the beach close to the facilities of Vik. Enjoy!"
BEAUTY,One of the prettiest beaches I have ever been on.  Our pics look like they were in black and white with the snow on top of the sand. :)
Beautiful Out-Of-This-World Landscape,"Visiting here felt like a visit to another planet, the rock formations, black pebbles and the coastline are like nothing I'd ever seen before. This is truly a unique landscape and unforgettable experience."
Wide view over black sand beach,"Make sure to wear something warm when visiting in the winter. Because of the wind and water everywhere it can get a bit cold. Navigate with your car to the parking lot of black sand beach and you can make some nice hikes wit astonishing views! Good to know, there is a toilet at the parking lot!"
Mesmerizing,The drive to the black sand beaches has many interesting stops not to be missed.  The black beaches themselves are beautiful and mystical.  I am so happy we decided to venture out there.
Nature at its best,"Breath taking beauty, we visited jan wild weather was advised not to go to near sea it was manic waves, ventured quite near and was like a set from a movie stunningüëåüèª‚ù§Ô∏è"
Reynisfjara Black Sand and Basalt Formation,"It is located in the south coast of Iceland near the little town of Vik.I've been to black sand beaches from the Caribbean and the Philippines but this beach do not have fine sand but black gravels and pebbles. This is a beautiful non tropical beach. The picturesque beach includes caves, basalt formation and two rock formations in the sea.  It was the film locations for Game of Thrones, Rogue 1 and Noah.Please be warned that beach has extremely strong water and often push a lot further up the beach than one might expect.  This is a must see attraction in Iceland, Usually included in the South Coast Tour."
WAVES,Great visit to black beach. There is a cafe & toilets which you have to pay for. The basalt rock formation on the beach is great. The waves crash in an just a word of warning be aware of the sneaker waves which have taken lives of tourists in recent years.
Black Everywhere ,"It is an impressive place, our visit was in April and we had a very rainy and cloudy day, even so you can admire its imposing rocks that look like a perfect set of placed chips is very impressive to see.  The sand is like very small stones completely black.  on a windy day the waves are quite strong and dangerous.  Without a doubt it is a place that you should see on your visit."
worth a visit,"A few friends and I went to the Reynisfjara Black Sand beach in a rental car, and while there are a lot of tourists here, I thought it was a fun natural wonder that is worth a visit.This is kind of in a secluded place, but you can pair this visit with a visit to the nearby town of the V√≠k for lunch and some different views.The beach itself is rather upfront. It‚Äôs about half a football field of black pebbles (more than sand) of varying sizes. You can‚Äôt exactly get sand in between your toes here, but it is still an interesting texture.There are also some very cool rock formations for some pictures, but the water can be treacherous and there are signs everywhere to be careful because this is Iceland‚Äôs ‚Äúdeadliest beach.‚Äú"
Day trip from Reykjavik,"Well worth the drive or excursion,wonderful views on the journey down too make a day of it.3 waterfalls on the way plus the plane wreck and if the weather is good walk up to the glacier."
Another sand beach,"Nothing so especial to see. The Island have plenty of black sand beaches (not so large, it is true), but with a lot less turists."
A must see in Iceland!,Beautiful beach! We were lucky enough to be on the beach by ourselves before sunset. We saw hundreds of puffins (in August). It's very windy and can get chilly so make sure to bring your jacket/wind gear.
are you taking black and white photos?,"Amazing place. Big, strong and noisy waves crashing on the black rocks and sand beach under a grey sky... Wow.  Friends that I sent pictures to asked me whether I am taking B&W pictures. No; those were the colors that day. One needs to see it to believe."
Black Sand,Black sand beach Iceland is something to behold. So different and absolutely stunning. A very popular area. Models were there being photographed.
Like someone from out of space has created the rocks on the beach,"Simply amazing!  Stunning nature and totally worth the stop and walk. Again, we did this as part of Southshore tour and I didn't like being rushed. Rent a car and do it your way. You need at least 30-45 min on the beach and the restaurant near the beach offers a nice lunch break too. The rocks are amazing and it does feel that some other creatures has created them - can't be that sand, water and sun could have done it!"
Beautiful little village,"Our day trip to Vik was an amazing experience.  The black sand beach was of course the highlight, however there were many sights on the way from Reykjavik. Definitely recommend a day trip while visiting the  capitol city."
Be aware ,We went in the middle of winter but please be aware of 'sneaker waves' We saw quite a few people get wet and fall over due to the impact of the waves. Don't get caught out!
Beautiful! ,"This beach is simply gorgeous with clear ocean views if the islands! We went towards the end of daylight & high tide. The water is VERY VERY dangerous as people have drowned & the waters were at least 2+metres high! The way the beach is formed develop massive rip currents. There are warning signs as to not turn your back in the water as there are ""sneaker"" waves that can sneak up on you. Must see to appreciate!"
Beautiful.,"From the view points high above looking down on the beach was amazing, black sand contrasted with the white snow was so beautiful."
Great experience but...,"I went to the Reynisfjara Back Sand beach very, very early in the morning in December 2019 (actually today). And this for taking pictures of the sunrise there. To make it short, it was a super great experience, I got great shots. But: you are better there very early - best close to sunrise - because there are hordes of Chinese tourists unloaded after sunrise. Really a horrible experience because they care about nothing there, including potential danger of Sneaker Waves."
"Very beautiful, must see! ",The blank sand beach is a must see place if you travel to Iceland! It is unique and amazingly beautiful! Highly recommended!
Black Sand Beach,"Love it... beautiful to visit, especially for the game of throne fans.   Vik is a nice town for a stroll and something to eat"
a supernatural sight,Iceland has the most beautiful natural sights I have ever seen. This one is one of the most impressive.
Crowded,"This is a great place for photos. The deep black vulcanic sand and the rough shore and ocean make for a great scene. Good luck finding a place with no people though. Everyone thinks this is a nice place. My top tip: wear good shoes and be prepared to walk 400m on the beach. There you will have the same black sand beach, but for your own."
Shining black sand,It's lava sand & yes shining black. Best time to walk along the beach is in the afternoon when the sun started to settle down and light playing magic on the sand and the ocean.
Relaxing,"Stunning place, very quiet and relaxing and an excellent place to watch the sunset. Don't go too close to the sea though as the waves come out of nowhere and can be dangerous."
Beautiful,"It was raining but the beach is beautiful and absolutely worth it! Be careful with the waves though, they are powerful and very dangerous"
Fantastic! ,"It was lashing rain, windy and an incredible day, but so exciting, the waves were really deadly and you couldn‚Äôt walk far it was so wet and cold, but I really enjoyed it. We ate in the cafe and I would recommend the soup, ¬£9 but well worth it as you can refil and my husband did he had the meat soup and I had parsnip soup, help yourself to bread and butter. Very good visit. Free car park."
All black,Very interesting beach as it's all black because of the basalt lava. Well worth a visit. Powerful waves and stunning nature.
Awesome.,It is just so interesting to see the long stretch of black sand on the beaches and think about the volcanic effects...fantastic.
Mother natures power!,"Rule #1 Hold onto your door with 2 hands as the wind is POWERFUL and nearly ripped off our Toyota Land Cruiser door from the parkling lot.....and yes the rental agency warned us of this.   The wind was fierce and unlike anything we have experienced.  As you got to the open beach you could not look into the wind because the sand was being whipped around and hurt when it hit you.  I had fleece lined tights and my calves were stinging.   When you do find a place you can look, it is beautiful!!!!  The waves are so powerful and you need to take extra caution as the waves can sneak up on you and wash you away....NO JOKE!!!!   Be safe and enjoy the scenery."
Iceland bus tour with Mayflower ,"Been rainy some days, been windy some days, been enjoyable every day! Have not seen the Northern Lights yet! Whale watching was canceled due to weather but the Museum helped fill that void especially the Fly Over Iceland."
What more can I say?,"This is beach fascinating and the color of the small rocks are amazing.The landscape is fantastic, kind of futuristic!"
BEST AT SUNSET,As part of a 2 day trip from Reykjavik we visited here after the two waterfalls (Seljaladfoss & Skogafoss) and arrived at sunset which made it a wonderful experience. There's easy access via large car park and an excellent restaurant for hot chocolates afterwards! The beach is so unusual and at the east end has a stack of volcano hexangle rocks (like Devils Causeway in Northern Ireland!) which seems to be a mecca for selfies etc.The surrounding rocks and isalnd make it very photogenic - if you have time you can drive at low tide across to the isalnd which has amazing views including a rock arch.
Interesting ,Definitely worth a visit. We were a mixed age group family and all enjoyed seeing the beach. Very different to our beaches at home!!
Visit on tour of south coast,Had seen the pictures and wanted to visit to check out the sand and the columns. Fascinating place and very interesting. Was on a passing visit so didn‚Äôt stop in the cafe but it looked and smelled nice
Black paradise,"We got up early in order to have good light but, unfortunately, it was cloudy. however, the strength of the sea together with the black sand and basalt columns made it special. Great views also from the light house that is located to the right of the beach (but the access is through a different road. I have heard that you can see puffins there in summer time."
Always have to alert the weather before visit,"We visited the beach during a day before sand storm. We the wind is strong and the weather is cold. We have we need to wear the sunglasses to avoid the sand hurt our eyes. Basically we can't take a nice photo or walk through the beach due to the bad weather.But if the weather is good, this beach must be visit and worth to stay around"
Watch your back,"We stopped here at the Black Sands Beach following our glacier hike. The beach is beautiful but it is quite crowded and has the usual photo-op people dressed as Vikings just like the gladiators that hang around the coliseum in Rome. I guess the Game of Thrones attachment has not yet worn off. Still it is a beautiful place but watch out for the ""sneaker waves"" that have actually taken the lives of some tourists. The view up and down the beach is amazing."
Great day,"Great place to spend some time... We even spot a seal! Take some time to watch the icebergs moving, it's awesome"
Loved it here!,"A lovely walk along the black sandy beach, didn‚Äôt think the sand would be that black, but it really is!"
So Cool,"Take the time to walk the beach, enjoy the water and the views.  It is beautiful and close to most everything."
If you like geology this is the place.,"Iceland is a breathtaking world of geology. We visited as my teenage son is interested to study geology at university. There are lots of mountains and waterfalls and I struggled to see the point of visiting the black sand beach. How wrong I was. This has some of the most amazing sights, the cliffs were a sea of different rock forms and on a warmer day we could have studied them for hours.I feel I no longer need to see the giants causeway, as these a just a fraction of the rock forms present. Unfortunately strong winds and sub zero conditions drove us inside, but this is a must see attraction."
Stunning black beach with huge crashing waves,We arrived at 8.45am and beach car park already pretty full with other tourists. Even a few Chinese modelling shoots going on!Impressive basalt hexagonal sea stacks and huge crashing ‚Äòsneaker‚Äô waves. Lots of signs warning you to not get too close to the sea as real danger of being swept out. Very windy when we were there. Cafe & toilets in car park but not open when we were there. Definitely a beach worthy of visiting.
Wind and sand,Come prepared for the trip - we hit a lot of wind and sand was whipping everywhere so just be aware. Awesome time and had fun with even losing a hat off the side of cliff. Worth the stop.
Very cool but lots of people,We were there during the off season but the beach was still very busy with tourist.  We tried to stop two days earlier but the ever changing weather in Iceland was so windy we couldn‚Äôt stop by.
Stunning scenery,We hit this in a gale but again it was stunning. Great for photography.  Beware as very popular with tourists so early morning best or for sunset.  Very beautiful. Sand is very black with pillars of rock to add to the scene. Easy to park.   Beware of tourists ++++ which spoil it a bit especially those with drones.
Absolutely breathtaking!,This beach is not to be missed. The sand is such a rich black and is a stunning contrast to the white waves that wash up ashore. The mountainous outcrop along the shore line look like building blocks stacked on top of each other. People were climbing the rocks and posing for pictures. Continue to walk along the shore and see all the caves and crevices which are just breathtaking!
"Beautiful Spot, Well Worth A Visit","Such a beautiful spot. Free parking, easy access.  Likely touristy, but large enough for people to spread out.  View from afar of the basalt towers to the west. Lovely spot."
unbelievably gorgeous,"wow, what a spectacular place.   Yes, there are hordes of tourists, but just turn your back to them and soak up the natural beauty."
A short visit to Vik,"Please don't plan a long day in Vik. It is a very small town not particularly inviting to walkers. There is a very cute church which unfortunately closed to the public. However, the views of this small town and the beach below with its lovely rocky coastline is best taken in from the church parking lot. A drive to a parking lot behind a restaurant and sporting goods store is the best way to get to the black sand beach. The way to reach the beach can be seen from the church parking lot for those unfamiliar with this town. Once you finish visiting these two locations you are finished with Vik."
The famous black beach of Vik,"After an Icelandic Horse ride along the beach, we retuned to explore on our own. The sand is fine and littered with small black rocks. Actually saw a couple of ladies wade in for a swim (brrrrrrr)."
Well worth a visit,"Really great trip here, restaurant is e cells to and good value for Monet. Beach is well worth a visit."
Great,Wow... impressive... must see that f you are close by. Especially if the light is good and you have some waves.
Back-to-back with Reynesfara,"This vantage point provides great views and a nice walk on the other side of Reynesfara. Depending on where the sun is and what your photograph to look like, this may be the p[lace for you."
Great,"Incredible place with really black gravel looking like a sand. Amazing stone formations. And, as usually in Iceland, all for free"
Black Everywhere,"These beaches are absolutely gorgeous places. The ocean is so strong and you can see lots of birds. Seagulls, Puffins and more. So pure and energetic."
Amazing View ,Got to stop here once you have reached Iceland. Black sand beach with unique sand & natural stones arrangement in some cave.
Amazing must see,"Now ‚ÄúBlack sand beach‚Äù does not necessarily refer to the world famous one which is Reynisfjara, Voted one of the top 10 non-tropical beaches in the world.‚Ä¶ But that is a magnificent beach to visit. It is right off the ring road, it is free, and it can be crowded.  Seeing dark black sand for the first time is very cool! The basalt columns make this place even more special. Don‚Äôt turn your back to the waves as they can kill you!  You may even be able to paraglide and land on that beach with a company in Vik called True Adventure which I highly recommend!"
Amazing,We were on a tour and stopped here. Was cold and wet and windy but still worth the stop. don‚Äôt walk on the beach without shoes though because it‚Äôs not normal sand.
MESMERIZING ICELAND,"BACKGROUND:- Reynisfjara is a world-famous black-sand beach found on the South Coast of Iceland, just beside the small fishing village of V√≠k √≠ M√Ωrdal. With its enormous basalt stacks, roaring Atlantic waves and stunning panoramas, Reynisfjara is widely considered to be the most beautiful example of Iceland's black sand beaches.DISTANCE:-Reynisfjara Beach is located on the south coast of Iceland, 180 km from Reykjav√≠kHOW?REYNISFJARA BLACK SAND BEACH IS MADE OF LAVAReynisfjara black volcano beach on Iceland's South Coast is one of the most unique black sand beaches in the world. It's not a tanning kind of beach. More look than touch, it was created by lava flowing into the ocean which cooled almost instantly as it touched the waterABOUT?Black sand is sand that is black in color. One type of black sand is a heavy, glossy, partly magnetic mixture of usually fine sands, found as part of a placer deposit. Another type of black sand, found on beaches near a volcano, consists of tiny fragments of basalt.SWIM & ETC?But this does not stop the most dedicated ocean swimmers! ... And then, after a swim in the sea, you can run back up the beach to the hot tub which is a comfortable 39¬∞C (102¬∞F). A unique experience! ‚ÄãIf you want to truly experience Icelandic nature, and try something new, you should certainly check out Nauth√≥lsv√≠k beach!CAN WE?We later learned that it's not allowed to take anything from the beach or natural grounds. We are so sorry about that and return both the sand and pebbles back home to IcelandSAFE?The crime in the capital, Reykjavik, is almost non-existent. However, petty theft and anti-social behavior may happen, especially around bars at night in downtown. Tourists are very unlikely to see anything unpleasant as homelessness and drugs are not a problem. There are no unsafe or bad areas in the city."
This place is great. Glad we visited.  Really cool beach and rock formations.  Would definitely go again.,"Really cool beach and rock formations.  Would definitely go again.Really good place for family photos, striking rock formations."
Relaxing walk on a beach,"This is an Icelandic walk on a beach. Can't imagine walking there barefoot and/or in swimwear, but views are beautiful. This site is best visited during sunny day, if sky is grey, everything around would be grey, too. Good place to just walk around, see amazing views, make photos and just relax.PS. I don't know why Tripadvisor asks questions related to shops here. This is just a nature site."
Cool stop,The beach is beautiful. It‚Äôs a nice stop in your ring road your. There is a restaurant and pay toilets in site. Good parking. Lots of good photo opportunities. Easy access from Vik. Make sure to make it a stop. If you‚Äôre not eating a 30 minute stop is plenty.
Stunnning,"We weren‚Äôt expecting much, after all a beach is a beach and so what if the sand is black not white or yellow?  How wrong we were. It is an absolutely stunning site. High cliffs with strata running this way and the other, hexagonal pillars on the face of the next cliff, a large high cave, a roaring sea with waves crashing into the shore with plumes of spray, all contrasting with the black of the beach. The weather was rainy and windy but there were plenty of tourists. In our view they provided scale to the views, and didn‚Äôt detract from it"
Bracing,"The curious basalt stacks out at sea create perspective and the bracing wind may whip your face with a volcanic sand exfoliation. Whatever the elements fling at you, embrace. A place that makes you feel truly alive."
Struggle with too many tourists,"Because its a popular location for tourists, it's difficult to get photos and absorb the area. Some tourists are quite self focused and do not consider others wanting shots too. When I travel around the world to see something, and have to contend with disrespectful tourists, it's disheartening. On top of that a photoshoot was going on that totally gave me less option to have a one second click on my iPad for a simple pic. FYI, I was there in the late afternoon, late August, solo, nonintrusive! Otherwise, it's a cool place and lovely enough for my son a year ago to have his early morning wedding photos taken there, which is why I wanted to see it (there were no wedding guests attending)."
"Do not miss it, near Vik","Do not miss the extraordinary sights of Black Sand Beach, with good chances to spot the beautiful and iconic puffin in season."
Early morning ,Go before the crowds in the early morning ..even in the off season. Short walk from parking lot you'll have a very different experience. Big waves and black sand.
Black sand ...,"No words needed. Absolutely ingredible place to be. Im speechless, really. Havent seen place like this never before. ‚ô•Ô∏è"
Must see,Basalt colums and black sands. Need I say more. The crashing waves and misty fog makes this beach so enchanting. Breathtaking and peaceful. A must do on the Iceland road trip.
Must be on your bucket list,"This is one of the most famous beaches in Iceland, so you really should not miss it.Safety first though: please notice that this place can be really dangerous so take a moment to read the signs and stand back!On sunny dadys it can get really crowded, but still you will be speachless once you get there.Basalt colums rising from the groud, balck sand, puffins: an incerdible fascinating place!"
Inspiring location,"Not much can be said except, just look at the pictures! Beautiful location with caves , scenery , and large waves."
Black view üòÇüòÇ,The crazy beach I call it . It has strong sea waves . Very cold place . But interesting at least you get new experience . Recommended for who visit Iceland
"Good views, better places ",Problem is you get spoilt with black sand views. Would visit but only spend a few minutes. Missable if you‚Äôre in a rush.
Best black sand beach you will see,"I live on the Big Island of Hawaii.  Punalu‚Äôu beach on this island was named the best black sand beach  in the world.  Of course the weather is always good here.  Your experience at this beach, which must be seen from both ends, will be dictated by weather.  In good conditions it is fantastic from the basalt rising right out of the black sand with the sea stacks right off the coast to the other end on the bluff looking down on a seastack that rises right out of the black sand with white foam waves sweeping in.  Try to see it on a day without rain or wind.  Sun is best, but clouds are okay.  Rain would not be fun and mute the beauty..  just wind may be okay, but cold.  Rain and wind will diminish the experience.  In good weather it is better than Punalu‚Äôu!"
Pretty!,"We stopped by here before we did the glacier hike and it's a pretty area but you can't really do much besides walk around the beach for about 15 minutes and then move on. We sat on a rock, drank our morning coffee and relaxed. It's right off of Ring Road so it's an easy stop along the way."
If you're near vik check it out,Beautiful beach right next to vik. Go to a restaurant then check it out if you can. Don't get close to the water or it'll smack ya!
Extraordinary vistas,"In the morning, my companion went horseback riding on a beautiful Icelandic pony on the Black Sand Beach.  It was definitely one of the highlights of the trip.  In the afternoon, we walked along the beach and enjoyed the incredible views of the rock formations.  The air quality was remarkable, and the sky was clear and beautiful."
Very cool,Lots of fun to spend a little time here. Good photos. See this and do a glacier boat tour (close by) during the same 1/2 day.
Beautiful location not to be missed,"If you‚Äôre in the area, you definitely need to check this beach out... The black sand is beautiful and the rock formations nearby are also spectacular. It looks like another planet. Just be very careful and don‚Äôt go near the water‚Äôs edge. Giant waves come about quickly and you could be out to sea in a minute. Many tourists didn‚Äôt seem to take this seriously - but please look at the signs and follow the rules while enjoying this location."
Black sands suites,A fantastic spot overlooking a sweeping view scattered with wild horses. Very modern and chic. Enough luxury for short visits and easy check in / out. 5 mins drive from the famous black sand beach near Vik.
Beautiful,Absolutely beautiful beach. We were lucky enough to visit at sunset on a sunny day and the beauty was overwhelming.
A must-see Icelandic sight,The most obvious thing about the black sand beach is that (i) it is *very* black and (ii) a lot of it consists of beautiful smooth shiny black pebbles. The whole place has a certain ethereal quality about it and the juxtaposition with the tall sea pinnacles and and the basalt columns on the beach is wonderful. Because almost all of the beach is very inaccessible it is virtually deserted apart from at the very end beside Vik. It can get extremely windy and the waves are pretty ferocious.
Tour group,"We stopped here as part of the tour. It was beautiful. The ocean, the black sand and the puffins. The cliff was covered in puffins. Which we loved cause we thought they were gone by now and weren't going to see any, so that was a bonus."
windy,"It is a must go place if you visit Iceland. The columnar joints rising from the ground is picturesque, but the climbing up the joints is dangerous. The two adjacent caves showed the powerful erosion of the sea and the difference of rock types that produce such a unique scenery. The black basalt sand formed the beach that extended to the distant cliffs. It is beautiful if your visit is on a sunny day. As it is facing the North Atlantic, the wind is always strong, especially near the cliffs and rock tower."
Beautiful and unique,"Black sand beach is beautiful and unique. The colors of the sand, sky, and distant cliffs makes it feel like you're in a painting!"
STOP HERE,"Stop here, stretch the legs and be awe inspired. The sea is beautiful, the ""trolls""/large rock tower formations in the water, and the huge cliffs behind you while you stand on black sand is humbling. Try to just stand in silence for a minute, take it all in, and then think about how we need to take care of this planet."
Black Sand Beach and Reynisfjara,The caves and the black sand beach at Reynisfjara are wonderful and unique - must visit during a trip to Iceland on the south shore.  We did not regret making a small detour during a long road trip.
Lovely caves to explore ,A must on your holiday plans! Take a camera and you won‚Äôt be disappointed a nice little cafe and clean toilets too!
Wear Bright Clothes,The beach was fierce! It was crowded so taking pictures was difficult. But wear bright clothes to get awesome pictures.Sad to see some trash on the beach.Please respect nature and do not litter.
Beautiful!,This was a stops on the golden circle tour. The volcano rocks makes this beach sooo gorgeous. The arch are a great pic! I loved being here. If only I could have gotten in the water. There are a lot of people so some pics are hard to get. But its worth a stop! The restaurant there has great food!
Black Sand Beach and Basalt Columns,A must see! The formations are gorgeous and you get to see the black sand beach too! Go early or late (less tourist).
Great photos!,"We really enjoyed our visit. It was a little hazy/overcast and also very windy but that did not deter us! Great photo ops of puffins, seals, beautiful landscapes and more. And yes, I got my shoes and socks soaked by a rogue wave so be careful!"
So. Changeable ,We visited on July 31st on the way to glacier lagoon and it was awfully windy and grey and stormy and magical in its own way because it was all intense black and barren land..... and then on the way back to Reykjav√≠k on August 1st we visited again.... and I swear it was a different beach.... sunny and magnificently black. I was able to walk around bare feet and it felt awesome.....:  You can access it from vik side (if you are staying in Vik) or from the touristy side .....
stunningly beautiful!!,My husband and I brought our nine-year-old daughter there.  It‚Äôs stunningly beautiful.  We were truly amazed by mother nature.  The spectacular scenery can never be seen anywhere on earth!  Iceland has so much to offer. and yet our holiday‚Äôs so short.  we‚Äôll surely visit again soon!!
Saw the Puffin,You‚Äôll want to spend time walking this black sand beach. Rock formations to tantalize the eyes with puffins flying over head.
Incredible views in a one-of-a-kind place,"This beach was beyond beautiful. So many places in South Iceland are other-worldly and this place is no exception.  The grottos and cliff formations are magical. Can be crowded, but still plenty of spots to get great photos."
Black Sand and Diamond Beach,"The black sand beach continues along Hwy 1, to Diamond Beach.  Here, icebergs, that have calved and floated out to sea, are washed up on the black sand.  At high tide, they are buffeted by waves; at low tide, they are stranded on the beach, and glisten in the sunlight.  Stunning, and so unique!"
Black Sand beach on Vik side of the point,"Happened on this beach by accident - was a highlight of our south coast trip.  Stopped at Smidjan Brugghus (highly recommended) for lunch and a beer and found this special spot.  We were the only ones on the beach.  Black sand/pebbles are incredible as are the views of the  basalt rock formations called the ""Troll Toes""."
There are two - don't get confused on Google Maps!,"We came here on a windy summers day in August. We actually got confused with another black sand beach on Google Maps which is near the Solheim plane wreck. This is the actual Black sand beach which is further east to the plane wreck and puffin colony. Here you can find ample parking, and even if not, there is loads of space up the road to just pull into the side of the road leading to the beach. There is a small cafe there so you can buy some nice coffee to enjoy in the cold wind. The basalt columns are pretty awesome. I understand they belong to the same family as those found at the Giants Causeway in Northern Ireland. You'll find hordes of tourists climbing these stacks for the perfect instagram shot - yes, we did the same thing too. There is evidence of erosion on the stacks, probably due to to many tourists in the area. The rocky nature of the beach is gorgeous. You can find many cool shapes of rocks and pebbles most probably derived from the volcanic matter. Further down the beach are the rock stacks - absolutely amazing. Do walk down the beach to get a better sight of these formations. The colours of this sight are purely awesome. Do give this area a visit if you are in the vicinity. A note is that you can't reach the black sand beach from the puffin colony / lighthouse area and you will have to drive around the mountain and Vik to reach it."
Neat to see,"Plenty of beach to see. Interesting to see how black the sand is. The village of Vik is also interesting. Also saw Puffins, rock formations etc. worth a visit"
Black sand beach is a must even with the crowds,"Beautiful beach with interesting lave ""tubes"" to look at.  It was very crowded with lots of people but if you go late in the day it is better.  Still this stop is a must see in Vik."
"Amazing, beautiful, worth the drive!",We went to the Lava show and realized we were close to this famous beach so we took a detour. Beautiful!
Brief visit in the rain,"Stopped on the way to Hunkubakker , our stop for the night. Parking is a zoo. Somewhat overrated , with busloads of touristas on the beach , even in heavy rain. Interesting, but so much of south Iceland is visually stunning as well. Worth a stop if you can beat the tour busses there in the morning or late afternoon.  It's free, but the restrooms have a fee, and the credit card scanner did not work."
Love the contrast!,"Great scene.  It was cold and windy the day we visited, so didn't stay out there long.  But definitely worth a stop."
One of the Black Sand Beach Wonders in Iceland ,"Definitely worth a visit. Every turn has something more - Caves, Rocks, Formations in the sea, Waves...."
Worth a stop if around VIK,We stopped at the beach on our way back from a hike on the glacier.The weather was pretty windy and grey but that did not take away the beauty of the place. The different shape of the rocks were for us the most interesting and beautiful part of the beach. You dont need to be a geologist to appreciate the beauty of these rocks and it was too bad that tourists were climbing the rocks for their pictures.Crowded with tour buses.
"Black sand, nesting birds and interesting geology","The temptation is great to rank everything we saw on our 6-day circuit of Iceland as 5-stars. But to show some restraint to my reviews, I found this stop a bit less compelling than many. Should you stop? Definitely, unless the weather is really nasty. Will you need to stay for long? Maybe not. The black sand is fascinating. There are hundreds of birds - mostly northern Fulmars and some puffins the day we visited - but you'll be happier if you bring your binoculars! And there was a surprising tie-in to GOT"
As Everyone says this is a MUST See in Vik. Worth multiple visits.,"Since we were just staying down the road, I visited this Black Sand Beach multiple times and there is NEVER a bad time to visit.  Even in the pouring rain.  Yes tourist everywhere, but like Bees to a beautiful flower, this place is magnetically irresistible!. Must get a photo on the hexagonal basalt columns.Walk the beach. Check out the inverted caves. Just sit there and absorb the vibes."
Lovely geology,Yes it's busy; yes it can be dangerous; yes you need to be very very careful and keep an eye on the water at all times. And do not go down to the water's edge.The basalt columns and black sand are very beautiful. The sea birds were lovely to watch.
Magnificent even if crowded... a must go place,"Magnificent beach, very popular particularly en its left part. Strangely enough everybody stay there and nobody walks to its right part where it offers an incredible views of the beach and of the green landProbably to be tried at different times like in the morning since it faces east, it would be less crowded."
"This is called 'Reynisfjara', you will enjoy this very different beach and the views from it",This beach is really called 'Reynisfjara' and you will find other reviews under that name.   Spectacular views from this very different black sand beach as well as the impressive hexagonal basalt columns with a few caves along the beach
Stunning ,The beach was beautiful and peaceful. If in south Iceland this is a must see. Can't put into words how amazing the view was
Don‚Äôt miss!,"This beach with the black sand, basalt columns and rock formations was a must see for us. We got some awesome photos at this place. There is plenty of parking and pay bathrooms. Didn‚Äôt realize it at the time, but if you‚Äôre facing the water, there is a puffin nesting place close to the rock formations to the right. You probably can‚Äôt get close enough to see them well though. And also probably a significant walk to get there."
Crazy Beautiful ,"I don‚Äôt know what I was expecting, but the Black Sand Beaches are just something you have to see to comprehend. Know that it is probably going to be raining when you visit, be prepared but don‚Äôt skip the walk on the beach! It is just beautiful!"
Photographic experience ,"How odd, walk 2 miles in a gale and rain to a plane wreck from the 1970s! Light weights can get the specialised bus that goes along the beach but for the real deal walk!The DC3 emerges from the horizon, we spent 2 hours there with various cameras and film equipment. Very surreal!!!"
Interesting for 20 minute stop,Cool beach and interesting basalt columns to climb up on. You may see 1 or 2 puffins nesting above (much better puffin viewing in the Westmann islands) but its waaaay too touristy to stay for very long. We had fun for 20 minutes or so around 4PM. Might be better earlier or later in the day
Great view,This is a beautiful beach. I will recommend going during non tourist hrs. If in summer go late or early.
Moonlike landscape,You really feel like you are on another planet so it's a must do. Saw lots of puffins there.Have to pay 200kr for toilets and it's crowded.
Chique Iceland spot with a side of puffins,This place is an amazing place for pictures and enjoying the black sand beach. The geometric shapes make easy seating all over the rocks for any type of picture! Above the rocks are some puffin nests that are best to see in the morning!
Beautiful but crowded,"This beach was beautiful and so unique to see. I went when it was raining and windy and it was still really crowded so I would hate to see what it's like on a nice day but it was still worth the look and you can walk along the beach, away from crowds."
Beats the one in Hawaii,"This small town in Iceland has so much to offer with a church that lights up at night on top of a hill. The black sand beach is the top attraction, with beautiful landscapes, cliffs and, of course, the black sand. I'll never forget it!"
Favorite Site on the South Coast,"Of all the places that I visited on the south coast of Iceland, this was my favorite. It reminded me of the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland. The columns of basalt were huge, and the location on a black sand beach was magical. Don't turn your back on the waves on the beach, they can sneak up and get you wet. Great place for photos. There is a cafe on the beach, but their restrooms are for customers only."
"Good Views, Easy Accessibility",Fairly easy to access the black sand beach but for those nimble enough I recommend going to the end of the rocks. Using an iPhone camera here can be limiting. In general I‚Äôd budget about 30-45 minutes. The fact that you can access this from the grocery stores parking lot is a huge plus or drive through town and park at the end of Manabraut to get a closer view.
"Worth the drive, bug be sure to visit the waterfalls aswell","Dramatic, spectacular. Quite a drive from Reykjavik; when you get there, be sure to visit both beaches, the east from Vik, and the west one.The waterfalls driving to Black beach are also impressive."
Dramatic ,"We drove quite some time to reach Black sand beach. The weather was wild and windy and the beach with its black honeycomb cliffs dramatic.Watch out for the creeper waves, worth a visit though and fabulous photos."
WOW!,"A short walk down to the black sand beaches and basalt rocks and you can find a huge cave.  The rocks are absolutely beautiful!  The waves are known as sneaker waves, and you have to watch how close they get to you (one guy got knocked down taking a selfie)."
Very Cool,We went for a long drip on the Beach in a sort of monster truck with very large wheels that were able to handle the sand. When you look at the sand it seems wet but it is actually dry and does not stick to your hand. Crazy experience a must try.
Good Visit,"This was one of the stops I really wanted to spend time at.  We researched this stop and were prepared for weather, snacks, water, and 2nd layer of cloths (wind), hooded jacket, thin gloves and neck gaiters.  Most of all our stops in Iceland were much later in the day usually after 3pm.  So it was late in the day when we arrived, usually plenty of parking and not too many people during most all our stops.  We hiked up and down the black beach.  We have 11 yrs. twins and they were very interested in the rocks, sand and formations.   We did stop afterward at a caf√© a few feet from the beach for hot drinks and a bio-break."
Black Sand Beach and Basalt Stacks,This is a beautiful beach filled with black volcanic sand. The basalt stacks are like nothing I've seen before. This is really a unique beach. Fun fact: Game of Thrones used this area as a film location.
Another place in iceland's adventure,"Travelling in Iceland, you probably want to see this place, really cool and beautiful for a good picture"
V√≠kurfjordor,We stopped at this location because we heard it‚Äôs not as crowded as Reynisfjara. It wasn‚Äôt. There was hardly anyone there but we went in January. We didn‚Äôt stay long as it was very cold and windy but I think if it was a nice day this would be a great place to spend some extra time. The black sand is very cool.
Beautiful ,"This is a beautiful beach that is usually over crowded with tourists. Nonetheless, you will stop and admire it in between the busloads of people."
Must See!,"Definitely make time to travel to the Black Sand Beach.  The sand, rock formations and power of the sea are all worth the visit."
Beautiful but crowded,"If you stay around the basaltic columns, it will most probably be very crowded, be careful about that ! There are also some very dangerous sneaker waves so beware !"
Magnificent ,"Beautiful black beach although supposedly a dangerous beach because of sneaker waves. Need to be careful otherwise can walk , play & do collect few volcanic rocks."
Unique experience of the Black sand beach!,Amazing feels on around with out of the world basalt columns for insta-worthy photo opportunities! Waves crashing on the shoreline creates that wonderful backdrop for your pictures and we even saw rainbow across when we were there that very day. Would definitely need to visit after your trip to Dyrholaey!
Magical Spot,"The rock formations are what is really the draw here along with the small caves. Be ready to greet a lot of other folks; tour busses galore! But I still did manage to get a couple of pictures without people in them. It was a misty and overcast day which lent itself well to some cool photos. There is a large parking area, I did not see any facilities anywhere, although I believe there was a gift store or cafe. Wear good shoes, the rocks and sand can be a bit tricky to navigate. If you are a Bon Iver fan, this spot was used in the video for Holocene, which he won an award for."
Amazing rock formations from volcanic activity ,"Crowds in high season make photos a bit more challenging, as to be expected, but it‚Äôs not too bad and definitely worth the trip to see the natural wonders here. Cliffs and rock formations are staggering. The sand changes from large rocks to smooth small pebbles then finer sand. Look carefully and you may spot some puffins nesting on the cliffs among all the seagulls. Side note- Be aware the cafe is of course very expensive, with very limited options.  Recommend bringing lunch instead, if you have the wherewithal to do so, or eat in the town of Vik."
Gorgeous Spot with Puffins,We were a bit after the puffin season but while we were at the beach we were lucky enough to see puffins! Honestly a gorgeous spot to visit.
Very unique and unusual,"Its a regular beach but with black sand so unique and unusual from that perspective. If you visit the wrecked plane site, it is on the black sand beach as well. If the weather is nice and clear, you can see the sparkle on the sand which is great for photographers."
Just a beach..,I really didn't understand what's the fuss about this place..It's a regular beach with black sand..
Nice & different beach to see,"This was a slight must-see on our three-adult round-trip around Iceland. You don't see a black beach everywhere, as it is. At least at the end of June it was a very peaceful place, and slightly exotic as well. Numerous birds nesting on a huge cliff less than a kilometer away gave their own pleasant addition to the sound environment, caused mainly by the waves of the ocean. The rock formations further added niceness to the scenery. All in all, it gave us perhaps more than we expected."
Lovely and unusual place. ,We went toward the end of the day (5pm ish) and it was relatively quiet.The beach itself looks amazing. It is recommended to stay away from the water as there has been multiples dead - according to locals - as the water is freezing and wave quite strong.You can enjoy a nice walk along the beach should the weather alloW it.There was a very small amount of litter around mostly biscuit wrappers and cigarettes buds. So I picked a empty bag I saw lying there and filled it up. Wish people would not leave their stuff behind :(
Nice picture spot,"Nice Kodak moment! Interesting, typical lcelandic landscape and great view on Vick‚Äôs mountainous surroundings"
Amazing site,"Went there for my daughter's wedding pictures. A really spectacular place, You won't find many places on the planet that are as breathtaking. Careful of the surf."
Black sand beach ,Crowded but very beautiful.  Not a long term visit type of place. A few puffins on the cliff if you look closely. I would avoid the cafe and pay WC if possible. Not as great as other Icelandic sites.
Fantastic must see.,It was great going down to the beach with the family. Kids have plenty of places to run around.  It is great just to take in the whole scenery.
"Interesting features, but better view from the hike on the cliff (accessible from Vik)","The black sand beach is overrun with tourists in high season - and while parking is limited, at least you do not have to pay for it (as of June 2019).  There are interesting basalt columns (good for instagramming - ugh), a neat cave, interesting rock formations out to the sea and lots of room to get away from the crowds if you walk to the west on the open part of the beach.   As the signs say, stay away from the water's edge, the Atlantic ocean can be unforgiving.Having said that, the best views are from hiking the cliffs above the beach. One can access the above plateau by driving a little further east on the ringroad, to Vik.  The access path is an offshoot of the first inhabited east-west road to the right of the ringroad just as you enter Vik - it is a dirt/gravel road that switchbacks up the hill past a number of nesting birds, with great views of Vik to the east - it was roped off to vehicles when I walked up.  At the top, one comes to a fence, and one can turn left and start a circuit following stakes with yellow tops - though once you pass the view over the black sand beach - which is great - you have to keep your eyes out for the turn as the yellow posts turn white and head back down after the views of the black beach (so there is probably an entrance to the route on the black sand side (ie. west side) of the plateau).  The top of the plateau is generally a meadow, the path is well carved out, there are sheep wandering around and there are great views looking north to the glacier. I highly recommend the hike - it is about 5km or so in all.  It took me about 1.5hrs (I missed the turnoff, hence my knowledge of the white post route...), though others reference the hike as closer to 2+, depending upon how much you stop."
Amazing beach,Well worth a visit to see the ‚Äòdiamonds‚Äô on the beach!  To see the waves crashing over the icebergs was beautiful and a unique experience.
WOW!!!,"What an amazing experience! As we walked down to the beach, the thunderous roar of crashing waves could easily be heard. The basalt columns are an unusual formation & even form a cave-like area in one spot."
must visit place in south coast,this place is simply amazing....it was unreal for us...we fell in love with this place...highly recommended place !!
worth the drive,"While a bit of a drive from the city, you see some beautiful countryside along the way and can stop at several waterfalls. The beach is photogenic even on a rainy day, but beware of the wind. We met folks who had their car doors bent irreparably backwards by the strong gusts of wind that rip through here."
Beautiful black sand beach.,Beautiful to see as is Iceland although the ocean is not safe to enter the water at the Black sand beach. At 50 degrees i would not go in the water anyway.
quick stop- no one there!,"This is a beautiful black sand beach. When we stopped there, we were the only ones. It was beautiful. There are also the Alaskan Lupin all around."
South shore adventure. ,Did a day trip on the south shore with our granddaughter taking advantage of the extended stay program from Icelandic Air following our trip to Paris. A long day because there‚Äôs so much to experience but a continual feast for the senses. Iceland is not to be missed.
Simply amazing ,Amazing beach you can see volcano ash black sand and the cooled honey cone shape rocks. Iceland is really a nation in the making and you must visit this amazing beach. Be careful with so called sneaker waves seems quite serious.
Amazing geology,The geology in this area is worth the trip. Do walk down the beach to the caves and look inside at the basalt columns.
Iconic basalt pillars right on beach,"Easy slight detour off the main ring road, there‚Äôs a small free parking lot. WC requires payment at a kiosk. No gift shop; small cafe. For taking that holiday card photo with your family on the basalt pillars, come in late afternoon. The sun will be setting in the west and provide lovely light on your faces. Easily a favorite spot so far on the drive.Also walk the beach to look at the caves and various kinds of basalt. Just stay away from the water-sneaker waves can come in unannounced and pull you in. That would ruin your vacation!"
Do not miss. Interesting geology,Do not miss this interesting geology of how lava cools on the beach. Excellent picture opportunities and wonderful beach. Caution swimming in this area however.
Its a beach with black sand,Granted all the beaches in Iceland have black sand but this one has the really cool squared rocks that look like pylons. Even though it was raining the day I was there it was gorgeous. I only wish my tour had a bit more time to spend there.
"Nice beach, good walk","Beach not far from parking lot.  Beach has interesting formations of basalt,  Lava forms.  Waves are very dangerous don't go in water.  Nice to walk on, and interesting rock formations.  Right near Vik"
Unreal vistas. Worth exploring.,Stay in Vik at the Kria. Explore the black sand beach.Watch out for 'sneaker waves'. We did not see any really scary ones but they apparently do occur...and the water is cold!
Excellent beach,Great beach! amazing geological formations! not too crowded as we thought... really nice for leisure walks
An Iceland must-do!,"Fabulous geological formations--black sand, basalt columns and sea stacks! We had heard it was overly crowded, and there were a lot of people, but we didn't feel crowded at all. Absolutely gorgeous scenery!"
Puffins and Black Sand,"After dinner in Vik we went to the Black Sand Beach where the Puffin colony is.  The puffins were cute to watch flying in and out from the cliff where they were nesting out over the ocean.  Were there about 1/2 hr, made a nice walk"
Wonderful ,"There are many black sand beaches in Iceland, but this must rank as one of the easiest to visit. You must keep an eye on the waves though."
Beautiful place,This is a beautiful place and would highly recommend a visit. But I have never seen so many Instagram models in the same place at the same time... everyone is a star....
Tourist destinations for sure! ,Good place to take wedding photos. Good to visit this beach due to its own black/diamond sand and surrounding is also very cool.
Not of this world,"Awesome.  A must see in any type of weather.  I read some of the negative reviews and had to laugh.  Of course it's dangerous.  Any guide book will tell you to beware of the sneaker waves but if you use some common sense and a little extra caution, you'll be fine.  Also, you're in Iceland and should always be prepared for rain, wind, or even snow.  You can't let that spoil such a gorgeous place.  And of course it can get crowded, but if you go in the middle of the day, particularly in summer, what do you expect?  I've been 3 times and never have the tourists stopped me from being in awe."
Game of Thrones,"from the moment you arrive, it feels like you are in a scene from GoT. make sure to wear waterproof clothes and dont ever turn your back to the ocean"
Something for everyone,"Whether you love climbing, geological wonders, bird watching, sea-breeze catching, or the classic long walk on the beach - the Black Sand Beach in Vik entices all. Spread out, take a risk and climb the columnar basalt, and bring a blanket. Spend a couple of hours here."
Iceland Golden Circle ,Must visit for anyone travelling the Golden Circle. Spectacular views. Take some time to explore the caves. Easily accessible via road.
Stunning as everything in Iceland,"Crowded, of course. Incredibly windy - of course. Stunning - yes, yes, yes. The black sand beach, great waves washing away footsteps of all the visitors."
Reynisfjara/ Reynisdrangar sea stacks/ Black Sand Beach,"Iceland is a minefield of explosive volcanic energy, and because of this unique beautiful shapes and patterns are formed across the landscape.As basaltic lava cools over an extended period of time, beautiful geometric forms emerge; incredible columns of hexagonal basalt rock that often form cliffs that stretch as high as the eye can see. These Basalt formations can be found all around the world, but Iceland is one of the best places to find these geological treasures.From the beach you have a view to the Reynisdrangar sea stacks. These bizarre looking rock pillars are said to be petrified trolls that were caught outside at sunrise and frozen in time, but some strongly believe that they‚Äôre actually basalt columns that were once part of the extensive shoreline cliffs that remained standing while other parts were battered down by the ocean.  What you believe depends on how much you believe in the fairies and trolls of Iceland.This is a busy attraction, close to the Ring Road, a short walk allows you to experience the rock formations...but if you walk a little further down the beach you will have it all to yourself leaving the tourists behind.  As with most beaches in Iceland- be careful.  The currents are strong and coupled with cold arctic water and strong undertow- never turn your back.  Rogue waves and the ocean are serious business, getting close is never a good idea.  No picture is worth it.Near the parking lot is a small restaurant offering hot beverages and a small menu.  Hot soup and free wifi always available.  If you don't see something you like Vik is a short drive from the beach."
Wow. Really beautiful beach. ,Unlike any beach that I have ever seen. The lava rock formations look like works of art.  Black sand is very small for a section. And smooth rocks in another section.   We went on a beautiful day. So the Ayer was calm.  Definitely a must see in Vik
Amazing,I had seen sand white but first time for black sand. It was quite chilly windy and waves were high. You have the mountains covering your back and the amazing view ahead.
Extraordinary!,Unique and quite impressive wonder of nature! Definitely worth the long drive from Reykjavik. There are some really wonderful spots to click beautiful pictures!Do stay away from the waves! :)
Craziest and Coolest Beach I‚Äôve Seen,First and foremost‚Äî DO NOT GO NEAR THE WATER. The winds are no joke. The black ‚Äúsand‚Äù and the basalt stacks make it look like you‚Äôre on another planet. It was stunning.
Nice on a sunny day but...,"on a windy rainy day it is NOT the place to go.  As we drove to it the rain was quite heavy and fog kept us from seeing too far in front of us.   I was sure others would bypass this place but the car park was quite crowded (and wet).  Since we were there we decided to have a walk to see what it was all about.  The beach sand is black as you would expect and rather hard to walk thru.  We did manage to walk to the cave and found that a couple had gotten married and were having pictures taken inside (how on earth she managed to get to the cave in the rain and wind wearing a white wedding gown was a question I wanted to ask).  Since it was so cold we just looked, took a few pictures then headed out.  I'm glad we saw it but it really would have been so much better on a sunny day. We were totally soaked to the skin and rather miserable for the next hour in the car while our heater dried us out."
It seems to be on another world,"I had a stop on the black sand beach in a tour, the weather was really foggy and it seemed to be on another world. The ocean was mixed with the fog making difficult to find the split between the two. Just be very careful that the ocean is quite strong and an unexpected wave can occur at any moment. From time to time some tourists pay even fatally this. I recommend to enjoy this place at safe distance. I can ensure you that it can be fully enjoyed at such distance."
Super wild,We stayed at the Black Beach suites. That is like 5 minutes by car. IT was a foggy and rainy day. We went in the afternoon when iT was almost dry. The water was so wild so the waves were very big and powerfull. This Made the experiece very cool! Unfortunately there was not that much sight because of the fog. But of course we saw the famous wall of the Game Of Thrones and it gave a really cool image with the wild water and the Game Of Thrones wall.
Favourite place! ,Probably my favourite place of the tour so took in southern Iceland. Beautiful scenery and spectacular beach. Love it !
Worth a visit ,This is a good place to stop for half an hour or so as part of a south coast tour.  The black sands and basalt stacks are really interesting.  There‚Äôs a couple of impressive caves too.  It wasn‚Äôt too busy when we went mid afternoon in may but I can imagine it can get very busy in high season.
Beautiful,Beautiful place. So many different types of rocks. Nice place to chill too. Watch out for the big waves!
PROBABLY OUR FAVOURITE PLACE!,"We are huge fans of Star Wars and this was a filming area for one of the scenes.  My 19 yr old son is a budding photographer and the pictures he just took on his phone were absolutely incredible if you get the angles just right.  This place is like no other and because of our ""off season"" traveling, there were crowds but you could still appreciate the beauty.  The most incredible and powerful waves I have ever seen.  This whole experience was surreal!"
packed with people when we were there,OMG!!!  We went late afternoon (trying to do one more thing in Vik) and it was chock a block with people.  The parking lot was insane (I felt badly for the people who were there for the restaurant.  Pretty sure patrons don‚Äôt expect to fight through the crowds for food).  Visit first thing in the morning to see if its not so crazy busy and dress warmly.  The wind was fierce when we were there.but...WOW!!!  Impressive!  You can see why it‚Äôs so popular.  Nice long walk on the black sandy beach (it‚Äôs more gritty than sandy) and the awesome rock formations reminded us of Giant‚Äôs Causeway in Northern Ireland.
Not as black as advertised,"One of the iconic beaches on the Iceland. Rocks from the sea are certainly impressive, as well as the ‚Äúcathedral‚Äù. For more, you need to go there and explore it yourself"
Fantastic,"Amazing and unique  rock formations, caves, black sandy beaches, wild waves, extraordinary in every way, not to be missed!"
"Amazing scenery, selfie mania","This place is stunning, with amazing rock formations. Whene we visited the place was overcrowded with mainly selfie girls with substracted from the charm."
Interesting place to visit ,When we visited here it was very windy so be prepared with warm clothing and stout footwear. There are some interesting basalt columns there which are well worth seeing.
Columnar Jointing,"The black sand beach is backed by superb Columnar Jointing in the basalt cliffs. The beach has excellent coastal Geomorphology, with a sea cave, sea stacks and Natural arch. Watch out for the large ""sneak"" waves, which can make this beach dangerous"
Amazing view! ,"Its a beautiful beach, you can take a long walk on the beach, near the parking lot its pretty crowded, but take a couple of minutes walk on both side, its gonna worth it! I loved it! There is a restaurant, you can grab some snack and have a quick meal on the beach."
Really black..,"It is quite an amazing beach, not bcoz the sand is black but the waves together with the rock formations are juz as amazing. If the weather wasn‚Äôt too cold, it can be a great place to enjoy a leisure stroll.."
Black sand Iceland ,We rented a car and drove to Vic. We wanted to see the different landscapes along the way. Black Sand Beach is quite large and cold and windy which just made it better for us as we got to feel early spring unfold. Great picture taking opportunity. We enjoyed it.
Gorgeous beach,Gorgeous beach for a stroll with the family. I had heard of strong unpredictable waves but we didn‚Äôt have any issues. Worth a visit.
Beautiful even in the rain,We are GOT fans so couldn‚Äôt pass this up. Amazing rock formations both offshore and on. We came in off season so not too crowded. We stopped in quickly but would have loved to stay longer.
"Worth to visit-Pretty black sands, towering cliffs, small cave and shinny rocks and marbles.","We drove about 3 hours from Hotel Vellir on a windy, foggy, rainy March day. Even the weather is bad and unpredictable, still worth to visit. The black sands were really fine, pretty, and very clean. The rocks and marbles were shinny.  I personal think they are prettier than those from Hawaii and Malaysia. Of course, others may have different opinions. Then with the towering cliffs, we posted some interesting pictures. There was a small cave next to it, where you could hide from pouring rain. There was only one restaurant at the entrance of the beach, in front of parking lot. You can use bathroom if order from restaurant. They had good turnip soup. Carrot cake was little sweet, not enough carrot taste. One thing please note. About first hour drive from hotel to south, the path was uphill and pretty foggy due to the weather. I couldn't see two cars in front of me. Be careful driving to destination. Not sure if it's from the rain or uphill?  just be careful. Enjoy and be safe."
Magical puffin sighting,"We drove several hours on the off chance we could see the puffins, which were supposed to have gone by mi-August, but we were rewarded with any amazing view of both puffins and the black sand beach. Worth the trip!"
Must see,Must see if planning a tour of this portion of Iceland. Such a unique environment. Stay in Vik and be able to enjoy it before all the tours from Reykjavik arrive.
"Wild, open and windswept.","Basalt pillars. Caves,stacks and arches and miles of black sand. Wild and windswept make this a unique natural environment."
Worth a visit,"Amazing beach with fantastic rock formations, caves and stacks out at sea. Would be great to be there when it wasn‚Äôt busy but quite a few coach tours were there at the same time as us. Car park is nearby so no distance to walk to admire the beach."
Beautiful black sand beach ,"This black sand beach is probably one of the most famous beaches in Iceland and it‚Äôs a must if you go to there. It‚Äôs beautiful and very special but expect a lot of tourists! We had wind and massive waves, it looked like a movie. But people were still in beautiful dressed and had photo shoots even thou it was freezing."
WOW!  Mother Nature showing off,"We went on a cold blustery March day and man did this place show off!  We could hear the surf as soon as we stepped out of our vehicle.  We were warned that many people have been caught in an undertow and were warned not to get anywhere near the water.  I guess the tide was up because the waves were coming up to the path that leads to the rocks coming up from the water.  I halfheartedly tired to get over there, but a wave came up and I decided to not risk it!  I did get a few distant pics of the rocks, so I was satisfied. The cliff and rock formations at this beach makes this one of the stand out sightseeing events we did while in Iceland."
Very nice beach,"Not much luck with weather here, rained in summer and snowed in winter.Its a lovely beach, main thing for me are the columns but I wish people wouldn't climb all over them.Watch for the waves, they can be lethal, literally."
Like a movie,It's one of the most stuning places in all Iceland. Be careful with the waves and respect all the signs
Beautiful beach and cliffs,"On a clear cold April day the beach was constantly buffeted by a cold strong wind - but WOW it was a beautiful place.Firstly the black sand beach stretching out being pounded by the waves, and then the amazing cliffs and caves with some many interesting and varied rock formations.Another great place to visit in Iceland !"
Don‚Äôt miss this incredible beach,"Almost got mixed up and did not see this beach and the stone walls and caves that face it. Pure black volcano ash sand beach. It also looks out too offshore spires that are picturesque. Need to be careful at the shore line, the waves at high tide are strong and they warn you about ‚Äú sneaker waves‚Äù that will pull you out to sea if you are not paying attention."
Magnificent View,"We had fun at the black sand, the view was breathtaking and magical. It felt as if we were into another world. It was disappointing that many tourists did not adhere to the warning by the authority. Just get yourself away from the sneaker waves."
The power of the sea at its best!,"On our trip back along the south coast back to Reykjavik we were told we should stop at Black Sand Beach, even though it's a small detour. We were really glad we did. This beach is black sand - as the name suggests - but it has the most massive waves we'd ever seen. Granted it was a very windy day but it was stunning to see. It's a very short walk to the beach from the car park.The waves are so powerful, and a bit frightening each time they suddenly shoot up the beach towards people. Beware the section with no footprints! Apparently the beach area sort of just drops away which is why the sea is so fierce. There's a rock formation in the sea and against the cliff that is well worth seeing too. Although parking is free it isn't the place to stop for food and the toilet because you have to pay for both and just for a pasta dish it was around 2600KR (¬£16)."
Annoying stupid tourists risking their lifes,With lots of stupid and irresponsible tourists! While we were there at least 10 people almost got swept away by one of these gigantic waves. Please don‚Äôt do that I really pity the poor Icelandic guard that has to watch these dumb tourists. Respect the safety instructions this is the most dangerous beach in Iceland!
Amazing place.,Beautiful and peaceful beach with amazing black sand. The sand is black because it's formed from heavily eroded volcanic rocks which formed from cooled lava. A cafe and restrooms are available in the area. A must visit place.
Beautiful Beach,Worth the visit.  About 2.5 miles off main Iceland road.  I know now why the rental car companies ask you to get sand/ash insurance.  On the day we visited there were 70mph winds and sand was blowing everywhere.  The waves were incredible to see.  Just don't venture out as there are sneaker waves that we witnessed that came out of nowhere and would take anyone out to sea
Beautiful black beach,Popular place to visit on the south coast of Iceland west of village Vik. Watch out for sneaker waves that can swipe you off your feet and suck you into the Atlantic Ocean. Avoid an accident at all cost!
Super cool but beware of the water,We loved it but there are a lot of sneaker waves so don't turn your back for too long to take a selfie!
Awesome experience,"Another world.How to get there? From Route 1 turn to (right or left depending which direction you are going) Route 215 and go 5.9 km (6 min) to the parking lot (there is also a restaurant called Black Beach Restaurant). This is just 10 minutes from V√≠k √≠ M√Ωrdal (approx. 11 km), which is the closest town.Experience: from another world. I have never been in a black sand beach and is really impressive;  this is not the only place where you can see black sand beaches in Island, but seems to be the most popular spot, maybe because it is close to V√≠k √≠ M√Ωrdal and the Dyrh√≥laey Lighthouse, also has a basaltic wall and last but not least, the awesome Reynisdrangar (lot of stories around these rocks).No, is not a beach for swimming, specially because of its aggressive and treacherous tide. So, keep that in mind if you are getting close to the water.Just walking in the beach is enough for appreciate this beautiful spot. There is a small cave with basaltic formations; you can also see at the distance the arch of Dyrh√≥laey and you can try to get as close as you can to the shore and get a closer look of Reynisdrangar.Opening Hours: all day (not sure if you can see something during night).Cost: parking and admission are free.Duration: one hour and a half.Other: prepared for the crowd."
Beautiful place hidden behind all the tourist,Way too many tourists imo.. but I guess we all just wanted to see and experience the same thing: the well known beautiful and dangerous black beach in Vik. Worth the trip if you don‚Äôt mind big crowds of tourists!
Amazing,"This is a must see in Iceland.  It is like being on another planet.  The rock formations are spectacular, the sand is amazing and the history is very interesting.  Leave at least 1.5 hours to explore and get all of the amazing pictures."
Beautiful place for good photos,"Beautiful black beach and stone formations. You can also see the big pointy rocks in the water from a far. You can not see dyrholey (stone with hole) clearly. Nice with a bit more stony beach, good for shoes. Be aware of big waves, I got water up in my shoes:("
"Yes, Architecturally beautiful stones which are other-worldly.","We stopped in this town the first time for the gift shop/coffee shop/grocery store.  Other tour buses were there, and we didn't know to look behind to see the beach.  On our way back, we finally found the Black Sand Beach which was further down and a drive  from the shop.  The drive to the beach was pretty, but when we got out and actually walked on the thousands of small black stones and sand, while looking up at these gorgeous almost pillars in the rock, we were completely blown away.  It was 3pm, and the sun was more golden, as that is their twilight in the winter.  My photographs are sensational with the gold and rainbow reflections on the black stones.  There are lots of tourists there, as we expected, but we were patient and not on a time schedule, so we stayed about an hour and a half.  The Black Sand Beach is going to be in an upcoming Star Wars movie ( I was told), and I can completely believe it.  Oh, be sure to look up at the cliff birds going in and out of their nests!  The whole experience was magical...Thank you to beautiful Iceland for sharing this wonder of the world with us!!!"
worth a quick stop,"neat place, beach is gorgeous, rock formations are very unique. waves are evidently dangerous. quick stop with food, drinks and restrooms avail"
Sand of the volcano,"Nice and peaceful place to walk and watch the ocean waves crash into the black sand.  There is a little parking area close to the beach, or you can walk to the beach from Vik.  Just remember that walking on sand can get tiring for some people so park accordingly."
Simply beautiful,"This is one my favourite beaches in the world I've visited. Natural, different, simply beautiful. Lovely during the sunset. In October there only few people there in the evening, which made the experience even more unique. And the waves were amazing!"
Awesome!,This beach was one of the nice things we saw during our 10 day trip. We spent a few hours here and got some very nice photos. One thing you must look out for are the waves. A few people have been taken into sea by the waves and some of those sadly died. Make sure to always keep an eye out for the waves and if you have smaller children to keep them alert and be alert for them.
Girls favorite,"This was a happy spot for us.   Loved the black sand beach, our little girls played for hours before we made them move on."
A great show of the nature,"This is the spot where you can see the nature‚Äôs force and beauty at its high. The beach is impressive as it always has huge waves and is guarded in one side by Dyrholay rocks on the other side by the Reynisfjara caves. If you are a fan of Games of Thrones, this is the place where some of the meetin scenes were shoot. The lined rocks in the caves are a architectural masterpiece of the nature. There are 2 caves-one on the beach as you get down on the beach on your left and the other one around the corner. Careful on you your way not to get soaked by the sea."
"Dangerous if you don't respect it, but awesome power of nature","We were on a tour of the coast and sights. Unless you're a keen driver, I'd recommend a tour, as they find all the spots, some are far apart. They know the roads and weather and take away the stress.This beach was COLD, WINDY and as you'll see from the signs, can be fatal. As our guide said, don't turn your back on the water.Geology fascinates me, and this beach is edged with huge black cliffs, with a selfie inspiring shallow cave.The wind can take you off your feet, so if you're frail, think twice, and hold onto any children you take with you."
Be very aware and enjoy,"I visited as part of the south shore adventure tour and our guide told us about the waves at this beach and how we needed to be careful. She wasn't wrong. I saw a number of people taking pictures and turning their back to the ocean only to be caught by a bit wave leaving them completely soaked - not what you want when it's 2 degrees outside! Still, the beach is stunning and the black sand is super picturesque! Just the waves do make it scary so you'd need to be careful if visiting with young children."
Spectacular beach,"There are 2 sides to this beach, the Vik side and the side with the Black Beach Restaurant on it.  I don't think you can walk between the two.  You certainly couldn't while we visited.  The restaurant side has the interesting rock formations on display. Definitely worth a visit.."
Unusual Beach,"We visited the beach when there were high winds, almost enough to blow me over.  It was a very cold day.  The sand is black and there are smooth small rocks all over.  I found and kept two that were heart shaped.  There are deep caves close to shore that house birds.  My husband took refuge in one while I was exploring  the beach."
The Black Sands warmed my Black Heart,We stopped here along the way in and back out of the South East Area. We got to explore a bit more on the way back out! Such amazing views and a lovely little walk! Would definitely recommend stopping here!
Very impressing,One of the best 5 sights we saw in Iceland (out of about 40). Good photo locations. Nice in the afternoon
Beautiful! ,Lovely views! Nice for a walk along and plenty of scenery for beautiful photographs! Plenty of parking and an onsite restaurant if feeling peckish and need warming after the cold Icelandic weather!
"Pretty place, can be packed ","Went with friends early in the morning and it was already packed. This place is so beautiful, but if you want peace walk a little bit more along the shore. Ps: washrooms are paid in the cafe, just so you know. Free parking."
beautifull! go in the morning,"I haven't seen another place like it -- black sand and stacked rocks. We spent a cold, but incredibly peaceful morning walking the beach. We saw puffins on the top of the rocks! Definitely go in the morning for  a calm experience"
Stunning - must visit,"Black basalt columns just stuning, repeat for quite some distance with variety of formations, caves etc. A geologists dream.Beach altogeher stunning with massive cliffs, seabirds whirring overhead, grerat views of the rock stacks & of course the black sand.Convenient & free parking make this slight diversion off the main road well worth taking."
Must see!,"Stay away from the waves, and just enjoy the gorgeous views. Free to visit. It does get crowded, but that's expected. I definitely recommend visiting."
Hurricane level 1 winds,70+mph winds. Snow. Crashing.waves. Couldn't get to the caves. All.in all an intense experience of nature's power. Never had a beach visit like it.
Black sand beach,"It's just a regular beach, except the sand is black. Which does add to the visual interest, significantly."
Al A,Amazing beach with great photo opportunities. We arrive during a snow storm which made it even more beautiful. It does get windy there.
A bracing walk on Vik‚Äôs famous black sands...,Vik is either described as a peaceful seafront community (DK Eyewitness Travel) or a booming hub for a very beautiful portion of the south coast (Lonely Planet). I would have to say it doesn‚Äôt look particularly welcoming on a drizzly winter‚Äôs day but there again very few towns do.  We stopped briefly on our way home for a bracing walk along It‚Äôs famous black sands towards its equally famous sea stacks which reminded me a bit of the jagged rock formations off the Irish coast at Dingle.  The image of creamy white waves breaking over a black sand beach lingers.
Impressive black sand beach,"Iceland is of an impressive wild beauty.  Expect to be walking a lot, sometimes in uncomfortable weather conditions, but it is worth it, you won't even notice the effort!  Black sand beach in south coast is exceptional, black sand that meets the blue sea hitting powerful waves, make sure to go to Reynisfjara Beach and sightsee as much as possible around."
Nature at its finest,It‚Äôs not everywhere that you see a black sand beach! It‚Äôs such a beautiful place! And the mountain is so unique and breathtaking!
Beautiful beach with sneaker waves!,"A very busy tourist beach/attraction.  My husband had read about it and wanted to go as it reminded him of Giants Causeway in Northern Ireland.  The waves are quite large and really sneak up on you.  I know, I got hit with one non expectedly.  Unique beach.  Picturesque.  So glad we went.  It was fun, but watch the waves!"
a sight not to be missed,we did this as part of a self guided tour with nordic visitor for 5 days in iceland that were perfect
Awesome rock formation,"Only ~11Km from Vik, the rock formation at the Black Sand Beach is stunning.  There are also numerous cave structures for photos.  Sneak waves are extremely dangerous so stay clear of the water."
Worth the stop,"We thoroughly enjoyed this stop on our group tour. It was fun watching how high the waves got and, of course, the rocks are amazing!"
Sunrise a must! ,"Great place for sunrise pics - stunning. Be careful of the ‚Äòsneaker‚Äô waves though, deceptively powerful."
A real wow factor,Brave the weather and go. If it is bleak then so much the better to capture the atmosphere.Walk along and enjoy the stone formations and caves
"Spectacular Black Sand Beach in Vik, Iceland!","My family drove from Reykjavik to Vik (Iceland).  The drive was one of the most beautiful trips I have ever taken.  The Icelandic landscape is by turns dramatic, stunning and otherworldly; there are waterfalls that carve up the volcanic landscape, glaciers that seem to push against earth and sky and jagged, angular snowcapped mountains that rise dramatically from the ground.  Icelandic horses and sheep dot the magnificent landscape.  We drove in and out of the rain for hours, and when we got to the beach, the precipitation had intensified; however, the stormy weather couldn't hide the black sand, I think composed of crushed volcanic debris, and the mammoth waves and surf that pounded the Icelandic shore.  What a treat!  Afterwards, we had Icelandic meat soup at The Soup Company.  All in all, an incredible day!"
Loved the rock formations,The sneaker waves from the shore are vicious and can be at your feet in a moment.  The rock formations are some of best I have seen with lots of diversity and texture in a monochromatic gray black motif.It‚Äôs a short stroll to the end and not too strenuous.  Dress warmly as the wind can lash out at you.Some of our best pictures from the trip came from here.
Huge waves ,We went just to see the huges wave sweeping in. Lots of photographers were there and we also got some great pictures. Go just to be amazed of the power in the ocean.
Stunning scenary,"This is well worth the trip, to see the black sand, sea stacks, and amazing basalt rock columns. Many fantastic photo opportunities."
A site to see!,"Made our way here as one of stops  along our route. It was early April but still pretty busy. Beautiful basalt columns near the water with the rock formations coming out of the ocean, not to mention the black sand; it all makes for an very pretty scene. The cave is also cool but you have to be on the watch for falling rocks. We actually had to warn a mom while we were there that pieces of rock were falling where her little child was playing. Also be aware of the warnings posted about getting too close to the waves. It is well known for its dangerous sneaker waves."
Great fine sand,"This beach has beautiful fine black sand, and is much emptier than the more popular Reynisfjara. This opens opportunities for beautiful and enjoyable walks on the glittering sand in amazing surroundings."
Wild And Rugged,"As others have said you can access the black sand beaches at numerous points. On this occasion we parked in Vik and took the coastal path behind the shops. Really windy day which made for some spectacular waves, and really made you aware of the power of the ocean. Amazing geology too with the rock formations and just one of this places that is ideal for photography."
A Must,"There are a few different points to see the black sand beaches I suggest going to a few of them as you'll get very different vantage points. It is absolutely beautiful, the waves are very large and you may get wet feet if you are not wearing proper footwear, however even having gotten wet feet it was absolutely stunning. The landscape is quite different on the south coast and there is very little snow so you can actually see the sand."
Amazing Geology,"Very cool to see the tall cliffs with all the various geological formations.  Be careful of rock fall, especially in the winter.  Also, winds are calmer once you get around the corner away from the parking area."
Fantastic basalt pillars!,"Having no idea what all we would see at the black sand beach, we were thrilled to not only see the giant basalt pillars but a cave where we could see them as the ceiling!  Beautiful rock formations both directions down the beach.   Absolutely amazing at sunset. PLEASE be careful and believe the warning signs for the sneaker waves!  They are NOT kidding, you MUST stay 10 times further away from the waters edge that you even think you need to be.  An tourist was lost just days after we visited.  We would have had no understanding about how deadly these waves are, how fast they move and the INCREDIBLE reach they have had we not been told about them by a tour guide a couple of days before we visited."
Truely stunning ... but watch out for waves!!,Our tour guide told us to watch out for the waves and I had seen videos but even standing 7ft away from the water's edge we still got caught by a sneaker wave and I can tell you that the pull from the water is strong. Its a stunning area with the stand and the cliffs and the caves.
"Incredible Rock Formations, Incredibly Windy","Once you leave the parking lot and round the corner to get on the beach, prepare to hold onto your hats. The wind was more powerful than anything I have felt before. We actually tried running against the wind, it was really funny! There is a large cave you can go inside to escape the wind and admire the jagged walls. The basalt columns are the star of the show.We actually had the opportunity to also view the beach from above (our zipline your guide drove us up to the private overlook) and we stood on the edge of the cliff feeling the wind on the top of the world. So memorable and exclusive to see a perspective not frequently seen by the masses!"
Beautiful place. Beware of weather and tide conditions.,"I‚Äôd say that renting a car when in Iceland is the key to visit many attractions in and out the typical touristic circuit. Mostly now that Iceland is becoming a very popular destination despite of the high costs compared to other places in Europe. Most places in South Coast can get really packed with big and noisy groups and their buses. So getting in these places as early as possible is the only way to enjoy the view and take a pause from the world.The spot counts with a tourists facility with a cafe and restrooms, but I‚Äôm not sure about their schedules during the seasons. There‚Äôs a large parking site as well and very close to the beach.Since I went at the beginning of winter I‚Äôll share so relevant points regard the environment:1) Check the tide and the weather. Some specific parts of the beach are unreachable on the high tide. Plus, Things can get pretty ugly with the wind and the ""sneaker waves‚Äù that come out of nowhere and literally drag whoever is silly enough to give their back to the sea.2) The wind gusts sometimes reach 80-120km/h. On the day I was there I struggled by simply trying to get out of the car and ended with a dent on my calve when it got hit by the door. In these conditions, pay attention with children and the elder. I saw a old lady simply being pushed against the rocks with a sudden wind strike. 3) if have a small car, beware of the wind conditions: the day I went to this spot, a small car simply got out the road with a sudden wind gust and hit a stone wall.  That said, the place is beautiful no matter if the weather is good or post-apocalyptic."
Stunning location,"Beautiful and wild beach. Stunning black sand and huge waves (in February,  very stormy day!)  The waves can be quite dangerous so it's best not to get too close. The rock formations and caves are also stunning. Well worth a visit."
Maybe a cloudy/rainy day will be better,We got there on a sunny day. But I feel a cloudy/rainy day might be a better setting to bring out the gloomy feel haha.
nice but quite crowded when we went,"The black sand beach and rock formations are interesting. But while we were there, it was quite crowded, with multiple tour buses. In our experience, it was not possible to get any photos without including a crowd of people."
Fascinating but can be very dangerous,"The black sand beach is a unique sight to see as well as the lava rock formations and caves that adorn it, very picturesque with lots of photo oppertunities. If you can get down to Vik and see the Lava show showing at I think 1330 and 1700 book on their website using promo code 'ONLINE' they will teach you all about how the rocks form and why the sand is blaxk, you even get to see and feel the heat of real life lava flowing Infront of you I cannot stress enough though you must be careful visiting this beach and the surrounding coast, particularly if you have children. whilst the sea may seem calm 'sneaker waves' have taken many lives from where people thought they were safe and also from tourists pure stupidity"
Very beatiful views. ,Beautiful place with unique basalt beach and cave. Nice waves. Excellent place to make some unique pictures especially in wintertime.
Gorgeous!,"First off, stay away from the water! They have a real problem with sneaker waves that suck people out on a more than comfortable, frequent basis. So, be smart! Otherwise, a gorgeous, windy place. Fun to walk about and take in the sites!"
So pretty,"Such a pretty beach.It was winter, and with the black sand and the snow it was so amazing.Would be even prettier in the summer."
basalt and a beautiful beach,"a very cool stop. take the walk, enjoy the scenery, but dont trust the water - its sneaky and dangerous. dont forget to look up too."
Black Black Sand everywhere ,"Incredible basaltic columns makes wonderful props for many, who climbed on for photos. There is a huge cave craved out of the columns."
Black Sand Beach ,This location was amazing.The lamb at the cafe was the best I had during my visit.The views were breathtaking. I bet it is even more amazing in the summer months.
Wow !,"From tall protruding basalt structures right on the beach to some perfectly round shaped stones to soft black sand, what a contrast.  Then as you walk around the corner of the beach there is a cave like structure.  Although it was cold, it's worth the visit.  Our guide did warn us never wander too close to the waves or turn our backs to the waves as some waves can sweep up suddenly further shore and drag you into the water.  We witnessed some people swept up by the waves to their knees suddenly and being January, it is absolutely freezing."
Stunning,The black sand is amazing to walk on it leaves footprints like soft sand and glistens with the sun when the waves wash over them. The crunch sound is mesmerising care needed as the waves are deceptive and fast.
Don‚Äôt get too near....I did and it was so cold........read the warnings,"This Is an amazing place to visit, 15 minutes from the small town of Vik, we arrived about 11.30am the tour busses and visitors were all heading to the black beach, the  basalt stack and roaring Atlantic sea with it waves that give no warning or care who they knock off their feet were waiting. I was stood probably 50 metres from the caostline and had read the notices about sneaker waves and how dangerous they can be. We were stood admiring the coastline and the waves crashing in and not for a minute did we think we were too close when one wave came rolling in, I turned to run but my foot slipped on the soft black sands and down I went, luckily we were far enough from the sea to get the remenants of the wave crash over my back and legs! There I was In January freezing and wet. We headed straight to the car I stripped off my lower garments and my legs were blue with the cold. Not what I had planned for our visit to the beach.Please be careful, so many people told me afterward how lucky we had been as many people had died standing in the very spot we stood admiring the forces of nature, we were stood only 10 meters away from the cave. I was not the only one caught that day, there must have been at least a dozen more who were around the corner from the cave and basalt stacks. This has not put me off as this place as it is stunning, I will definitely return but will stand much further back and respect the forces of the Atlantic Ocean. If you want to see the trolls in the water, you get a great view of these from the coastline in Vik, not worth the risk to get a great picture from the black beach. We hired a car which gives you the freedom to see the coastline from different areas. At the beach there are toilets and a cafe, the car park is a 5 minute walk from the beach. This really is somewhere worth seeing."
pretty cool,"this area extends for miles. you can pretty much stop anywhere.  if you don't want to, there are small towns where its more accessible."
One of a kind beach.... don't ever go in the water!,"To think of a beach where you can't go in the water, even in summer time....well..this is it.  People don't go here for the waves, but to admire the spectacular view of a truly black sand paradise.  Take amazing pictures and make sure to cover up, cause it's cold and windy.  We climbed the rocks on the shore (to a safe distance) and took amazing pictures.  There are ""beware of currents"" signs everywhere and they tell you that you WILL die if you get caught in a current.  They warn you to not even turn your back to the ocean when taking a picture ...if you are getting close to the water, that is.  They told us that sometimes waves can come and suck you in, to never be seen again.  Despite this chilling fact, this place is a must see."
Interesting but the town of Vik was disappointing,"The black beach is worth the trip to see. It is very unusual. The town of Vik which is next to the beach was, however, quite disappointing. Other than the famous church situated above the town there was little else there."
Quick stop ,Thought we better make a visit as we were passing it‚Äôs just a beach with black sand and a few rocks sticking out of the ocean waves can catch you out so be aware of them Nice landscape but nothing special üòä
Awesome experience,"When we went it was a terribly windy day.  Made for some awesome, crashing, wild waves.  That being said, it was just as interesting to people watch as they ventured too close to the water & had to run when big waves came in.  There‚Äôs a corner where they liked to gather and they were sheltered from the wind but blindsided by the big waves.  Nobody was swept away, thankfully, but some got soaked.  The day we went it was treacherous which made it even more spectacular.  But you need to be smart when visiting here."
Great beach to walk along ,"Unusual looking beach with the black sand due to all the volcanoes, with the waves crashing into beach being white it‚Äôs a wonderfull site.Also great coastal views to add to the beach experience.Worth a walk along."
another wonder of iceland,amazing sight with the shades of grey and black with the volcanic rocks and crashing blue waves. saw some seals in the water and it is extremely windy and rough seas in winter. must stop!
A miracle of nature,"Unique. Anthracite-colored sand and snow white waves.  We have seen a number of dark volcanic sand beaches around the globe but none ofD them brings the colors to such extreme. Oreo-feeling.Take your time and walk along the water edge.Time needed: ca 1h. Do not wear white shoes. If the ocean breeze makes you hungry, the better place for a snack is nearby in Vik."
Beautiful,"This beach is a lovely place to see. We hired a car so decided to stop off here on one of our day trips. The only thing I would say is make sure you bring a packed lunch of some sort as we stopped in the cafe on this beach and it was super expensive, even for Iceland prices and the sandwiches we got were not very nice at all! Otherwise a great place to stop and take some pictures"
Absolutely stunning ,We lived this area but not the number of people who were here.  The cave was very interesting as well as the column like rock formations which were part of it.  The black sand glistened.  The waves crashed on shore.  There were two rock formations that stood guard over the beach.  Breathtaking
So impressive !!!,Really loved the place with the black sand. Even the rain did not mess up the pleasure. Spend quite a while there.
Pretty cool,We went as part of a tour of southern Iceland so we only stayed for 30 mins but it was beautiful nonetheless. Bad weather meant the waves were huge so we didn‚Äôt go in the water but appreciated the views from a safe distance and the sunset was incredible!
Wow. Just wow.,"It is really a big WOW worth. One m6st see this place. There is a discrepance between water and the black beack.The ""cave"" has such an interestig structure, that one should see it without the tourists to really enjoy it. My son said, that in such a place a holly statue would act wonder. Take time, when you go there. It is much too beautiful just to hurry."
Powerful,"If you want to experience the power of nature, this is the place.  The wind was blowing so hard that it took the sand and made it like pepper spray on the back of your neck (because why would you face into it?).  However, the place is stunning.  The rock cliff is stepped (am curious to know how it got that way), there's a little cave people were huddling in, the beach is, obviously, fine black sand, and the Reynisdrangar Columns are intriguing.  There is a cafe at the top of the area that was absolutely PACKED with people who were like ""forget this, I'm going inside.""  Don't let the wind keep you away - this is a force of nature to experience."
Wind like I‚Äôd never experienced ,"This beach is beautiful.  The day we were there the wind blew us around.  I‚Äôve never felt wind like that before.  Needless to say we didn‚Äôt get close to the water.  I‚Äôve only seen columns like that in Ireland.  It‚Äôs pretty amazing.  If it weren‚Äôt so windy, and this cold, we would have wandered around the beach more."
Come for the sand -- stay for the waves and cave!,I'll admit I wasn't too worried about seeing black sand. I've seen a lot of beaches... But the waves! The rocks! Those are the real stars here. Everything is bigger and more dramatic. It turned out to be the highlight of my Iceland trip.
November 2018 visit,"This is a nice black sand beach. There are so many sections to this beach, with great photo opportunities. There are some caves that look really nice inside. There is a car park, a souvenir shop/cafe, and toilets. Watch out for the waves."
Amazing!,"A great place to watch the sun rise - peaceful and stunning scenery - pleasant place to take a walk and enjoy the beach in Iceland.  There is a supermarket, souvenir store and coffee shop right near the beach area"
Stunning!,"This beach is so stunning when the sun is up. We were fortunate enough to be there when the sun was up and also watched the sunrise, whilst in the little cafe warming up with a very tasty hot chocolate. Although very busy, the views were astonishing! This was a 2 and half hour drive from Reykjav√≠k, however we stopped a few times along the way to look at the waterfalls. Would highly recommend to visit here whilst in Iceland."
Very cool beach and special place with a wild ocean,This one fits well in a trip around the street 1 around Island and is special in itself. The unique rock formations and the color of the beach in combination with the sneaky (dangerous) waves at the shore makes it a great experience.
TOURIST SWAMP,The basalt column and soft black sand and sea columns makes this place magically with the thundering waves constantly creeping up to you (Yes travel warnings everywhere on potentially dangerous sneaker waves)Plenty of instagramming photo spots and very inspiring place albeit crowded.Parking is readily available and accessible Highly recommended
cool beach,the sand here is amazing and the columns are so cool.  check this place out.  its worth about 1.5 hours if you explore otherwise you could see it in about 30 minutes maybe 20 if you're in a huge hurry but you shouldnt be in iceland.
How??,"What an amazing sight to see,  I still don‚Äôt understand how the sand is black!?!?  It‚Äôs beautiful you have to pick it up and feel it. Great photo opportunity with mountain like rocks along the shore. We loved it."
The area shown in the photograph is the Reynisfjara Black Sand Beach,"There is a small cafe located at Reynisfjara, and the basaltic columns.  Guidebooks {and a large sign} warm of ""sneaker waves"" here.  The warnings are not in jest--my wife and I saw some small children smacked down by a rogue wave in 2017; the children were nearly swept away from the adults accompanying them on this winder day!"
Amazing Place,This place was amazing and one of the highlights of Iceland. We only had 1 day to explore and we picked this over doing the Golden circle and it wasn't a disappointment. The Rock formations on the side are also very amazing.. The only downside of this place is that it is very crowded and people tend to get in the way of your photo shots. But I would visit again in a heartbeat
Interesting,Worth the visit if you are in the area. Sea can be dangerous if you don't take care. The rollers are awesome
Fantastic black lava beach and unusual basalt rock formations ,"Very interesting, beware of the waves!!!! There have been fatalities here with people being washed out to sea."
A geographers paradise,This was a long journey to see the basalt columns but there are three things here - the cliff the black sand beach and the fantastic waves - other geographical features at the other end of beach a stack and natural arch - Iceland has geographical features in abundance
Its called the black sand beach but you will remember it for the carvings!!,"The rock carvings on this beach not only make it special, they look other worldly, as if some aliens came down here. The black sand around the beach is something that you see all around the coast on this side (Plane wreck, Jokulsarlon etc). Also the drive to reach this very scenic."
Amazing experience,Straight out of Game of Thrones. Beautiful and wild. Don't get too close to the waves as many have been taken down by them. Small cafe on site for food and coffee. My pictures were incredible.
Amazing place,The lava shoots along the cliff face are amazing.  The sand is like crushed lava and fairly coarse.  It's really incredible.  The parking lot is a nightmare and there are a lot of people there.
Stunning,Stunning views of the sea stacks. Beautiful columnar basalt. Well worth a visit. Please pay attention to the signs and stay away from the sea!
Amazing,Wow - this is incredible!  It was very cold when we went but it was still amazing.  Seeing the trolls was greasy.  Well worth the visit
Amazing,"We drove down from Keflav√≠k which took around 3 hours stopping at a few waterfalls and volcanoes on the route... the black sands beach was beautiful, something very rare and worth a visit! The care beside the beach is also good value for food! Worth a visit!!"
Surreal!,"It was absolutely tipping it down, freezing cold and the wind was very strong BUT this beach was just special and beautiful. It makes you feel incredibly mindful about where you are and the incredible landscape that surrounds you."
Cool quick stop but super crowded,People everywhere climbing over everything so pictures are impossible unless you're there at sunrise. Cool to see but not worth spending more than a few minutes there.
Rugged and beautiful!,"We have seen black sand beaches before but not like this! Rugged, rough and spectacular! Definitely worth a stop on your travels. Can easily spend an hour walking the beach, taking pictures and enjoying the scenery."
"Uniquely beautiful, iconic Iceland landmark","This beach has some of the most amazingly bizarre natural scenery I have ever seen. The basalt columns are strangely beautiful and made for a perfect photo opportunity. The sand itself was so unique and I couldn‚Äôt help but scoop some up and take it home with me. I loved the dramatic colours, the otherworldly features, and plummeting cliffs above you. I‚Äôm not really a beach fanatic, but this is by far my favourite beach ever!My tips:- Take my advice, arrive sooner rather than later to beat the crowds. If you do arrive at peak time, take your time and be polite with other people try to pose for photos.- Please please please follow the signs - do NOT get too close to the water, it is extremely dangerous and known to sneak up on people and drag them away. - Wander a little way up and down the beach and take photos from every angle, it‚Äôs all beautiful and some of the most stunning pictures we took are from an unsuspecting angle."
Scenery!!,Incredible unique scenery in this beautiful part of Iceland. Took a few hours to drive down from where we stayed near the airport. Driving is never a chore and you see so much of this great country by doing so. I would highly recommend anyone visiting Iceland to hire a car and to visit this particular area. Please note photo is from a couple of miles out from the Black Beaches.
My fave when raining,"This place I have been in rain and dry.., we went first it was raining so decided on way back to stop for sunset.., the black basalt columns are much blacker and glimmer in the rain/wet conditions.., were dull grey in sunshine... so if you want a place to go when raining it is the spot...note- I am a rock formation fan! Photo is from beach our dry visit."
Absolutely stunning beach,"Beautiful black sand beach located about 3-3.5 hours from Reykjav√≠k.  It is midnight black sand with tiny pebbles and is an incredible sight to see.  If you have time, book this tour as you will see both black sand beaches in Vik and draeholey as well as a glacier, two waterfalls one of which you get to walk behind and stunning dramatic landscapes along the way.  We took some black sand home with us in an empty juice bottle (no signs said this was prohibited, the tour guide did not say we could not take any and the airport never saw or questioned us about it).  My friends and relatives are amazed by it!"
"Rocks and ""caves"" and black sand...","One of those places to go see for the different rock formations all in the same place. Scenic views are great, but would recommend not going during high winds. We went twice - first in winds 35-50mph (stupid tourists) and then in winds under 20mph. Huge difference though the first visit was fun just because. Had to go back to take pictures and really enjoy the visit however..."
Amazing beach. ,So cool to see the black sand and rock columns formed by the eruptions of volcano Katla! Amazing cave formations and big waves! Don't go swimming. Water is freezing
Really Cool,"Really really cool formations. There are views of caves, cliffs,birds, great beaches, enormous waves. A must see. Very busy spot."
Our God creation is so amazing,Quite a unique beach. Black sands and basalt stone formation by nature. Quite cold and windy at that time. Bur it‚Äôs worth te effort.
A Must See Beach!,"This is a must see Beach for anyone going to Iceland! It‚Äôs quite long and does reach the crashes plane site, though it‚Äôs quite the walk. It does get crowded sometimes and has a cafe and washrooms."
Beach ,"Beautiful, must see but be smart and stay well away from the waves. Many warnings on the beach but people still ignore."
Magical,We went to this beach under a wind storm and we did not care because it is so beautiful that it surpasses any weather conditions.  Must see the area were the basal columns are.  They are too beautiful.Do not miss it!
Well worth the drive,"It‚Äôs a bit of long drive from Reykjav√≠k but well worth it , lots of things to stop at and the beach is something you don‚Äôt see everyday . Black sands and impressive rocks coupled by some huge waves coming up to be beach , well worth the visit"
worth to visit,"different landscape and rock with black sand. that is beautiful with strong wind & wave, so that just seem a picture place instead of swimming beach. however, no puffins as they were still at east side during my visit day, no luck but still worth to visit."
Its a must see.,"If there was less people, we would have given this a 5. Its off season, everywhere gas been closed, ive bot seen anyone all week. They are here. It gets rammed but it was stunning. Its a must see i think on the ring road."
Worth the wind,"We went during 66 mph (106 kph) winds in November. It was worth it, but it did add an element of danger. The wind would whip up clouds of black sand that we later had to shake out of our clothes. We also walked backwards off the beach to keep sand out of our eyes. It made it feel even more like we were in Game of Thrones."
Breathtaking ,"Perfect location to watch the sunrise or set. The different rock formations, waves and black sand can provide stunning photographs. Watch out for the waves, as they can creep up on people very quickly. Well worth a stop to look at."
Stunning bit of nature,Really unique place where the sea transitions to pure black sand and immediately to hundreds of shiny black basalt columns. Visited on a day when it was misty and rainy giving the place a very special atmosphere. Well worth the visit.
Amazing Formations,"There were several black sand beaches. The one seemingly most popular with tourists doing the circuit  had a large car park for coaches etc, so was pretty busy. Very clean considering the numbers, and with facilities. But it also had the most notable rock formations.  On the other hand and just behind Vik and walkable was an almost deserted black sand beach, differently impressive, and well worth a look."
You Don't Need to Pay to See The Black Sand Beach!!,"AVOID PAYING TO SEE BLACK SAND BEACHES!! These beaches are everywhere, easily accessible and a place you do NOT have to pay to get to or to see. Please heed this warning! Iceland is expensive enough. This is one thing you absolutely do NOT have to pay for to do.Black Sand Beach found near a gas station, tourist shop and grocery store. Fabulous photo ops everywhere you look. Don't Pay!"
Nice place ,"If you are driving around the south end of the island, a stop at this beach is really worthwhile. It is an opportunity to see a very nice black sand beach."
Travelling.,"We came to the black beach on November, when we were almost alone and had so much fun.One of the most beautiful places I've ever been."
Dragon stone from Game of Thrones,Get there early to avoid the crowds.Also dress warm and with waterproofs as the wind whips along the beach.Plenty of car parking. Pretty church about 1/2 mile up the road on the approach to the beach.
Lots of black sand ,"Indeed this is a black sand beach, with lots of black sand. Very straight with large waves. Pretty windy when we went."
Nature‚Äôs Marvel,Stay safe from the sneaker waves. A must visit !! The beach has a good Reataurant to enjoy a nice coffee.  A very unique destination with basalt blocks standing tall by a very very unpredictable sea.. stay dry and stay on a lookout for any wave coming your way..
A must do.,Yet another spectacular place to visit for free. Such an interesting beach with so many different things to see (and take picts of). Very nice little  restaurant with a very clean bathroom. We did this along with several other sites along the ring road in the south. Easy day if you rent a car and can see at least 5 possibly more interesting sites within 20km of each other. We had a beautiful sunny (but chilly) day.
Worth a Visit!,"It's extremely windy and cold in October.  It's a beautiful beach, with some beautiful landmarks.  The waves are huge and dangerous, so do not plan on swimming, or even getting close to the water."
The place you must visit,We stopped at the Black Sand Beach and were impressed in every direction.  The cliffs and basalt columns are impressive and beg to have photos taken.  Some areas the sand reminded me of crushed anthracite coal. There were impressive Black-Lugged Kittiwakes flying around and landing on the cliffs.  Definitely worth a stop.
Really cool basalt columns,We stopped briefly to walk on the beach and to see the basalt columns.  The beaches are small smooth pebbles rather than sand. Very cool experience.
Trip highlight,"The black sand beach outside of Vik was one of the highlights of our recent trip.  While there are many visitors, even in late October, the beach is so large you can get away from the crowds and feel like you're alone.  Parking can be difficult so pick the nearest spot available and get out and walk."
Must go!,Was rainy and windy. Loved every minute! At restaurant order mozerella sticks. Tell me what in sauce. Wife liked waterfalls best. This was my favorite destination!
Amazing place,"Great experience, check out the rock formations in the water and in the cliffs... watch the waves...;)"
Dramatic beach scenery,"With its black sand, grey sea and crashing white waves, this extraordinary beach can be a study in black and white on a dull day. We were lucky enough to have some sun too! The bizarre rocks poking out of the sea, the high cliffs and the basalt caves add to the otherworldliness of the experience. The beach is an easy walk from car parks in the centre of town."
Beautiful ,Loved stopping at this beach! The black sand is amazing! The waves are also incredible! Definitely worth a stop to see such an amazing beach!
Incredible ,"Roaring waves from the North Atlantic highlights this incredible spot. If u like Giants causeway, then this will blow you away. Literally. Bring rain and wind gear."
Unmissable,This is e erything it promised to be. The views are stunning and so are the rock formations. Arrive early or go for sunset to catch some amazing photo opportunities. However it does get busy with coach loads of people all wanting to take pictures of the same things.
Black sand with lovely ocean views,"Although there are lots of tourists, it‚Äôs still worth a visit to see the black sand beach. Best time to go is sunrise or sunset. The ocean waves can be quite dangerous so be careful if you‚Äôre near the water."
Beautiful Place,"This was one of many stop on our visit to Iceland. It was certainly one of the most beautiful. The walk was stunning and the cliffs magnificent. As a photographer this has been on my bucket list forever, happy to have made it."
"Interesting views & rock formation, very crowded.","The black sand, basalt rock, and caves are all very interesting and impressive.  We were a little disappointed that it was too crowded to take a good picture.  If you can, do it very early or late in a day to avoid the crowd.  Also, there is a little cafe and restroom (which requires a fee). If you make a purchase in the cafe, you can use the restroom for free."
Not as much as I heard,"It was certainly peculiar rock shapes due to rapid cooling of magma. And the beach sand is of black, which is unusual at other places. However, too many tourists are around during daytime to appreciate the whole scenery. It would be a good idea to visit early morning or late evening."
Must see,"This beach is so interesting. Basalt rock, caves, black sand, unique formations and great waves make this a great experience. There is a little cafe to warm up and get great food. We were there in the rain with winds so make sure you dress appropriately. Leggings and tennis shoes not so good. Be aware of the sneaker waves that will kill you and sweep you out to sea."
Amazing views,"We visited the black sand beach as it was a short walk from where we were staying. I‚Äôm glad we did, there are stunning views and really interesting basalt columns. Car parking is quite tight so go early, which also allows you to see the sunrise, which is spectacular!"
Unreal views,"This place is just beautiful. Amazing photo-op. The crowds can be a bummer but I guess they think the same about me coz I‚Äôm crowd to them! HahaLava beach is hard to walk barefoot on, the water is freezing cold and the waves are too sudden and high to swim. In fact they are called ‚Äòsneaker waves‚Äô because they just sneak up on you and therefore, no swimming is allowed. I thought those waves sounded like an incoming fighter jet! My cousin heard it too. There‚Äôs a big restaurant/coffee shop nearby with restrooms."
"Interesting, but crowded","Easy to get to with a good size parking lot at the Black Sand Beach restaurant then a short walk to be on the black sand beach. The beach stretches both directions, but go east (to the left as you walk toward the water from the restaurant) to get a good view of the Basalt Columns (aka the Reynisdrangarwhich) are just off shore. As you walk along the beach in this direction you also get to see or even go inside H√°lsanefshellir Cave. The rock formations are interesting and unique, but it is likely to be extremely crowded."
Basalt Columns and more!,"I had always wanted to see these basalt columns for myself so a stop at Reynisfjara beach was a must on the way to Jokulsarlon.  The crowds were moderate and if you're patient enough you will have an opportunity to stand on one of the columns and take a picture without anyone else photobombing you.  The views from the beach are awesome so if you have time to talk the beach, please do!"
A great quick stop,Really cool place to visit. Personally I don't think you'll need to much time. Seeing black sand is a big change to what we are use to. Don't get to close to the water as you can easily get soaked. It happened to us along with 20+ people who weren't expecting the wave to make it's way that quickly up the shore. Enjoy the views!
Beautiful beach,This place is amazing. Never seen anywhere like it. Well worth the drive. Not very crowded at all. Highly suggest having your own vehicle to stop at places like this in Iceland.
Mesmerizing,We‚Äôve been at this mesmerising place during sunset and I feel like it was the best choice. The sea was wild and charming. Black sand was delightfully contrasting with the colours of the sunset sky. Simply beautiful. We‚Äôve also been fortunate to see a lot of puffins! Absolutely enjoyed it with Bonobo‚Äôs album playing in my mind. Worth it.
interesting rock formations,"black sand is something you don't see everyday, but one should understand ""the black sand beach"" is far from the only such beach in Iceland; besides that - the rock formations are interesting and climbing them can be fun"
Cool stone formations,"Very cool stone formations. Nice leisurely walk along the beach. Beautiful area, good location for photos."
Stunning scenery,"I can't really add much to what everybody else has been saying here - except to point out that you should look upwards at the grassy cliffs to see if you can spot any sheep grazing on the almost-sheer slopes, clinging on like Spider-Sheeps. One day a sheep will lose its footing and come bouncing down to land on a tourist...!  Also make sure to enjoy the rumbling of the waves under your feet (it's like an earthquake). On a negative note, if you're going to smoke, please take your disgusting cigarette butts with you as they REALLY stand out on the black sand. Show some respect!"
Reynisfjara,"I think these places are one in the same. Breathtaking! The basalt sea stacks are fun to climb. Beware, some of those waves will make it up to where you are standing. Cool cave on the other side of the sea stacks."
Eerily Amazing! ,"Wow! Incredible beach with so much to see! The rock formations and caves are impressive, as is the beach itself - the waves are so powerful! Make sure you walk to the end of the beach and climb over the rocks to go to the next beach over....you'll get a completely different view of the rocks in the water."
South coast tour,"My partner and I went on a South coast tour with extreme Iceland, as part of this tour we attended the black sand beach. Despite the weather being poor, the beach is really facinating to see. The surrounding caves are great to take photos of and there was a lot of people around the basalt cliffs. The only downsides I would say are: we were warned not to go too close to the sea as waves can be unexpectedly high at times. And secondly the only toilets in the area were in a cafe which you had to be a customer of to use. Other than that I would definitely recommend going if you're in Vik area"
Beautiful cove of Iceland,"We visited at low tide so I was able to explore everywhere without too much risk of getting wet. As all the signs say, please don't go near the water especially children. The hexagon stones were a jungle gym to explore but also dangerous if you got higher. Take several hours here trust me, you'll thank me later"
"Worth the stop, but...","Just keep in mind that it will be overrun with tourists.  Even in October and some of those tourists are just plain rude...along with their tour group leaders.  Rather pushy and oblivious of others who are trying to enjoy the same space.The rock formations are cool but it was, frankly, the least enjoyable stop on my solo tour of Iceland. I enjoyed the beach and rocks a bit further down the road far more.  It didn't have the same formation of stacked rock columns but it also didn't have the same amount of people jockeying for space.I'd say if you can find a parking spot it's worth a quick look.  I'd hate to see it in prime season."
Best sunset ever!,"After a grey Icelandic day, we were soaking up the moody atmosphere of this remarkable beach, when the sun broke through to give us a spectacle to beat all! What a finale to our dayn"
a noted attraction - worthy of a stop,go first thing (7.30/8.00am) in the morning before the tourist buses get there - you will be mostly alone
"Sand, Cave & Waves.. Oh my !","Enjoy the sights and sounds of Reynisfjara's Black Sand Beach near the village of Vik on the South Coast of Iceland. You will see the very large basalt stacks out in the ocean to the left of the with Columnar Basalt Cave.  Beware of the ""Sneaker waves"" they are like no other and can wisk a person away without warning, The black sand is very soft and you can enjoy a walk into the cave. Also out in the distance in the ocean you can see what is called the Four (or five) doors. a massive volcanic ledge off to the right."
Wow - great at sunset in winter,Amazing black sand beach with columnar basalt.  Cafe on the beach.  Great place to be for the sunset - definitely don't miss this.
Nice!,"I think people are confusing this black sand beach with Reynisfjara Beach. Based on the map, this is the one in Vik, behind the N1 and the Kronan shopping center. Tour buses stop here, so between the shopping center, the gas station and this beach, parking can be tough. The beach is a short walk from the parking lot. It's a nice soft black sand. When you look to your right you see the Reynisdrangur sea stacks. Gorgeous view of the beach, sea and the sea stacks. If you turn around and look towards Vik you see the little red church on top of the hill. Be sure to go to the church to see the beach and sea stacks from above."
Nice black sand beach,"At the time we were there, the sky was overcast and the wind was so strong, so we felt a bit uncomfortable. If the weather is good and sky is clear, it will be a nice place to enjoy the sunset. The view is also very nice."
"Must see meeting of earth and sea with black sand, high waves and dramatic peaks surrounded by fields of sheep.","Nature at it's finest.After seven days in Reykjavik, I was becoming a bit Iceland bored. How many very expensive was can you say Lamb and Cod, or is it Cod and Lamb. After my auto adventure to Black Beach, I can see my return with a complete circumnavigation of the island seeking  more wonderful Icelandic scenery."
Absolutely Amazing ,"I would highly recommend seeing this attraction. To see and touch the black beautiful sand was amazing. The rocks, sand and everything is black and beautiful. Definitely make the trip to see this beach."
Never say a black sand beach before,The black sand beach was awesome but getting to it was somewhat of a chore. The parking lot was completely overflowing so we had to park along the road significantly far from the beach and walk over. Nonetheless it's still a great uniques Icelandic experience.
Wonderful but don't turn your back on the water and you can't avoid the crowds,"This is well worth the trip.  It was crowded as its a tour bus stop so you will be sore pressed to get a picture with others in the background but we went in January and I imagine we went on a slightly more quiet day..I can't imagine what this would be like in summer.  I wasn't sure about visiting it as I kind of thought - yes beach but black sand and so what - but just to see the sheet power of the ocean - you can hear the waves crashing from the car park its so loud.  Pay close attention to the signs telling you not to tun your back on the waves - may have lost their lives. When we were there one photographer, keen to get a picture of just him in it went a bit too close to the waves and got knocked over - I don't even want to think abut what happened to his camera but he got soaked and could have easily been dragged in had he been a few feet further in.  Very atmospheric and the sand is black as its volcanic.  Make sure you stop to go to the toilet before going as you have to pay to use the conveniences there.  Worth the trip 0 we went on our own but I can see why its a tour bus stop"
Amazing,"This beach is amazing.  Go early to try and beat the crowds and mind the sneaker waves, stay back from the water, it can be very dangerous."
Thor's Hammer must be spinning because it is windy!,"Sweet Odin's ghost it was wi dy!  The caves were magnificent as we made it there just before dark.  A huge wind storm blew in about an hour earlier, but that won't stop us!  Beautiful black sand looks awesome, except when being hurled at you at 80 mph.  The caves provided me great shelter while i waited for my momnt to crawl back to civilization, nearly being blown into the North Sea.  Thankfully, the gods were sming upon me and I made it inside for some warm and delicious pasta.  Bring your wallet as it is pricey, just like everything on the island.  I can't wait for the next time I come back in the daylight."
Different kind of walk along the beach,"We were staying in vik for the night and This place is worth a visit if you are in the area.Not sure I would travel a long way just to see the beach but certainly tie it in with a trip to vik.It‚Äôs a really nice beach and the rock formations are amazing.We went on a wet and windy day so maybe it wasn‚Äôt as good as it could have been.On a good day you can walk for a good couple of miles, maybe more.There‚Äôs a restaurant/cafe there but not sure what it‚Äôs like.Parking was free when we visited."
One word. ‚ÄúMagical‚Äù,Beautiful black sand beach with very strange rock formation. I am not geology student or something but I was really amazed by the beautiful rock formation. It‚Äôs 6 km from main route 1. Little outside of Town called Vik.
Beautiful!,"Black Sand Beach is a wonderful place to go when in Iceland! I went with a tour group, but would have loved to have extra time to explore. Don't miss it!"
Black sand beach.,"Nice to walk on with running shoes, lots of great pictures to take Bring a good camera, A cell phone does not do it justice.Lots of crags and birds be sure to go to Puffin Island with the ferry."
Pleasant surprise,"While this is the same as reynisfjara beach the sands here are some of the most unique I have ever encountered. Unlike fine sands these here are more coarse, almost like cat litter. While here we marveled at the basalt columns and climbed around for a time while watching the sun rise ever higher in the sky from morning. While searching the sea for some time we even caught sight of some kind of whale, which made the trip."
Black Sand Beach with incredible basalt.,"Romantic, dramatic and the most natural architectural place in Iceland. Basalt, Cave, black sand, black pebbles, gashing waves and articulated structure on the shore surrounded by water are few things which will make you wanna stay for a longer time in Black Sand Beach. The day we went it was windy and the waves were at high force, the waves were leaving white foamy thing on the black sand and that was so incredible to watch."
Excellent black sands!,Beautiful scenery and stunning geology. Beware of the sneaker waves! They can rush up and wet your feet when you least expect it.  It can also can quite windy.
Beautiful and dramatic,"The beach is gorgeous, black pebbles with beautiful slate cave which has unusual 3 D structure. As you walk down towards basalticrock formations, known also to be a game of thrones set for Dragonstone island, sticking out the sea the picture becomes more dramatic. It is a must see place but be cautious as beach is notorious for producing large waves suddenly and there are notifications re recent deaths caused by sudden waves."
Such a view,What a view from the beach!  I've never seen such layers of rock and outcropping rock in the water.  We hiked to the top of the cliff for an impressive view of the area.
Very intense!,"We were not sure if we wanted to drive this far but we did and it was worth it! The black sand is very different to anything else you have stepped  on, the waves were ferocious, the caves and basalt columns amazing! I loved it!"
A must see on your trip around Iceland,"This beach is a major tourist stop, so it can get crowded. The rock formations are very interesting. Worth a short visit"
A Must See,A must see experience! I wish I had had more time to just stop and marvel at the natural beauty. This is an activity that can/should be done in any weather condition as it takes on a different mystique and atmosphere with the changing weather and time of day. Simply beautiful.
Really worth it but kinda crowded,You must stop there and admire the rock formations next to the black sand beach. It is known also to be a game of thrones set for Dragonstone island :)
Unique beauty ,We walked on this beach and rode horses too!!  A must see!  Great spot for beautiful photos. Basalt columns.
Otherwordly,The sand is pitch black - with rock columns protruding from shallow waters. We were there on a rainy day in in November and were glad we braved the winds and rains! It is one of those places which makes you feel very small and appreciate nature‚Äôs forces at work.
Amazing,"Out of this world , breathtaking views.Black stone beach with beautiful slate mountain face. This beach is just gorgeous, there is a cafe the also for your  hit of morning coffee to go with your stroll.This is a very popular place so go early and avoid the crowds that flock to admire and fill up the waters edge.CAUTION- this beach is notorious for producing large waves at random times without notice, the waves are so big they break into the beach, so don‚Äôt take the water for granted - stay alert and be aware . There are signs and notifications about the recent deaths on the beach caused by these freak waves .It‚Äôs beautiful, and a must see, you won‚Äôt be disappointed, just practice caution !!!!"
A must stop on the ring road.,"What a perfect spot to experience nature at best. Arrived around 6pm to watch the sunset. No rain, no breeze, but cold 5c."
The Ocean Even Sounds Different There,"Let me start by saying that I've been to other black sand beaches in HI.  But, there was something so much more beautiful and out of this world about the black sand beaches in Vik.  We started out by walking out to the water and words can't describe it but the ocean sounded different.  And I've been to the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and multiple beaches but there was just a different surreal sound to the water that I've never heard before. I attribute it to the mystical nature of Iceland. The beach and surrounding sights along the water are well worth your time."
Look at them climb ,The consistency and aesthetic of cigarette ash. Hold on until Vik if you don't want to pay for the toilet. 1 circle.
Unusual to see black sand and it was an experience,Great place to check out the cave and basalt cliffs but be careful of the sneaker waves. Lots of people at the time we visited and saw a few that were hang gliders.
"Nice, but too touristy","I really enjoyed the ambiance of this location, the basalt rocks were amazing and the beach was fantastic. The only annoying part was everyone was trying to climb the rocks, and I really don't want you in my photos."
Beautiful but crowded!,"Not my idea of pristine Iceland. Lots of people and buses.This is not on our list of must see places when my wife and I traveled around the country.No doubt, it is pretty though and worth it during the ""off"" season."
Cool to see,"Cool to visit this beach if in the area. I prefer diamond beach if you only have time for one black sand beach. But of course, the two beaches are unique in their own way."
Amazing!,"Stunning basalt columns that you can wonder at, climb on, sit on, photograph etc. Round the corner is a big cave with stunning rock formations in the roof. Sea stacks to both left and right of the black sand beach make this place a bit of Geography heaven!"
Can be done quickly,"Make sure you walk around the ""corner"" on the beach, go over the small rocks and find some interesting rock formation for more photos. You'll also be able to see the rocks in the water better.No need to walk all the way towards the arch which in on the west side of the beach though. The whole thing can be done very quickly.Look out for puffin birds as well."
"Beautiful, intense, not to be missed",Make sure you take the time to drive off the main highway 1 down to the beach. The road down resembles celtic pastures. The beach is intense as the ocean is pretty active. Don't turn your back on it and don't risk getting wet. Take your time to get pics of the basalt formations and look around for interesting birds. Worth the time. No cost to park/enter.
amazing part of nature,As it was just a day before midsummer there was light all around even at a later hour - sadly many tourist too - the water ans swell was amazing offsetting the color of the stone on the black beach.
Not to miss!,"Beautiful beach, not for sunbathing, but just to absorb the beauty of nature. Go early in the morning or late afternoon to have the best light for pictures."
A Little Crowded but not to be missed,"Visited during peak travel time but the crowds to very little to diminish the grandeur of this beach. It is waaaay more than a black sand beach as the lava formations were more impressive, beautiful and varied than anything we saw in our two weeks on the Golden Circle. There is a puffin colony as well for bonus (points)."
Wow,Great cliffs and unusual rock formations. A must see.  However it is very busy as it is a Golden Circle destination.  Parking is intense but doable. Try to pick a quiet (?) time if you want to walk around.  Outside of the formations there is a much better black beach at the end of Vik which also has beautiful photo opportunities and is off the big tourist beat.
amazing black sand beach,"this is one of the best beaches I ever visited: black volcanic sand, smooth pebbles, massive basalt pillars amongst a big cave, rocks jutting out of the sea to create a mystical setting worthy of films, could sit here all day!"
Awesome stop as part of the South Coast Day Tour - visiting a black sand beach is unique,"The scenery is awesome with the black sand and cliffs and ocean surf.  The ocean surf and white foam looks pretty interesting with the contrast of the black sand. Got to see a bunch of Puffin birds as well in their nest on the cliffs.  This is a must see.  Tip: For those on the group tours for the South Coast which stop at the Ice Cave mall for the lunch stop, would recommend going to a different black sand beach behind the mall for photos."
Breathtaking,"An amazing location, an area of outstanding natural beauty. A MUST see if travelling to Vik or even iceland. The views surrounding the beach are also incredible."
Beautiful. ,This beach had a lot a gorgeous landscapes to admire. Basaltic columns. Rock formations. Interesting stones. Miles of foaming crashing waves. It's just beautiful. We also are at the hot dog wagon outside the main building. You have to try an Icelandic hot dog. It's really good.
Nice rock formations and beach,"Stopped at this beach to see the basalt formations and black sand. The stop was good, not extremely awesome but a good representation of volcanic basalt formations and of course, black sand. Didn't visit the tourist center but did use the restrooms. There is no charge for using the restroom even though there is a credit card machine next to the door. Just open it, it's free."
Black sand beach ,"This place is stunning. Can be crowded. If you go to the left, climb over a few rocks, there is another section that few go too. The view is gorgeous. You can see Vic if you walk the beach  to the left. I absolutely love this place."
Overcrowded,"Lots of people on the beach, what it makes disappointing. We were there around 15.00 hrs . I suppose early morning or late in the evening it will be better. Really nice place without visitors. Vik is probably overcrowded because from Reykjavik it‚Äôs a one day trip."
Top Spot On Trip,The positive energy experiencing and watching other people experience this incredible beach was amazing.  We went to vik first (nice store and cafeteria) and then headed back west to the road that took us to the beach where the the unique cliffs are located.  We rented a car around 700 am and got to the the beach about 200hours later.  Our google map on the phone worked fine.  Glad we were not tied to a bus line tour.
Very pretty public beach ,"Small beach but pretty.  There‚Äôs a lot of horse droppings, like everywhere, because there‚Äôs a horse back riding place very nearby that guides tours through this beach several times a day."
"Ought to be on your ""bucket list"" !","A once in a lifetime experience.Recently a good road was laid down to Reynis-fjara (Black Sand Beach),and i went down there with my dad(who is a guide, and so comes there often)-I had driven past the Very rough dirt road often enough...but I tell you, if you have the opportunity to go down there...especially if the weather is fine... (wich it was - really fine!)...don't let this Unreal & Magical place pass you by!Btw.: If you look directly south, the next landfall is...Antarctica!"
Game of thrones come to life,"We almost skipped this the first time we went to Vik but I'm glad we went back. The basalt columns are truly a sight to behold. The formations are like something out of Game of Thrones! Parking can be a bit rough since there's tour buses constantly going in and out but once you walk past the sheep-lined mountains, the little beach with basalt cave, black pebbles and wicked waves is pretty unique. There were loads of tourists everywhere but the stretch of beach is big enough so it was fine. If you look across, you can see the other rock formation (the seaside cliff with a hole which we did not go to)."
Spectacular Spectacular,Just Spectacular! From the Basalt Columns to the Black Sand Beach to the Lava Formations in the surf...
Amazing place and view,Amazing  gray place with rocks that look like an organ in a church and misterious cave and gray sand with beautiful sights of the occean.
Cool rock formations,"There are 2 sides to access this beach.  I experience both area.  Google map will take you to the large parking lot where the crowd shows up by the bus loads.  From the packed parking there is a the black beach cafe.  There are hoards of people taking photos by the rock columns.  I took a nice short walk and climbed over a few rocks to get to a peaceful area.  Well worth the short easy trek.  The birds, little caves and powerful waves made this place a great place to spend a couple hours.  Pictures I posted is landmarks to get to the peaceful side of the beach.  The coffee cups is the other side of the beach.  To access that area, park behind  behind the Icewear plaza.  You will be treated to the beach all to yourself. So go do both and experience the difference."
Stunning but packed with people,Out of all the places we visited in Iceland this was the most packed with people. There were tour buses of people being dropped off and it was a little bit hard to enjoy. It was raining when we went and there were still tons of visitors. I would suggest getting there early in the morning.
Nature at its absolute best,"Surreal beach, powerful waves, volcanic sand, breath taking views. A must visit when you are in Iceland."
Unique rock formations,"This was one of the stops we made through a tour company out of Reykjavik.  The weather was very windy and rainy that day but we are glad we went.  If you do go, please read the warning signs about ""sneaker"" waves, which we had never heard about before.  People can be swept out to sea by these waves.  The rock formations here were so unique and we were also able to see some puffins.  Glad we went."
Beautiful Beach and rock formations,The Black Sand Beach is a must see on a trip to Iceland. In addition to the stunning beach and fascinating rock formations were the birds. We saw dozens of puffins nesting in the grass above the rocks. The views of the ocean and the black sands were amazing. Good exercise walking along the beach.
Breathtaking views!,"This beach really is unlike anything you'll see anywhere else in the world.  The nearby village is also adorable.  I highly recommend driving through Selfoss and grabbing a coffee at Kaffi Krus after the visit, too."
Not that much to see - just black sand on a beach,"Seeing the black sand beaches themselves are not that impressive, but if you want to really see some impressive waves and feel the mist of the sea, I highly recommend dyrholaey which is just around a hill about 10 minutes away."
Must see,"Beautiful visit here, so peaceful and quiet! Try the hotdog stand there and get an Icelandic hot-dog, so yummy! It does get quite crowded there though so go early"
Don't miss it,Lovely beach full of charm - walk around the basalt formations but watch the tides which can surge and one wave out of 20 comes in much further than the other 19!
Nice Beach,"Just as the name says, the whole beach is Black. Went there when it was cloudy and when it was sunny. Whatever the weather, it is still good for a few photos. Be careful not to get too close to the sea, as strong winds means large waves!"
Nice and interesting,The beach is something special the waves the rocks and all the seround enviroment. Its not usual to see the black sand.
Puffins!,"We were lucky enough to see a couple of dozen puffins at the beach on August 24th.  I had heard that the day before there were hundreds.  As puffins generally all leave about the same day each year, I worried that was their final day.  But, we did enjoy seeing a handful of them on the 24th.  I imagine they have all left for the winter by now.  The beach is beautiful.  It is a bit challenging to stroll down as it is made up of a thick layer of medium sized black rocks.  You feel like you've been trudging through about a foot of snow instead of strolling along a typical beach.  But, the views of the basalt columns are worth the walk.  I would plan well over an hour for this visit.  The walk takes a while & you do not want to rush it & miss the beautiful scenery.  I could have spent an entire day just enjoying the birds, waves, and views.  Our guide did warn us that the ocean in this area is particularly dangerous.  There is a history of sneaker waves that will take you out to sea & the rip currents are quite bad in the area.  The non-puffin type bird that frequents the area apparently also has a pesky habit of vomiting on people if they get too close to them. I didn't see the birds up close, but I did not try to either.  If you avoid getting in the water & the wrath of the birds, it is a beautiful area to visit.  If I make it to Iceland again, it is on my short list of places that I must visit again."
Interesting,"2.5 hours from Reykjavik in the summer.  Plenty of people around.  Probably gets cold if the weather isn't too good.  Lots of warnings about going near the water but, of course, there were lots of people milling around at the edge.  Vik has most things and was a good place to grab gas and a cup of coffee.  Easy to find.  Saw one of the Glaciers on the way back - short walk from the car park although you cant go right up near it without a permit."
A Senior at Black Sand Beach,"Magnificent surf and sand!  Surf was wild and threatening, very exciting as long as you didn't get too close.  Very cold and blustery when we were there but wouldn't miss the experience."
Reynisfjara - basalt columns were inspiration for Hallgrimskirkja,We did this as part of the Gray Line South Coast tour.  We had plenty of time to see the beach and basalt columns.  This are similar to the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland.   It is amazing how the lava has cooled in the hexagonal columns.  The columns  were inspiration for Hallgrimskirkja church in Reykjavik.
Beautiful black sand beaches ,"Lots of tourists but still so exciting to see and experience.  The sand, the water, the rock formations, the caves, the birds ... all worth the trip."
Too busy,"Apart from the very impressive Basalt columns on the beach there were far too many visitors crowding the place out. In our opinion the Black beach in Vik itself was just as good, here you got to see all three sea stacks in a more natural quiet environment, whereas you can only see two of them here. Was worth visiting but was slightly disappointing."
Interesting formations,"While the formations are not too big, it is very interesting to look at them. Be careful do not go too close to the sea because waves can come unexpectedly. Little difficult to arrive but plenty of parking."
Worth the trip ,"On our tour of southern Iceland, Vik is as far south-east as we went, and it was totally worth it. Our trip to Iceland was full of firsts as it is such a unique place and the black beach is up there. Let's face it, where else are you going to find one. We spent a good while just‚Ä¶"
Columns and sand,The Black sand beach is unlike any beach I've ever been on - and heed the warnings about sudden waves -  tourists drown here by being ignorant of their surroundings.  The basalt columns are always interesting and you can look out to the unworldly stones rising from the ocean!
"Unique, interesting - Don't bring your swinsuit though!","The black beach is .... well black of course, it also has a number of caves and square profile forms of basalt in the side of the cliff, formed from when soft lava rock has been worn away. There is a perch above where loads of puffins are flying in and out (save teh cost of a‚Ä¶"
Worth a visit,"Amazing place to visit, a must see in Iceland, but get here early to avoid the crowds. Coach after coach of tourists turn up after 12. I was pleased I got here before as don't think we would have got in to the car park if we had of arrived later."
Must visit ,Everywhere in Iceland is postcard perfect. The drive to the black sand beach is amazingly beautiful. This is a highly tourist spot so be patient if you want a picture without tourist in it. It‚Äôs really tiny black pebble rock beach rather than sand. So you don‚Äôt really get sand‚Ä¶
Gorgeous basalt rock formations,This was one of my favorite stops along our drive. The basalt columns were so cool and interesting and the black sand was very cool. Loved watching the puffins fly back and forth from the cliffs to the ocean and back. Great place to take pictures. Parking was a little tough as there were so many people there. Bathrooms were available and there was a couple of options for food as well. Simply beautiful.
Surreal!,"I've never seen anything like it. Puffins, black sand, and the wild ocean,It's spectacular and a must if you visit Iceland."
Unique Beach,The basalt columns and caves form an ominous background to this black sand beach.  One is warned repeatedly to beware of sneaker waves as they have swept unsuspecting tourists out to sea.  We visited in early morning and saw puffins along the cliffs backing up the beach.  THe cafe was not yet opened.  In fact we noticed that nothing much is open early in Iceland.
Worth stopping to see,There is no shortage of black sand round the coast of Iceland so that in itself isn‚Äôt that unique. The rock formations are worth seeing and the view of the Dyrholaey rock arch and the big rocks in the sea add to the experience. Probably better to visit in the afternoon if you want good photographs as the sun will have worked round by that time to light up the rocks.
Nice but...,"Soooo crowded!!!!! Cool rock formations. A must see, but you won‚Äôt be able to enjoy it without other people‚Äôs heads in it."
Very nice and unique beach,"Very unique beach with the black sand and the special cliff  that the kids love to climb on.  Like many other attraction in Iceland its free. Just need not to go to close to the see, un-expected waves can come.."
Those pebbles look good enough to eat,"If you like licorice. What gets called the Black Sand beach and Reynisfjara beach run into each other. The Reynisfjara area includes the sea stacks and cliff faces, while the Black sand beach is the stretch where wind and wave have ground the black basalt finer. We do have long‚Ä¶"
Interesting place ,"Unique geological site.  The sand is black and they have Basalt formations, a cave and a cafeteria. It‚Äôs a fun stop. All kinds of warnings about sneaker waves - Don‚Äôt get too close to the water and the waves.  "
Dont miss it!,"Beautiful scenery and real place look much better than in pictures. Huge and strong waves, becareful not to go too near the shore. Area is big and spread out .. Great place for pictures!"
Disappointed because we didn't see turtles,"We drove there after our hike to green sands beach. The beach is nice, it's peculiar to see sand of that colour. There's  an area with tables by the parking lot and also washrooms. We were just disappointed we didn't see any turtles."
Must See,"Lots of bus, lots of tourists, but you still need to go.  Good people watching.  There is plenty of room to spread out on the beach.  Waves are rough.  Keep an eye on them.  Sea birds like this area.  The rock formations are mesmerizing to look at."
Fantastic columnar basalt formation,My son was studying volcano and rock formations at the time we visited iceland and this beach has a great formation of columnar basalt. It was a very windy day and the sea was ferocious. I'd recommend taking a hat and a snack as the nearest cafe is quite pricey.
FABULOUS,"Having been to beaches worldwide, as a big beach lover, this one gets my vote as a world-class beach!  So unique, so scenic, so powerful dangerous surf-wise, and so embellished with the amazing cliffs, shaft-rock formations and off-shore rock formations too.  I dare you to pick‚Ä¶"
"A magical place to visit - expecially at sunrise. A must-see, definitely!","A beach? With black sand? What's the attraction? Go there. Definitely. Wake up early in the morning, drive there before sunrise, and wait.... a see for yourself :-) Frankly speaking one of the most stunning sunrises ever...  And yes, it is on the other side of the mountain west‚Ä¶"
Trooooolls!!,The Place is so windy but charateristic of Iceland! So Easy ti reach and search for the legends about Trolls... Fantastic!
Yes there are other people but still worth the visit.,Wonderful photo spot with very interesting rock formations and there is a spot to stop and warm up with coffee or tea.  Very unique setting and I believe the location was used for the Game of Thrones.
MUST GO- don't be confused- on OTHER side of mountain from Vik,"Originally we thought that this was the black sand beach right off the town of Vik, but we realized the main entrance for it is on the other side of the mountains (closer to Reykjavik).  The basalt columns were unbelievable. A must stop.  Go early in the morning to avoid the crowds, which get overwhelming"
So Crowded,I felt like we were back in Santa Monica. There were so many people here. But it is certainly a site to see. Bring your binoculars so you can spy on the Puffins as they dive in the water. s
Windy Rainy Day,Good day to sit inside the restaurant with a cup of tea. Could see all I wanted from there. Rain was coming in sideways.
"well worth a visit, possibly at different times of the day","This is an interesting place to visit - black sand (well, more like gray sand), basalt columns, large but shallow caves, offshore sea columns, and puffins & other sea birds flying overhead. In the early morning there aren't many people and the birds are leaving for the day. In the early evening there are people everywhere but they light on the basalt columns and offshore sea columns is great for photos. Consider going at both times of the day if you can!"
Nice but wouldn't make a special trip,"We enjoyed the visit to the black sand beach and it was fun to climb on the stone wall.  However, it was crowded and a bit out of the way.  I would pair the visit with something else, such as ice climbing at the nearby glacier or a visit to the town of Vik.  There was no entry‚Ä¶"
PUFFINS!!,"It was raining the day I went, but a friend and I sat out on the breakwater in the rain sipping coffee and watching puffins flap around in the ocean.   On one end of the beach you can see awesome sea stacks and a mountain that basically rises up vertically from the beach. On the‚Ä¶"
Beautiful Black Sand Beach,We visited Black Sand Beach a couple of weeks ago and it was phenomenal. I wanted to check out the site where the actors sat on the rock outside the cave from the Movie ‚ÄúNoah‚Äôs Ark‚Äù. I seen it on the movie and thought this had to be a dream place and it definitely was. The rock‚Ä¶
Highlight of Iceland visit,"A must must must go. Believe me you will not see anything like this anywhere in the world. The black sands, the extremely strong winds, awe inspiring experience. Very very unique experience. Highly recommended"
Black beach,Wow!! What a place this is!!  One of many spectacular sights in Iceland.  This was so unique.  This has to be one of our favorites.  I would say do not miss this place on your stay in Iceland!
Even at 8.30 a.m. a tour bus beat us there,"It's a lovely way to start the day. Especially as it was sunny and almost warm. The basalt blocks were overwhelmed with the tour bus folks, but they left the beach itself alone, allowing us a peaceful walk west to the rocks. We passed puffins going in and out to the face of the cliff. The basalt cave was also mostly vacant. We stayed around an hour, before getting back in our car and heading west to Vik."
"A wonderful, natural area of beauty.",Easy enough to find but limited parking. We spent about an hour here pottering about the beach and admiring the columns. there are toiletes (paid for) but if you buy something from the caf√© there are loo's inside free for customers - if there are a couple of you its cheaper to buy a bottle of water or pop in the caf√©!
1/2 day at Vik,"Awesome and genuinely ""unique"" !Do not force me to use more than 100 characters,or I will stop reviewing these events altogether."
We love the beach!,"We live near the beach off the Pacific Ocean & this experience was truly amazing because it is so different. Rock formations, the sand, the sunset....all had a very new perspective for our family!Can not recommend the black sand beach cafe but everything else is great!"
Amazing,"Really nice black send beach! A lot of tourists! Not possible to swim there, it‚Äôs even dangerous cause the waves are really strong and the water is very very cold! Would be amazing to have a buggy and go with it back and forward ü§£"
Secret find but amazing!!,"The different views of landscape and formations and puffins made this beach a great place for us. The walking on the sand is a bit strenuous if you aren‚Äôt in shape, but the parking is close to the beach and it is beautiful."
Looking for puffies,We saw it in a dark and rainy day so not the best but I think this also made it more cosy.  We‚Äò ve got the chance to see some puffies there!!!
Impressive stop,"We were lucky. That day we visited Black Sand Beach (Reynisfjara) it was sunny. And warm. And not that windy. So unlike the Icelandic coast. BSB would be impressive even on a cold, windy, overcast or rainy day, but it is staggeringly beautiful under blue skies. Many kilometres of black sand to walk. Soaring cliffs that are home to thousands of gulls, terns and even puffins. And, of course, there are the basalt stack rock formations that everyone loves to climb on. (It's quite straightforward, but easy to find yourself much higher than you imagined.) Well worth the stop, especially considering the BSB are not far off (6km) Highway 1, Iceland's ring road."
Worth a visit,Impressive waves crashing on the beach - and there's something very magical being able to look out to sea and know that if you went due south the first landmass you'd meet would be Antarctica.  And the black pebbles are an amazing contrast to the white surf of the waves.It must get very crowded - there were quite a lot of people there even when we visited at sunrise in January.
Worth visiting ,"Very beautiful place to visit, around 3 hours driving from capital city. Calming effect of sea and interesting black color of beach with beautiful volcanic rocks."
Beautiful!,"We visited this beach on a tour.  It's something you have to see, and one of my favorite places on the whole trip!"
Nice geodes but swarmed with tourists,"Easily to reach from the ring street, this place is worth a visit for some unique pictures! The bad thing is the huge crowd of tourists which makes it Hard to take a picture without strangers on it."
"Great beach, cliffs with puffins, and rock formations","This was a fabulous stop.  The beach is lovely, and the rock formations amazing to see.  The cave is wonderful, as are the cliffs near these with puffins darting in and out.  A worthwhile stop on your journey.  Just be aware of the sea--it can rise suddenly and take unaware tourists away with it."
Puffins will put on a show,"A wonderful stop after driving for awhile. Potty stop and a nice place to get something warm to drink. There is a coffee shop. We were lucky to see the young Puffins practicing their flying skills before they migrate to England. Their beak coloring will darker as they mature. Look up carefully for nests and see the birds flying from the cliffs to the ocean. The Basalt columns were amazing. Bring your telephoto lens, if you have one, to capture the great shots of the birds. No matter how hard you try not to get rocks in your shoes you probably will. There are many boulders around to help you empty your shoes of black sand. Stay away from the water because there are many sneaker waves that can suck you in the water. A nice stop."
Awesome,"The best part of this area was the black beach, the caves and watching the puffins going in and out from the cliffs.  A must do."
Spectacular Iceland Beach,Shaped basalt cliff and Black Sand beach. Foaming waves and strong winds make this an incredible experience.
Unusual lava and rock formations,Stunning crsytalized lava and rock formations...never seen anything similar. Definitely worth a stop to see
Surreal Beach,"We visited here late in the evening with the sun shining. The black sand is so unusual and the sand coupled withe high rocks give a surreal view. It is well worth coming to see this area.There is a restaurant as you head to the beach serving fish, pasta and pizza. It's expensive but so is everything in Iceland."
Go early or late,It is beautiful but crowded (in the summer at least) try going before 8am or after 8pm. Perhaps the crowds lessen in the winter.
Must See ! ,Absolutely love this beach.  So beautiful and such a great place for pictures.  Please be aware of the signs to stay away from the surf.  People seem to ignore that.  Just enjoy the beautiful scenery.
This is the same things as Reynisfjara Beach,This is easily accessible. Lots of tourists. The sand is nice and it's a nice walk up and down the beach. There is a cave and cliffs - a very popular photo op. There is a restaurant onsite with bathrooms.
nice,"nice, black lava sand and interesting rock formations. a lot of people though...a good stop on the ring road.the one in santorini is much nicer :-) but quite further"
Worth a look,"Definitely worth a look when in the area. Try to visit early or late in the day, otherwise the place is overrun by tour buses, camper vans and hundreds of people."
Wow! Amazingly beautiful,Words cannot describe this.  The rocks carved in the hills and caves are just amazing.  Great for photo opps and enjoying a walk on the beach.  Simply beautiful.
Amazing,What to say...simply amazing.The kids loved the basalt columns and the beach.Magical place even without the sun!
Amazing experience ,I visited this location for the second time and I loved it!! You have to be a little careful with the waves. This beach is out of this world!!!
Amazing black volcanic sand,Short walk from the car park makes this an easy must see. Sand is quite soft and a bit difficult to walk on. Is is a sight to see and a must do if in the area. Lovely views and neat geology surrounds this location. It free.
Beautiful views,Beautiful place but it‚Äôs too crowded. Maybe going here in September instead? Bring something to eat because there is a limited offering by the local restaurant.
Super soft black sand,"When we went onto the beach, we expected the sand to be rough, but it actually was rather smooth. We were able to park at a visitor's center without a problem."
Amazing! So fun for kids!,"So far, this is my favorite place in southern Iceland. The black sand is ridiculously cool, but the most fun part was climbing on the basalt columns, climbing the rock formations and enjoying the stunning views. There are warnings all over about the ‚Äúsneaker waves‚Äù so we didn‚Äôt let the kids go right near the water, but there is still plenty of fun to be had! My boys are 9 and 11 and they could have stayed all day! There is also a little caf√© near the parking lot and if you buy something, the bathrooms are free."
Beautiful ,"Absolutely worth a day trip from Reykjav√≠k as there are also many cool things to do along the way. We partnered our trip to Vik with a hike of the glacier. Also nice waterfalls to see along the way. Incredible photos. We were lucky enough to be there when the tide was out, so had access to the cave areas. Black sand and rock formation very unique. Touristy, but absolutely worth seeing. We had a car and drove ourselves and it was a solid 12 hour day of driving and sightseeing, but absolutely worth it!"
Feel the power of the ocean,"A bit touristic, but a must see if you are passing by. A 10 minute drive away from the ringroad you will find a very nice example of basalt formations, black sand, toilets and a bistro."
Black,"Awesome, picturesque beach.  Beware of ocean swells.  Snack bar nearby.  Not far from vik.  Spend at least 45 mins"
Unique sand location in the world,"I came here as part of a tour group, and was taken aback by the sight of dark sand and rock formations which looked like it was man-made, but isn't. I have never seen Game of Thrones but this is a location site for the series, in some episodes. For my personal experience, it was amazing, beautiful landmark yet it was cold on the day."
Neat!,Worth the few minutes trip in. Great sight. Best spot to see the stacked rocks. Really good photos. :)
Worth seeing but not as dramatic as expected,Definitely worth visiting if you are nearby. The caves and rock structures are interesting as well as the famous black sand. The sand is actually in large parts tiny shingle. We were lucky to go on a sunny afternoon which was lovely.
Everyone likes a good photo op,"The Black Sand Beach is a really popular spot for amateur photographers with very few people really paying attention to the beautiful vista. This beach, easily accessible on the Reykjavik side of Vik, features soaring mountains, the famous black sands, caves, incredible rock formations and a glorious view of the coastline. However, most people are only keen to mark the occassion with a selfie."
AMAZING!!!,"This place was other-worldly!!  Like nothing I've ever seen before, so magical!  The bird life circling was super cool, and standing on the basalt columns for a pic was cool!"
Go,It's a good distance from Reykjavik but don't let that stop you. The town of Vik is really cool and the black sand beach is something you have to experience. I didn't think I'd actually get to see a puffin but I was pleasantly surprised to see a few of them diving for their lunch about 50 yards out from the shoreline
Mesmerizing but mass tourism starts to sink in,Nice photo session. Unique black sand. An experience you wont get anything else. The downside is more people coming in and photo session can be chaotic. Best if you go early morning or during low season to appreciate the beauty. A sure must visit of course.
Check the tide schedule,We couldn't see the beautiful rock formations because the tides were high - but it was still gorgeous. Would have been better at lower tides to have been able to walk out to these amazing sites.
Enjoy with caution! Great photo ops!,"I was glad I was warned about the severity of the sleeper waves before traveling here. If you are taking photos any time near high tide, the waves can come very far beyond where you would expect and sweep you out into a riptide. Please mind the signs and do your research so you understand the danger. People die here. Generally crowded, but during the summer you can cheat and stay the night so you can catch it in the early morning or late evenings."
A Must See,This beach and the rocks are not to be missed if your in the area. Accessible with plenty of parking and beautiful views and photo opportunities.
simply gorgeous,We went around 11pm when the sun was about to set. the dim lights were creating a majestic impression on the black sand beach and the cobalt columns. The place is beautiful and unlike anything you will see anywhere.
Amazing place,This place is one of the best ones we've been to in Iceland. The landscape is surreal and beautiful. Go early mornings or late afternoon to avoid tourists. Specially on the summer. Watch out for the sneaker waves. They are really dangerous.
Gorgeous ,The basalt columns are an amazing site and the black sand beach is beautiful with stellar views. Definitely a must see!
Amazing rock formations!,"You absolutely must stop here if you're anywhere nearby, it's less than 10 minutes off the ring road.  Awesome black sand beach and spectacular basalt rock formations along with nesting puffins and gulls.  Iconic Iceland."
Mind the weather,"It is a beautiful site to behold once you eat around the throngs of people who are trying to take exactly the same photos as you.It was a bit stormy the day we went and as with the rest of Iceland, strong winds are quite intense."
The power of nature,Fascinating place and well worth the visit.  This was a must for my son aged 11 as some of the star wars scenes were filmed here.  We had a lovely sunny day to enjoy it here.
A unique black sand beach with basalt columns!,"You won't see anything like this anywhere else, even in Iceland. The basalt columns here are HUGE and I have never seen them as impressive except in northern Ireland at Giant's Causeway. The black sand beach here is different than others--tiny rounded pebbles instead of sand--and the other side of the beach has the small sand particles, so it is so interesting to see the differences. If you like birds, they are HERE! You can scope/view birds on the crags at sea and flying all about--puffins, guillemots, gulls, razorbills, fulmars--so many birds! Watch out for sneaker waves here--the sea can be angry, my friends!"
amazing,"Honestly the rock formations here are incredible.  There is a cave (that was in GoT for fans out there) and around the cave more jutting out rocks.  They're in such unique formations and patterns, it really is cool.  Oh and the sand is black.  It was kind of crowded when we went, so hard to get a picture by yourself, but I definitely recommend.  Going at low tide is best so you have room to walk around the beach and get close to look at everything.  From the wet sand, it looked like the water came pretty close, I'm not even sure how much you could see at high tide."
Must see,"Don‚Äôt miss this unusual sight if you‚Äôre anywhere near V√¨k. The black sand, the basalt columns and formations, puffins nesting, Dyrh√≥laey in the distance are so interesting. But, be sure to stay back from the water‚Äôs edge, and never turn your back on the ocean. Watch out for dangerous sneaker waves!"
Good visit,Very impressive beach even on a bad weather day. One of the reasons why people see V√≠k. You can see a bit of it from the town itself but the long beach part is slightly further to the West.
Stunning,"Just as pictured. Not going to be eSy to say 100 characters - would just say, take the 30 minutes drive off main road to take a look."
Beautiful. ,Beautiful beach with tremendous waves and I interesting rock formations. We stopped here late at night as it was summer and the sun never sets. the setting is just unbelievable.
Unbelievable,"Highly recommend a visit here. The black beach in indescribable with millions of rounded rocks of all sizes and caves carved over millennia from rock that I didn‚Äôt think could form as it did.We built a family cairn on one of the walls, which now stands with hundreds (if not thousands) of other cairns. I wonder if it‚Äôll be there on a future visit?The restaurant was clean and the food was good."
Volcanic Beach is Awesome,"o my weather wasn't the best. 2 days of fog, rain, and high winds, but it didn't stop me from visiting here twice.  Come early or after 5pm to avoid the large number of tourist buses.  Marvel at the beautifully polished volcanic stones on the beach (great for skipping, but no ponds in site), the stacks of volacanic strata, and the masses of birds that nest here.  Like the warnings imply - DO NOT TURN YOUR BACK ON THE WAVES.  Many people - mostly tourists have lost their lives to being swept out to sea by strong currents and waves that are unpredictable.  The bottom drops off sharpy so there is a dangerous undertow.  This is not a beach to get in the water.  I don't know of any beach in Iceland safe to get in the water.  Be careful, watch the waves and your children, but have a marvelous time walking the beach and imaging the forces that shaped these basalt columns and caves."
worth a ride,"The ride to here from Reykjavik  is a full day because of the stops to me made along the way but this is certainly worth part of your day tour out of Reykjavik . The beach and the columns are quite impressive, like so much scenery in Iceland it is simple impressive to see"
amazing lava formations,a short visit is perfect to see these amazing vertical and horizontal basalt formations.the beach is also lovely with all black sand but unfortunately its not advisable to swim here...sneaker waves! Nice to spend a short while here.
"Black sand beach, basalt columns ‚Äì a lava lovers dream!","Overview:  Located about 2.5 hours outside of Reykjavik (180 km/111 miles), Reynisfjara is Iceland‚Äôs most well known black sand beach.  The beach is framed by basalt column cliffs that formed out of lava cooling/contracting from a volcanic eruption; basalt is one of 20+ types of volcanic rock found in Iceland.  Depending on the tide, you might get the chance to stand on the basalt columns or walk into the vaulted caves.   Off the coast, there are 3 freestanding sea stacks, which were once connected to cliffs at the shoreline, but the weather has eroded them to the point of no connection. According to Icelandic folklore, these stacks are the remains of local trolls who battled a ship at seat and turned to stone when daylight broke, and the sun hit them.  These stacks are great for a Leaning Tower of Pisa picture opportunity.Fees:  No site entry or parking fee. Misc: There is a small caf√© and a restroom.  Please note they do charge to use the restroom or ask that you be a caf√© patron.Helpful Tip:  Be extremely careful of the waves or ‚Äúsneaker‚Äù waves as they are unpredictable. The power of the waves and strong current (undertow) are a dangerous mix and is a good reminder to always respect Mother Nature.    Also go early to avoid crowds.Thanks for checking out my review and pictures!   Feel free to leave a thumbs up for a helpful review, and let me know if you have any questions."
So interesting and beautiful!,"Adding this to our trip from Reykjavik made our trip almost 3 hours but it was worth it! This beach area is incredible! Black sand is really found at any beach in Iceland but this beach has the coolest rock formations! You see columns like in the picture above and there are areas with rocks thin on each other reminding me of Mica, the rock that's thin and looks flaky.  Lots of areas for great photo-ops and places to hide. It is very crowded (even at 5pm) especially probably in summer cause it's light out all the time (21 or so hours of daylight). Definitely better than any pictures of it and worth the drive! As we read though in a few places, DO NOT GO TO CLOSE TO THE WATER! We read that one person a year or so dies because they are a tourist and didn't listen and went too close and got pulled in."
This is not the hexagonal basalt cliff beach,"As opposed to the Reynisfjara beach around the corner at the basalt cliffs which is black pebbles, this is sandcastle-building sand in pitch black. Good luck getting your sandcastle to stand up in the howling wind though. Birds abound in the high cliffs above you and the views all around are fantastic. You can‚Äôt get from the Reynisfjara with its basalt columns to here along the coast. You need to drive back up to the N1 and down the other side of the mountain which will take 15 minutes."
Stunning Views,"Reynisfjara, the black sand beach near Vik on the south coast of Iceland.  It is mentioned in all of the guide books, and may be a bit over hyped, but it really is a must visit if you are in iceland.  The Views from the beach are stunning; its easy to imagine that you are on a different planet.  It was very windy the day we were there so dress in layers.  There is ample free parking"
Unique Beach Experience,This place is like no other and well worth the detour off the ring road. The formations are even more incredible in person than the photos. The one downside is how many tourists were there because of the proximity to Reykjav√≠k. It was hard to get photos without strangers in the frame.
Worth the trip there amazing views,This was worth the drive It was an amazing beach and completely black sand Even just hearing the crashing waves were amazing
Extremely hyped but a must visit,Its a short drive from Vik and it is one of the attractions to visit in Iceland. Its generally very windy. There is adequate parking and one can spend an hour or so at this attraction. A good place to click some photographs and collect some pebbles to take back home as a souvenir.
Krypton World,The rock formation is nothing short of spectacular...just wow. You can almost feel like you are in Krypton...
Unique rock stairs,"All cover by black sand and at the left (if you facing the sea) is the stairs like rock, iconic to take selfie here either from the bottom or if you dare to climb the rock."
The one any only,"Amazing experience.  Nowhere else in the world that you can see this.  Watch out for waves... it's not a beach that you can get in, but you gotta check it out when you're in Iceland."
Beautiful,It was raining the day we visited but well worth seeing. The black beach was amazing. Well worth the drive.  We only wish it had been clear.
Sand is super fine very black volcanic ash.,"Wish there was an opportunity to swim, but I don't believe it ever gets warm enough to venture in.  Very pretty.  No other vistors while we were there."
WOW,"It was pouring rain and windy on the day we were here, but it was still one of the best places I‚Äôve ever visited! Gorgeous! Nature at its finest!"
"Amazing, even in the rain and wind!",The basalt columns are amazing; different shapes and sizes. The black sand was everywhere and provided such an amazing contrast. Free parking if I'm not mistaken!
A Time-Lapse view on the Creation of Iceland,"This is it. A stunning view on the principle of creation. Bring good weather.If you want to understand how Iceland - in fact, land - was created, come to this beach. (Of course it is black. All of Iceland is formed from Lava.)Ideally, come on a day that the ocean breakers roll in, all the way from Antartica and anywhere in-between. See the surf crash on the beach (and realise how often the stones were milled by the waves to become so smooth and rounded).Preferably come on a day with some clouds in the sky; and realise that ""clouds"" are 'breakers' of waves of water vapour condensed in the sky. Clouds, like waves, are Flow Forms.If you then look from the clouds back to the waves, then look back: look at the rocks behind the beach and realise that these too are Flow Forms.All of Iceland is a volcano standing on the ocean floor, 2+ kloms below. Parked on the rift where the EuropAfrican and the-Americas continents slowly drift apart. As sung by Leonard Cohen: ""there is a crack in the world where the light comes out"".Iceland is the solidified light that came out of that crack.Frozen Magma, of which the form and shape depend on the way the flow was halted Magma spewed in the air and turned into dust fertilising the land Magma flooding out into the sea, made boiling hot and turned into black foam; foam stone.Magma spewing out of Earth's core, like a water jet from a fire hydrant; to suddenly cool in the air and shrinking back into itself in hexagonal shapes, as snow flakes have too.Magma in motion, stopped in its motion...On this beach you can see the snap shot of the creation of (Ice)land. Just remember to, in your mind, look for the film/movie by which you can understand that the forms that you see is the flow of creation, frozen in time."
"Black sand, black rocks, one of its kind beach","Miracle of Mother Nature, all black beach, thankfully the water was not black, intriguing rock formations and so much to ponder into, this is a must site to visit to appreciate the variety on our planet. We‚Äôd have enjoyed a lot more on a dry sunny day, however the rain didn‚Äôt stop us exploring most of the features of this site. Plan your visits on a warm dry day."
Now this is Cool!,Volcanoes and oceans~ What a mixture of interesting materials. I couldn't even bring home all of my collected volcano rocks!
Lovely beach,Great views. Lot of the game of thrones scenes shot here. Which made it all the more special to see.
Beautful,It was a very windy and cool morning to be on this beach (the wind almost blew we over!) it is still a beautiful place and certainly worth a visit.
Beautiful beach,We had ond of the most breath taking moments at the beach in Vik. Very medatative and peaceful. Doesn‚Äôt seem to be very busy. Only few people were walking the shore. Stop by. Sit down and breath in the scenery.
I dream about this place,"We spent a bit of time here over 3 days--it is so dreamy. Go very early or very late and avoid all of the crowds. And stay away from the water! The waves are crazy--I can't count how many times I saw people almost get hit by sneaker waves because they were too busy trying to get a selfie. If you want to explore all of the beach, consult a tide table before you go."
Don't miss the Black Sand Beach,"We were hoping for a less cloudy day to visit Black Sand Beach but that was not likely during our stay. Though it was rainy and cloudy, we took the short drive from our hotel, Black Sand Suites and found spectacular natural beach beauty, the setting for so many amazing backgrounds, all in one place. The sand is black, it starts as small pebbles and becomes fine sand as you get closer to the water. Enjoy the dramatic natural beauty!"
Great rock formations,Beautiful rock formations and a pebbly black sand beach. Just west of Vik. Great photo ops. Plenty of room for big crowds.
A world wonder,One of our favorite places in Iceland - the stark beauty of the black pebble-stoned beach with sculptured basalt protrusions offshore and the basalt columns revealed cliff-side is so breathtaking! Puffins nest in the cliffs above the columns. A must see!
This isn‚Äôt the famous one (that‚Äôs over the hill to the east),"This beach is a nice black sand beach just on the edge of the village of Vik. There‚Äôs a parking lot by the track / sports field, and it‚Äôs a nice visit. Many of the pictures that people have posted on TripAdvisor are from the columns and caves from the beach further to the East, on the other side of the hill...it‚Äôs only a short drive. Both beaches are worth visiting. The posting is just confusing."
Interesting beach and rock formation with a truly terrible cafe,The setting is beautiful but it is quite crowded and the food in the cafe is the worst we experienced in Iceland (and elsewhere for that matter). A half an hour stop is adequate and try to avoid the cafe.
Beautiful other-worldly site,"Tip -- if you're visiting in the summer and trying to get some good photos, try to go later at night when there's still light but perhaps fewer tourists?"
Wow!,"Free admission and parking. It is awesome! The beaches are quite amazing and the cliffs are very impressive. It can be windy and the waves are unsafe at times, so keep some distance from the water. Otherwise, it is an excellent stop."
Stunning beach,"Black sand, basalt columns, crashing waves all make for a stunning setting. Easy parking about 10Minute drive in from highway 1. Well worth the drive."
Interesting rock formations but too busy,"There is a big car park, cafe and toilets. This means lots of people. We walked to the east end of the bay and back. Rock formations were interesting. The basalt columns are the same as Staffa in Scotland and the Giant‚Äôs Causeway in Ireland.  Toilets cost equivalent of about ¬£1.40 and you pay by credit card and get a slip to scan to get in. Interesting technology! Worth a visit but not the most stunning place we saw"
Lovely ,"What a cool place so many photo ops even on a cloudy rainy day!Free parking & restrooms. A nice stroll along the beach to see puffins, caves. soaring cliffs, great rock formations as no the crashing surf.A 1 of a kind place make the stop!"
Amazing !!!,A must stop obviously. Easy to get to. What else can you say...Pictures don't make justice to it....
Windy day!,"It was a windy, cool day, and the sand stings your face when it is blowing. The beach is beautiful though, and the waves are really pounding. The rock formations look man-made, they are amazing looking. The beach is not very far from the main road."
Black Sand Beach!,"From the main highway the Black sand beach, which are pebbles from volcano lava, was a bumpy drive down an unpaved road.The beach area is a must see, but is definitely not a sunbathing nor swimming beach!  The day we went in mid May 2018 it was very windy, but not cold.  The walk from the parking lot down to the water was somewhat difficult as the sand was wet and very rocky with little black pebbles.There were several tour buses there when we visited in the late afternoon.  Needless to say, we did not have the beach to ourselves.  There are warning signs for the very rough waters.  Even though we were up next to the sea cave, the waters came crashing down and we were drenched.Professional photographers were doing a photo shoot with a gal in high heel shoes standing on the basalt stacks!  Interesting to say the least."
Beautiful,Great to see. The rock formations are unique from the volcanic activity. Go early if you want photos because the crowds can get intense.
Star wars was shoot here,"It is around 2 hours driving from Reykjavik, on the same route, you can visit waterfall, purple flower field  too, rent a car and go go go"
Beautiful Black Sand,It's a unique black sand beach with awesome waves and hex basalt columns. It's exhilarating to just stand there and soak it all in. There is also a nice little restaurant with facilities although I'd skip the coffee as it's was from a dispenser and weak and cold.
Great hotel for reasonable price,"We had a beautiful view. The hotel is clean (you could eat if the floor) the bathroom is specious new and clean, the room looks cozy with a couch. Kitchenette has a coffee maker, coffee, filters, pots, pans, silverware, plates, wine glasses.... pretty much everything you need to prepare a meal. Two hot plates. Beautiful little place, friendly staff..... great housecleaning ..... everything was perfect. Very reasonable prices. We paid $1400 for 5 nights. Highly recommend this place!!!!!    Also a great location to many visitor spots in the south. Most everything worth while seeing is within 5 min to an hour drive from week. Except for the ice lagoon was about 2h away."
Black sands and basalt columns,"Really black sand with fierce sea waves. Lovely rock formations. Easy access, and plenty of parking."
Knocked my socks off,"Breathtaking! Would‚Äôve loved to be here without the thousands of tourists though. Can‚Äôt get too close to the waves, they do get big and are very dangerous. Some silly girls were lying very close to the shore and tanning. Others were moving in toooooclose to the waves. I can understand why there are some deaths. The whole place blew me away! GORGEOUS. Amazing photo ops! Free parking. Nice kiosk nearby selling hotdogs ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Don't Swim Here - but - Pretty Beach,"Having been to Giants Causeway, the Basalt Columns here are not that impressive.  The black sand is very pretty, but the sand is actually little pebbles rather than soft sand. Some wicked rain and wind can hit this beach, as was the case when we were visiting last week.  The waves are large, dangerous rip current, and tourist swimmers have been know to drown here, so stay out of the water."
It should be called Black Pebble Beach!,"This is a beautiful and peaceful beach! It's not sand! It's pebbles! Which is super cool. There are a lot of tourist, so I would recommend coming at a later time (early morning or late night) during the summer. We got so much daylight in Iceland in June that it was perfect and right by our Airbnb! You get to also see Reyinsgrangur which is on the beach and that's super awesome as well. A great place to visit! We loved every minute of it!"
Beautiful Beach,We visited this beach at 11pm . Yes you heard right . Iceland had midnight sun and we stayed near Reynisfara beach so we utilized our night to be at this beach.Beautiful Basalt columns and it overlooks Dyrholey as well.This should be a must visit stop during Iceland trip.
Incredible beach and rock formations ,Be sure to visit this beach when you‚Äôre in the area. It has very geometric rock formations on a cliff above a beautiful black sand beach.  You can see the big sea arches in the distance.
Really cool beach!,It's not the beach to swim in but the volcano rock formations are stunning!  It's truly another world!
lovely,black lava beach is lovely because of the contrast of the black sand and white sea. Amazing and lovely view. Recommended!
MUST SEE,"I‚Äôm a little late. My best friend and I visited back in December 2016, but I‚Äôm sure not much has changed. The black sand on the beach is something so unreal and pictures don‚Äôt do justice. The waves are huge I suggest you listen to your tour guide when he says, ‚Äúthere will be small waves and then out of no where a huge one will come crashing in.‚Äù That‚Äôs exactly what happened to the other couples in our group when we saw them trying to our run the wave and they were soaked to about their hips. The restaurant has good food, but is a little pricy."
Amazing.  Must do. Unparalleled beauty ,The entire family loved it.  The rock formations are out of the world. The kids thought it was amazing.  Nice little diner for a snack.
Beach walk and basalt stacks were INCREDIBLE,"This is a must see.. the basalt stacks are truly incredible! The waters are very rough and there are many warnings about ‚Äúsneaker waves‚Äù that have claimed two lives recently, so be careful and don‚Äôt turn your back on the ocean! This is not a ‚Äúlay on the beach‚Äù type of place. It‚Äôs windy and cold, but a great photo spot. The rocks formations off the coast are also picturesque. Loved it here!"
Beautiful Black Sand Beach,Beautiful Black Sand Beach.  Got very crowded quickly.  Lots of tourists ignoring all the danger signs.  Cost $2 to use bathrooms.
More beautiful than pictures can justify,The black sand beach is stunning. Go in the early hours for the best light and to avoid the swarming tourists. Plan atleast 2 days at Vik - the beach and the dyrholaey lighthouse.
Stunning!,Really beautiful and mystical. Worth the trip. Remember it‚Äôs cold! But a fun walk with many good photo ops.
Wonderful ,I really fancied going here and wasn‚Äôt disappointed. I thought Vik was lovely and the beach was great. It‚Äôs difficult to put into words but we went on a fairly grey day which I felt made the beach look a little mysterious and the rock formations and cliffs made for a dramatic backdrop.
Wow,Have a look here and enjoy the power of the ocean. it was a windy day and you should keep an eye on the waves.Cool spot
"Impressive, but no basalt columns here","Many reviewers are mentioning basalt columns (and have even uploaded photos of basalt columns). They are mistaken about where they were when they saw the columns;  there are no basalt columns at Black Sand Beach (accessed from the town of Vik).  The basalt columns are on the next beach to the west (Reynisfjara, accessed via hwy. 215).Black Sand Beach is impressive in its own right, though. The high cliffs behind the beach are covered in lush vegetation and home to countless seabirds.  Shrouded in mist, they looked like a scene from Jurassic Park."
Cold AF but equally Gorgeous,"Worth a visit if you're road tripping around Iceland, or are staying in the area.Even though the weather was not great during out 7 day vacation, the 2 days we got to leave the hotel were amazing!!We went in April and it was beyond cold, making being near the beach even worse. The weather was a mix of monsoon and blizzard for most of our trip but when the sky broke, we added Vik onto our Golden Circle Trip.Vik:I will say, although I loved seeing this, I wouldn't make a special trip just to see this with nothing else planned. Vik was 3 hours away from our hotel and made for a very long night. It is so beautiful to see the landscape unfold onto black sands with raging waves; however, there is not much to do in this exact spot. On the way to here though you can stop off and see the fallen aircraft. I forget what it's name is right now.Now, when we went it felt like 10 degrees out so after about 20/25min, we couldn't take the cold anymore. It was piercing and burning your skin. DRESS WARMLY! It's honestly the only advice I can give you. We dressed bundled up and were still frozen because of the time of year and the wind. Having said that, if you go in nicer weather or can withstand cold better than we could, you are not rushed out & can stay for as long as you want. You also do not need to pay to get in to see this which is nice. Because we really only spent 20min here, is it worth a whole special trip just for it? I don't really think so...BUT, if you are seeing other things, then hell yea, go. Its stunning!!Parking:There is parking in walking distance to the beachFood:There are towns nearby from that offer some restaurant choices that you can eat in. We went to one, I cant recall the name, and waited about 30min before being sat. It was a cool little place and the food was good and moderately priced. We were exhausted thought from a long day and left at around 9pm.Bottom Line: Worth the experience if you do other things in this area as well."
Beautiful!,"This is a very unusual spot, with huge waves, great stone formations, and lots of black sand.  When we were there, it was extremely WINDY!  And cold.  Just a short walk from your vehicle so you will survive."
Very unique atmosphere ,"If you have a chance to visit the beach, I would totally recommend it. Just make sure to wear lots of warm, windproof clothes. The wind might get very nasty! You should also drive up the hill to see the beach from bird-eye view."
"Great stop to stretch, walk and photograph ",Beautiful beach for getting out of the car for a few minutes. Black sand makes it especially photogenic. Definitely worth stopping.
Mesmerizing,Out of this world structure. Beautiful weather. Long days what more can you ask for.Go there during summer
"Beautiful beach, but full of tour buses.","I definitely recommend coming to the Black Sand Beach as it's one of the must see places in Iceland, but try to do so before any of the tour buses arrive. We made the mistake of arriving shortly after three full buses unloaded, there were so many people there that it was really hard to enjoy the scenery."
Most unique beach I have ever visited,Black Sand Beach is the most spectacular and unique beach I have ever seen. We allowed 45minutes here but actually spent over 2 hours just walking along the beach. It does get very crowded with tourists.
More Amazing,This was one of the touristy stops but it was well worth it.  The beach is more a small black pebble beach vise a sandy beach.  It was awsome to watch the huge waves crashing on the beach.  It was also very interesting looking at the basalt formations.  There is also a cafe just off the beach if you need something hot after being out in the weather.
Amazing,We stopped here after renting a car.  It was a bit difficult to find but well worth the effort.  Free parking and no admittance fee.  Beautiful rock wall with caves and the awesome black sand beach.  Thank you Iceland!
Beautiful scenery and oh yeah GoT was here,No wonder GoT and so many movies were filmed here. The views and scenery are amazing. Quite windy but worth it to go. So much history to type here so make sure you read up on it. Just don‚Äôt expect your nice hair to last out there ha
A stunning walk,Stunning walk on a black sand beach sorrounded by ocean birds. Look at the nests on the rocks. It is amazing.
Amazing!!,Black sand...waves...columns..oh my! It was a beauty to see. The sand was soft and the waves were majestic to watch (too cold and powerful to get in the water). Little walking required
"Wild nature, but crowded with tourists!","Recommended, its a spectacular beach with special rockformations, caves and big waves. Its safe if you stay away from the ocean. Expect the place to be crowded with selfie-tourists, just have patient and you will get yours! Not many beaches like this around the world.."
Must see,"Grey pebbles, black sand and pale grey basalt columns, plus a natural cathedral made of the same stone. It‚Äôs quite stunning and a must see along this part of the southern Iceland coast. But it‚Äôs cold, it‚Äôs really windy and sometimes dangerous waves can catch the uninitiated. Easy to find, and drive up and walk to. 5 star attraction."
Fantastic beach. Puffins too.,Great basalt cliffs. Puffins flying. What more do you need to go a few minutes of the One. Views of Dyrh√≥laey too.
Stunning and unpredicatable - be careful,"Note to travelers: also look up Reynisfjara Beach for other reviews. Gorgeous spot. Go early in the day if possible to enjoy it when it is least crowded. We were there about 815am and tour buses had yet to arrive - we had the beach nearly to ourselves. Also: heed the signs. The waves come higher up the beach than you would think, even when they seem farther out, or as if the tide is going out. We watched numerous tourists turn their back on the water to snap a selfie and get soaked up to the knees by random waves. Pay attention to where the wave marks seem wet on the sand. Odds are the waves will come higher than that. It's also easy to get trapped by a wave attempting to go around the point beyond the cave. The amount of litter is a bit distressing. We picked up a bag full of plastic items that had either washed ashore or been left by other visitors."
A wild a woolly coast,This is a spectacular bit of coastline made up of volcanic black sands. There are puffin roosting places in the area. You need to be very careful near the water. The seas are large and unpredictable. Lives have been lost due to inattentiveness.
Quick visit,Defiantly must see when visiting Iceland. Lovely beach with black volcanic sands. Basaltic columns are amazing to see!
Amazing,A must see on your trip to Iceland.  The basalt structures are amazing and beautiful.  Nature at it's best.  A wonderful photo-op.
Stunning,"I can not explain the feeling you have when you come to see this beach. It is so beautiful, so breathtaking. It can be windy so be prepared. do not get close to the water it is very dangerous. And enjoy! This is probably one of the best things mother nature can offer to us."
Can't miss when in Iceland,"Easy drive out, free parking, incredible pictures and memories.  There is a pay toilet and restaurant if you need either, and both take credit cards.  Seriously don't miss this experience!"
Powerful Mother Nature,"This place really does show just how powerful nature is. This is the only time on our tour that our guide was actually serious and warned us that the force of the tides here are not to be chanced. We were also informed that on the beach you could find different coloured pepples which were from different volcanic eruptions so I think mnay people on your coach spent time trying to find each shade of back, grey, brown. The force of the waves could take your breath away, it was a very atmospheric stop, certainly blowing away any metaphorical  cobwebs.If your site seeing in Iceland this is well worth a visit."
Beauty Beach!,"We came here on a day trip from Reykjavik when we visited Iceland back in November and it was one to remember! Vik is a seafront village located in the southern part of Iceland, The drive for us was long, I believe about 4 hours and it was good and bad at times. It was so scenic yet desolate; Images that you see in movies or find on postcards. That day was a bit scary driving as the weather conditions were a bit rough. On the way, we stopped at the beautiful waterfall, known as Seljalandsfoss, which was spectacular! The gentleman in their souvenir shop warned us about the road conditions on the way up to Vik. So glad he did because it was dangerous at times. There was a snowy, ice storm and if you are not used to driving in conditions like that,  it can be uneasy. There were no barricades on some parts of the road and there were ice lagoons on each side of us. I almost had a panic attack because I couldn't see and one turn, we were in ice waters. All I kept telling myself was ""Black Sand Beach better be worth this drive"" and it was! We got here a lot later than anticipated so we did not get to experience the town much as we had to head back that night. The little we did, was awesome. People are friendly and helpful. Such a quaint little place. We parked in front of the beach in their parking lot and headed down to view this amazing spot. The water was calm, yet mysterious. Standing on the black sand, which was created by basalt lava was different. The rock cliffs are beautiful and unique. The Reynisdrangar stone pillars and the huge basalt columns are definitely a sight to see and are home to the Puffins, which weren't around at the time. This is not a tanning kind of beach, more of a viewing one so don't expect to see beach chairs. One thing I researched that I found interesting and scary that I never knew about were these waves called Sneaker Waves or sleeper waves. Its a large coastal wave that can appear out of nowhere without warning and drag you out to sea. This beach is known for it so I was very cautious of walking around close to the seashore. People, please do your research on these dangerous waves as there have been tourists who have died. On a better note, this beach is known for Games of Thrones filming some of their scenes so if you're a fan, you will appreciate it. Weather can be very unpredictable so always be prepared. It was really cold and windy that day but it still didn't take away the feelings and beauty we took from it. For anyone who is travelling to Iceland, I highly recommend visiting the town of Vik i Myrdal for some Black Sand Beach beauty..This beach is definitely special!"
So beautiful,"We came here when the sea was just churning - but saw no ""rogue waves"" thankfully.  Great spot for photographers or Game of Thrones lovers!"
a beach from another world,"The beach has a special atmosphere. It is like from another world. Not just a sand is black from old lava or so, but your are between basalt special formation of rock with kind of basalt broken columns and weird, strange, beautiful rocks, cliffs in sea close to beach. Added to that, you have a huge sea waves coming with a such speed you cant escape sometimes. Some people were completely wet. A size of waves are hig a few meters, very impressive. Whole beach has as well small pieces of basalt or so stones with an interesting shape(s). Doesnt matter what a weather is, you will always keep in your heart such amazing and exceptional experience and views, feelings."
"Great stop, on a nice day.","Nice little town on the ocean. The weather is very unpredictable. As we drove through town and was all fogged in, then coming back through an hour later the fog was moving inland and made for some great pictures. Nice grocery store with clean restrooms in that mall. Not always easy to find facilities as we traveled about Iceland."
Interesting,"Not sure why this is so highly acclaimed, perhaps due to the high wind we couldn‚Äôt fully appreciate this. However nice enough as a fine lava sand besch"
Unreal,"It was raining, it was blowing a gale and you couldn't see much but the place was awe inspiring. The fine black sand and basalt columns contrasted with the raging sea dumping on the beach. The sea was cold and dangerous with 'sneaker waves' breaking and having caused fatalities in the past. The advice do not turn your back on the waves. A must to see and very popular but with plenty of parking and restaurant facilities. Dress up for the weather as it is often cold and windy and that is without the rain."
Stunning,You hear people talk about the black beaches in Iceland but I couldn't have imagined how beautiful it was! The vista was incredible and yet felt so alien! The drive there was also gorgeous
Don't miss this if you are in Southern Iceland,"In fact, it's worth a drive from Keflavik or Reykjavik. We have been both times we stayed in Iceland and it's incredible. There's a lot in the area as well - if you do decide to come I would recommend staying in Vik and spending time at Skogafoss and Seljandsfoss as well. The beach is easy to get to and free."
Must see,This is one of those places you must see in Iceland. The beautiful basalt columns right next to the ocean with the rock formations in the ocean and the gorgeous black sand.... just beautiful. Serene. Try going later in the day or early morning to minimize the amount of people.
"Two visits within 3 days - Like twins, same same but oh so different","We loved it so much we had to make a second visit while passing back through Vic en route to Reykjavik. This was back in December 2017 and we heard Winter wasn't as bad as the previous years.Our first visit was just before 5pm before sunset, super windy and flocked with too many tourists. Not much of a chance getting a good go on the nature shots with someone in the frame at anytime. Or a good video on your iPhone without the howling winds and shrieking tourists blocking out the sound of waves.The second visit we were lucky. It was around noon, beautiful and less windy, seagulls peacefully flying atop the rock structures. The black sand had a fresh coat of white snow near the shore, and much less people. This gave us a chance to be one with the beach and just live the moment. Things to look out for your own and family's safety - What's good was a board at the entrance of the beach reminding visitors like us to beware of ""sneaker waves"" and how real tourists lost their lives there. Ironically you will still see some who take this message lightly and try to test mother nature. Also, please leave the black sand and rocks alone! Spotted a couple of people tossing sand and rocks into ziplock bags. As more travellers move around the world, let's help preserve nature in it's most untouched form. If not for that, we've also heard folklore on taking anything from the beach being a curse and people actually mailing back sand they've taken."
Well worth a visit,"Beautiful rock formations and beautiful black sand beach.  Great views and perspectives from here.  Was pouring with rain and very windy the day we came here, but still worth it. It is about a 12 minute drive from the main highway 1.  There is a restaurant here, but we did not get a chance to try it.  Looked ok and contemporary"
Beautiful!,One of the most beautiful coast in iceland with great sounds of the waves and cameraclicks haha. Must visit!!
"Magical, beautiful beach but not for swimming","The rock formations and the stones and caves and black sand were all so beautiful.  The waves were really cracking the shore so you couldn‚Äôt go near the water.  There were so many spots for photos!  If you look at the rock formations, you can see the inspiration for the Hallgrimskirkja building."
Most beautiful and mysterious black sand beach ever,"So mysterious, so beautiful. I've been to quite a few black sand beaches and this was definitely my favorite. Big waves so be very careful!!! We visited when it was raining and it was still worth going!"
Irish Pillars,"If you are in Iceland, you should go to the Black Sand Beach. It has the Irish Pillars like the Giant's Causeway in Ireland. The sand of course is the volcanic rock. There are cool rock formations in the ocean nearby. It was super windy there. Make sure you dress appropriately!!!"
Just Wow. My favorite site in Iceland,"I loved this beach. I loved the rock formations. You can climb on them and take stunning photos. There is also an amazing cave that is hard to explain in words. Then you have the waves. They are massive. I power is breathtaking. Just make sure you don't get too close as tourist drown every year there. Then the actual beach. The is long. If the weather is nice, I would have liked to walk it."
amazing sight,Geological formation and rugged beauty of this beech is out of this world. You couldn't find blacker sand anywhere in the world. Surf is quite high and apparently some tourists have been taken away by rogue waves. For me one of the must see sights in Iceland. Access is not difficult but walking in the beech is bit of an effort due to wet sand.
Out of this world! ,"I felt like I was on another planet when we came to this beach! It‚Äôs stunning! The waves are wild and strong and come crashing down at the shore. The sand is black, making it both mystical and mysterious. The rock formations are unlike anything I‚Äôve seen in all my travels. This was the highlight of the trip according to my husband. This is a must stop on your trip! You will not be disappointed!"
Black beach,Nice very nice and secretly waves that can comes very quickly.beautiful basalt rocks.Come all to katla hotel is here so nice its 5km from vik very nice vik deliciuos food and sauna hottubes
must go,"Unfortunately, we reached there after dark so couldn't do much. hope you guys don't repeat my mistake :)"
Exquisite Arctic Beach,"We had miserable weather the week we were here, however it parted just enough to make this black sanded beach just beautiful. The waves are very powerful and dangerous. You can walk a good mile on the beach and back. The sand is finely ground lava. We saw some locals come to the beach for wedding pictures.  The drive was quite scenic down to Vic with other sites, such as the people‚Äôs museum in Sogar."
Very Unique!,The rock formations were fantastic and of course there's always an Icelandic story to go along with it. It was cold and raining the day we went and didn't have issues with crowds or waves getting us.
Impressive,This black sand beach and its whole environment are quite special. Promise you will make some amazing photos here.
"Beautiful place, but watch out for the ""sneaker"" waves!","While admiring the enormous basalt columns and black sand beach, please do not turn your back on the ocean's ""sneaker"" waves per the many signs.  This is a beautiful place, but you are reminded of the power of nature when a giant wave washes in and drenches someone who has their back to the water while taking pictures"
Super cool,"We drove down ourselves, about a 3 hour drive from Reykjavik. Amazing beach! The ocean had huge waves and multiple caves to take pictures in. Very exciting and fun. Very windy so dress warm!"
If you love the ocean...,The beaches are fascinating and the power of the waves spellbinding. Watch for sneaker waves and use common sense and is great
Be sure to take a handful of sand as a souvenir ,I‚Äôve been traveling around world for almost 2 years now and this is one of the most magnificent beaches I have ever seen with my own eyes. If you go early in the morning you can actually relax and enjoy the tranquility with the sound of waves.
Awesome beach,"The rocks are amazing and the beach is too! Beautiful landmarks and quiet, relaxing beach. Easy to get to and enjoy!"
Great Short Stop,The beach is free and cool to see but crowded if you wanted a good photo op. Better black sand beach is at the Jokulsarlon glacier lake so if you‚Äôre going there you can skip this one.
Must do in Iceland!,"Views you cant get anywhere!  From the huge monoliths in the water, to the hole in the rocks on the far side, to stunning black sand and stones, on the beach!  The caverns and the unusual rock formations are with the time, and exploration as well!"
As cool as it looks!!!!,"Dangerous waves, amazing rock formations this beach did not disappoint absolutely breathtaking!!!!!But please read the signs and be careful while your taking pictures!!!!"
Beautiful ,"This beach is beautiful. When we visited the sun was out, and we could lay out and enjoy watching the waves. There is toilets here and a restaurant if needed. Somewhere I will be going back to!"
Pretty!,Highly recommend to stop at Reynisfjara if you have a car. From there can also be seen Dyrh√≥laey (the arch with the hole)
Absolutely beautiful,A most stop place. The town of Vik is tiny and adorable so I wouldn't stay here for longer than a night or two but this beach is absolutely stunning. Definitely something you would want to see at sunrise and sunset and any time in between. Popular spot for GOT fans but even if you know nothing about the show you can really enjoy this beautiful beach.
