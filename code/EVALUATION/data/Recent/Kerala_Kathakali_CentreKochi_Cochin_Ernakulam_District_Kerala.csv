Fascinating experience,"Traditional local performance- Kathakali. The ticket includes the make up and the preparations before the show and little expensive for locals. It is nice and interesting, I would just recommend to come not more then 1 hr. Also would recommend to get your ticket a bit in advance."
"Interesting performance, but VERY LOUD - take earplugs","It was interesting to see the performers applying their makeup and gluing on their paper face pieces before the performance.The theater is is small with hard chairs, and no place to buy beverages during the intermission.You have a good view, but it was far too loud for many of us in our tour group.   Some left at the intermission."
Just two words: Talent and dedication,"An amazing performance. Good stories of Mahabharata. Most importantly mind-blowing facial expressions. Reasonable fee. Through out the show, I was wondering about the levels of dedication and hard-work the artists have put in. I am glad, this place is trying to educate and promote about Kathakali and stopping this ancient and classical art form from having a slow death.One can visit a bit earlier than the actual showtime to observe the process of makeup and dressing. The place was sparsely filled and most of them were foreigners.I had to visit Kochi on work. That day, I completed my work and got myself free by evening. With an intention to best utilize the time, I tried this place over Lulu mall, marine drive etc, I felt it was a good decision after the end of the show."
Colourful and accessible introduction to a very special traditional art form,"Although it is lengthy, I would recommend arriving early to see the performers applying their make up. The transformation unfolding added an extra dimension to the performance. A complete play would take many hours, so a small excerpt is what they show. Even without the demonstration of the conventional poses it would have been easy to follow the story, but the demonstration set the scene for  this mix of mime and dance. Having learned about it as a drama student but never dreamed I would actually see, it was something I could not have missed and I was enthralled throughout. My husband, in fairness, found it a bit longer than he really wanted. That is why I have not rated it 5* although for me it was."
Simply amazing,"We had no idea what to expect but it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience.  Saw the artists applying their make up, a mime presentation which was fabulous and then the main act.  Well worth a visit and can highly recommend"
Learn...Be Entertained ..and Marvel,"Dance and drama take many forms. Katakali is a form rich in colour, expression, rhythm, movement, and voice.  It is hard to believe that the face can express so many emotions, or that the hand gestures can represent so much. This centuries old theatre was explained in a way that…"
EXPERIENCED AWESOME EXPERTISE,"Very interesting to see the artists are having make-up on stage. The movements and the  expressions of the artists are excellent, gracious and worth watching.   The Martial Arts Show 'Kalaripayattu' was also equally interesting.   The location is very good, easily approachable…"
Maybe less is more...,"We arrived very, very early to watch the application of makeup.  That was our first problem.  5 minutes would have been enough for me.   The performance was well done and interesting for the first half.  That was enough for us. We left at intermission, before the weapons…"
Amazing performance,This kathakali was so amazing to watch this program . The artists are awesome & expressions are mind blowing . All the best all those kathakali artists .      Thank you
Fascinating,Lasts two hours - one of which is watching them make up on stage. Fabulous. Ask where you arr staying ot organise tickets.
A must..enthralling performance,My daughter had entertained Kathakali dancers in England many years ago so this was at the top of our 'must do' list.   Before the performance we witnessed a dancer having the elaborate make up applied.  The dance tells a fascinating story and is unique to this area of India. …
Am absolute must when you are in kochi ❤️,"Deeply rich and culture, and captivating from start to finish, watching Kathakali at KKC was extremely pleasurable. Prior to the show starting, the audience is able to get a up-close and personal view of the men doing makeup and preparing for the show. This extremely candid…"
A wonderful stage performance.,"The dancers come on to the stage beforehand in order to apply the complicated, elaborate make up. The act is,super. The dance moves are amazing. It is worth seeing."
Great Fun,"Worth a visit, it is interesting seeing the face painting first and the show is very clever, something unique"
Authentiek Kathakali,"Great place to see the Kathakali. Make-up from 17.00 hrs, you also can come a bit later. From 18.00 hrs the Kathakali starts with an introduction and explanation which I really liked! Last half hour are two scenes from an original play. Make up is beautiful as well as the…"
Tourism ,"I enjoy my visit to Kochi, the weather was very humid and warm but not that bad, the sea front was very good and food was very good."
Entertaining ,"The centre was great with a menu of things to do.  The story dances were short with great explanations. Very expressive, specially with the facial expressions. "
Kathakali Masters ,"Really enjoyed this experience- despite hassle from Auto-rickshaw drivers earlier that we had to book in advance, we turned up at about 5.30pm and got a ticket on the door- there was plenty of space. As you go in, you watch the application of make-up, then at 6pm there is a…"
Simply amazing,"I’d seen Kathakali on the UK children’s TV show, Blue Peter, in the 1970s. It left an impression and I’d always wanted to visit Kerala to experience it. Eventually, we made it.  Kathakali dates from the 17th century and is characterised by the intricate costumes, make-up and…"
Very Interesting!,"A decent value for the price ($25). Mythical story told in eye, hand and facial expression - no speaking- good explanations before performance"
Great way to spend an evening....or a morning.,This is a place dedicated to keeping alive culture and tradition and runs shows in bite-sized “tourist chunks”.    We saw an Indian play - well 2 hours of one as they can last for up to 9 hours - starting at 17:00 where you can watch the make up going on and ending at 19:00 when…
Fascinating & entertaining- a must see. ,Fascinating & entertaining evening- a real must do in Cochi for any visitor! You can arrive at 5 to watch make up being applied- which is really interesting. Theb there is a demonstration of the meanings within the dance before they show a short extract of Kathakali. A must see!…
A gem in the heart of Cochin,"I visit Kerala Kathakali Centre every time I come to Fort Kochi. It’s a unique & special place which programmes high quality Kathakali performance, and live classical music and dance 365 days every year!  You can go there to experience the cultural heritage of Kerala; highly…"
cultural experience,"We went to see the Kathakali dance session , arrived early to watch the two dancers  put on their make-up. The costumes are stunning and must be quite heavy to wear.  The two dancers perform only a small part of the story, I believe the whole story takes several hours. Very…"
Interesting cultural experience for tourists,"While it’s good to see cultural activities being preserved,this is so clearly a show for tourists that it feels a bit contrived. That and trying to see the performance through a sea of smart phones and tablets rather detracted from the event.  Fascinating to see the painstaking…"
Interesting!,The center offers martial art and  the khathakali dance performance. The martial art start at 4 pm followed by make up session for the dance then the dance performance. The full program cost Rs 700 as a package or 350 for one  session only. The center has also a small musuem that shows the dance costumes and hands movements. The martial art was ok. The dance performance was really amazing. Make  a reservation if you want to sit in the front row. Dancers invite the audience to take photos with them if they want. Overall great experience.
Traditional,"Well worth a detour to see this traditional spectacle. It is only a small part of the original but enough to experience something entirely new. You are given some info on the story line and a demonstration on make up application. A real eye opener, if I may say so!"
Must see,"The show lasted about an hour , you watch the dancers putting on their make up which is very intricate.  You are invited to take photos. The costumes are wonderful but the dance is very difficult to follow.  Not really my thing but part of Indian culture"
A fascinating experience,"From the moment you step into the auditorium, you become part of the performance as the artists sit before you on the stage applying their make-up using small, hand-held mirrors and the deftest of touches as they transform their facial features.  After half an hour or so, the dancers leave the stage to be replaced by the musician with his large drum which accompanies the demonstration of the incredible eye movements and hand gestures used to convey the emotions which are constantly changing through the the performance.  Soon after that is over, the dancers return to the stage, fully made up and dressed in their elaborate costumes to bring to life a mythological tale of princes and demons.  All of this is done on the barest of stages but the performance will draw you in so that you will soon believe you are in a regal garden watching the action unfold.An experience not to be missed!"
Amazing Experience!,"The Kathikali show, with the make-up application included, was amazing.  We were concerned initially about potential for how hot it would be in the room, but were pleasantly surprised to find that there was a bit of A/C which made it very comfortable.  We both agreed that the show was beautiful and very well-done.  So glad we did it."
Amazing mime and makeup,A really interesting experience. Worth arriving in good time to get a seat near the front and to watch the actors applying their makeup
Martial arts demo is a must visit,These guys are so skilled. Their vairiety of demonstrations is jaw-dropping. Also a narrator pops out between skills to briefly explain the history. After the show they invite guests up to demonstrate how to defend yourself. I learned a lot about stopping someone snatching my…
Very interesting and enjoyable,"We went to the afternoon Kalarippayat (martial arts) demonstration. I'm not particularly interested in martial arts, didn't want to see a Kathakali 'show' so decided to see this. I'm really pleased I did and would happily recommend it as it provided an insight into the history…"
Definitely go if you can,I have never been a fan of tourist shows but this has changed my mind. It is recommended that you turn up an hour before the show to see the artists getting made up. I was a little sceptical as to whether it was worth it but am very glad I did. The amount of work that goes into…
Classical Dance.,Lovely colours and costume in this traditional dance from the Mahabarata story.  Opportunity to see the preparation process of face decoration was most interesting together with explanations of the unique facial expressions.
Typical Keralan Entertainment ,"Kathakali is typical of Kerala. This fairly small, but well laid out, theatre has a show every late afternoon, starting with the make up of the performers, which should not be missed.There are other daily performances here too which are well worth a visit."
Cultural must!,This is a must do while in Kerala. It is a fascinating show. The costumes and makeup are exceptional. Buy your ticket a head of time and ask for a seat in the front.
Fascinating Dance Entertainment ,A quaint and interesting Dance Theatre Facility providing makeup demonstrations beforehand with background information and detailed explanation on the Kathakali Dance. An entertaining evening spent enjoying the colourful and vibrant Dance Form that is Kathakali!
Fantastic traditional Indian Music and dance,"I've been here for 8 weeks and visit regularly. I often manage to get a good seat which is a must for the incredible kathikali performance. There is much variety going on and I particularly love the tablas, sitars and vocals, male and female. The 'full moon ragas' are a 'must do'. I also respect the attention from the organizer who always asks if I enjoyed each show and keeps me informed of new and upcoming guests"
Amazing Kalaripayattu and Kathakali show.,An amazing opportunity to experience one's own rich culture. We went for the ancient martial arts show - kalaripayattu and were mesmerized by the performances. We decided to stay on for the kathakali dance play as well. That evening they presented Kichakvadh from the Mahabharata. It was an excellent show.
An interesting show,"The Kartkali theater is wonderful. Very nice cultural experience!very colorful, very teaching, and magnificent."
Interesting night,"My parents and I had a really interesting experience at the performance of the Kathakali dance. Was some confusion with the seating. We booked 2 months prior, but because of groups, our seating was at the balcony, so I was a bit disappointed. But the kind crew offered us a better seating , which I would like to say thank you to them!!!The applying of the makeups was interesting on it's own. After that came a demonstration of the gestures and it's meanings. Then came the performance, which was nothing I've seen before. They handed out previously the story in translation. Also, the whole programme is a great photo opportunity.Overall, it was a great and colourful night, would recommend to go and see the performance for yourself!"
Delightful performance,Fun evening. The first part of the evening is the application of makeup. They actually build the face adornments. If you have traveled to Bali you can see a relationship to the dance style.
Wonderful Show,"We went to this theatre as per our friends recommendation and really loved the show and the theatre. If ever you get a chance to visit Kochi, then please do visit...you will love it"
Bit odd,"This was booked for us as part of our tour.We decided to go later than planned as watching someone put make up on was not our thing.The show was okay but I was bored,I did notice several people in the audience had gone to sleep. It's not something we would go to again but it was an experience."
Best Kathakali place to enjoy,Its place we enjoyed more in this place with kathakali dance but they will take charge to enter inside
A well-run cultural venue,"Kathakalki Centre is easy to get to in Fort Cochi, and has plenty going on, including the nightly Kathakali dance performance, which is top quality and very interesting, and an ever-changing program of Indian classical music, especially Keralan. The music performance we saw was Southern Indian flute and tabla, and was absolutely top quality, with very good musicians. Great value, and a great way to experience some genuine Keralan culture, even if it is a tourist offering."
Very Entertaining,Went to this show in Fort Cochi. Started with actors putting on makeup right on the stage in front of the audience. Fascinating process. Then a demonstration in full costume and the performance. Costuming fabulous and the play was interesting. A great option for entertainment in Cochi.
"Kalaripayattu Martial Arts, the unsung hero!","The star of the Kathakali theatre, for me, is the kalaripayattu martial arts  performance. I attended with a keen martial arts enthusiast not really knowing what to expect but... Wow. The demonstrations showed the years of skill and dedication of the 4 practitioners, such precision, form, and discipline, watching their combat demonstrations was utterly mesmerising. After the performance they invite members of the audience to come up for demos or to learn useful self defence techniques. My friend and I booked into the class which follows the performance and we were taught the Greeting and the first 5 sequences over the next 2 days. Our teacher was very patient, knowledgeable and experienced and I loved learning how to move in a completely new way - somewhere between yoga, plyometrics and martial arts, it's a must for anyone active-minded or who is curious as to how to look after themselves using a unique and traditional approach. Would love to do more!"
"Kathakali dancing, yoga and Indian classical music","This was the high point of Fortkochi for me, a centre whose mission is to preserve and present local culture. We did yoga there for three mornings, saw the dancing and a classical Indian flute and tambour concert. All first class. Well worth visiting"
Everything was as promised,Fantastic experience and so worth going for the hour before to see the make up application that is a production in itself.
Must see traditional show,"This was a very reasonably priced show which covered watching the performers prepare (absolutely recommend being there for this), a fabulous description by the narrator of the history, hand and eye gestures (wow!) demonstrated by a performer, and then an hour long performance. This is local to Kerala so do try and get to it if you can."
A hidden little gem ,This place is located near to St Santa Cruz Basilica. The Staff were very friendly when we arrived and greeted us. It was a excellent opportunity to see all of the actors put on their makeup before the actual show. The actors used rice powder mixed with coconut oil which was added to the colours.This was a very wonderful experience.This place is a hidden attraction and little gem as it is very cleverly hidden away in a little alleyway. The narrator was telling us about the story and all the facial expressions. The show was brilliant and easy to understand by the facial expressions that the actors were using during the show.The paper with the storyline was very wonderful.Two of the actors played the roles of women very well. I would recommend this place to others to see local dancing performed right in front of you in Kochi. This is a must see and an opportunity to witness a great experience.
Kathakali experience ,"Great theatre hidden away from main road. Really great traditional Indian show that is indescribable so just go. About an hour in length, we booked it online back in UK. HIGHLY recommend!"
don t miss it,"you cannot understand Kerala if you don t spend two hours to see a show of Indian culture,it s amazing and it helps you to understand Indian culture"
A first introduction,I watched the make up session and one short performance. It was an introduction to Kathakali targeted at tourists. I would have liked to see a longer performance. The explanations were useful.
Something quite different to experience,"If you attend one of the dance performances, you can go early and see the dancers putting on their makeup. Quite a spectacle!"
More than Kathakali,We loved it here and went to almost all the shows we could! The Kathakali was fascinating but I would highly recommend the classical music at 8 every night except Saturday when it's classical dance. Both shows are amazing (and quiet compared to the Kathakali which attracts a lot…
Entertaining ,We saw the evening performance. Beforehand the audience can watch the performers apply their makeup which Is intricate and time consuming. A handout that explains the story of the performance helps greatly as there are no spoken words. This is a traditional theatre style in…
A Dose of Kerala Culture,"I really enjoyed this experience, from the makeup session where you saw the actors transform into their characters, to the performance itself. The control of facial expressions is quite extraordinary and the story was easy to follow. Special mention to the musicians who really…"
Martial arts and Kathakali performances,Booked in advance from home a couple of weeks before the show and paid for tickets on arrival. Shows take place in an enclosed Theater in Fort Kochi area (apparently there are several different venues for this type of performance). Unique performances so was well worth it. There…
Interesting,I went to watch the make up applying session and then the one hour Kathakali performance . The timings were 4:00p.m - 5:00 p.m and then from 5:00 p.m - 6:00 p.m  The make up session was interesting because you learn how they achieve all those colours from nature and that is…
Good presentation ,Good presentation and execution. Facial expressions were superb. Music of high quality. And good lights. 
Interesting but had no idea what was going on,"We went to see the show. It was interesting to see the make up being put in before the show.  Once the show started, the explanatory bit as to what it all means was also interesting.  However, when they were acting out the actual story I had absolutely no idea what was going on,…"
promoting violence against women,"We went to the Kathakali Centre an hour earlier to see the performers put on their make up. The beginning of the performance seemed really interesting, the facial movements of the actors were amazing. There were 2 male actors, one taking on the role of a female. At one point the…"
"Unexpectedly interesting, not your common "" folkaloric"" type performance.","I was hesitant as normally I avoid "" staged"" performances of this type.  I pushed my fellow traveler to go to the "" make up"" portion of the performance.  Fascinating to say the least.  You see the actors ( 2 ) start with a fresh face and transform into their classic masks.  The explanation of facial expressions was very helpful as I could follow the emotions and story line. quite well.    The performance was also good, an appropriate length for the audience.  The venue itself is simple but adequate.  Do callk to get an early reservation so you can have seat near the front for the makeup and facial muscle movement."
Surely worth visiting ,Magical experience of watching the traditional and ancient art performance of Kathakali  Before the Kathakali act started the actors presented us how the face painting is done and we were given details about the History behind this art performance.Surely worth visiting!
"Kathakali, Kuchipodi and Barathanatyam classical dances",We attended two nights of amazing Performances.First day was Kathakali dance it was all male affair and it starts the show with the men showing the audience how they apply the bright colour makeup. It was a team effort and the makeup had transformed them. The dance  was absolutely amazing with accompanying song with traditional musicians. The second day was all female who performed Kuchipodi and Barathanatyam. This was another amazing night with the most experienced dancers. Well worth it
Kerala Kathakali Treat!,"There are many Kathakali dance places in Cochin and we were recommended the Kerala Kathakali Centre in Kochi Town. It has various types of performances and events throughout the day. We attended the face painting and the Kathakali dance performance. The entire event for was two hours. Since one always reads about and sees the grandeur of this type of dance in the media, my expectations were high. However, I found that this place was very basic in its approach and while the performances themselves were good, it lacked the grandeur and the oomph this particular dance form is associated with. The tickets were moderately priced."
Great performance,Went there for experiencing the Kathakali performance. It was quite an amusing performance. Must visit.
Couldn't be over fast enough!,Being a family of theatre and dance lovers I thought we were on a winner with the selection for a nights entertainment.....I couldn't have been more wrong.  It was insanely mind numbing.  We couldn't have been more restless if we tried.  On the up side this has provided hours of…
What  A Show,"If you want a dazzling show of colour sound and light then do not ,it’s these performances. A stunning show that is just th right length will plenty of good interpretation so you know what is going on. Make up and choreography is just brilliant. Not be missed and this a good…"
A must!,"Visiting Kochi and watching a Kathakali performance was in my bucket list for a long time and i must say i was not disappointed at all with the performance. I was visiting in June which was rainy and off peak, but i was happy to find that they performed even with 2-3 people in…"
Not what I was expecting,Went to see an Indian dance performance with our tour group.  Saw the makeup session prior to the performance. First part of the performance was one person showing expressions then he and another performer acted out a story. Rather bemused by it all.
An art-form which is local and something very different,We had seats in the gallery and it was very hot and stuffy (we discovered on our way out that there was some air-conditioning in the main auditorium). Arrived a little afer 5 p.m. and watched how the actors applied the extravagant make-up until the actual show started at 6 p.m.…
Cultural insight,"I always find shows designed for tourists somewhat uncomfortable, as it may lead to local people performing historical traditions out of context in order to satisfy tourists's desires. That being said, the show was excellent, and I fully endorse it. The show gives great insight…"
Excellent,If you have time in Kochi this is a must! It gives an insight into this tradition and is great entertainment even if the lighting is rather crude.
Marvellous,"Marvellous. That's the word. That's how we can explain our time spent at Kerala Kathakali Centre. The Kathakali Show was mesmerising,the auditorium was small but adequate. Even my 2 year old son, who rarely stays at one place, watched the whole show eagerly."
very interesting to see.,To watch the actors applying the traditional makeup was interesting. We watched a performance for half an hour after that. Fortunately it was well explained beforehand as it would be very difficult to understand what on earth was happening without help.Fascinating!
Bit different !,The performance we saw lasted an hour or so. It is culturally very different and to Western eyes rather strange. The action is mainly in the eye and hand movements. However it was explained well and the make up and costumes very colourful. About an hour is sufficient but it’s…
Interesting history insight ,"Recommended by Crowne Plaza Kochi, I went there without knowing what to expect. After the make-up sesión and written background information, the actors performed excellent expression of emotions, mimics and dance.A must see in Kochi."
Educating interesting great art performance,Learning the gestures and story behind this indian taditional drama dance art. Delighted by the excellent performance and meticulous make-ups. Highly recommended!
Wonderful place to attend Indian  Classical Music !!!,We went 2 evenings and enjoyed superb music. it starts at 8 pm and i recommend all to enjoy the concerts they have every night all year around. of course it a good place to attend Kathakali show.
Awesome Perfomance,"Kathakali’, an important genre in the Indian classical dance form, is associated with storytelling form of this art. It is the dance drama from the south Indian state of Kerala. Similar to other Indian classical dance arts, the story in ‘Kathakali’ is also communicated to audience through excellent footwork and impressive gestures of face and hands complimented with music and vocal performance."
Cultural experience not to miss,We went with a local friend to the centre to see the marshall arts show and Kathakali. I believe is a must see if visiting Kerala.The on site museum was an added bonus.
Touristic trap.,"Don’t go for the Kalarippayattu: they sell you the ticket for one hour but they give max half an hour show, full of interruptions. When asked about this, the staff will awkwardly smile with their stare lost in the void, as they kick you out of the theatre. Go somewhere else."
Average,"Attended the martial arts performance. To start with both artists are highly talented. The demonstrations they gave were amazing. However, the place can do lot better - first improve the air circulation. For initial few mins we were waiting for fans to be switched on. They never…"
Really Enjoyed This,The show was terrific and was made even more enjoyable by the demonstrations and explanations beforehand. The venue was just right for experiencing the full drama of the dance and accompanying musicians.
A Life Time Experience,Awesome and inspiring. This is what I can term the performance of artists of Kerala Kathakali Centre. Reach the theater early to witness the artists put on their makeup. It is indeed a treat to see them get ready for the event and gives you an understanding into the effort and…
Fascinating,I would recommend a visit to this unpretentious building which hosts a nightly show of traditional dancing. The costumes and makeup are outstanding and the dramatic story telling is fascinating.
Recommended Cultural Experience in Fort Kochi,"We saw the 4pm Martial Arts demonstration, the 5pm Kathakali make up demo and stayed for the performance. The strength, precision and skill of the martial arts performers was a sight to behold! The makeup demonstration was a very interesting process. Especially when you see the performers in the following show with the makeup combined with the costumes! A very worthwhile experience while in Fort Kochi and it was topped off with a great dinner afterwards at the neighbouring Tibetan Restaurant. There were some big tour groups coming through for the make up and performance, so make sure you get tickets in advance to secure a good seat."
Interesting local show,Spent 1 1/2 hours at the theater watching makeup application then 2 different dance routines.  Costumes were very colourful and routines relied more on facial expressions and eye movement...all explained before hand to provide insight into what is going on.  INTERESTING TO SEE.
An interesting hour of traditional dance,"It was a pleasant hour or so we spent here. I really enjoyed learning about the traditional face paint, body movement and 'sign language' used. The story was ok but I must admit my husband and I got a little bored after the first twenty minutes or so.The actors are amazing though, very enthusiastic and passionate. The costumes are unique and interesting.You can't really go to Fort Kochin and not see this dance show, even if only for a short time..."
Performance 🎭 below average ,The Kerala museum was very interesting to see however the theatre play was absolutely painfully boring. I’m not sure why it gets such great reviews on TA as I certainly didn’t get the childish performance 🎭. Having been involved in theatre performances over many years on all levels I found the whole experience to be below average. Each to their own ...
Kerala Kathakali Centre,"Visited here on a Saturday evening, I arrived before 5 to watch the actors apply their makeup and was glad I did as it adds to the atmosphere. There is a good explanation of the show and demonstration of facial expressions and modris that the actors use to communicate with the audience.The show itself is very well acted and costumes are elaborate.This is well worth a visit, you can book tickets early to get the best seats."
beatiful exp' for artists who wants an inspretional trip,beatiful exp' for artists who wants an inspretional trip a beatiful show  you have special yoga in the place
Kathakali Natyam,Artist heart never stays away from art. Eventhough we came to enjoy our privacy and nature stay at munnar we couldn't stop us to witness such a captivating age old heritage...The artist of Kalari kshetram made audiences awestruck with thwir great presence of mind..  involving…
Must see Kathakali,The performance by the Kerela Kathakali Centre was an absolute highlight of our trip to India and should not be missed. Show is fro 6 to 7 pm but it is really worthwhile arriving early to see the cast applying their makeup and to see the demonstration of techniques used.
Excellent martial arts and dance,"This intimate space was an excellent place to see traditional Kerala martial arts, learn a few self defence moves, and see the preparation for and execution of traditional Kathakali dance.  The verbal introduction to both the martial arts and dance was excellent (I often find…"
Tabla tuition ,"Having a few days In Kochi I wanted to learn a bit about Indian music. A musician at my hotel told me to try here. I walked in one morning and the same afternoon had the first of three lessons with a superb tabla player, Ravish Shet, who was also a fine teacher. Of course in…"
Interesting peek into traditional story telling,The Kerala Kathakali Centre has a sweet little theater where every seat has a good view of what is going on. Before the show we were treated to the actors putting on the traditional stylized makeup. The story was explained and an hour-long presentation with drums and traditional singing narration was performed.
Interesting,"If you arrive around 5:00PM the actors apply their makeup on stage for an hour or so which is an unusual experience. The drama takes approx an hour, quite different techniques by way of eyes and facial expression."
Brilliant Show!,"We booked tickets both for Kalaripayattu and Kathakali. The one-hour long Kalaripayattu was showcased superbly by two warriors and we genuinely felt our adrenaline rushed. After this, the stage was taken over by Kathakali artists, who started applying their elaborate make ups. Its a unique experience to watch them prepare for the dance with such rapt attention. Later, the Kathakali started. We were shown the various facial expressions and mudras used by the dancers. We were left speechless by their beautiful and precise dancing in such gorgeous costumes. We highly recommend this as a trip to Kerala remains incomplete without experiencing Kalaripayattu and Kathakali."
Kadhakali decoded,"Kerala Kathakali Centre explains the facial expressions in tandem with the various drum beats performed by skilled artists. If you go a bit early, you can see the artists applying makeup to their face."
Show visit,simply awesome Show. Highly recommended must watch also watch martial arts karali . Get photo clicked with artist
Fascinating experience ,I loved this experience and the opportunity to watch the performers getting their makeup done. They allow photographers to come on stage and take photos or videos of the process which makes it feel very intimate.One of the actors demonstrated the facial and hand movements used to convey the different emotions as they do not speak during a performance.The actor who played the female demon was incredible at this and absolutely mesmerising to watch.There is also an interesting museum and coffee shop on site.
Kathakali Performance,"Got in early to watch the makeup session, actually quite interesting. fascinating  performance, the artists were great to watch but I couldnt get pass the ""narrator"" who told the story through song and was almost in a trace like state in doing so. . great way to spend the evening in Fort Kochi. Highly recommend and a must do."
great experience! - Martial arts,"1. I went to the martial arts display - i loved this! it was well performed and the gymnastics and weapons was fascinating.. I never saw this before. at the end they invited the audience on stage to do some simple moves, some kids and their mothers tried it... and the two guys turned out to be excellent teachers that obviously love their craft!"
Must visit,If you like or not like dance this place is a must visit to see the Make preparation and dance performance. Tickets can be bought at the Center or local homestay’s also have some.
Fabulous,A trip to Fort Kochi is incomplete without watching a Kathakali performance at this place. The artists are just awesome - and I don’t mean just the actors.
Quite Impressive,"I had watched a short clip of this on YouTube before going to the Kerala Kathakali Center and frankly ended up going just because I felt it was a ""must"" see attraction while in Kerala. I felt I was going to be bored and disappointed, but instead, I was impressed and educated. I…"
"A good place to enjoy Indian theatre, music and dance.","It is an essential place to visit in Kochi. You have to go well before the show begins because the makeup of the actors is done in public. Every day there was a different show, different plays, concerts of Indian classical music, dance, etc. We saw an awesome concert with…"
Good experiance,Recommended for kerala cultural experience. Artists were makeup with vivid  and high contrast colour painting. It's combination of two or more classical arts
Brilliant,"The centre is the focal point for Kathakali Dance, a tradition dance form which has only male actors and recounts - without words - a story. We had extra time to watch the two actors putting on their make-up which was a performance in itself. They then nip off to don the…"
Second visit.....will be back again,"This is second time I have been to the show, and it's one of the best live shows you can be to. Must come if you are in Kochi"
Must visit place in Fort Kochi,"Not so many people visit this place, but if you're in Fort kochi this is a must place to visit. You to get see how they get ready for the show. It was actually mind-blowing performance and totally loved."
Good,"Wonderful artist, lovely perfomance. Kathakali at evening 5 to 7. Also yoga is nice too. Thank you ,that we enjoyed, will recomend highly"
Season India -kathakali,One of the itinerary with season india arrangement!! Love it the performance as local culture show..
"Wow, this is a must visit",This was something special that you have to visit when you are in Kochi. You will also have the opportunity to see them painting their faces. Impressive work....
Great experience ,"Booked through trip advisor with dinner included.  Unfortunately there was only 1 other couple there, being a low season. The actors were professional and carried on with full performance. Amazing explanations which enhanced understanding of the show. Would definitely recommend."
Ancient historic dance ,It’s one of the ancient dance which I witnessed in Kerala. There costumes are so colourful and each dance it has its own story in there performance.
Must visit place if you are in Kochi,"This place has kathakali, south Indian classical dance, yoga, meditation and all other cultural events under one roof. This place is a must go if you like cultural things. People are also very nice there.Very reasonable price also"
Kerala Kathakali Center,The Kerala Kathakali Center in Fort Kochi is one of the few places where one can witness the elaborate process of make up that the Kathakali dancers undergo before the actual performance. We had booked online for the show and enjoyed it very much.
Absolutely Astonishing,"When my travel agent booked this theatrical performance for me I had not heard of it and wondered what it was all about.  My guide explained to me that I would sit in the audience in and watch the actors put on their makeup and then their costumes and it would be silent except for the musical drum accompaniment.  The seats were assigned and I was lucky enough to be in the second row very close to the performers.  I was given a handout explaining what part of the performance was being acted out that night.  The handout explained that normally the performances are very long so the actors only do a part of the play and the handout explained exactly what the performance was about.  When I got there the 2 male actors were already seated on the stage and putting on their makeup and when that was finished they got into their costumes, one dressed as a man and the other as a woman.  Then  with the drum accompanying the actors the performance began.  There wasn't any sound except perhaps a few grunts and groans,  it was very dramatic and quite an extraordinary performance.  From the time I sat down until it was over it lasted  only about 2 hours but it was a wonderful experience into the traditional arts of Kerala.I was delighted that my travel agent had booked this performance for me and in looking at my photos of the actors I am once again in the theatre reliving the experience."
Culture of Kerala,"One of the best place to visit if you want to see the culture of the Kerala in short span of time, here you can see the tradition of Kerala in the form of dance and acting, they will prepare and make up in front of you then you will come to know how the fascinating Kerala dancer do there make up and look, so must visit place if you are in Kerala or around, 2 hrs we can spend to know about the culture and tradition of one of the oldest community of India."
Don't miss this dance! ,We were watching the martial arts before following the special make up of the dancers. Both the martial arts and the dance were a nice evening experience. I would recommend to watch the make up session the whole time!
Cultural Night Entertainment,Very unusual viewing. The first hour is devoted to performers applying their make up on stage. The next hour depicts historical stories being acted out and the last half hour was a martial arts demonstration that was unbelievably acted. We'll worth a visit but please leave the…
Kochi,Make sure you get to the theater 45 minutes before the show to watch the make up ceremony and don’t forget to read the story as you watch it. Amazing experience of the Kerala culture
So interesting!,"What a weird, wonderful experience!  Pro tip: eat beforehand, as the performance is quite long.  (Probably a bit too long.)  Definitely worth doing once."
No,It's just artistic figures dancing and maki g worried gestures... Even I could not understand. Totally avoidable .. of your tour guide says you will like it.... Then you should understand that your tour guide is a phoney.
Fascinating,Our group of 9 New Zealanders visited the centre one evening. What a treat. We were able to watch the make up being applied and found the introductory talk and show fascinating. The eye movements were unbelievable. Well worth the visit and the dancers will photograph with you at the end.
A must see in Fort Kochi,I booked online for the 5pm Make Up then  6-7pm Dance Show.  It is so fascinating.  The make up and costumes are so elaborate and well worth going early to see it all come together.  The actual dance performance goes by very quickly.  It's all about the eyes! Loved the whole evening.  The theater has no air conditioning so prepare for a warm evening and you'll need to bring a bottle of water.  You are given a paper with the story for your understanding.  This type of theater has quite a history.
A ‘Must See’ Performance,"A real treat in store starting with the application of makeup and head gear to one of the main characters. A demonstration of facial expressions to show feelings and emotions using eye, head, face, arms, hands, legs and feet and then all combined in the most skilled performance of dance."
Unique and expressive dance,"This venue was suggested as part of our Trailfinders tour of Kerala. The dancing relies upon both body movements, exaggerated facial expression and eye movements.  We arrived early (to get a front row seat) however the show did not start for another 45 mins and we watched the dancers (there are only two of them) apply their makeup. The first part of the show is a demonstration of the classic dance movements and what they mean and the second half is the enactment of a famous demon vs handsome prince legend.  We would definitely recommend it - we did note the rest of the audience (from a cruise liner) were restless and several fell asleep!  Certainly recommended as part of a Kerala culture fix."
Great Performance,A must see if you are in kochi. Highly recommended kathakali show. It is Drama and comedy like of show. come if you have some spare time.
Really great show ,Went here not knowing what to expect. Great show with makeup application and dance explanation first before performance. They also give you a written storyline which helps you follow it. Good A/C in the theatre too! 
Interesting to see whilst in Kochi,"My wife probably enjoyed this more than me, having said that, it was interesting to see and learn a bit more about. I imagine it’s quite authentic to the traditional style of folk dancing. Luckily they give you an English written story/script before hand, make sure you read this…"
Mesmerizing!,The performance starts with the explanation of Kathakali art which give a complete different dimension to the experience. Show is indeed mesmerizing! And come 30 min before the show to see the actors applying make up
Eye-opener to Traditional Dance!,"This centre promotes & preserves Kerala’s ethnic culture, art, ancient costumes & props. We were privileged to see it’s makeup & dressing session at 5pm & dance performance at 6pm. Photography is allowed & the performer & teacher were very professional & friendly. Indeed a must…"
Wonderful cultural experience,Very professional intriguing display of the traditional Kathikali theatre. Excellent demonstration of how elaborate makeup is applied. Excellent explanations made it very educational. Well worth the cost. We also saw the Martial Arts display whic was intetesting but not as…
An amazing insight,"Visited early one evening to watch the make up display, absolutely amazed at the amount of time it took, about an hour to make them ready. Very impressed. "
Great show for all,"We booked this on the recommendation from hotel concierge. Was well worth it. Great show and get early to watch the transition of some of the cast. Well explained throughout the show. Just make sure you stay to the end after the photograph option, or you will miss more dancing…"
Indian Opera!!,The experience and immersion into the Kathakali dance and its preparation and principles was amazing! Loved the explanations of each aspect of Kathakali dance.  The performance itself was good and the duration is perfect for those who are seeing it for the first time. It is…
Something for Everyone,"This charming arts centre offers multiple performances showcasing classical arts, so it was easy to fit into our schedule. We attended a dance performance on one evening and returned on a different evening for a musical performance. Both were thoroughly enjoyable. The atmosphere…"
"Traditional Indian dances, music and theatre.","If you go to this magical place you will feel to satisfied and happy to attend the Kathakali Theathre, the Mohiniyatam dances and the Barathanatyam dances too. "
Beautiful theatre. Good people. Traditional arts,"This beautiful theatre made with wood is like a temple of traditional arts in the city. I enjoyed there a Kathakali show, Kalaripayattu demonstration, clasical dance lessons and the morning meditation with ragas music. I recommend all. And the people from the theatre is very…"
Unusual but enthralling,We arrived early to watch the performers put on their makeup - this is well worth doing. They demonstrated how the eyes are used to great effect as the play is without words so facial expressions are necessary. The play was interesting and possibly just long enough for tourists.…
Amazing and surprising ,"We attended the traditional fighting performance, the make up application and traditional dance. All were amazing. We really appreciated the time, dedication, commitment and talent of all the performers. We were surprisingly impressed. The dance costumes and style was something…"
Kathakali Dance,The traditional dance of Kerela enchanted my family. The artists were very good. Never miss the dance .
Don’t miss this experience while in Kochi! ,"Everyday of the week was a different performance, including special Full Moon Raga!   The artists are experts, very well trained and great stage performers.   They’ve ensured they make the art form relevant for modern audience in performance and they appropriate explanations…"
Great evening of traditional music and dance,Kathakali has very deep roots in the culture and traditions of Kerala. Epic poems set to music with very intricate movements and dance. The Kerala Kathakali Centre does it extremely well and the place was packed. It takes years of training to become ne of the artists and this…
Nice performance!,"There were only us and another couple. The small group did a good job at entertaining  us. We participated too, it was condensed perfomance but we were well informed by his explanation. Great job. Short and sweet."
Great cultural experience,"We attended the Kathakali daily evening show. We had seats in the balcony. We arrived right before the makeup started and were able to sit right in the middle of the front balcony row. I think these are definitely some of, if not the best seats in the house.  We were able to…"
Must-experience!,"Highly recommended for a cultural experience! Come early to watch the actors apply their stage make up and give a primer on kathakali. The performance itself is a condensed, tourist friendly version of the real art form but you get a glimpse on this fascinating art. It reminds…"
Fascinating dance ritual but a little long winded,"Was not sure what to expect when this visit appeared on our itinerary, arriving early to see the makeup application is something to behold. The actual dance combines ballet, opera, masque and pantomime. The most interesting part for me was a dancer that used facial expression to…"
Varied shows,"Dance, music, make up, martial arts, all with fab costumes, good explanations, very reasonable tickets. Something on at least daily. A must do cultural activities for tourists. At least once!"
Hilarious and fascinating ,"You don’t want to know too much before you go but this is an event not to miss. It is spellbinding, amazing and very funny. The actors and musician are extremely talented. A great evening out."
Wonderful Local Cultural Experience,"We really enjoyed the opportunity to see the Kathakali Dancers. It was interesting to see how they apply their makeup prior to show time. Their movements, facial expressions, and interactions with the audience made for and informative time."
Absolutely amazing....,"This is a must to go if you are in Kochi..... believe me if you don't go there you just wasted your trip money, time and opportunity to see such a great and good art.....I was very disheartened to find that we were the only Indian family in the crowd of appx 100-150 tourists.......Beautifully decorated place , beautiful people, beautiful art.... mesmerizing performance.....Even my 10 yrs old son was awestruck with the performance...It's opposite to SantaCruz Cathedral basilica fort kochi...Must go.....I will go again....Don't take children less that 5 there.....rest all good."
Best..,Best place to see kathakali dance. It’s a training Center also for the same. You must not be avoiding this place
Cultural show,"This was part of our itinerary and watching the actors put on their make up was interesting for a few minutes. There was a printed sheet explaining the story and it was also explained by a narrator, but it was difficult to follow. The eye exercises were interesting but s bit…"
An evening well spent,"Tucked away in a lane close to the Santa Cruz Basilica, Fort Kochi, the Kathakali Centre is a building done in typical Kerala style. A must visit to watch short daily sessions of Kathakali and Kalarippayattu. "
8 day kerala trip,good and worth watching.kerala cultures well presented. troupe from a dedicated famliy.very friendly people. 
Authentic if you pay attention,After a small alley you come to a nicely decorated hall where the actors are putting on their makeup on stage in a very meditative way inviting you to join the experience by their calm. The host gets you at the entrance and is also the storyteller and guide. His English is hard…
Loved it! Absolutely beautiful :),If you're in town pls be sure to visit this place and attend their shows.  They are professional and inspiring people and preforming arts are so special in Kerala. Ive attended Kathakali and Dance shows and they were beautiful.
Terrific Kathakali show,"We attended not just the Kathakali, but the music evening and the martial arts shows.  They were all first rate and highly recommended.  I would advise going to the make up hour ahead of the Kathakali.  It was fascinating.  Very professional and polished performances.  It was very busy the evening we went to Kathakali so better to book that in advance."
A brilliant touch of culture,this was an excellent showmy advice is to do a drive by in the morning to ensure that you get seats of your own choiceEasier to stand up a photo from the back rowMust see when in Kochi
Brilliant,Excellent show especially watching them put on makeup.Facial expressions were amazing and they really gave an idea to what was going on.
A great experience,"This was our first visit to Kathakali and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  We arrived about half an hour in advance, so that we could see the actors preparing, and then there was a short introduction to the conventions of Kathakali, which was very helpful, before the main performance started.  Notes about the performance were helpfully provided in English.  We were astonished at the skill and versatility of the performers.  A unique and very worthwhile experience."
Totally worth it,"It was mine and my husband's first time watching and learning about the Kathakali dance form. This was the ideal location to learn about the art form and watch a performance. They even had a handout in English explaining what the dance was about. Prior to the performance, we could watch the dancers getting ready. There was also a brief explanation of some of the dance steps used to describe emotions. It was affordable too. Cost is only 350 Indian rupees per person for such a wonderful experience."
"An amazing, immersive cultural experience.",The centre is ran by lovely people who really care bout the art and are passionate about keeping it alive for the benefit of future generations.  The Katakali show is fantastic and mesmerising not to be missed!  The morning meditation with live music is also worth getting up…
Enlightened about Kathakali Dance in just 2 hours,"Its the best cultural destination in Kochi undoubtedly. As it is situated in Fort Kochi, foreign travelers mostly book this show but i would request all my fellow Indian citizens to come here and enjoy this breath-taking cultural extravaganza. Kathakali show timings is from 6 pm…"
Great yoga teacher every day at 6:30am on the roof,"I’m a yoga teacher and I went there 2 times. Mindfulness teacher with Hatha Yoga for all. Pranayama, yoga, meditation... and kindness. Highly recommended "
Nice dance exhibition - skip the make-up,"Interesting show of local traditional dance with fantastic costumes - also exhibition of costumes in the accompanying museum.  Show preceded by an hour of make-up - worth watching for five minutes, but not spellbinding."
Art is something which has to be done with perfection and this is the place!!!,"Great Vibes, Great People!!!!  Thank you Mr.Sucheendran for all your efforts. I was thinking about the hard work and dedication that you all have towards these art forms.  Though there are different Kathakali centers at Fort Kochi, you and your team are very different. I respect…"
One of the best cultural performances I've seen.,"I was a bit dubious about going to yet another cultural performance, as you do on many of the tours. But I was pleasantly surprised at the quallity of the performers. If you go earlier, you can see them demonstrating putting on the makeup before the performance. If you're not that interested in the make-up, arrive about 10mins prior to the performance to see the end of it as it quite intricate and detailed."
Must-do Activity While in Kochi - Traditional Kerala Art Form,"Our home-stay host suggested we book seats for this show and I was a bit skeptical at first - I figured it was just another tourist trap.  I was wrong.  Yes, it is for tourists, but it is a great introduction to a very old Kerala art form called Kathakali.  The first part is spent watching the male performers put on very elaborate makeup.  Then there is a brief explanation of the various coded hand, body, face and eye movements that the performers use to tell their story (there is only music an movements - no words spoken during the actual performances).  The performers have to study for over eight years to become skilled in their art form.  Finally, there is an hour-long sample performance. The 'real' performance lasts all night in temples during special festivals so this short introduction version is perfect for tourists and at about 350 rupees per person it is worth every rupee!  It was our best attraction in Kochi.  Great to see living art!"
The richness of culture,The true touch of art... The unique form that gives u an understanding of a new relam of art.... The mudras will enchant you for sure...
Amazing performances,We participated 2 music and a Kathakali dance performances in Kerala Kathakali Center which were amazing. Hotel can book in advance. Prices are also affordable. They have every Day a different activity. I  strongly recommend.
Great cultural immersion! ,"Wasn’t sure what to expect. Get there before 5pm to line up to see the makeup. It is pretty long but interesting and great photo opp. The facial expression is really something marvelous and highly skilled & impressive. The performance showcases the colorful and cultural side of the Kerala history, but I thought was definitely a highlight in visiting Fort Kochi (since there really isn’t much to do here...). Great costume, singing and music, an enjoyable evening. At 350 rupee, well worth it!"
"Very interesting, but too noisy ",It was very interesting to know and see the story behind the green guy that we see in all websites concerning Kerala.. But the performance can get quite loud.
a cultural experience,"a mimic show portraying a love story all in small jesturs accompanied by a singer, whom in my opinion, was the highlight of the show. you can come earlier and watch the actors get ready, putting their make up on stage. 5 minutes is long enough.  all parts are acted by mail…"
Fascinating visit,"We were in the third row with pre booked tickets that afforded us excellent views We arrived towards the end of the make up demonstration, which was interesting, but I am pleased we did not sit through the whole demonstration as it was literally like watching paint dry. However,…"
Fascinating and Beautiful. A great experience,"This was one of the highlights of Gate1's Spiritual Southern India tour. The show is in a small auditorium and features the very complicated application of makeup by the actors, demonstration of the facial muscle techniques used in the dance, an explanation of the scene that…"
Nice before dinner,"Since I don't think there's much to do in cochin itself I consider it to be one of the best things to do to spend an hour and a half. By the way it is very characteristic and cultural, I wouldn't have missed it"
Worth a visit,Interesting and entertaining experience. There was an hour of face painting before the performance which allowed plenty of time for pictures. Book in advance for the best seats nearer the front. The information regarding the story enacted and the narration was also helpful to explain the dance. Well worth a visit.
Experience a Kathakali performance when in Kerala,Kathakali is difficult to describe but is a worthwhile cultural experience when in Kerala.The show starts at 5pm with the male performers going through the ritual of applying makeup.The dance involves elaborate costumes & eye gestures & movements (which are briefly explained before the show) music & colour. The male performers are surprisingly elegant.Do visit the costume museum on your way out. The costumes are amazing.
So much expression,"We didn't know what to expect when we read about Kathakali but this was an amazing experience. Definitely worth getting there to watch the makeup prior to the show, that in itself is an amazing skill to watch. They then explained the movement and language used which made it so unique, highly recommend going to a Kathakali performance"
Great experience ,We went to see the martial arts performance and the classical dancing and were amazed by the quality of the performances. The kids (10 and 12) loved the martial arts in particular but both performances were great.
A variety of cultural delights,If you can get past the perfume seller at the entrance and the impressive woodwork showroom with its model ships and more modern sculptural pieces you can buy a ticket for a variety of local performances here. The Martial Arts hall and its masters are incredibly skilled and professional. Some people may not consider India as having a rich heritage in martial arts but in fact it was an Indian Bhudist monk who took this form of Martial Arts to China. It was then practised by the monks and practiced for over 500 years. This is the birthplace of Kung Fu as we know it now practiced by well known artists such as Jet Li and Jackie Chan! Inspiring and slightly terrifying to watch (especially the flexible sword).I also enjoyed the Kathakali dancing taster which shows some of the ancient dance forms as well as how the dancers prepare their faces with elaborate makeup.
spectacle ,it is nice spectacle a l though i didn't get the signification of all eye's movement. It deserve to be seen.
Dont miss this enthralling makeup and dance,"The show starts about 5pm with 3 male actors meticulously applying g their full face makeup, well worth watching  then at 6pm there is a 10 minute explanation of Kathkali with one actor demonstrating the mime features then about 6.15pm the dance starts with gorgeous costumes and mesmerising mime.I don't often go to cultural displays but this is one I am really glad I went to. It finishes about 7.15pm. Book a day or so before and try to get some of the numbered seats in the stalls close to the stage. If you can't, then the upstairs seats on the side nearest the stage are almost as good (unnumbered upstairs)."
Interesting traditional play,This is a must see while visiting Kochi as it is a famous traditional play. They are very talented in applying makeup using all natural ingredients. The musicians and dancers are interesting to watch.
Kathakali And kerala martial arts,Kerala martial arts from 1600hrs at 300 rupees per person and worth a watch. Each move and lock is explained.Sword and bamboo fights are a treat to watch. Kathakali makeup starts at 1700 hrs and kathakali dance starts around 1830 hrs. 350 rupees for kathakali dance. They give a write up of the show each day and then enact it with all explanations.2000 hrs is a cultural dance each day.Well constructed small auditorium. Chairs are modestly comfortable. The kathakli dance is full house with a seating of 120 to 130 people. Snacks are sold outside the centre.
A wonderful centre for culture,"We came several times to this centre to experience different things they had on offer. The kathakali was great, as was the Classical Indian Dance but our highlight was the morning meditation where the musician sang the songs traditionally performed at that time of day to live tabla. His love and passion shone through everything he did and it was really great."
Must visit!,Saw the demonstration of how elaborate make up is applied and subsequent performance of the group - in traditional costumes and story! Was extremely fascinating and interesting show. Truly worth going and seeing for yourself!
Kathkali traditional art dance drama,"This dance drama belongs to the coastal state of Kerala, the skilled traditional dancers in elaborate costumes, accompanied by drums and voice, were preceded by unique face painting, which is highly symbolic and defines each character type. Human, god-like, or even demonic qualities are represented by the stunning makeup, costumes and eye movements.  Humorous situations add to the enjoyment.  Be sure to explore the center, a museum with several rooms, many large carved statues, even a decorated long boat."
Hi quuality performance.,We saw a classical indian concert. Top notch performers and musicians. Not just touristy restaurant performes. They were the real deal. The setting and vibe was also great. Have been to some that are marginal and not comfortable. This was good all round.
Good experience of Kathakali show,We saw a Kathakali show which was for 1 hour. The tickets cost 350 RS each for balcony seats. Before the show the artists do makeup in front of the audience to demonstrate the intricacies of the process. They also explain different movements and aspects of the show. For someone new to the art that is really helpful and the duration of the the show was just long enough to be enjoyable. Overall a great experience.
Must see attraction in Fort Kochi,"If you like culture this is a must for any visit to Fort Kochi.  We had never seen anything like it before.  The training required to perform takes  years of practice and dedication.   There are different performances Kathakali, traditional dance, martial arts, classic music and worth checking them all out."
"Fun, but a bit too long for my tastes","I enjoyed seeing and learning about this unique form of entertainment,  but I was also glad when it ended. I did find it rather hard to follow. Definitely worth seeing."
Great shows,"One can see the amazing shows or kathakali, classical music, kalaripayttu (martial arts), classical dance at this center. It is located very close to Santa Cruz basilica. Yoga sessions are also organized. Apart from kathakali show, one can reach early and can see the makeup process."
Ancient art/ dance displayed in it's original form,"This is probably the closest you will get to the older cultural/ art/ dance experience while in Cochin. In a well maintained center one is able to even see the way make up is applied and the costumes put on . The performers are genuine artists and the commentary done well in English. It is an authentic experience , reasonably priced, easy to get to and a must for any visitor keen to know the culture and arts of "" God's own country "" . Make it a point to spend part of an evening there"
wonderful performance,we witnessed the Kathakali performance here and it was outstanding show..we were awestruck..good learning for kids..
Must-see for lovers of culture ,Your accommodation should be able to buy you a ticket. You can arrive at 5.45 for the make up before Kathakali demonstration and show. Very interesting for those who like to experience different arts.
Good Kathakali Show but Kalaripayattu was average,"We went to this place as it was recommended by Taj (the hotel we stayed in). We went for 2 shows- kalaripayattu and Kathakali. Both the shows were for an hour each. Cost was Rs 300 per person for Kalaripayattu and Rs 350 per person for Kathakali. One can stay for make up of Kathakali which is also for an hour and included in Rs 350/-.Advance booking is recommended for Kathakali while not needed for Kalaripayattu. Kalariyattu was not very interesting as the people who performed were good but not exceptional. It was very basic and did not evoke much interest.Kathakali was good and it was engrossing for an hour. They do not accept credit card and only cash needs to be paid. I think, this place is specifically for tourists and decent one if person wants to know about Kathakali.Seating is basic and place is inside a small lane."
Entertaining,We arrived late but enjoyed the show. We were given the story so we knew what was going on. Very ornate costumes. Worth a visit.
Visit to martial arts show,Interesting history. Martial arts students were very talented. Show starting times not well posted. Good seating and interaction with the crowd at the end of the show was welcomed
Very entertaining cultural shows,"We went to two different shows on different days. One a theatre show that if you go an hour early you see the elaborate and colourful makeup and performers preparations which was fascinating. The other was a concert of Indian music and singing, it too was just great, very talented performers. They have shows most days and the theatre show can be popular so pays to book."
Okay!,"This was literally across from our hotel and only inexpensive to attend.  The makeup session was ok to watch for 10 mins but literally was like 'watching paint dry' Thought there may have been more people getting made up but only the one on stage.  Skipped across the road for a cold beer and went back for the show.  Appreciate the talent and preservation of the cultural heritage, but it got a little monotonous for me.  50mins definitely long enough for my attention span."
Don’t miss it,Loved this dance presentation. Do not miss it. This was one of the most unique  shows we saw during our 2 weeks in south India. Unique to Kerala.
Thank you saving our heritage,Guys best place to experience Kalaripaytu n Kathakali. Best part is their love n determination for their art. Amazing experience. Very nice people.
worth the visit,"This might be not to everybody`s liking, but in you are in Kochi, you have to visit this place. A unique experience and I can appreciate the talent of actors with all the expressive eye and face movements, also hand gestures."
Good performance,"Kerala trip is incomplete without kathakaliWe went to see the performance with our 1 year old kid and we were very worried that he will not let us see the performance but amazingly he was the one who was clapping throughout. I think he enjoyed more than us.Storytelling was excellent....very good performance by actors... background music was very soothingJust one apprehension.....out of almost 100 audience only 5-10 were Indians and we were sitting on second row. When performance ended we appreciate the performance with one of the drum master ( there guru I suppose...since performers were touching his feet before performance) , but he was not interested in listening to us....he had three feedback books which he gave to only foreigners and he was interested in their comments only...."
Must see,"Here you can see wonderful traditional theatre of Kerala. They use a lot of muscles on the face to show many many emotions, so you can open for yourself not only cultural part but something new about people and emotions"
A real taste of Indian culture,We went on three consecutive nights to see three different aspects (art forms) of Indian culture.1. Part of an Indian epic play. There was an option which we took to see the actors being made up.2. A demonstration of Indian dance done by women.3. A sitar recital… (Accompanied by drums)All three were excellent and we would not have wanted to miss any of them!
Cultural interest,"Well, I was not in the mood, so I found watching 45 mns of make up boring after 10 mns, and it went well past the announced time. After 20 mns of the actual Khatakali show, I was ready to go home, as I could not tune in the cultural meaning of the rather static dance, once I had an eyeful of the amazing costumes and got the gist of the movements, but that is my bad. I have to say, the artistry was delicate, the performers highly skilled/disciplined. Warning: do not go if you have a headache, the drumming and mini cymbals are relentless. The welcoming, entrance, stage, staff were all lovely. And at 350 rps (AU$7), a cultural must."
Total waste of time,Spent a hour watching a man put his makeup on.  The 1 1/2 hours of boring dancing with regular power cuts. The only redeeming feature was a short marital arts show at the end
kalariyapattu,"only one word to say _ outstanding .there are two shows 5 to 6 Kathakali and 6 to 7 kalariyapattu. both are good but if shortage of time then go for kalariyapattu. it is like must see show, very energic and enjoyable."
Stylish dancing - educational.,"The make-up and costumes are spectacular and the dancing, though relatively static, is interesting but limited by ones ability to remember all the inferences in the expressions and movements."
Unique.  Must do!,Loved this.  Very unique.  Not seen anything like this.  The actual performance is an hour but you can go an hour before to see them putting on the make-up.  Would highly recommend for culture.  It's all about the eyes :-)
Superb,It’s very good experience.mesmerized after visiting recommended all to visit.kerala is beautiful place to visit
A real laugh and insight into a cultural element of Keralan life,"This activity wasn’t on our itinerary but we were encouraged by our driver to go and for an hour’s entertainment before dinner it was very funny. The dancers are very skilled and entertainment really is the name of the game. The first half is a good explanation of the technique involved, i.e. eye movement and hand gestures and their meanings. Then a scene from a story is told. Lighthearted and fun. Appropriate for any age."
Really worthwhile,"A group of us went to a performance, but wasn't at this centre. Cost was Rs 350. It was fascinating to watch make-up being applied and have explaination of movements and expressions.  All artists were very skilled and performance was informative on culture as well as entertaining."
A good introduction to this key part of Kerala culture,"We went on our first night in Kerala. If you go early you can watch the actors apply their make up, which sounds dull but was fascinating. There was then a 30 minute introduction to the eye movements, actions and drum rhythms which conveyed various messages, essential for understanding what followed, which was about an hour-long extract from a real Kathakali. Whole thing took about 3 hours.    A guide to the story in English was handed out before the performance. As a westerner with no prior knowledge of this art form I found the experience most interesting for the light it shed on the cultural life of southern India."
kathakali and classical art forms,"Best place to watch and enjoy kathakali art form.They demonstrates the make up methods.mudras,dressing style etc"
Indulge in Kerala's most colourful experience,"Kerala Kathakali centre is a wonderful place to experience Kathakali and Kalaripattu.It has an auditorium with about 75 person capacity and are entry tickets are priced about 200 rupees. Get the front seats for the best experience.. so reach there ahead of time. so what do we do getting there early??? apart from getting the best seats, you can talk to the artists, master trainer and also view the makeup process for the performance (charged extra). Get ready for a adrenaline filled Kalaripattu performance and also get some self defence tips from the performers. The elaborate dressing for the Kathakali performance is itself an experience, then feel your heart rhythm with the beats of the drums. If you are lucky, get to see a battle performance of a fight sequence...  interact with the artists, take some pics and also try a move with the artists :-)If one is obsessed with the dance or the martial art, training is also provide (for a longer stay though). The master is a world renowned highly awarded artist himself"
Charming little theatre,"Anyone who comes to Fort Kochi should make a point of attending that little theatre located at the end of a very small lane next to the Tibetan restaurant.They are open every day of the week without fail and the gentleman running it is so motivated to show various forms of the typical arts of Kerala such as the fame Kathakali mime plays,hence the name of the Center but also various music concerts.Do not miss the long make up preparations for the Kathakali plays.It’s a real spectacle in itself,quite fascinating actually They open at 5pm for thatBut what is remarkable is the dedication of the artists and their passion for their arts.They really deserve a big applause So do make time fo enjoy at least one evening of your holidays to go there and make those artists happy."
Entertainment! ,"It's one of those things you have to do when you're in the area or you'd regret it. When you've been you're not really sure why you went. Yes, to the purists, it is local culture and it originated a long time ago. It's very well done, I wouldn't want to take anything away from the actors. It is though a unique skill. Go and enjoy the experience and when you leave be pleased you didn't sign up for the full 10 hour version!"
A must visit when in Kochi,"From the make up on stage for an hour before the performance, and the whole experience it is just amazing. Don't miss this when you are in Kochi. Performances every night.There are also classical dance and martial art performances which we unfortunately missed due to lack of time."
Show of Kathakali and classical music,It was a great show! It's worth the price. I really recommend going there. The Kathakali is a 5 pm starting with the make-up of the actors then with the show itself. The Indian classical music or dance (depending on the day) is from 8 pm to 9 pm.
Jewel of Kerala,"Location was very good, you can walk around and go to many places in Fort Kochi...Absolutely if you are in Kerala and haven't seen this show you have missed something which you will not find anywhere...starting music was so meditating, We have spent whole day from 5 am to 5 pm... too much enjoyed and after that less remaining energy we are attending this show... listening to this music and eyes close and it was so relaxing... my whole day's tiredness gone in minutes... i can go hours and hours to listen this music.performers are making up their faces. it was amazing, half by themselves and half by other person.... it was so creative.main person was saying about history of kathakali and what is going to happen in this show. he was teaching us A,B,C,D of Kathakali so we can understand easily.then show started and it was amazing experience. though it was very hard to consume whole length show because they were doing only expressions only to tell the story. so it was too hard to looking to expressions and understand story without any words.but overall a different experience and enjoyed a lot."
Jew Town,"Definitely a not to miss place as the most interesting sites to visit are located there in the area called Mattanchery.Aside from the Dutch Palace and provided you are interested In the History of Kerala,you can visit the oldest synagogue in Kerala.But it’s the whole atmosphere there which makes it so pleasant,all the spice merchants and antiques shops,do not miss Crafters where you will find amazing antiques and not so antiques stuff but you could find whatever you want in any of their shops.And the multitude of kashmiri run shops.Do not miss the one called « Trésors des Indes »,the owner Althaf  will be only to pleased to show you his textiles and jewellery.He also manage some french hence the name of his shop.Anyway strongly recommended and far more interesting than Fort Kochi for the atmosphere."
mesmerising,"Incredible haven of Kerala culture, this centre for the Kathakali art form keeps the tradition alive, accessible and incredibly cheap- a concert costs the equivalent of about 4 euros. It is run by incredible human beings- so warm and welcoming, who welcome you in and take you on an incredible journey of dance and music. First night I visited, I attended a classical Indian music concert which took my breath away from the sheer virtuosity, beauty and sincerity of the ragas. i became addicted and came back another night to see some mesmerising and colourful Kathakali dance- followed by another concert of ragas. Full explanations in english were given and I got to talk with the very friendly musicians afterwards to discuss the music. i hear the meditation sessions in the mornings accompanied by live Indian classical music are to die for. This experience was the highlight of my trip to India."
Kathakali performance,"This place was recommended to us by a friend. We were not sure if the hour long taxi ride would be worth it but we are so glad that we went. Very peaceful and tranquil place. They demonstrated the make up techniques, eyes, mudras and expressions. The performance itslef was only about 45 minutes which is perfect for people who just want an idea about this ancient art form. The hand out of the story for the day made it easier for us to understand and enjoy the performance. I applaud the art center for trying to keep such art forms alive. Very nice evening spent in Fort Kochi."
Hypnotic,"Enjoyed the show very much. Definitely worth seeing the performers transform themselves with make-up beforehand, and how the stage/floor gets set. As others have said, it gets very loud but I quite liked that!"
Unmissable. Unforgettable ,"The kathakali performance was powerful and a privilege to witness. Extraordinary grace and emotional intensity - vivid colours, masterful control and almost superhuman attention to detail. Mesmerising - must be seen. Directly afterwards we attended an Indian classical music concert at the same venue. We are musicians ourselves, and we were shocked by the brilliance of the musicians performing. Breathtaking virtuosity of the highest calibre. We were so impressed that we came back another night, and were even more blown away the second time. Must be seen. This isn’t light entertainment - it demands concentration and focus from the spectator too, but deeply rewarding"
Mesmerising performance,"I'm in India on tour with a symphony orchestra, and I was lucky enough to stumble across the website of the Kerala Kathakali Centre as I was looking to see a concert of Indian classical music. A group of us went to the Kathakali session, and then stayed for the music session afterwards. It was absolutely amazing. The Kathakali was wonderful, despite not understanding much of what was going on! It's a very stylised form of story-dance, and yes, the music is quite loud so earplugs are a good idea. The hall is air conditioned which is a great touch :D The thing that really blew us away was the music performance. It was a male singer, a harmonium player, a tabla player and a tiny cymbal player. It was one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen and heard. The musicians were totally in the moment, and they're improvising about 75% of the time - it's really incredible. It was a huge shame that there was only a small audience! We got chatting with the man who manages the shows, and he said that if we came back another night he could get any instrument we wanted to see. So we came back two nights later to listen to a violinist, a mridangam (type of drum) player, and a tabla player. It was just as wonderful as the first night. I would be there every night if I could be! Please go along, and don't miss the music as well as the kathakali!"
Excellent kathakali rendition,I would suggest carrying ear muffs as it can get really loud. They explain very well each dance move.
Kathakali Theatre Show,I wasn’t quite sure what I was supposed to be seeing especially as when I turned up the first near hour of the show was watching the actors sitting quietly on the stage putting on their face make-up. Yes very strange indeed but it transpires this is a major part of Kathakali Theatre which is seemingly unique to Kerala. Unfortunately not for me I just didn’t get this which in the end was longer than the actual show. Yes the costumes and make up are amazing but as for the storyline - very basic is me being kind! However I do respect the efforts and the art.
Kerala kathak,Kerala kathakali centre is one of my favourite kathakali centre i were visited.Fee was very cheap then other centre.
Great exp,The traditional Kerala kathakali dance was awesome..Recommend people to visit once...The traditional attire is so pretty and prices are reasonable.
My visit for Kathakali and Kalaripayattu show.,Been there two times so far once in 2013 and last was 3 months back. Was disappointed with how the staff's communication with the visitors. I would not go back there. There are many other options in Fort Cochin.The show was nice.
An Amazing Experience,The performers are immensely talented! So gracefully with every performance. It was a treat for the eye.
always a great experience,for the third time we attended a show with as much pleasure and interest.Ne manquez pas le maquillage des acteurs qui se fait devant vous sur la scène
Interesting must do theatre,Nice and charming tiny theatre with a very interesting introduction to the Kathakali performance. For all ages !
Great performance,It was amazing performance. At the beginning every gesture was explained to the audience. The make up show was my favourite
Interesting first-hand experience of an old Indian tradition,We arrived early to be able to see the preparations of the actor for stage (heavy make-up) and to learn about the meaning of the different colors and different hand motions (mudras). The museum was simple yet informative and the show was nice. Unfortunately we don't get the full meaning of the play.
wonderful experience of such a specialized art form,"the makeup application was interesting but could have skipped it but the introduction and demonstration of the various eye positions, facial expressions, hand gestures and all the meanings such subtle movements capture was simply fantastic.  the musicians performing live with the dance were a joy to watch and listen to as well.  What a pleasant way to spend an evening!"
Great experience,"We came to Kochi from scotland so had never seen anything like this. It’s VERY different from anything we’d ever seen, but good fun and the venue is great. The actors talk you through Kathakali before he performance, and watching the make-up getting applied is fascinating. The play itself is good fun, even if it is slightly hard to follow everything that’s going on - but that’s part of the fun! The translation is handy and helps with this. All in all, we wouldn’t do it twice, but we’re really glad we did it once."
Incredible entertainment ,"We saw the kathakali performance and thoroughly enjoyed it. Watching the actors apply their make up was fascinating and it was also really helpful to learn more about the history of kathakali and the various actions used before seeing the show. During the show, the actors were fabulous, using amazing facial expressions to tell the story, and the live music really brought it to life."
Nice try but stretched too long,Its a nice attempt to save the culture and art and an ancient dance form.Nice costumes and makeup.Only if the man reciting the whole thing had an easy accent. And only if it started on time and was all squeezed into an hour. It was stretched way too long for us and we had to leave after an hour leaving the show in between.Also it was priced too high for the quality.
It's interesting,"Amazing place to watch a Kathakali performance. The ambience of the place sets the mood before the show. And you get the opportunity to watch them put the elaborate makeup before the show. The organisers even arrange a demonstration right before the show - a sort of 15-min crash course into understanding a Kathakali performance. They have a different story each day of the week, so you can go back for more. Am curious to attend some of the other things they offer...classical music, martial arts performances and yoga classes"
How eyes and faces dance- Kathakali,"Kerala kathakali centre is the finest kathakali auditoriums in kochi. It is situated in fort kochi area. I watched the evening show of kathakali alongwith makeup application process. It cost me around Rs. 350 and man, it was worth it... 💝. Face makeup application is really very detailed process. The show began with the introduction to kathakali, how natural colours are used for makeup, which colour represents which kind of character, then they showcased basic emotions called bhavas, various eye movements, facial expressions etc, all these before the main story. The main story that day was of kichaka, draupadi and bhima. It was beautifully described by singers, orchestration and of course the dancers.They must have undergone to master this intricacy. Overall,it was very entertaining,informative,and learning experience for me. One thing, I spoke to the head singer Mr. Sujeendra and he told that Indians come to watch the show are lesser in number as compared to foreigners. I appeal to all the Indians who are reading this review, to give a chance to this intricate art."
Very interesting ,"The show started with an hour where the actors are doing an extremely intensive makeup, so picture. After that they explain different face mood, body positions and the meaning of them. Then we had one hour of very spectacular show/teather. A must if you are in Kochi, Kerala."
Morning Yoga,"We went for morning yoga off the time off the website, which was incorrect, so maybe check timings beforehand! But they ran us a yoga class anyway! Instructor was great, and great intro to beginners yoga on the rooftop!"
Culture,"Helpful staff, Rich in culture.Especially in Hindu.3 floors of KeralaSouth/ middle/ north.With alla of the original pieces"
Introduction to India’s Martial Arts,I left this Kathakali Centre feeling genuinely down and sad. That this wonderful marital art did not have the support and following it deserved seemed incredible. That it was struggling to survive in this modern age caused me concern. I was intrigued during the performance by certain body positions or movements which I am used to performing within the context of Yoga. It gave me pause and I wondered at the possibility of Yoga functioning as a martial art. The history was wonderful and the sheer energy of the performance (sword and pole strikes) left me wishing I too could invigorate myself with this wonderful art.
A terrific experience,"I'm not used to watch a show based on men behave as women. I've found it interesting and fascinating. Sometimes it's hard to understand the story,  in spite of the short English explanation prior the show.Don't miss the make up process on stage, before the show.Try to come alert, as you need to concentrate during the show."
Good cultural experience at the centre near the Basilica,"I arrived at 17:00 to watch the actors get into character by applying their make up. The show only starts at around 18:30, so take some snacks and your camera. It was an interesting performance and I found it quite relaxing and enjoyable. It's an interesting cultural event to tick off when visiting Kerala."
Show cancelled cos “not enough audience”,"I had watched the Kathakali dance performance when I was in Fort Kochi last year. I really enjoyed it. When I decided to come back to Fort Kochi again this year for vacation, I really wanted to watch the Kalaripattyu (Kerala martial arts) show. Their website says it’s necessary to make a reservation, so my hotel did so for me. There’s only one show a day at 4pm. Today is a Saturday. I showed up at 3.55 having rushed there from Jew Town. There was another tourist waiting there. The ticket seller lady was on the phone. It took her 2-3 mins to get off it. She then said “today’s show not enough audience. Minimum 7. Show is cancelled”. What???I told her that my hotel had called to reserve and nobody told them it’s cancelled. I also offered to buy 7 tickets to let the show go on. But no was no. How disappointing. How can you operate an important cultural institution like this without having a reliable show time, even after you make your guests call ahead to reserve??Really disappointed."
Good experience,I was there few years ago. I found it very interesting to see how the actors are getting prepared for the show. The show itself was also worth seeing.
Colourful and interesting,I loved the dancing but particularly enjoyed the demonstrations of different facial and physical expressions of emotions
Great experience,First tryst with this art form... Loved it .we saw the makeup at the beginning and then the performance.
Fantastic experience,"Fascinating performance by incredibly talented actors, dancers, and musicians. A real insight into traditional Keralan culture."
Fantastic-must see,"If you only do one thing in Kochi,  go to Kerala Kathakali Centre, and make sure it is the one behind the Basilica.  There are others and there is no comparison .  Dedicated,  beautifully costumed performers in a wonderful authentically decorated center.  Please be aware that some of the reviews are of a different center as I can tell by the photos and descriptions. This is fantastic !  Bring your camera !.."
Culture ,"Although I seemed to have some trouble understanding what my ticket actually actually allowed me to see( I’ve a feeling my driver wasn’t completely honest about my booking)In future I would get Mr Walton to book this for me.Anyway the dancing show I saw was really superb. The Martial arts show was very good but a bit labored. The young man explained it very well and it was demonstrated with talented artists, but it needed a little more direction.Glad I went."
Awesome place,This is one of the most attractive place of touristers.On there it's shows the kathakali and good place to see.
Waste of time,"The images are nice but, please, do not call this a show. The room it's empty and ""cold"", everybody look surprise for the lack of interest and it never ends. It's realy a waste of time (and expensive). To complete the picture, at the end of the show the ""actors"" will ask for tips :( In case you decide to go, I suggest to go at the end of the make-up time (at least 1 hour)."
Kathakali 🤐😡🤣,I couldn’t understand why people see kathakali. I was feeling sleepy there but if some one like art and culture it’s good
Great introduction to Kerala dance,"They provide a shortened version (the full performances are apparently several hours) of a dance performance, complete with explanations of the facial expressions and movements.  Come early to see they apply the makeup.  Definitely a good evening out.  (I was concerned it might be very hot in the theatre, but it was not.)"
Intersting,Its very special dance we found in kochi with their face expression and typical story play. Ita thier traditional dance of kerala where they can attract the tourists who visit kochi anyway i enjoyed it well
Great evening outing,Our host suggested arriving an hour before the performance to watch the application of makeup. I was not terribly excited by the idea but decided to give it a go. This turned oit ti be quite as interesting as the performance itself. The pre-show introduction to Kathakali mudras and expressions was also fascinating.Pick up a water or juice on your way in as it can be quite warm and refreshment is helpful.
"If You Do One Thing In Kochi, Watch This Dance",These guys are seriously amazing. Definitely arrive early to watch them put on the makeup - it is well worth it. The dancing is also spectacular and it is clear that this is a labor of love.
Evergreen kerala tradition,I'm booked Kerala kathakali from namasthe fortkochi.it was really amazing costume.The gusters they made was too good .Really I recommend all never miss Kerala kathakali
Great place offering many Cultural experiences,"I came here to see the Kathakali performance on Friday evening. This small and intimate theatre is welcoming and air-conditioned. Fascinating to watch the artists applying their make up, and to learn something about the performance before seeing it.  A very enjoyable evening, and I was interested to discover that stories vary on different nights.  Just wish I could have seen more of what thus place offers."
Munnar trip ,"Kathakalli is the traditional art form of Kerala.. It really interesting to watch that but we have to concentrate on it because if we can't concentrate on it, we cant understand even a single thing from it.."
Very interesting experience,"Never ever having seen a Kathakalli performance before, I didn't really know what to expect, but found the 60 minutes a fascinating experience. Hard to believe sometimes that it is a man performing and not a woman! It helps to book early and get a front row seat if you want to take some photos."
An experience and good value,"This is my second visit and to be honest I only returned as my daughter wanted to experience this as it was the same story being performed..I am pretty sure the theatre has been improved and we had front row seats which was amazing. Having been before, we arrived to see 30 mins of the makeup session rather than  the full hour, this is ample but don't miss it as its so clever. The 30 minute explanation of the symbols and eye movements is really good but I do find the actual play a bit tedious. BUT the costumes , drumming and colours are superb. You have to go . Toilets are easily available , hand fans for personal use and cold drinks on sale at the door.Photography is allowed but no flash."
A honest insight into the complex art of katakali,"Katakali is not something that can be understood at a glance, nevertheless this modest and honest performance, accompanied by explanation in English, manages to provide an interesting overview, and at the same time it gives a bit of the sacred atmosphere of a full katakali ritual. I sincerely appreciated. The yoga classes in the morning are accessible and a good way to start the day."
Intricate make up and excellent demonstation of the art of Kathakalli and other forms of classical dance,This was an excellent demonstation of the art of Kathakalli and other forms of classical dance. All the artistes were well trained and excelled at the art. Demonstration of the Martial Art of Kerala and the light/puppet show also was a traditional art which was training youngsters for the future.
Get there early. Really enjoyed.,"Although our group had purchased tickets and been assigned seats, when we got there, people were in our seats and wouldn't move. Nor was there any enforcement. However we found it very interesting to see the actors applying the complex makeup before the show and the show itself was really spectacular."
Fascinating cultural insight ,We went to the 6pm show which included a demonstration of how the performers’ make up is applied followed by an introduction to the tradition of Kathakali and a short performance. Very interesting to be told about such a different storytelling tradition performed with gusto and skill. Enjoyable and interesting
Traditional dance,It was a good experience to see our culture and the dance form. Tickets are available at reasonable rates.
Like it or hate it you decide,"Well this was different.This was the Kathakali dance show. Now if you get there when they tell you to, you will spend the first hour watching them put makeup on. The dance is loud and colourful. After the make up come expressions of love, hate, jealousy etc. then the full on dance. I must admit, I laughed. I could not help it. One person fell asleep, and was snoring. This is a hour of dancing, but you will either love it or hate it, depending on your own thoughts. Clearly there were people who did, and some did not. Some even were bemused by it but hey, make your own mind up on this one."
Local folklor ,"If you are interested in local folklor, than you must visit this place, otherwise it is just a boring show..it starts by the players putting the make up for an hour in front of the audience, that a one+ houre of a show. A pantmimic show..."
Worth a visit,Went here last night and really enjoyed the show. It is a must to attend the make up and explanation otherwise the show does not make much sense. It is also quite interesting to see the transform and to learn all about the movements
Traditionalism,The primary traditional artform of kerala kathakali is well exilhibited here.The art form is exhibited as per the traditional and cultural mores and values of kerala.Quite a good experience
Learning Experience,"It’s a fantastic attempt present Indian Classical Music, Dance and Martial arts for tourists in an easy to understand light presentation. Full of clear information, each act is complete in itself and makes one feel proud of our Indian culture. I hope every state can create such lively cultural centres, which combines live performance with some good introductory learning. It’s a small beautiful place and has activities almost whole day. Refer to their website for details & book in advance for free."
Guys are Better with Makeup too!!,"It was a brilliant performance and their attires were perfect. You must see the makeup session so that you get to see the transformation. From this to that. It’s truly Remarkable!! Good show, easy to access the place, AC. They always appreciate words of encouragement and very affable. The program includes an hour of makeup session and another hour of performance."
One of the best live performances!,"The place is located very near to Fort Kochi. We went an hour before the Kathakali show starts. Seating arrangements were good. We saw the makeup preparations of the dancers. I think, people must not only go to watch the dance form, they should watch the makeup preparations behind it too. It was an awesome experience all in all."
Fascinating and captivating Kathakali,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching the make-up, demonstration and then performance of the The Killing of Kichaka. The time and effort needed for the makeup is incredible and it is fascinating to watch the performers transform their appearance right in front of you. The performance itself is dramatic and amusing at times - brought to life with the wonderful drumming and hypnotic singing. Note: a lot people will get up and go up to the stage to get a photo during the makeup period. Please have patience - several in our audience were getting themselves in quite a tizz as their view (albeit only briefly) was interrupted! Everybody stays put during the demo and performance :)"
"Not for us, waste of time",I truly appreciate the talent of the actors but this kind of show it's not for me. We came half an hour before the show and watching the actor making up. The show was very boring in my opinion. I'm sure some people would love that but for me and my family it was just a waste of time.The show was about one hour.Unfortunately it's not possible to share video.
Really enjoyed the entertainment ,We’ve been twice to the Kerala Kathakali Centre. We found watching the artists putting on their makeup fascinating and the show afterwards really enjoyable. Tonight we went to see a one hour show of traditional music. I enjoyed both. I would strongly recommend both.
A great place to experience the Kathakali culture,We were a bit late for the show but the hall was full on a Sunday evening. The location is a bit hard to locate but the performance was nice.
Very nice & professional,"Autstanding experience. Highly recomended! Don't miss the make-up session. Also, they give you very interesting explenations before the show starts."
Interesting Kerala Culture But a Little Tedious,"We went to the show last night and I am glad I experienced and learned about Kathakali as an art form but found it a little tedious. We arrived early to witness the application of the makeup which took in excess of an hour and really 15-20 minutes would have been ample. The application was very detailed and a skill that along with all the other facets of the art form takes years to perfect. The eye communication along with the hand movements, (which is how they tell a story) is very detailed and after seeing the performance you can understand why it takes years to learn. We were given an explanation of how the eyes express the different emotions and shown all the hand movements and what they mean.  We also had an overview of the story but really you have no idea whats really going on. Despite that you can not try to understand but just appreciate the makeup, costumes, the detail and the skill of the actors. The centre provides nice hand held fans to use as it gets very hot in the venue so is a nice gesture.  The venue is quaint and wooden inside- very local which is cool. Definately worth attending but wouldnt bother with so much time to see the application of the makeup."
Gave up the will to live.,I think we wasted 3 hours of our lives here. Wish we'd have gone for Indian classical music instead. Very weird and monotonous.  Left with a throbbing headache.
Fascinating,"I would highly recommend going to see Kathakali traditional dance if you get a chance when you are Kerala. The performance was split into 3 sections; make up application, demonstration and story dance. I found the first two the most interesting. Seeing the actors/dancers transform under their make up was fascinating and the demonstration was informative, with the various subtle face & hand gestures being explained to help you follow the dances that follow."
Wonderful yoga course,"I do in the center wonderful corse of yoga and it S beautiful Time .hata yoga is A fondation of yoga .and after I feel more peace, Hapiness .and I am So relax.Ramesh is  very good yoga Teacher .we learn yoga and Enjoy the day.you must take A yoga course here.i have learned the true path of yoga here.and  you see the show of kathakali it' S very good Time in this center for me.i recommended warmly."
