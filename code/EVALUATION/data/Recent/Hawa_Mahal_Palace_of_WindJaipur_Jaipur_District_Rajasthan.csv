The wind palace,Hawa mahal is a landmark of the pink city Jaipur. It is situated in the heart of the city attracts people from the main road....
Beautiful Sight,Beautiful architecture in Jaipur. Perfect for taking photos. Drive by sight. Takes a few minutes to view.
Historical architecture ,"Wonderful historical architecture monument, these are the assets of Rajasthan. Jaipur is famous for HAWA MAHAL."
Hawa@mahal,i think one should visit jaipur in rainy season when wecwere on top of hawa mahal. the view of jaipur was outstanding. When the winds blows in these jharakos. it feels lovely
Pride of of the Pink City - Jaipur,"One of the most famous tourist destinations in Jaipur, Hawa Mahal, also known as the palace of wind, is one of the most prominent attractions in Jaipur"
Mesmerising view,Oh god what a view such an epic piece of art. Reminds us how talented were those artists who built it.
Heart of jaipur,"Located at rhe centre of jaipur a palace where u can find history and art of manufacturing builduings , hows at that time king has done this work"
Exquisite ,"Although you get a sense of the palace from the road, it‚Äôs only by exploring behind the facade that you get a sense of this truly wonderful building. Make sure your phone is charged - this is one of the most photogenic palaces I‚Äôve ever visited."
Some places just gets better with time,The surrounding has got cleaner with a little enclosure for selfie clickers. The monument has been very well maintained.
Jaipur Famous Place,Jaipur must visit place... it will take only 10 to 15 mins... just take a photo and move on... but try in both day light and night too. Here Iam attaching night effect
Just saw it from the outside a couple of times,"We just saw the Hawa Mahal from the outside and admired its wonderful architecture. It looked much smaller than I had imagined it to be. Although, we had tickets to go inside, it was so hot and we were so tired from all our sightseeing, that we chose to skip it."
HAWA MAHAL: Extraordinary example of Rajput Architecture.,"The name Hawa Mahal means ''The Palace of Wind"".One of the best landmarks to visit in India.This was built in the 18th century. It is an extraordinary example of Rajput Architecture.The interior of this palace is Stunning, especially for photographers and archeologists.Trip to Jaipur is never completed without visiting this place."
Loved it even on Second Visit,This building has a real charm that attracts you and makes you feel awesome. Its wonderful feeling going up one floor to another. We enjoyed a lot with our 5 year old daughter. A visit to Jaipur is incomplete  without a trip to Hawa Mahal.
One of the best historic place to visit in Jaipur,The best time to visit Hawa Mahal is between month of October to March because the weather during this  place is considered to be pleasant.One of the historic place in Jaipur in the night it looks more beautiful in lights but you can't go inside after 6pm.
Enjoy the outter view dont bother going in unless you are a Archeologist / Architect etc,It's not as good from the inside as it is from the outside. Rather try to go to a cafe right in front of the palace and have a coffe/beer and enjoy the view while you rest.
An Incredible Building.,...with an impressive 'front of the house' architecture. Worth seeing both during the day and at night to gain very different perspective. A favourite location for photo opportunities. Most visitors to Jaipur will come to see the front of the building and not exploring the‚Ä¶
Interesting place good for short visit,There is nothing much to see here apart from the beautiful frontal  facade and the area is very crowded.Very interestingly the building does not have a foundation and attempts to mimic lord krishnas crown
Not really sure I understand the point,"There isnt much to this place beyond the facade, lots of steps and the views. It was very busy but I understand that's routine.  There is some pretty stained glass. "
Impressive Frontal Facade,"As our tour group bus traveled along Hawa Mahal Road in Jaipur city center, we came across the stunning facade of the Hawa Mahal or ""Palace of Wind"".  It was said that this structure was designed to allow breezes or wind to easily travel through the building to serve as a‚Ä¶"
Gorgeous building and add it to a walk down the bazaar of Tripolia,"This is a very busy area of Jaipur, but worth taking the time to find a spot without being run over to admire it. Watch yourselves if you try to have a coffee from the buildings opposite, you will find you pay a lot for the view. I enjoyed a walk around this whole area of the‚Ä¶"
 an architectural wonder,This is an architectural wonder. The ambience inside is Royal. You feel like a King walking inside the palace. The whole palace is visible from the rooftop cafe opposite to it. It reminds you of the rich history of the place. A must visit place for all the history freaks.
Great Look,"Our guide didn't want us to enjoy this classic  in the Pink City , probably because no tip was involved ?  But we got the bus to stop and got to enjoy what is a fabulous facade and an endearing piece of architecture !"
Better than imagined! ,"If you are heading to Jaipur this is undoubtedly on your list of places to see, & it is so worthy.More than just a beautiful facade ~I wasn't sure if we would go in or not but so glad we did - the whole place is quite amazing & so beautiful, which also offers spectacular views over to Nahargahr Fort & into Jantar Mantar aswell as across to the bustling streets. Tip~  get the audioguide for some context  & take your own headphones."
The most recognised facade in Jaipur,"The Palace of the Wind was on our tour guide itinerary.  It is the most recognised facade in Jaipur and is therefore a must see. It is built beside a busy road and reflects the colour of the famous pink city.Our guide did not take us in as the beauty of the building is in the facade.  It is very shallow (single depth) and houses only rooms used as viewing galleries from which women were able to watch the grand processions in the times when they could not be seen in public.We were there for about ten minutes and that included finding somewhere to park,"
üòç,Such a heavenly place situated on a busy road of jaipur which is the pink city. A must visit in the morning
An impressive facade.,"This impressive facade house a small museum, reached from the rear.  Photographs are best taken from the opposite side of the road."
An amazing visit to Hawa Mahal,"Jaipur visit has a royal feel to it and the trip is not complete without visiting the iconic Hawa Mahal. The structure was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, who was the founder of Jaipur. The design of the palace allowed the royal ladies to view processions and everyday festivities without being seen by the common man. The architecture of the palace is such that it remains cool inside even in the scorching summers thanks to the Venturi effect. Your visit to Jaipur has to include this wonderful palace which is the heart of Jaipur city."
exploring,We came upon this by accident just exploring the area and immediately realised it was a stunning building in the level of detail and colours particularly the pink facade.
Unique Structure,The Hawa Mahal or Palace of the Winds is a landmark building of Jaipur.It is Made with the red and pink sandstone.Its unique five floors exterior is akin to the honeycomb of a beehive with its 953 small windows .It is very easy to reach there. It is amazing.
"Expect it , when least expected.","The famous hawa mahal- palace of winds is on the main road. So if you want to enjoy beauty , visit early morning timing with least traffic. Otherwise you'll be bothered by road Side shopkeepers. The palace was made for female of royalty to see without being seen.Five story tall the palace is made of famous pink and yellow sandstone.It's nearby Jantar mantar and city palace.So plan the visit to place accordingly."
A must see in Jaipur,"The Hawa Mahal or Palace of the Winds is a landmark building of Jaipur. Not only the facade  have a tour of the inside and get a great view of the Walled cimty. You cant miss it. Great shopping around the area...from coloured stones to Razai and other handicraft items. See the colorful flower sellers around Badi Chopar,shop for the famous Leheria sarees and turbans and lots more ."
Beautiful ,"I loved this place. Beautiful. I could imagine the royal queens looking out over the square. Amazing structure, so much detail. Not sure if you could enter the Palace but I don‚Äôt think so. So glad I saw"
Gorgeous..,It is  basically a fabulous architecture design with nothing behind it... Almost a facade on a very busy street
Visually stunning,We only saw this from a distance and didn‚Äôt actually go in but it looked enchanting.  A great photo op.
Beautiful Place! ,"I will come again, it has such a beautiful interior! The staircase and pathways indoors were a maze, and I loved the little windows that opened to the street. It‚Äôs a good place to imagine life of the past!"
Awesome Palaces of Rajasthan,"Although we could not spend time going inside the Palace, it's a piece of Beautiful Architecture. Some time you Wonder about the Level of architectural skills of ancient India!!!"
Beautiful to view from top,Great palace and great to visit. Took an rickshaw from Jantar Mantar to Hawa Mahal.Highly recommended though the location is crowded.
Ten minutes of fame ,"Iconic facade like structure is truly beautiful to behold. Located on a busy street, makes it unpleasant to stay longer. Beggars, and hawkers won't leave you alone, and don't you dare take a photo of those snake charmers unless you expect to pay... Pity "
Landmark spot of Jaipur,Everyone I think will associate The Palace of the Wind when they think of Jaipur. On my last visit here nearly 25 years ago I was lucky enough to see part of the interior with it's beautiful paintings and artwork but this time it was just a quick stop in a few tuk tuks while our‚Ä¶
Impressive facade,"Even though it looks so grand and impressive from the outside, it's only a few metres wide inside so that the court ladies could look out to city life without being seen.  If you want a really good view, go to the cafe opposite where there is a perfect viewing spot."
Nice facade,Very pretty but really a one room wide facade. Nice for a pic and takes 5 min. Watch out for lots of beggars
Beautiful structure,"Went here but palace on a very busy street, we couldn‚Äôt go in but was a stunning piece of architecture.  Jaipur is a breath of fresh air after Delhi"
A beautiful facade at least worth a drive by!,I believe the only was to visit this is by viewing it from the street in front of it because it is only a facade.  The story behind it which our guide told us made it very interesting but with the back story or not it is simply beautiful to see in person.
"Lunch break at Hawa Mahal, the Wind Palace","With a history of over 200 years, Hawa Mahal is perhaps the most iconic monument in Jaipur. The original intent of the lattice design was to allow royal ladies to observe everyday life and festivals celebrated in the street below without being seen, since they had to obey the strict rules of ""purdah""."
A case of tourist brochure vs reality,The tour bus just dropped us by the roadside and then it was a scramble to cross a choke filled road to take a photo of the building. The reality; it is along a very busy street and what I have seen in tourist brochures does not reflect the serenity and calm. Even the colour of the building is not true to the actual colour. We spend more time haggling with street sellers than the photoshoot of the building.
A must-see!,"One of the visual landmarks of Jodhpur, this 5 story facade is a unique structure of screened windows, built to allow the ladies of the court to view unseen the comings and goings of the busy street below, particularly during festival times. These women, never allowed to be seen‚Ä¶"
Jharokas on main road for view.,The most prominent structure on the main road for the ladies to view the processions from jharokaas.  Its a beautifully constructed and well maintained site.  For taking the full view of Hawa Mahal we had to cross the road and take pics from opposite side. Few friendly‚Ä¶
A relatively large palace,"From the outside, Hawa Mahal does not look that big but actually it is reasonably large and if one wants to see all with audio guides, it will take at least an hour and a half. Also, the entrance to the Mahal is not at the front, which is the front facade of the Mahal which‚Ä¶"
Iconic,This is the most iconic structure of Jaipur and is a must visit place for a photo or two. Mind you it is situated is the middle of the craziest traffic you will ever come across. Hawa Mahal is a five story building in the heart of the city of Jaipur. It has a beehive like‚Ä¶
Beautiful building ,Only stopped to take photos of the facade. Very beautiful.Very busy street. Lots of sellars and a snake charmer
Heritage  and tourism,Nicely  architectured  for  crossing  air.hawamahal must be visited  but  not good  place to spent  much time.it is good  pcs of ecofriendly  architecture  and represents  life of peoples  who lives here in past.nearby market is based  on tourist so prices  are not good enough  and much bargain prices. Also quality  should  be taken care.
Very instagramable,"We only stopped outside the Hawa Mahal to take the necessary photo, and instead of taking just 1, we found ourselves taking several from all manner of angles. The building is a real feat of physics/angles and you can‚Äôt help but try and capture as many of them as you can."
Must see in Jaipur ,We saw this from the front only one day with a tour but then came back the next to go inside. Lovely and unusual place. Entrance is behind the facade. There is a open arch twenty or so feet to the right that you follow to the back and to the left.
Instagrammable Place in Jaipur - TheWickedSoul,"Hawamahal is the city‚Äôs most iconic structure. One of the most instagrammable spots in Jaipur, the Hawa Mahal or the Palace of Winds derives its name from the many windows on its fa√ßade ¬†through which fresh air passes.More updates on Insta @thewickedsoul"
Hawa Mahal,"very instragrammable one.  very colorful nice place even though we couldn't enter, certainly nice to see from outside."
Instagram spot ,An excellent spot for taking photos and selfies. Though parking is a problem at this spot. At night the place takes a different look thanks to the lighting.
Hawa mahal,Tad disappointing as not the crisp colours but still an amazing building and do go up to the windview cafe to get a good view.
Hawa hawai,If you want to see complete old Jaipur than you should go on to the top of this palace. Generally people take pic only from outside but from inside also it is good to see
Nice,We visited here but the did't allowed to go inside.we clicked pics from outside .so I didt reviewed about the inside.
Great night photo,Basically a beautiful wall built to house the ladies of the court. Nothing to do there but take a great photo at night.
Worth a visit....,"On a recent holiday in India, we visited the Palace of the Wind. The architecture of this building is amazing and definitely reminds me of a big slab of honeycomb. We visited this both during the day and when it was all lit up at night..... it was stunning.Perfect place for great photos and it is a great example of what the Pink City of Jaipur is all about."
Classic ,"Historic architecture with great stories within its campus ,clearly shows how people were more artistic and  a greater architecture than today"
Impressive ,An impressive site of red and pink sandstone from it‚Äôs roadside location. Great architecture and well worth a visit when in Jaipur.
In awe,I am in awe after I went here.  It gives a view into India's rich history.  An archaeological wonder. Must visit place.
beautiful facade,"This rather unique building is on the main street in Jaipur, you can get great photos of it from one of the high floor Cafe's across the street."
Royal mahal,Hawamahal is very big with 1000+ windows.so it's called hawamahal and it is at the edge of road so it makes it beautiful.
More than what meets the eyes,Hawa mahal is more than what meets the eye because it‚Äôs huge from inside with pretty carvings and tiny little windows everywhere! Try going on a weekday as it can get really crowded.
A piece of Architecture beauty,It is must see piece of architecture because the name suggests that lot of air flows through it when the heat is blowing in open area. It is a land mark beauty of Pink City.
Not what I expected,"Not much, very pretty, but only worth a 2 minute camera stop. The rest of the town is super filthy. Lots of garbage and beggars."
Brief stop is all that is needed,This is a beautiful looking facade used for Royal Queens to look out onto every day life from behind a screen. A must see as it's so pretty
Correctly the visual symbol of the pink city!,"This is a stunning building, correctly compared with a honeycomb. Only a pity that it's so close to a major street - so carefully cross the street and take a look at larger distance as well. My guide said that it's not worthy to enter, so we didn't.BTW: ""pink"" is not really pink, it's rather ""terra cotta"" colour."
Great architecture!,Great architecture! Must visit if ypu are visiting Jaipur for the first time! Perfect for clicking photos and instagramming!
Nice and fabulus.,One of the best experience in my life iwas there with my freinds we feel very good when we was seen uncrideble story about wind palace guide was explain everything about jaipur city ........
Pretty ,It is advisable to go in the morning to beat the crowds. I arrived about 10.30am and was able to walk around easily without too many people which really made a difference to enjoying this beautiful place.
Beautiful,The most beautiful view of this mahal is luckily free. From the road in front of mahal. Rest to visit from in side or not is your choice.
Nice place,"It's very charming , and nicely keep t heritage and nearby market is very fantastic n well preserve the old charm"
Hawa mahal,I visited Jaipur and went to hawa mahal and found that it is Must visit place in jaipur .the view from top is fantastic
One of the previous historical sites in Jaipur,"Beautiful, gorgeous, tremendous the art off ancient times was on another level, I must say that.Whenever I got visit to Jaipur this place is always on my list."
"Great Architecture, View","Visited this and was told by most of locals that it has a better view from outside than really inside, but as a tourist you want to venture into everything and we did the same. Should have listened to locals, it is a great sight to see, click picture and admire the architecture."
Amazing Palace,This Is Truly Wonderful Place In Jaipur. This Beautiful pink structure is probably the most famous structure of Jaipur. The experience is very wondering.
Architectural marvel!,A very pleasing-to-the-eye building! The windows served as a look-out to the outside world for the ladies behind their veils.
Incredible,"Very nice & attractive placeOne of the historic place in Jaipur , at  night it looks more beautiful in lights but you can't go inside after 5 & 6 pm but in day time you can access this beautiful monument and explore it from inside too.. this place is a attraction of tourists.It has 953 windows on the outside walls.The honeycomb shaped and beautifully carved windows allow breeze to blow through the palace and makes it a perfect summer palace.. is one of the major attraction in Jaipur.. must visit highly recommend this place üòä"
Signature of Jaipur,Your visit to Jaipur is incomplete without visiting Hawa Mahal. Its a palace with more than 900 windows which make it airy and comfortable even in the scorching heat of Jaipur. It was built for the royal ladies who could sit and watch the activities of the town without being watched by others.
Interesting Architecture,"The Hawa Mahal is an interesting building located in the centre of Jaipur. The best views of this building are outside from the street. You can enter this building and get good views of Jaipur, however there is nothing overly exciting inside and if you‚Äôre on a budget or short of time I would avoid going in."
turism,good historical plac to visitbeutyamazingeasy to go cheep ticketsvery smart photos and viewsthanks
Quick Photo Opportunity ,"I couldn‚Äôt understand why all of the photos I saw of this palace (‚ÄòPalace of the Winds‚Äô) were all of the facade and there were none of the interior. Now that I‚Äôve visited I understand why. This ‚Äòpalace‚Äô is really a giant facade with just two floors of, fairly ordinary rooms,‚Ä¶"
Photo stop,One of the iconic places and most photographed palace in jaipur. Not sure whether you can get in. Most people just stand and take pictures from the road
Impressive facade,"This is where the women used to watch the parades without being seen. The facade is stunning, but it is not worth entering. A good photo can be got from the Tattoo cafe or Wind View cafe opposite."
You must see this incredible architectural masterpiece!,"This is an example of unique, beautiful Indian architecture.  Try to at least stop on the street and look at it!  It sounds like it is only one room deep - and that the real beauty is the exterior."
Beauty at its best!,"Could have the pleasure of a day and a night view of the Hawa Mahal and it‚Äôs just awesome and spellbinding. Did a lot of shopping in the market surrounding the attraction especially the Jaipuri jooti, my favourite and the cute Rajasthani puppets too."
Wind Palace ,"Hawa Mahal also known as Wind Palace is a gorgeous building in Jaipur, the pink city. It is easy to find in a busy place, worth checking out. Very photogenic"
Wondering place,Architecture of the building is very amazing it is really perfect place for visitors also foreigners
Windy Palace,An amazing place with amazing view. The view from across the road is fantabulous. It reminds you of the rich historical heritage of jaipur. A must visit place if you are in jaipur.
The whow ambiance,"Its one of the iconic heritage marvel and one of the most visited place in jaipur , the palace is well maintained and managed by authorities there is a entry ticket to visit the palace , its situated at the heart of the jaipur city and apart from hawa mahal you can find lots of various options available nearby to visit."
Everything was good but Jaipur police in the city ask for money,My 2 nd visit to Jaipur but still police man in the city stop for no reason ask for all documentation and I have shared but still they didn‚Äôt given my documents they given by when I have given Brie üòÇüòÇHawa hamal is very place to visit I have given 200 üò†üò†üò†üò†and don‚Äôt like the attitude of police against tourists ü§¨
"Symbol of Jaipur , every visitor of Jaipur pays a short visit ","This is the most known symbol of old Jaipur .was completed as the royal palace for the 4 queens of the king number 5 , in 1719 .the name derives from the 950 glass windows that were used to cool the palace by letting the wind go through."
Gorgeous Pink Facade,The front of the wind palace is a gorgeous pink color. It is best viewed in the morning between 10am and noon from the cafes directly across the street on the second/third floor. However you will have to purchase something from the cafe to enjoy the view. On an adjacent side‚Ä¶
Best Thing In Jaipur!,"The entrance is in a really nice courtyard where people take time to sit and chat. ¬£2 for entrance. It‚Äôs a bewitching place as you move from one level to another up gentle inclines there is always something to see (and photograph!), from coloured glass to tiny windows which give‚Ä¶"
A Feeling of Royalty And Medival Architecture,"Hawa Mahal  - The Synonym  For Pinkcity.  It will make you feel proud about the Royal culture and rich heritage of Rajasthan, Situated at the center of the city, it is the must visit if you are planning to visit  in near future "
Go to the cafe across the street,"It‚Äôs located in the middle of a crowded bazar which by the way you can find very good Indian clothes, there is a cafe in front of Hawa mahal where you can enjoy the beautiful view of Hawa mahal while having some coffee or food."
Beautiful and Pink,The structure is beautiful but unfortunately very difficult to photograph since it‚Äôs right on a busy street.  There are also lots of people selling unwanted things in the area.  I didn‚Äôt have time to go inside but would have loved to.  
One of the must place to go in Jaipur,I went to Hawa Mahal and it do not allow to get inside.  You could take picture outside and the best place is coffee shop on the opposite of Hawa Mahal in which you could get the good view and photo there.  This place is one of the must go while you are in Jaipur.
Art of piece,Hawa Mahal is a very amazing place for a tourist. Great for a amazing photos. It's very close to the pink city
Amazing ,Amazing and super romantic. Perfect spot for pictures. Very suggested to go inside. Beautiful view of the city from the top
Kya Baat Hai. iT'S MESMERISING,What a towering facet of this monument. It encompasses your sight and makes you feel that you are in it. A must for any body visiting this beautiful city.
Great views from the top,"I would say that the Hawa Mahal is Jaipur's most distinctive landmark, delicate honeycombed lattice towering 5 stories.  Built in 1799 so that the royal Ladies could view the town/street below.   The entrance is located in the back.    50 rupees for general admission/ about .70‚Ä¶"
Where is mahal,"Name is Hawa Mahal but there is no mahal. How is it a tourist spot, there is nothing to see inside. It is in the middle of a crowded market. Not worth a visit."
Hawa Mahal...An architectural marvel....Indeed Beautiful,"Visited this place on 2/2/20 ...Its in the tripolia bazar area of jaipur..Its an heritage marvel build by H.H.Sawai Pratap Singh Ji in 1799,having a  huge pink stone structure with numerous small windows, It does has a historic significance,build by the maharaja for his queens .‚Ä¶"
Drive by for a look,"Our guide stopped and we took some photos. Interesting historical place, the guide explained what it‚Äôs purpose was - there is nothing behind the lattice, it‚Äôs for the ladies of the court to be cool and not seen by the public. "
The Beehive,"When you visit the pink city of Jaipur,be ready to see many wonderful sights.  One, in particular, caught my attention because of its interesting shape, color and design. It's known as Hawa Mahal,The Palace of Winds and reminded me of a buzzing beehive.  Why a beehive you may‚Ä¶"
View from the front,"We crossed the road from the same side as the Hawa Mahal was on, turned around and saw the full front of this iconic building which made me gasp in awe. Although it is more terracotta in colour than pink."
Surprising gem on the side of the road,We walked through the Pink City and stumbled across this palace. Quite a find. Very well kept on the road side. The Maharaja watched the processions from the safety of his palace from up on high.
Fascinating visit,I would recommend a visit as it is rather beautiful with lots of nooks and crannies to explore.   Ladies note there seemed to be a separate queue for tickets which might just speed your entry even if you are travelling as a couple. Entry fee is 200 INR for foreigners. I would‚Ä¶
Visiting,A beautiful building to visit and it is worth visiting BUT it is in a very busy road and its best to try to cross the road to take photos from the other side. It‚Äôs also very pretty at night when its all lit up too. 
Hawa hawai! Its a place only in facade. ,Only one wall which is beautifully engraved. Its in the heart of the city.very good cafe opposite to hawa mahal.
Five minute tuck tuck photo stop. ,Looks nice but don't waste too much time here if you're on a short visit. This is a stop option on the tuck tuck day tour which I highly recommend. See one of my other reviews for the company we used.
Beautiful Palace on the busy street or ancient highway to City Palace,"Just took pictures on the outside building with the Tour Guide as it was already late in the evening but its beautiful and amazing. Lots of local shopping, if you wish on this street on both sides. Do bargain hard."
Hawa Mahal ,"Always had seen Hawa Mahal from the road side , went last week inside from backside. The view is much better . We hired local guy who explained about this Mahal. It is good and worth visit"
Hawa Mahal,I am absolutely shocked to see this magnificent Mahal. This was my first experience to see this beauty. The place is situated in a heart of the city
Attraction of Jaipur,"Hawa Mahal is iconic Architecture Monument of Jaipur, the Pink City. Its construction is beautiful with lot of intricate designs, windows and motifs. Made completely of red sand-stones. It offer a visual treat to tourists."
Truly the icon of Jaipur,"Hawa Mahal is truly the face and the icon of Jaipur. Situated amidst the hustle bustle of the market, this attraction can be enjoyed from the front and visited at the back side as well by paying an entry fee of 50 Rs per Indian tourists. The hawa mahal has around 5 floors to‚Ä¶"
Jaipuri Pinki style wall,You can reach here by taking bus or auto. Easily accessible from everywhere. It looks more beautiful in night. The crowd and market is in Jaipuri pink style. You can purchase from here beautiful attires. This is photographers place to click beautiful view from outside with‚Ä¶
Beautiful Wall Amidst the Hustle Bustle,This beautiful wall was constructed to give a view to the poor women of the palace who were trapped inside. I was lucky enough to get an inexplicable nighttime shot capturing the overwhelming shadow of one person praying.  Our tour guide and driver said that I captured a ghost. 
Interesting palace,"Take pictures from outside for sure, but do go inside, to the top and take a peek outside from many of the small windows that look out into the busy street down below."
Nice ornate facade. ,You can stop to view this very ornate facade. It's only a facade built by a king who had it built so that his royal females could view any events down below on the street through small holes in the facade so they couldn't be seen from the public outside. Worth a visit. 
Best place for photos.,"I have been to Hawa Mahal or ""Wind Palace"" umpteen times. What I like most is the terracotta pink colour. A must visit place for photographers,just in front of the palace cross the road are 2-3 cafeteria so just go their for a cup of coffee or tea and you can find some beautiful‚Ä¶"
Stunning at Night,We decided to visit this beautiful building at night. Glad we did as it really does the colours justice.  The street is bustling as everywhere is in an Indian city.  We took photos right there but then went to a rooftop cafe and had a drink and got the best view.
"‚ÄúThe Palace of Winds"" or ‚ÄúThe Palace of Breeze""","Visiting ‚ÄúThe Palace of Winds"" or ‚ÄúThe Palace of Breeze""(built in 1799) is worth it to enjoy unusual artistry with 953 windows with the intention of allowing royal ladies to observe everyday life without being seen. I have not seen such a site before. It was not crowded on our‚Ä¶"
Beautiful facade. ,Beautiful building. We didn‚Äôt go in. It really is lovely to look at. The king used to live here at some times of the year. The honeycombs are so his wife‚Äôs could look on to the street without been seen.  Very pretty. 
Nice art,Hawa mahal is very nice place for tourists in Jaipur. It's very good example of rajasthani art and craft. After 300 years it's still look like new. 
A Glorious Monument,"Do not be fooled, this us not a building.  It is merely a facade --- and a magnificent one --- attached to the palace, so the royal women could look out up-on the world and not be scene.  It is the signature site of Jaipur in the Old City.  If you are lucky, you will find snake‚Ä¶"
Historic,This place is historic the Hawa-Mahal as per the name its very windy in the high temperature of summers when we visited this place our guide told us that the so many windows are made for the queens of king Sawai pratap singh so his queens can see the festivals and the crowd‚Ä¶
A worthwhile short stop,"We just stopped along the road to see this and take photos and it‚Äôs definitely worthwhile if you‚Äôre already seeing sights in Jaipur, especially if you‚Äôre focusing on the history of the ‚Äúpink‚Äù In the pink city."
Worthless,"A very badly kept and maintained monument with nothing much to do or see, its visited only because there is nothing much to see in Jaipur. Rs. 50 is entry charge, but given its condition,i would not go again even for free. Skip if u cn,just hv a look frm outside."
Beautiful Building,Such a stunning building! The contrast of such a building popping up in such a crowded street makes this worth view from the outside even if you don‚Äôt go in... 
So beautiful win please..,Amazing place one of the my favorite place wind please this is very famous I was with my girlfriend she is crazy about this palace inside so so good but when you see outside it's so beautiful no one can compare to this palace ..
Visit,Architectural wonder but can be maintained better. Very crowded and trash all over. I only wish Indian government can take care of these places with very good care!!
Better on the outside,The view from the outside road is the impressive part of the building  Have dinner in the tattoo bar opposite
"Bit disappointing, basically an empty building.",We had imagined that the palaces and historic buildings we would see in India would be displayed in the way these things are in Europe and Australia.  With relevant inscriptions and descriptions of the rooms and the people who lived there.  Usually some relevant artefacts with‚Ä¶
Great for a nighttime photo ,"Great for a quick photo. I didn't go in myself. The reviews are mixed on that and I had limited time and a long list of things to see. That being said , if your in Jaipur you are almost obliged to at least give it a quick look"
A Standout Architectural Masterpiece of the Pink City,"The Hawa Mahal (aka The Palace of the Wind) was one of the most famous landmarks in Jaipur.  Highlights: While the internal structure of The Palace was mesmerizing, the external facade of the Hawa Mahal was the main attraction. There was not much to see from the outside, besides‚Ä¶"
Just a Facade,"Maybe we should have had a guide to explain more about this but, after all the hype, it was a bit disappointing. Maybe we missed the point."
Haha Mahal. ,"This you can just drive by slowly or get out and spend 5 minutes to take in the facade. It's where the princesses went to get a view of what was going on and not be seen, and it's only a few meters deep. There  is little behind it. It's very close to the pink city so do it with‚Ä¶"
See this in the morning to get the best photos,"The Palace of the wind is really just the front of a building as shown on the photo, I gather that you can go inside but but we didn't bother, instead we and across the road for a cuppa at one of the two restaurants plying for your business.  Ideally see this first thing in the‚Ä¶"
Wow palace,"This is the most famous touristic point in Jaipur. The pink windows are really nice, but inside it is even better. I really recommend you to go inside. "
Spend an hour here,Your taxi driver will not allow you to spend time here. It's a place to spend 45 to 50 minutes atleast.
Great Experience with Hawa mahal & jaipur weather also.,I am particularly shocked about the magnificence and looks of this Mahal. This was my first experience to see an illustrious mahal. The Mahal is comprised of Red and Pink sandstones which give a decent look to the building. I prescribes all of you to visit this Hawa mahal in the‚Ä¶
get there early,"The earlier you are there, the less others tourists are there and that also means less street vendors and beggars. As it is only a facade, one quick picture across a very busy street and that's it."
As Name Suggests,It's in the middle of one of the busiest shopping streets in the Jaipur. After your visit at Hawa Mahal you can go for shopping. For enjoying the full beauty of the place I recommend to visit the place at night. After the lightings it's more beautiful than day time.
Hawa Mahal,Amazing place and was a wonderful experience. My kids were very happy visiting the place. The place is situated in heart of the city Jaipur. 
Beautiful architecture from Outside,"Hawal Mahal is in the busy street with shops area. You need to be too early to get a clear pics of the monuments from outside or it should be on holiday. Inside Hawa Mahal, it has narrow passages resulting in too much crowd and it is advisable to avoid this place by elders /‚Ä¶"
one of the best,Want to see how queens and female relatives of king and his family see the functions of jaipur then go to this place.  it is still looks like someone watching you from the window of this palace.
Visit,For indian nationality adult ticket is 50 rs per person.5 years old kids are free.and students id get have discount for entry tickets.
Get a combo ticket,Good and one of the must do places in Jaipur. Get a combo ticket which allows access to 6-7 other good sites  A audio guide seemed worth but the information isn't that great but still not bad to get one  There place is maintained well and is definitely worth a visit
An architectural marvel,"Hawa Mahal is located amidst a busy market. There is no parking available near it. It is located about 15 minutes walking distance from City Palace - another famous attraction. My brother had visited Hawa Mahal and said there is nothing much to see inside. So, I decided to just‚Ä¶"
Excellent architecture,Marvelous architecture. Awesome views. Easy access. No parking nearby. Easier to engage local transportation to reach the place. 
Hawa Mahal visit,"Hawa Mahal or the Palace of Wind is located in Jaipur(the pink city), in the Indian state of Rajsthan.   Made with the red and pink sandstone, the palace sits on the edge of the City Palace, Jaipur, and extends to the Zenana, or women's chambers. The structure was built in 1799‚Ä¶"
Honeycomb facade,We strolled to the Hawa Mahal from the Laxmi Mishthan Bhandaar. The Mahal is in the shape of Lord Krishna's crown. It's jharokhas (windows) on its decorated facade. Do note that it's almost impossible to find this place sans people.  We chose not to go inside though.
Very attractive architecture,"What makes this palace so eye-catching is the lacy ornamental facade accented by delicate latticework and honeycomb windows. If you want to get some nice pictures, go  early in the morning when there are not too many people and not so much traffic. We did not go inside so not‚Ä¶"
As crowded as the roads ,"Hawa Mahal is a must see in Jaipur, but be ready to be packed in to get a view from its highest point.  It you want an equally spectacular view and still be close to Hawa Mahal, enjoy dinner and a drink across the road at the Tattoo Cafe and Lounge."
A marvelous Palace,"This is a very beautiful and worth watching Palace in Rajastan, incredible handmade work by craftsmen of exceptional finesse and richness"
Great place,Spectacular view had a great time with family. Architecture of the place is amazing but being in city it was a long journey.
A Must See,On our city tour we stopped to admire this icon of Jaipur.  In our four day stay we seemed to always be driving by.  It does not disappoint.
Only click photo from outside,It's a good place to click photo. Not recommend to go inside and waste time.  You can try the local food they provide near to mall.  Spend more time at jantar mandatharam instead
Super experience and worth visiting ,Nice Palace where the royals used to peep from to see their ordinary subjects. Lovely 5 storey building. 
Just another building on the road,"Don't quite know what the whole hype really is about this place....just another structure on the road. In fact, if the driver doesn't tell you, chances are you will not even notice it."
"Nice place, elderly and folks with knee problems avoid","It is a nice historic site attached to the Hawa Mahal Road. You should start by clicking pictures from across the street.  Once done cross the street again, you have to go around the property to buy entry ticket. It costs Rs. 50 per person. You can also opt for audio guide by‚Ä¶"
Hawa Mahal,"Beautiful building located on a busy street with difficult access, limited parking. Worth stopping to get a picture. Many shops in the area with Indian products - shoes dresses foods"
Really hawa mahal,It is a real hawa Mahal as it is look like standing in the sky as it is very high .It's design is amazing .i loved it
Beautiful,"Very beautiful place but very poorly maintained. We visited at a time when it was the peak season time for travel. This could have made things worse for us, the place is not well run, people are not very nice. The staff and security who are supposed to help you do not care. ‚Ä¶"
Tour,The iconic image of Jaipur. Even from the outside it is impressive. Looks great in the evening. A great shopping strip as well
Nothing to see interior,"Not sure why this site / building is must see in Jaipur. At least the exterior of the building has an interesting/unusual structure but interior it is nothing special. Just space and stairs, packed with Indian visitors."
Not tourist-friendly at all,"We visited Hawa Mahal with a lot of hope and anticipation. The first let-down was the one, single-window and long queue/wait of nearly 40 minutes to buy entry-tickets. The  beautiful frontage/courtyard has been defiled by vendors, eateries and shops. There are no guides readily‚Ä¶"
Interesting but underwhelming ,"For those of us who have grown up learning about Hawa Mahal with the picture of its iconic facade, the reality is a bit underwhelming. The facade, though, is a beautiful sight at night when it is lit up in its full glory.  The narrow passageways tend to result in ‚Äúpedestrian‚Ä¶"
No photo face,"It's right on a road side, which is a very busy street. Extremely worthless ticket fare as well. Price should reduce. "
Fairytale and beautiful ,"The balcony is beautiful from both sides. You need to visit inside to see the balcony and get the view the royal ladies had of the festivities from here. There‚Äôs also a small collection of statues celebrating music and dance. From the windows you get far vistas of Jaipur too. You can spot the Victory tower, Jantar Mantar and the city palace. When you‚Äôre done make sure to go yo the frontside to see the stunning architecture from the street. Going to one of the rooftop cafes is an option."
Beautiful architecture,I saw it from outside and it was looking was very beautiful . It is huge and good . Was not having enough time to visit here properly but will surely visit next time when I am in Jaipur
Impressive architecture,"After learning about it in school decades ago, it was great to see Hawa Mahal in person! Impressive architecture. You get great pictures from Tattoo cafe opposite The Mahal‚Äôs main entrance. We didn‚Äôt get a guide as it was nice to wander around at our own pace."
shopping view only,"its just a wall with small windows, in the middle of the shopping area, u can go & see it ...take a pic and do your shopping, u should enquire abt item in 3 or 4 shops and buy , if they say, Rs.100... start your bargain with Rs.20/-, simply we are in trap, on their lucky day...if we are booked"
Not that exciting as it was in history books,"I had lot of expectation when I started to this place, But when I reached there I could see that the mahal is on the main road with the entrance not marked. No where there was proper guidance. I personally feel that guests can skip this and visit jal mahal and amber fort. People who wants to shop can visit this place since there are lots of shops near by."
Too much traffic,"The architecture of palace is worth watching. However, there is tremendous traffic outside and roads are narrow. Nothing much to see inside."
Amazing front side,It is not able to took pic ...situated in main road ...not able to cover the  area picture ...it is situated in busy street....
Wonderful architecture,"What an interesting and historical building. Built for the many wives of the Maharaja, so that they could all look out onto the street, without being seen themselves"
Facade only ,The palace of the winds is highly touted in guide books. It is nice but a single portion of the palace in a somewhat run down portion of the old city. It is really only a facade and about a ten minute stop. If you are in Jaipur it is worth seeing but I would not go there just to see it.
Impressive Beauty,"Hard to believe the Palace of the Winds sits on a busy street in Jaipur.  Impressive Structure with amazing beauty.Hawa Mahal is a palace in Jaipur, India. Made with the red and pink sandstone, the palace sits on the edge of the City Palace, Jaipur, and extends to the Zenana, or women's chambers. The structure was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, who was the founder of Jaipur.Worth a visit even if only a short time in front."
Just from outside,It‚Äôs a beautiful palace... but the beauty is only from outside. Make sure you carry a selfie stick for a full photo view. The best time to visit is dusk. Pictures during day and night are totally different.
City's Icon,"That visible building that looks enormous, it is really not real. But it is a tourist destination. Thousands, if not millions flock here to see this place. There are many things to see in Jaipur. This is a must see. The place is declared by UNESCO as world heritage site. The‚Ä¶"
Hawa mahal,Our driver told us not to visit Hawa Mahal n just had a glance from outside..we as a traveler believed him.but in the last day of our Jaipur trip we visited it n believe me it's just amazing..every1 visiting jaipur should enter at hawa Mahal otherwise u'll miss something really‚Ä¶
Iconic place of Jaipur not to be missed,Hawa Mahal must be one of the signature places when you talk about Jaipur. Do not think that you would ever want to miss Hawa Mahal. The palace is like a Jharoka for the erstwhile ladies of the royal family to see the proceedings on the road. Even now the busy main road with‚Ä¶
ANCIENITY,Since years of years hawa mahal is situated in chandpole Jaipur Rajasthan India .  Great place for visiters.
Better looking from outside than inside,"The fort has interesting history. However, it is prettier to look from outside than inside. I assume in summer it is more fascinating since it keeps the rooms cold. In general most of it seems to need reconstruction. "
Hawa Mahal,"Hawa Mahal, is palace of winds in walled city of Jaipur. The structure was built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the grandson of Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh, who was the founder of Jaipur. Its unique five floors exterior is akin to the honeycomb of a beehive with its 953‚Ä¶"
Wonder on the busiest street of Jaipur,"When you will be going through the busiest street, you wont believe that you will find Hawa Mahal thereüòÅ. Entry fees is ‚Çπ50.   It will take you around an hour or so to explore and click amazing photos. Its a wind palace and we were there last week so it was a cold breeze all‚Ä¶"
Beautiful construction ,"Beautiful construction but beware of local guides, surrounding area is full of local items you need to bargain a lot. Must try kachori Kadhi just outside of Hawa Mahal on road side stall. "
Full of airüòÅüòÅ...,One of the most beautiful ancient architect i have ever seen....at the top of the building u can see the whole city...and that is the best feeling....i had gone with my freinds...and really such a great place
One stop,"Dusty, dirty, noisy street full of begging children. Interesting architecture but not renovated at all."
Stopped outside to take photos.,Cannot say much more than what we saw from the street. Its a difficult place to stop at being on a busy dual carriageway. 
Crown of Jaipur,"This place is situated near to the main road, which is very crowded,easily accessible by public transportation, .It is known as crown of Jaipur city, very famous monument"
A must watch in Jaipur,This would be the first place I‚Äôd recommend to see in Jaipur. This spectacular architecture literally takes breaths away!
"Hawa Mahal , Jaipur - Face of the City .","Situated at Pink City of Jaipur, Hawa Mahal was built in 1799. It has approximately 955 windows on the outside walls. The honeycomb shaped and beautifully carved windows allow breeze to blow through the palace and makes it a perfect summer palace.   Exterior is richly decorated,‚Ä¶"
Best viewed from  outside,The Palace of Wind has a magnificent facade which is best viewed from a distance - although the best place is the adjacent main road and busy market. This facade was built to allow the women of the royal court to watch (from the many windows) parades and other outdoor events in‚Ä¶
Marvellous design,Most of the day tour operators wouldn't take you inside hawa mahal. But I would recommend to visit it from inside. It's worth it. Especially to see how the walls and windows are designed. Actually these designs can be used in modern structures to provide ventilation. Also the‚Ä¶
Beautiful structure but ill maintained ,"The structure, as you might have already seen in photos, is magnificent. However it's actual appearance is so so shabby and disappointing!! Covered with multiple layers of dust and with not even slightest sign of maintainance it's a pity that Government is not taking any action‚Ä¶"
Beautiful facade,"Hawa Mahal or ""The Palace of Winds"" in English was a palace of the Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh of Jaipur and included quarters for ladies, which is the most notable part of the palace. The facade is a very distinctive multi-storey windows of intricate lattice work that extends‚Ä¶"
Beautiful fresco windos,A beautiful.monument on the main road .... one cannot visit it from within as its beauty possibly is only appreciated with the external fresco.  The govt could do more to revive this structure to its former glory 
Pride of Jaipur ruined by shameless government,"Hawa mahal is synonymous with Jaipur but alas! The heritage monument is totally ruined by the apathy of shameless government. Full with dust, has turned black, full heavy traffic allowed right in front, countless shops opened right on the monument itself, dust and pollution at the peak... What a disappointment, in fact i felt so sad I left from the place immediately. And not to forget the greedy and rude cafe shops across the street, desperately wanting you to buy eatables from their cafe before you could click pictures of Hawa Mahal (don't go to the wind cafe, shameless and rude guys sitting on the stairs leading to their cafe confronting tourists)"
"""The Palace of Winds""",Another spectacular place not to be missed. We really enjoyed the place and its more scenic from the side where you can see the coves small windows. its in the middle of a buzzing market place and there is lot of shops around this place. One can enjoy a drink in front of the palace and enjoy the view. Must visit.
The Palace of Wind.,The building's have on of the best architecture. There are approx. 953 jharokhas in this building that makes it so beautiful that you can't resist yourself by click pictures or selfies. There are two side of hawa mahal one is the back and second one is inside it. The back part is what you will see the jharokhas and building structure and also there are cafes opposite to building you can eat and enjoy the view.
magnificent structure,"Do not skip visiting it from inside. Well maintained. A note: box office is hardly visible, and do count your money. I think it is always good to have exact cash"
Best to visit from outside,The most of the tourist don't go inside best to be enjoyed the beauty of it from the front cafes. ...
Amazing facade,"The facade of this building is incredible with all of its intircate detail. It was so amazing we saw it twice. Well worth a look, even if you can't go inside and have to put up with the pushy touts at the street bazaar that runs outside it."
very beautiful place,The place was very beautiful and the guards were very kind and helpful looking so amazing place with the history
Blah,"it‚Äôs just pretty on the photos. It‚Äôs really just the facade that is very popular but when you come and see it it‚Äôs not special at all. Worn out and dirty. I‚Äôd suggest you come visit it at night where there‚Äôs light on it, makes it look better but be careful in general. Could‚Äôve‚Ä¶"
Hawamahal ,Beautiful from outside only but nothing inside.. People waste time and money to climb stairs whereas it's beautiful look is from outside only. Best view from opposite road. 
Expensive ,The building is nice but the cost of the entrance is between 2000 and 3500 rupees. The museums are an additional 700rupees. Since this is the main attraction of Jaipur they take advantage of it.
Lovely place,What a delightful place. Amazing energy and treat to the eye. This place is a must for a traveller to visit at least once if not several times.
Must not miss this attraction,It looks awesome from outside. Inside view is also good. you can see Ariel view of nearby jantar mantar
"Nice architecture, one can see it only from a distance ,no entry.","Hawa Mahal has a very unique architecture with lots of small holes ,to give light and  ventilation and keep the palace cool during hot summer days.It was a resting place for the Queens.One can see it only from a distance as there are kind of barricades around it."
The Famous Hawa Mahal,This monument needs no introduction. This beautiful pink structure is probably the most famous structure of Jaipur. Its built with pink stone and looks beautiful with its unique architecture.This place is located on a very crowded street full of hustle bustle near city palace. you can get good view only in early morning hours when traffic is less. in the night its lit with lighting and looks beautiful.The entry to this place is against tickets which can be purchased from the counter. no one forgets to get clicked against this beautiful building.
"Elegant and functional architecture,  a must see in Jaipur.","This palace of winds palace was built for the royal ladies, a safe harbour.  Intricately designed windows allowed them to watch daily life without being visible to the public.It's basically a tall screen wall built of pink and red sandstone. Unique. Beautifully decorated  facade that resembles a honeycomb.  In my option,  the best view is from the cafe across the street.  If you're not in a rush, bypass  the curio shops and climb the stairs to the cafe (go to the very top).  Be still, and soak in the view.Last tip....be mindful of the best time for pics."
Drop by,"We didn‚Äôt go in, as per what we saw in other reviews. But the building is amazing and worth visiting, even if just from the outside."
Nice building,"We did not go in to this building, however, was beautiful from outside.  Intricate architecture - certainly worth dropping by."
Holiday of a lifetime,We visited the Hawa Mahal or Palace of Winds as part of our India tour it is a beautiful building in the shape of a crown. Jaipur is known as the Pink City
Beautiful Architecture ,For the best view you need to visit the cafe‚Äôs opposite the building which are up some steep stone steps Well worth the climb.  The architecture is so intricate but the busy road in front deflects some of it‚Äôs beauty. Well worth the visit.
Amazing place ,Really nice building in city of Jaipur.  Good art and strongly.  One of feamus place in Jaipur. Really good and great place... 
Foreign tourists should avoid brown ‚Äòpalace‚Äô,"Not only do foreign tourists get charged four times as much to enter the ‚Äòpalace‚Äô as Indian nationals. The people at the ticket booth refused to give us our change, charging us an additional 100rs.   In a country where you are scammed every second of every day for being a‚Ä¶"
Beautiful building ,Really nice building from the outside as well as from the inside! Also go to one of the coffee places across the street for an even better view!
We visited hawa mahal as a couple,"The place is not as nice as the buzz about it, but it is good if you want your pictures clicked.the place is in centre of city, so it is easily approachable, but beaware of the traffic."
Beautiful,"The building is beautifully constructed. It looks nice from outside, but nothing to see from inside. Too much crowd and traffic on road."
Can only see from outside,"It was built for the king‚Äôs wives to see him on the other side of the street. Just a quick photo on the street. No point to go in, since there‚Äôs nothing inside."
Worth one,"It's good place to reach easily, i have taken  300rs ticket from the Alberto Museum itself, so it was easy to get in"
Beautiful architecture,The best time to visit is early morning as this place is always packed with tourists. Being on the main road it's packed. The architecture of it was very beautiful and intricate. The inside of the Mahal is nice. Although people say it's not worth going inside but I went inside‚Ä¶
Visit,"We didn't go inside only drove by,  but what a stunning building. Not just in the day time, looks stunning on a night.  "
To be seen,We just walked past. Took some photos and we left.  To many people trying to sell you anything - its overwhelming and tiring. 
Special site,"Essentially a series of viewing Windows for royal women to view celebrations below whilst remaining out of sight, this is a fantastic facade and well worth spending time photographing. Care - the street is very busy."
Known as the Palace of the Winds,"Erected circa 1799 by Sawai Pratap Singh. Very ornate facade. For the ladies of the harem to peer out of! 5 storeys high, one room deep. You can pay to enter (around 180 rupees each) but we went round the street side to photograph."
Special,"Important building, built so women could view street without being seen. The front is just a facade nothing at the back.Good view at street level but you can get a better view from terrace of restaurant opposite."
Great place to visit in Jaipur,"It's really a great place to visit, nice view of and from inside and outside. I loved this place the most in Jaipur. If you are in Jaipur, must visit here. "
Masterpiece,"An architectural masterpiece with history. It does not require much time, but it is of interest. Must visit."
really palace of wind,"many windows in one tower look too beautiful .as this monument also has too many windows in,  it looks too beautiful   and the amazing also .hawa mahal is  one of the   best places for enjoyment place"
Ancient Monument,This is one of an ancient monument built in 1799 and renovated in 2006. The architectural feature allows cool air from the Venturi effect to pass through the structure which makes the whole area more pleasant during high temperatures in summer. This is why it is named as Hawa‚Ä¶

Overhyped,This is an overhyped place. It is shown as if it is a big palace but it is a simple building. Avoid.
Too much crowded,"Being one of the main attractions of Jaipur, the place is crowded by tourists. Heavy traffic adds to the frustration. But the place is worth seeing because of its architectural beauty. "
Classic Pink City,"Photographers get ready--it's tough to get a good shot of the Hawa Mahal in daytime or at night.  Lots of tourists, lots of traffic, but definitely worth seeing this iconic structure. I had the best luck at photographing it at night from a rooftop bar across the street.  It's‚Ä¶"
A casual visit to the main attraction of Jaipur ,Beware as this place is packed with tourist at all times.  The best time to visit would be early in the morning as the place would be less packed. The place is definitely beautiful but don‚Äôt even bother going into the Mahal because it‚Äôs empty inside and nothing much to see. The‚Ä¶
Windy it is,Excellent architecture and concept...was amazed to see this monument. Very well maintained. Definitely worth a visit
Tourist icon of Jaipur,This photo opportunity is in the old town. You can enter this place but mostly tourists take photo outside Hawa Mahal.  You see Hawa Mahal as tourist symbol of Jaipur. Royal ladies were under veil. Hawa mahal has shape of crown of Lord Krishna. There are small windows known as‚Ä¶
A must not miss in busy Jaipur,A definite not miss but ensure you have a guide to provide the background! Lovely place and stunning at night- good photo ! 
Good photo opportunity ,You can't go in and have to stop outside on a very busy street to get your photo opportunity but it is worth it. Watch out for beggers who get their kids to cling to you when you stop for a pic and then demand you pay them for the kids being in the pic.
Beautiful architectyral experience,"The palace of winds or Hawa Mahal is kind of a symbol of Jaipur. If you get in there with a guide, you will understand why it's called like that and what it was build for. Defenetley worth to visit!"
Very interesting,Interesting place to visit.  Nice historic palace  overlooking street market. Interesting architecture and good views overlooking court yard
Just wonderful,Don't hesitate. Go!!!   And then have a drink and/or a snack opposite in one if the caf√©s. Best views.
Beautiful architecture ,"I took a day tour with Royal Majestic Tours. The guide, Mukesh was truly excellent. Our first stop was at the beautiful Hawa Mahal - a truly impressive building with lots of windows. The history of the building is very interesting."
Hawa Mahal photo stop,Hawa Mahal dates to 1799 when it was constructed for Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh as part of the women‚Äôs section of the City Palace. There are purported to be 953 windows in the lace like structure of the fa√ßade which was designed to allow the women of the royal court to watch activities in the street streets unobserved behind the latticework. beautiful structure in hues of red and pink.
Hawa Mahal the best place in jaipur ,"It was my first  visit  to this city , this is symbol of jaipur. It look more beautiful  at evening  time "
Day Visit to Hawa Mahal,This place looks beautiful from both inside and outside. It looks stunning from outside at night. This is a must visit place in Jaipur
very interesting piece of architecture,it was built in 1799. the original intention of the palace was to allow royal ladies to observe everyday life in the street below without being seen.hawa mahal is great .really liked
Stunning ,The Hawa Mahal was built to allow royal household ladies watch the world and processions etc watch the world go by without being seen. Now just a facade but you can climb right up to the fifth floor and have fantastic views over a Jaipur. A must see ! 
Hard to see it all from the street,This is hard to view and appreciate from street level so it is best to get access at a higher floor from a cafe opposite.
Stunning architecture,"We were told that the interior was just ok, so we stopped breifly for a photo. Absolutely beautiful architecture. A little crowded on a busy street, so be patient for your photos. There are cobra snake charmers on the sidewalk across the street for additional photo opportunities, at a small cost of course. Worth the stop."
enjoyable visit !,"We loved our visit to the Hawa Mahal in Jaipur.  We were advised to go early and get a view of the facade from the multi-level coffee shops across the street which we did.  These places were already teaming with people when we arrived but we still were able to manage unobstructive shots of the facade which was nice.  We were advised there was nothing worthwhile to look at inside the palace, however we decided to go anyway and we're glad we did.  We found a multi-layered building with amazing shots of the facade from the rear and the grounds in general which we loved.  I would advise purchasing a multi-stop pass so you can tour all the palaces in one inclusive price.  It's best ot park near the City Palace and walk 5-10 min. to reach Hawa Mahal."
Jaipur diaries,Hawa Mahal looks fabulous from outside.one must go inside and climb to the top.there is a ramp so climbing is easy.the view from all angles is amazing
Worth a look,Beautiful building front. Definatly worth 10 mins of your time to tick of the Checklist. It is in front of a busy road and hard to park.
Architecture at it's best,Having seen pictures of this before I traveled I did not expect it to be on a busy street. For best pictures you need to cross to the opposite side.
Stunning,"This is a stunning piece of architecture, the area around it is busy and bustling and you really do not have enough eyes to see it all! Cross the road to see this at its best. A gentleman on one of the stalls offered to let us to go on his roof ,( free of charge he said) to see‚Ä¶"
Wonderful architecture ,The architecture of this place is absolutely beautiful! Totally recommend to stop at least to admire the beauty of the building.
Architectural masterpiece ,"A great architecture in the old city of Jaipur,a part of Jaipur city palace . The road leading to the location is congested and better place to get complete view of the building is from the opposite road or best is from a rooftop restaurant in some of the old buildings opposite‚Ä¶"
Wow,Jaipur is great beautiful city I love it.its called pink city .and when I saw hawa mahal its amaze me such a beautiful and love the art work there .its built with pink stone and great feelings here
great architecture,well for starters... i was not expecting this heritage classic to be found on a busy street .. the government should at least ensure that there are no hawkers or peddlers below this majestic structure .. absolutely awesome experience but somewhat subdued in real life than in‚Ä¶
Busy but interesting,"Enjoyed the quirky details of the structure, fantastic view points of the city and the fort. Can be very busy. "
Good Architecture,"Hawa Mahal architecture is great with winds flowing from all side. The only thing i sould suggest/ask people visiting is to maintain decorum , when we visited some of the crowds were nosiy. "
Impressive facade,Really impressive facade! Difficult to get good photos of without other people or cars in it though.
Hawa Mahal,Exterior is more impressive than interior but still it‚Äôs a must see! You can purchase the combo ticket for 1000 INR here and make your way to the other places from here. 
Interesting Structure,"The structure was interesting, but not so amazing. It is in the middle of a very crowded street, filled with lots of peddlers trying very aggressively to sell you things. No need to get out of the car... snap photos as you pass."
Fantastic Trip,this was the best trip i have ever been to. The guide was very humble and polite. Had a mind boggling experience on the entire trip of jaipur. A must visit place foe all ppl. Excellent service. Thanks for this wonderful experience.
Heart of Pink City,This is the main place which named the city Pink city. One must roam around the whole place to unearth mystries and histories.
Iconic structure in Jaipur,Hawa Mahal is situated in middle of busy street.   Visit during night to see the lighted hawa Mahal. It's near to city palace.
Beautiful enough ,"Price for foreigners is $700 rupees per person the basic ticket, for what we see was good enough, there was another tickets with special rooms you can entered but where to expensive very big difference between the basic and something with more things available.

Must visit at night. With beautiful lighting,This is a must visit place in Jaipur.. it looks beautiful at night.. Lot of shopping area near hawa Mahal 
Palace of Winds!,"Hawa mahal, with 953 windows was built so that royal ladies could observe everyday street life without been seen. It is shaped like lord Krishna's crown and is the world tallest building without a foundation! Its located beside one of the busy streets so watch your back when you‚Ä¶"
Must see,"Another place to see when in Jaipur is palace of winds... made for the royal ladies to observe the every day life and festivals below... as they were not allowed to be seen in public, as they had to obey the strict rule of purdah and not be seen without their face covered. ‚Ä¶"
Jaipur trip,"Very nice architectural property. Amazing to see such property constructed showing the level if technology at that time. Parking is an issue,as area is too much crowded "
Amazing view,Go to the roof top place just in front to capture at night . There is good cafe also here . The lightings make it look marvelous.
Lovely to see - from the street,Iconic facade but only interesting feature is really from the street level as inside extremely plain.
For the royal ladies,"This beehive shaped palace was built as an extension of the zenana (ladies quarters) of the city palace so that the royal women could watch life below without being seen.

beautiful facade with interesting story,"This was a place where the royal women could go to watch the street scenes without being seen themselves. Go in the morning when the sun is on it. You can only really see the outside, but it is really beautiful."
Must see.,Must see especially at night when the monument is beautifully light up. The facade is gorgeous. The entire area is bustling with activity.
Architecture at its Best,All I can say is you need to be standing in front of it to appreciate its beauty. Head across to The Tattoo Cafe & Lounge for perfect shots of Taj Mahal
Beautiful ,We didn‚Äôt go inside but instead went to one of the cafes across the road to admire this beautiful building.
amazing building,"we could only view this building from the outside, its situated on a very busy road but definitely worth a look."
Rajput Architecture wonder,This monument is an architectural wonder once you start exploring. The entire monument has not used cement but some mysterious mix of ingredient... symbol of Jaipur
View of Hawa Mahal,The visit to Hawa Mahal was interesting.The intricate stone carvings of theMahal is worth-seeing. The Mahal looksnice with the lights in the night. Overall theplace is worth-visiting.
Beautiful Monument,"The Hawa Mahal is an impressive facade. Guides are available if you want. However, considering the steep steps inside, I will not recommend this for elderly people."
Culture ,Nice decor of wind place .  Example of great artuculture ...enjoy with my team ..all were very happy with art of india
