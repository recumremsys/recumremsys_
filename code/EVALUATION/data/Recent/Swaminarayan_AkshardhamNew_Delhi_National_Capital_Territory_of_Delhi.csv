Indian god temple,Beautiful architecture temple so deeply explained about swaminarayan bhagavan story.must visit place
Beautiful buildings but manic entrance,"Akshardham is set of stunning located on the outskirts of Delhi. Whilst once inside there is a large amount of stunning architecture, to enter there are long queues and you have to hand over your mobile phone and overall it was a stressful process. Try and visit when it is as quiet as possible."

Good ,Good people lovely place u can enjoy every moment if u are here .....u can see sunshine and sunset from here every thing is very helpful
No photo inside,This is one of the most amazing places I‚Äôve visited. You have to see it to believe it. I understand the logic behind not taking photos inside the mandir but think you should be allowed to take photos of the buildings from outside. Real craftmanship is still alive!
Visit to incredible akshardham,I visited akshardham during winters and trust me it is incredible .Totally worthful monument to watch when you visit Delhi .It architectural work is amazing and so beautiful.It has various activities to offer and have wonderful views to encapture.i loved akshardham's canteen.
Grand Temple,"Akshardham means divine abode of God.The temple is attributed to Swamy Narayon (1781-1830) . The centre of attraction the complex is Temple built on huge compound . It is 141 feet high ,316feet wide and 356 feet long .The temple has nine domes .The whole temple is designed on the basis of ancient and nedieval bastu shastra of India. Its an wonder that no ferrus metal is used in the construction .There deities are installed and thousands are depicted by bas or relief work.Beside the temple there are play exibition ,light and Sound laser show and boat ride .It is mesmerizing to watch laser show . From the entry authority has good management system. No mobile ,food or water is allowed . Inside complex there is food corner and photograph facility."
Massive and spiritual place,"Massive and spiritual place , I went with my guide, they said you need to remove you shoe and keep wallet in locker, it was painful job for us but, when we went inside the temple area, i feel that, it is awesome place."
Doesn't even feel like a real temple,"This place is so overly commercialized you can barely worship or do anything without spending $$ for no reason. Everything has a hidden ""fee"" associated with it. There are so many checkpoints and bizarre rules that make it a time-consuming and unenjoyable experience. Personally, I despise the old-school ""below the knee"" rule mostly because they use this rule even on the young children and have harsher enforcement on the women/girls especially. My father wore shorts that were shorter than knee length and they let him in, no issue. But when I wore a dress that was only slightly above knee length they created a huge fuss, pulling me aside, having a conversation for no reason with me, forcing me to wear a brightly colored crappy piece of fabric that they proceeded to charge me Rs. 100 for. A place of worship should not disallow anyone who is pious to worship in peace, unless they're truly doing something unacceptable like attempting to get into the temple naked. But commercializing God and harassing women seems to be the only thing this ""temple"" seems to be doing. You're honestly better off visiting your local temple or something. The whole dress code debacle soured my entire experience. Would not recommend unless you like upholding the patriarchy for some reason and lining the pockets of those who run the temple as a business rather than a place of worship."
Akshardham Temple visited through Trip India Pvt Ltd,"Great Place to see inside the Temple, first we enter to temple without own personal bags, we have putted in lockroom, it was free. after that entered to the great place ."
Darshan,Amazing place to visit for peace and serenity. A must go place. Great architecture great design. Really a heavenly place
Put on your itinerary,"A place worth visiting, and you can wander here for half a day. The whole complex is surrounded by beautiful garden, that harmonizes with the magnificent architecture of the temple.The photos are not allowed inside, thus you'll have to put your phone or camera into a locker at the entrance."
Peaceful,a peaceful and memorable place but only one problem after enter the temple you cant use mobile or camera for 3 to 4 hours but was really relaxing  moment you forget everything in this beauly
Swaminarayan Akshardham Temple,"The Akshardham Temple is known for its stunning architecture. It has eight ostentatiously carved mandapams while timeless Hindu teachings and flamboyant devotional traditions find their place on the temple's walls.Akshardham complex is home to India's largest step well which is a host to the mesmerising water show; an open garden, Narayan Sarovar, various expeditions, and rituals. The complex is not less than a paradise for spiritual seekers."
beautifull temple,the most beautiful temple i ever seen in my life. thanks to my tour gude vishnu to took me here. very beautiful
Dont miss it,"Superb and beautifully designed and knowledgeable, Book for whole day , reach early to skip the lines."
Way to Delhi,I have to go New Delhi with my friends who are from different states of india. I had booked trip on TAXIBAZAAR and it was quite satisfied with travelling charge. The car was comfortable.
Amazing temple,It is shocking to know that this temple was recently built. It has all the historical charm of a century old temple. Very well managed and the open space lets you enjoy the beautiful weather.
Wonderful waterfall show,"In swaminarayan akshardham temple located on the border of ghaziabad, the best thing is the waterfall show it narrates wonderful stories. Incredible !!"
Establish with Supreme,The best place where you feel connection with supreme and best things is that boat ride where you go through water viewing things and knowing things you have never seen in your life
A must place to visit in your life time,"Musical fountain show & neelkanth yatra darshan on gaint screen was awesome.... clicking photo inside the whole temple is not allowed, anyhow for generating money they have their own photographer 100 rs per picture..overall neat & clean posh Temple."
Blessed,We Me  and my wife fortunate to have glimpse of Swami Narayan ji so nicely maintained by temple staff peaceful want's to visit again and again.
Simply WOW,"just WOW! Amazing architecture and crafting. The detailing to every single piece, not just the displays, but the wall, ceiling to floor tiles are to be admired."
THE HINDU TEMPLE,"Akshatdham temple is located in New Delhi.It is one of the largest Hindu temple in India and also called Swami narayan akshardham temple because it has been made in the memory of Jyotidhar Swaminarayan bhagwan.It is surrounded by Narayan sarovar and spread over 83342 square feet area.The temple has 11 feet high beautiful statue of Lakshmi narayan and other statues of Shiva,Parvati Radhakrishna and Sita ram are also there."
"Great temple, Divine place",Very good visit to this temple. Need a little more information points and details to be setup about the timing. Takes a fair bit of walking so one must be prepared for the same.
Remarkable place,Had not planned to come here during my trip to Delhi but was recommended to come by a friend. Loved it.
Modern Marvel,"Akshardham temple in new delhi is a modern engineering marvel with its impressive architecture, and divine atmosphere that reflects in its interior. It built entirely with rajasthani pink sandstone and italian marble at some places.It is truly a divine abode of God. Inside temple complex there are various exhibition halls which provide information on Lord Swaminarayan. Mandir consists of carved pillar, domes, murtis of swamis and more than 100 elephant sculpture.Musical fountain and beautiful garden inside the temple complex is also worth visiting. 3 to 4 hours needed to see the entire temple complex."
Take ample time,"From parking to leave the complex cool 4-5 hours or even more time is required. The temple opens everyday except Monday. Opens from 9.30 am to 6 pm.Best time is to visit in winter as inside so much open places are there where direct sunlight is falling. If you want to enjoy the shows, which are worth watching, then go in afternoon.Ticket price is Rs.170/- for adult for exhibition and Rs.80/- for musical fountain.Different shows are exhibited in about 9 halls.Trick is to not to seat in front rows, though you get a better view of the current show but may miss something in the next show, which may be better than the previous show.Shops are there inside selling snacks which are delicious.Apart from that restaurant is also there serving meals. Yes, you have to walk more inside the complex."
Full day fun,Akshardham temple is one of the biggest Holy temple in  Delhi. Very well managed by the staff. Mostly rush on weekends. Mobiles are not allowed inside the temple. Great architecture. Water show is one of the most enjoyable thing here. The temple  looks so beautiful üòç. One should visit this Holy place. Must must visit here.
beautiful,"its a beautiful temple in delhi. no electronic items allowed inside, not even mobile phones. the temple is very beautiful"
Spirit of Indian Religion,"During our day long extensive tour with a knowledgeable guide provide you the comprehensive idea of spirituality in Indian people, this is not tilted towards any specific ideology of hinduism but introduces the visitor the way of life an average Indian lives having some faith in GOD."
Impressive but Modern Temple,"This is a fairly recently built temple that is quite ornate in its construction. There is a series of descriptive paintings running around the inside of the temple depicting the life of the swami the temple is dedicated to honoring. One of the more interesting features is the full sized carvings surrounding the exterior that depict the life of elephants. While this is beautiful and impressive, I find that the temples made by hand before modern tools were available to be more impressive due to the effort expended. This however does not take away from the beauty of this temple. Worth seeing."
Beautiful temple,"Must see if you are coming to Delhi. Hindu temple with all modern facilities. Cinema halls, restaurants and resting place. Laser light show is the main attraction"
clean and beautiful temple,We spent almost 4 hours inside the temple. Remember to leave your mobiles outside as they do not allow to take inside. must see the laser light show. it was a clean and beautiful temple depicting Hindu religion. Water and music fountain are splendid.
This temple will take you by suprise and you breath away.,"Excellent near 4 hour experience to see everything. Go after 3 in the afternoon so you can catch the evening laser light, music and water fountain show."
Amazing...,"If you have to choose one spot to go and see in New Delhi then this is the spot ...it's truly amazing inside, Breathtaking ..."
Cleanest temple in all of India,"This temple and its grounds took my breath away.  Hands down to me, it was the most beautiful temple I have visited in India.  Everything was immaculate and well organized.  Wished it was not closed at the time we visited due to coronavirus."
Extremely Beautiful,"The Akshardham temple is a masterpiece. There is ample parking in the temple. No mobile phone, bags and camera allowed. Keep everything in your car. If u are not travelling by car everything need to be deposited at dedicated counters but you will need to stand in queue. The walk to whole temple is really nice and every part and engraving is so beautiful. Do not miss light and sound show. It is amazing to see the play of lights, water and sound blended with technology. The show would cost Rs. 80/ each. Duration is around 20 minutes. This amazing building is a must visit."
A great place to visit.,"Place is very beautiful, must visit once. Very calm and peace place. Laser show and exhibition is the best part."
A stunning temple and cannot be missed,This temple will take your breath away. If you get the chance please pay this temple a visit it really should not be missed.  You will need an hour and half to go round the building and to enter the temple you will need to take your shoes off.  However they are stored safely.
MESMERIZING ABODE,a PLACE OF Serinity and absolutely clean and well kept.The darshan is awsome and the tour conducted is an experience to be remembered for long.
Don't miss this temple,"If you go by metro, there is a metro station called Akshardam. If you leave the station walk to right. After 5 minutes there is a road to the temple, easy to find. you walk for another 5 minutes and you reach temple. There is a special entrance for people who arrive on foot. Just follow the path and you reach the cloak room where you have to leave your camera, mobile phone and other electronic devices. It's not allowed to take photos. Walk through the beautiful gardens and enjoy the unbelievable architecture of the temple. It is allowed to go inside. After you visit you walk to the shopping area and foodcourt. On the way there are photographers to take your photo with the temple. I did, but the result was not so good because of the position of the sun. Pass the foodcourt and pick up your photo in one of the shops. Pickup your camera and mobile phone and look back to see the impressive temple."
Marvelous Creations !!,A must visit to see jaw dropping intricate designing & carvings of modern temple. Make a point to view Fountain Show in the evening.
Very Beautiful and peaceful,Security is strict so no mobile phones or bags. Well organised system to store belongings.Water show is worth seeing the rest I could have skipped (shows).
Unbelievably beautiful!,Part of my Chaman Duggal tour. Amazing Hindu religious site. I highly recommend this place! A must for your trip to Dehli!
Excellent Temple,Very good temple in delhi one of the best temple in delhi good place in delhi this is one of the dharmik place in delhi.
Undoubtedly the highlight of Delhi!,It's a blessing in disguise that they forbid phones and cameras for the digital detox so that we can enjoy the serenity and beauty of this magical temple! A great way to end the day away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The queue to the cloak room for depositing phones and cameras were surprisingly efficient and they issue you with a token for collection (separate queues for different number tags). We left early from the night water show to beat the crowd to collect our belongings. Enochlophobia kicks in when the crowd sets in before the show and the locals seem to have a different concept of having personal space. :/
Must see,"A giant temple surrounded by vast gardens, carved structures and a food court that serves tasty food at very reasonable price. Security is very high. You are not allowed to carry your mobile inside. Entrance is free."
RUDE STAFF- But beautiful temple. Try to enjoy! ,No phones/electronics allowed. So you need to check it in. Woman at counter 4/5 when you check in your electronics was SLEEPING AT THE WINDOW. I knocked the window to wake her. She then pointed to my wallet for me to open- DROPPED my phone out on the counter. She then literally threw the cchip in front of me and my partner and pointed for us to leave. Rudest woman in Delhi. It‚Äôs a beautiful temple and amazing architecture- truly worth a visit when you‚Äôre in New Delhi! But my experience was almost ruined. TIP: Make sure whether you‚Äôre a man/woman to wear pants/ long skirt to cover ankles. If you don‚Äôt they‚Äôll fetch you a wrap where you‚Äôll need to make deposit of $100IRN.
Beautifully Crafted,"Amazing place take blessings,good cleaning around the temple. Best thing to do is click a photo with temple from their own camera man as personal belongings are prohibited due to secuirty reasons.One should visit of you are in Delhi.Piece at the place."
mixed review,"A large, recently constructed temple.  Clean.  However, no camera aloud and does not have the historical impact of older sites/temples."
Eat after darshan,"Simple  decent  meals,  affordable  for  all  and  suitable  for  all  tastes--pure  vegetarian  only. Self  service."
Okay,Lots money invested and doesn't make any sense . Canteen is good but not fast and okay food . Temple is beautiful anyway in delhi like city
"Akshardham Temple , a PASSPORT, an ICON of Delhi , India ",This is a very famous tourist attractions. Forvthise visiting Delhi.. thete are severe security restrictions.. u xanrv4ajw mobile inside...but yes it's magnificent.. u can have nice food inside.. see light and sound show... Myst take a memorable photograph with temple inbthe background.. hot sunny day.. may be avoided as lots if area is open to sky.. better chose morning or evening
Visit February 2020,Excellent day out.  Close to the Metro station.  Free entry.  Snack shop very good and reasonably priced.  Good selection of affordable souvenirs.
Stunning peaceful temple,"This is such a beautiful temple built in 1881-1890.The workmanship is exquisite. It a peaceful place to spend a couple of hours and the entry is free. Sadly the day we were there they are making major repairs to the water displays , which are meant to be stunning."
Breathtaking ,This is one of the most amazing places I‚Äôve visited. You have to see it to believe it. I understand the logic behind not taking photos inside the mandir but think you should be allowed to take photos of the buildings from outside. It was a great place and I went early on Sunday so it wasn‚Äôt very busy. A must if you‚Äôre in the area
Architectural Masterpiece,"Swaminarayan Akshardham is one of the best example of excellence in architecture and carving which is a treat to eyes.  This is one of best managed places of worship in India spread over hundred acres. Fountain and laser show, film on Shree Swaminarayan and boat ride are worth seeing.  One can spend hours together in this magnanimous temple."
Breathtaking,"The most beautiful, magical place!But beware, you cannot take mobile phones or cameras of any kind. There is a check-in place to leave your stuff, but just a bummer because I wanted to take pictures! It is breathtaking!"
Beautifully intricately detailed structure!,The structure/temple was absolutely amazing to see.  We visited it without a guide so the only information we had as we toured were the plaques that were displayed throughout that thankfully were in English also.  The detailed craftsmanship make it seem impossible that this structure was completed just 15 years ago.  This place is definitely worth a visit.
Awestruck,"Best place to visit in New Delhi, imho - a greater sight than the Taj Mahal. As a bonus, entrance is free!"
incredible places,"it was very nice to visit these sights and i love the places,,i spend more then 3 hours in places..."
Mesmerizing place ,"I went here twice. This place is so so beautiful. Cell phones are not allowed inside and there‚Äôs a strict security to check to you before you go inside. There is no ticket to enter the place and it is so beautifully maintained. The akshardham temple is so beautiful, so gotta go there  and see with your own eyes to understand it. You can also wait for the fountain show that happens in the evening. It is worth a watch. The carvings on the temple are out of the world. I cannot stop singing itz praises. Also, the food cafeteria is great. It is worth a go ! Please go and check out this place."
A must if you are visiting Delhi!!,Exquisite architecture!!The sculptures and the buildings are amazing!There is also a food court and it is very clean and very well maintained. The food is really nice!No cameras or mobiles are allowed inside though. That was the only setback. The security before entering is very strict.
TOUR ,A perfect place to visit if you are interested in art and architecture! The best of the best is shown and carved on the stones of the temple! A view worth watching for a while! Though you cannot carry any of your belongings to the temple and neither can you click photos of your own! The major disadvantage if you want to take photos!
Don¬¥t miss this if you are in Delhi,"It is surreal, it is a young classic. One of those temples that will be UNESCO after it ages a little bit. Real craftmanship is still alive!"
Well worth a visit,Take a tour of Delhi and include this wonderful building. Get one of the security guards to show you around as they know the history of this acient place.
Temple,i really admired the interior design of this place. probably the best ever been too. too bad you can't take any photo inside.
Amazing place to visit,"Splendid architecture and worth visiting place in Delhi. There is varieties of food from South to north or Chinese. Don't miss the musical fountain show. You can spend whole day here while watching the different show or just sit and feel relaxed. Ultimate example of sculptural beauty, cleanliness. A highly delighted experience one could ever have."
Stunning modern Hindu temple that will take your breath away. A must to visit in Delhi.,"Great architecture work with marvellous interiors.Although it is a modern complex, the ancient and traditional techniques of Hindu architecture have been used in its construction. The temple is full of decorations, miniatures, sculptures, and artistic beauties. It is worth a visit. Before going, I advise you to leave your belongings at the hotel, as cameras, cell phones, and backpacks are not allowed inside. If you cannot do without having them with you, you can use the storage service used just before the entrance. Entry is totally free, As Mobile is not allowed inside , you can focus completely to the place and enjoy with your family. There is a kids' play area with multiple rides so kids can enjoy, that also is free of cost, There is a water fountain show in the evening after sunset which is also a must watch; kids love it, In the main temple there are idols of various Hindu Gods."
AksharDham Temple complex in NCT of Delhi,"Great place to visit. Great Architecture, clean and helpful people.However problem is they do not allow bigger bags  to be taken inside the complex. this creates problem particularly with outstation visitors and ladies. this is despite having airport type security screening.Secondly , Shows are good but first two shows , enthusiasim of the guide can be seen while for the third one, navigation through water , directions to get there is not clear and guides are also not there. this aspect needs to be looked into.Further , the tickets for the shows are three in one and you can not choose based on your liking/time availability. Otherwise , it is a great place to visit if you have 3-4 hours ."
A Majestic Temple from South India,"I have seen Akshardham Temple in Gandhidham, Gujarat and when I was told that they have made another big temple in Delhi, I thought I must see this one also."
Spirituality redefined !,"Amazed to see the splendour of architecture, carving, gigantic spread, people centric approach. Really surprised with the way the entire temple was created. To believe it, one has to see it. Can't be explained, enormously structured, splendid is a smaller word to describe. Foodies will have lot of good food to cherish. Must see for everyone visiting Delhi."
Organised and CLEAN,It was such a heartening experience to see an organised and CLEAN temple.Our temples are known for art and craftsmanship but all lack cleanliness and organization.has all amenities for elderly and a huge food court.. Must visit once atleast
Warm thanks to Nitesh and Rashmika Patel for your time at Akshardham,"My college friend and I had planned this trip weeks in advance. It was a sight to behold and we spent over three hours at the temple. We marveled at the intricately sculpted stone structures and even stood in amazement under the many carved ceilings in the sanctum. After our circumambulation of the two levels of the temple which were decked with mythological figures, we walked through the corridors. Here, my friend and I met devotees, Nitesh and Rashmika Patel from London, UK. They were a middle-aged devotees and were married. They were very affable and told us about the significance of the colour of the pink sandstone for the temple. They told us that like the pink blossom of flowers during spring, we too are called to blossom in our lives with goodness, like in spring. Nitesh and Rashmika also told us interesting facts about the temple and that it was the largest temple in the world and took 200 million man hours to make! I would like to thank them both from the bottom of our hearts for making our visit special.after this, we had a delicious meal at the cafeteria and clicked a picture. It was a day well spent."
Beautiful,"What a beautiful place! Unfortunately security is very strict and you cannot take cameras, phones, (pretty much everything apart from wallet) inside.It takes about 20 minutes from the centre of Delhi but we felt it was worth it, cost INR350 each way in a tut tut.Unfortunately we couldn't stay for the light show which was on later than we thought"
Most detailed temple I‚Äôve ever seen!,"If you‚Äôre interested in visiting a beautiful temple in the middle of busy New Delhi, the Aksharmdham Temple is a must see!Although the security is pretty tight and you‚Äôre not even allowed to bring your phone, camera or even headphones, it‚Äôs totally worth it! This temple must have been the most well crafted and detailed peace of art I have ever seen. The atmosphere is amazing and it wasn‚Äôt too crowded since the property is massive. After you‚Äôve visited the temple and it‚Äôs surroundings there is a foodcourt and ‚Äòmerchandise‚Äô shop where they sell everything for cost price (or at least I assume with prices that cheap). An overall amazing experience!"
Oldest civilization of India,"Greetings from incredible IndiaFive seasons toursVery beautiful and great learning from incredible akshardham temple, it is very good teaching for the good human being"
One of the modern landmark of Delhi.,"Visited this temple before few years. At first you would be mesmerizied by looking at size, design and details of this temple. Ita full of modern technology shows and interactive session. Kids will love it. Need atlest 4-5 hours to complete visit. Kids will love it. Food and water is not allowed inside. No purse handbag and footwear allowed."
Akshradham Swaminarayan Mandir,"To visit Akshardham Temple was my bucket list since few years.I am glad that I was able to visit it in this trip to Delhi.It was an extremely grandeur experience.Such a huge area with cleanliness and beautiful carved temple premises,that I was mesmerized.It is so well managed from the entry itself and what a great management . The main temple has free entry.They have exhibition gallery and water fountain show which have 300 INR combined ticket.But it is worth every penny.Not to be missed.The temple's architecture is breathtaking,emaculate carvings sculptures and deites.Every moment I spent here is treasured.The water fountain show was an unique ,such a creative experience.The exhibition galleries are equally good.The last part was the boat ride which takes us to the history of incredible India reminding us about the glorious past we possess and should be proud of.I felt blessed to witness this grandeur."
Guide Nitesh Patel,We had a very informative and enjoyable visit to the temple. Our guide Nitesh Patel was very knowledgeable about hindu mythology and all aspects of the temple. He made our trip very interesting and worthwhile. Ruud & Audrey from Norway.
Magnificent temple in New Delhi ,"A solemn temple, magnificent buildings build up by volunteers and donations. Provide a interesting sound-light show at night with little fee. Unfortunately photograph and camera are restricted inside the area."
Neat and peaceful,"The place is huge and we'll maintained. It serves great quality and tasty food. I have been there on multiple occasions, and never found it too crowded once reached inside. Although entering is a whole different task. It takes minimum of 20 minutes to get through the lines. They also have safe keeping option for luggage."
Peace is all you need,"i love everything about this place , its good that they don't allow phones inside the temple , so that people can actually feel the peace and spend some real good time with their loved ones , such a good vibe place."
Massive crowds and security made my visit barely worthwhile.,"This is an impressive temple on large grounds, but the ordeal of getting there through surging crowds and long and involved security screening through one is not even allowed a camera or bag, made my visit hardly worthwhile. There is a fountain and light show offered in the evening for an extra fee. But the best show is perhaps at dusk when the spotlights come on to accentuate the temple grand architecture."
Woooow,It's simply amazing it's has a great water show which I liked very much ...It's one of the best temple in Delhi .And it's one of the biggest temple
I feel so soft here whenever come to this place,"This Swaminarayan Akshardham Temple one of the best temple which is nicely maintain by their staff which is cool and helpful as well, we got nice space for park our vehicle here and night water show was one of the best part here."
awesoe place,I am never worried about the place because it is always worth it.   comfortable and neat.   well spread. I really like the ADD - Well Lit and sunlight popping through the windows
Intersting dive into Hindu religion,"Akshardham is a newly buit Hindu temple a few minutes ride from Connaught Place. It is huge and impressive, packed with visitors. Make sure you leave all your belongings at the entrance gate (or better, at your hotel), as you will be allowed to carry only your wallet and mineral water."
Tourist attraction ,"Absolutely beautiful a must visit In Delhi, needed longer there. Cannot take handbags in with you, we left ours with our taxi (from hotel) but I‚Äôm sure must be lockers there if not."
Interesting Place in Delhi ,"I was very wowed by the architectural presence in this place , it‚Äôs very soothing and beautiful. And even though you cannot take any pictures and you just leave your belongings outside , it‚Äôs absolutely worth it. The temple gives you such a tranquil vibe. Was probably one of my favourites in Delhi. Very safe and very relaxing. I recommend it highly."
Awesome,Incredible moment at temple. Clean green memorial moments at temple too much people are there for visit temple
Beautifully crafted ,This is the best Temple of Delhi which is really spread so long and have great art over there. There is a mandir with different shows also. Water fountain show starts around 7 pm and it is spectacular.
Breathtaking architecture,"The temple is an architectural wonder. The intricate designs are truly magnificent. The visit is a mind blowing experience. There are no cameras or phones allowed, it has to kept in the locker. You need to walk quite a bit, as the place is huge. For those who cannot walk, wheel chairs are available at the cost of Rs 100, which is refundable. There are eateries inside which sell Malasa chai, Chole kulcha and Dhokla. The temple is also has a Metro services from and to Delhi, which is the next building."
A magnificent temple with a wonderful design!,"This is probably the best temple in Delhi and a must visit if you are on a short trip to Delhi. I was completely taken aback by the intricacy of design and the peace one feels when inside. Though the check in is a bit lengthy in terms of time since one has to pass through a thorough security process, but it is all worth it. Do not miss the evening light and sound show."
Lovely Hindu temple,"Incredibly beautiful, grand Hindu temple and amazing architecture. The temple was completed and concentrated in 2005. Thus, it is a modern day temple. No entrance fee."
Beautiful architecture.  Tranquility and  serenity ,Exceptionally  beautiful  architecture. Talented  artisans. Serene and peaceful. A must see!!!Karen Karen
Best ever temple. ,"Once u go to this temple no need to tour other temple, all in one trip, if u know your hindu  scriptures, marble at is best. No camera  allowed, picutes would have been stunning. Biggest temple in world, one of its kind."
The most impressive sight we saw in Delhi!,"This should be top of your list when sightseeing in Delhi. Very impressive and a must see. One thing to note: you will have to store your camera, phone etc at the cloakroom (free and safe by the looks of it). We bought a photo book inside the temple with photos and it was actually nice being able to enjoy the experience without having to fight other tourists for the best photo spot.... We finished our visit with dinner at the cafe. The Thali is fantastic and very reasonably priced."
Peaceful and religious,"Very peaceful superb place, love the ambiance and everything, totally beautiful place  one must visit it"
Best Temple in Delhi,"I visited several temples in Delhi, and this one was by far the best. Before entering, you can take some pictures overlooking the temple complex from the road. Upon entering, you must deposit your cellphone and camera in their cloak room. Basic entrance and storage are free.  They sell a helpful picture guidebook for 50 rupees ($1 USD) which explains the different parts of the temple complex. They have three exhibitions, including a boat ride, which cost a total of 220 rupees ($3 USD). They will take your photo in front of the temple and frame it for 120 rupees ($2 USD). They have a large cafeteria with outdoor seating, mainly vegetarian food. Allow about 3 hours to see everything."
delhi sightseeing,"i love this place , very calm & soulfull experience . it is on the river banks & have  a lovely view from main deck. great architecture"
Nice temple,"This is a nice place to be and it was not too hot as most reviewers complained, we loved to see the culture and architecture of the building."
A one cool temple,I hated the security checking since I had to unpack all my bags with a lot of camera gadgets so take pre caution of that. Just take as little as you can so it will be easier for you.
Magnificent Temple,"It is an intricately designed structure, very well maintained.  It is  very peaceful and really beautiful.  But you can not take camera or mobile inside the temple.  Though you can get photographs inside.  It has a pure vegetarian restaurant and khichdi is really delicious.  It is at a walking distance from Blue Metro station.  Its light show in the evening is very informative.  You can enjoy boat ride here.  A must place to visit."
Peaceful. Worth going to the shows!,The boat show was our personal favorite. Highlight of our stay in Delhi. Peaceful and beautifully set structures and paintings that would blow your mind. PLEASE do make an effort to go if you can. You won‚Äôt regret it at all.Id recommend going in the morning unless you‚Äôd like to watch the night show which I hear is quite spectacular.
Beautiful temple,"Secuity is tight, take with you as little as possible. You will not be allowed to enter with either camera or phone and the searches are fairly thorough.The complex is free to enter and some signage tells you a little about what you are seeing.There is a small charge for some of the exhibitions, but as we were unable to find out at what times the shows were starting we gave them a miss.There is the opportunity to buy a photo, which at 50 rupee wasn't expensive,  picture locations were limited to 2 and the lighting would have been better from the opposite side when we were there (a very touristy complaint).There is a reasonable food court, vegetarian only.Easy stroll from the Akshardham metro stop (blue line).Cant comment on the light show as we only had the opportunity for a daytime visit."
Nice place to visit in Delhi,This is a must place to visit in Delhi. We went with our friend. We had an awesome  experience. Enjoyed thoroughly.
A Bit Overrated,"This place was highly recommended by our friends when we visited Delhi for the first time. But to be honest we did not enjoy it that much. There was a huge security check through which we had to pass before we could enter the temple. The amount of effort required to enter the temple was not worth what lay inside. Also our phones had to be left behind in the car.....so even we saw some intricate architecture we could not click. There was a central temple holding Swaminarayan and other idols but I like a temple because of its hustle, bustle and energy and this sofisticated place just did not touch me. We spent some time randomly roaming and then decided to exit. On the way out we saw several food stalls and a pure veg restaurant. There were also authentic Bengali sweets available and this was perhaps the best thing I liked about this place as I was craving for sweets for a long time. Maybe if you are a local of Delhi or staying there for sometime you can visit this place for some relaxation in the weekend. But if you are visiting Delhi for the first time and that also a group of youngsters like us then I would recommend you to skip it."
Intricate Architecture and sound environment,"It would definitely take an entire day for the visit, which is centrally located in delhi near by akshardham metro station, from an architectural point of view it's one of it's own kind. Apart from the spiritual nature of the place, it also offers laser shows, boat rides and museum visits."
Simply majestic,"To review such a majestic temple would not be possible in less than a book, but to help fellow tourists and worshippers a few tips and guidelines are being provided to the best of my knowledge. Regret omissions if any thru oversight. Located on nh 44 , highway connecting meerut to delhi, near akshardham setu. Approachable by bus, taxi, own transport and metro. Adequte paid parking.

One hour time. All three exhibitions are in different auditoriums. And now the best show us the water show at 7,15 pm in the water arena. Ticket is 80 rupees per head. This 25 minute extravaganza will hold your breath all the way. What a color combination, with spectacular fountains and designs. A whole story is weaved in the drama, with lot of child artists thrown in. The show covers a huge area, where sitting arrrangement is made in stairs and steps.no words are enough to describe the beauty of this show. Not to be missed at any cost. Not possible to describe in this shirt message. Akshardham today becomes the best tourist attraction for the world in Delhi. Not to be missed."
Highly recommend,"Want to know about Indian history, science, exploration and math, but don‚Äôt want to go to school for months and....be entertained?This is the place. ‚ÄúSpontaneous happiness‚Äù is one of the goals of the Swami and you have to be a real crank to not achieve it there. Worth the time and effort."
Intricate Designs,The craftsmanship was outstanding.  It is amazing how the construction had taken place without modern technology.
Must visit,Very beautiful and must go for water show at evening parking Available food pure vegetarian even not garlic and onion very good and large variety of food indoor must visit place in Delhi and water show and very low price food not so expansive love the place very peaceful has visited 3th time
iMPORTANT PLACE FOR VISIT IN DELHI,EXCELLENT PLACE atleast visit once you will love this place. Peaceful & holistic environment with full of enjoyment.
Fantastic,"This temple was fantastic it was well situated in lovely grounds. It was free to go into the temple, no phones or cameras were allowed. Unfortunately we didnt see the exhibitions as we were short of time allow at least 4 hours, to see everything. The gardens were peaceful. Although some work was being done it was quite subtle.The light show is a definate must see it had lots of seating around.  Tea coffee and snack stalls were available, for refreshment around the fountain area. The show had a theme of gods shown onto the building, through the water. It was all amazing lots of ohhs and ohs from the audience. When leaving the temple was all lit up a magnificent sight. It was possible to have a professional photograph taken with it behind you ..... at a cost ....the queue was huge. Lots of pushing to get to the exit.  It was a very narrow. Access ... a large car park and near to the metro."
"Beautiful design, art of building say lots of meaning","In this modern time medieval time experience is this place...khichadi is very tasty which is served as a Prasad, light show in evening is very amazing,    light decoration in evening give a glimpse of raj Mahal"
"Unbelievable attraction, don‚Äôt miss !","This is a huge temple inaugurated in 2005 . Was built by 7000 people for 5 years .all the temple and big surroundings are hand carved made of marble or red sandstone.The visit consists of an exhibition or actually theater scenes telling the story of the sacred founder of this special religion, a branch of Hinduism. Then the temple itself , and a multimedia open air performance based on a huge water fountain and laser illumination. This takes place at 1915 daily . Go there at 1700-1730 .admission 4 USDLRS.Very recommended"
fountain show,"went on full moon day ,, the fountain n light show was awesome ....the temple area is well organized n cleaned properly ...there were proper washrooms n drinking water facilities , locker facility ...,,,even though there was plenty peoples visiting the temple it was properly organised , the security arrangements...."
FANTASTIC,It is really very attractive and nice place. beautiful surroundings. wonderful construction. we really liked to visit again
Family tour Delhi.,Awesome experience. Very organized. Neat and clean. Food court is just fabulous. Variety of food is available. Very serene. Peace of soul.
The best of modern temple architecture in this part of India...Don't Miss!!,"This is a fabulous temple built on the banks of the river Yamuna by the Swaminarayan sect who have built temples around the world. This temple represents the most modern temple architecture that anyone can see in this part of India. The administration is just great and they have maintained the temple very well over the years. The intricacies in the architecture are a treat to watch. The idea itself is awesome and the expanse of the temple makes it an exhilarating experience. No one who visits Delhi should not miss this at all. Each temple built by the Swaminarayan sect is different in its architecture, the type of stone used and the looks. This temple has a nice shop, restaurant and prasadam counters. Overall, it is a very blissful experience to visit this temple."
Excellent Architecture,"Monday is a Holiday! Normally, you should budget 6 to 10 hours as time taken to visit swaminarayan akshardham temple. Depending on your level of interest in the place and whether you wish to have a more detailed and thorough tour or not, the time taken can be less or more. Food at the caf√© is delicious n nutritious."
Awesome Experience,Had great fun. The place is amazing. There is a lot to learn and it is a very tranquil place. A must visit.
Must Visit in Delhi,"I don't know why this place is not marketed as the TOP to do place in Delhi. Mesmerizing. If I can say, you can stay away from the filth of Agra and enjoy this temple. Don't take your electronics with you as the ques to the locker is long.."
Very clean and peacful place,"1. Nearest metro station is Akshardham metro station.2. Very peaceful and silent place.3. Perfect place for day outing with family.4. They dont allow you to carry mobile phones, camera, purse, belt or any other gadget.5. Photography or videography is prohibited.6. Different types of shows are shown at this place at nominal ticket price."
Not to be missed,A masterpiece of architecture. No pics allowed and you need to take your shoes off for the temple. Skip the presentation and boat ride. Very kitschy and all they do is tell the story of the founder. Food available on site.
Marvelous...,"Even newly built, it is hindu temple complex w/ a big magnificent one built in garden patio along w/ smaller ones, all connected through walking arches.Big/central one and all others having marvelous marble carvings on walls, statues of lord shiva and other hindu lords built inside big temple.Very clean all over, has veg restaurant, many ice-cream parlors and book/gift shop. PHOTOs are UNFORTUNATELY NOT ALLOWED INSIDE!"
nice temple,"love the architechture, its huge & calm. located on the bank of a river . though lot of local people & school children were there."
MUST MUST MUST!,"Absolutely awesome place. You cannot skip this while in Delhi...really. The entrance is for free but you are not allowed to carry with you your camera and mobile, which means you have to leave them in a cloak room and get them returned to you once your visit is over. There is an amazing fountain show at night...one of the best shows I have ever seen in my life...truly awesome. Inside you can also find food stalls and a souvenir shop where I could buy some nice T-shirts at a very reasonable price."
8 hour private tour,"Avi was an awesome guide!The temple was breathtaking and gorgeous!The gardens were beautiful.It would be nice to see the other exhibitions, such as the boat and light shows."
Best Spiritual place in Delhi,This is Amazing place. Best Spiritual place in delhi. whenever you go delhi must visit this Temple. I feel so amazing here. I definitely recommend to go there.
Yahoo' no cameras,"Brilliant show in the evening, a must see if you have the time, well put together. I would recommend to rock up about 5:00 to view the temple and grounds. Get your ticket early (before 6:00) to see the show that starts at 7:00. You dont need to join the excited crowd to rush in for a seat and look stupid sitting there for an hour as you can come and go as long as you have the entry ticket. The best part about this attraction is no cameras, phones or electrical items allowed inside, the locker room system is very well run and you can appreciate the history and culture in peace without flash photography, loud ignorant people walking around on the phone and no selfie crowd. Every historic venue should take note. One of the best venues to visit worldwide by far."
Religious,Very beautiful. Good water show --if you haven't been to other water show like Balagio--. Very long documentary.
"Lame exerience, don‚Äôt waste your time",Not worth the time. It is not even finished! It is new not old which totally undermines any attempt to be spectacular. Says it has biggest step well but there isn‚Äôt even water in it. You can‚Äôt take anything in - there is more security than international travel for a lame experience.
Lovely,"This place is so lovely. When you enter inside, you feel the positive aura & it's so peaceful. I would definitely visit again if I have a chance"
Most amazing and great architecture ,Visit to the temple is must.Parking space is adequate. Should plan visit early morning  so that rush can be avoided or afternoon so that one can watch lovely lazer and musical water show. The food is delicious and tasty in the food court.
Well worth going to,"Worth the easy metro journey, short walk from the station. Free to enter and we‚Äôre were there 10am so no queues.  They adhere very strictly to the access rules and you will be thoroughly checked over! The baggage store was very secure though. Unless you want to go in all the exhibitions we found an hour long enough. The evening light and sound show looked good but we did not have  the time to try it."
Don‚Äôt miss it,"Pictures don‚Äôt show how awesome it is, you have to go there, thousands of details in one place don‚Äôt miss it."
Very artificial and tacky,"This was the tackiest site i have ever visited.  The boat tour takes you through an overly simplistic overview of India history.  With all the rich, vibrant culture New Delhi has to offer, this artificial site is not worth the time."
Beautiful and serene,Beautiful and serene temple. No phones or camera allowed. Very strict! Don‚Äôt attempt to sneak them in.
Amazing experience ,Do check out the Sound and Light show . Starts by 7.30 but last entry is by 6.30 PMThe only sad thing is no cameras are allowed. This is the most beautiful temple and the sound light laser show is out of the world. Wow must visit and also just do the light show.
Interesting viewpoint on temple building. ,"Lots of security to get in. Best to take nothing inside so you don‚Äôt have to check it in locker. No cellphones, cameras bags etc. Interesting to see a modern day temple. Very beautiful and still under construction outside. For me it raised the ethical and moral questions of exorbitant costs to build something like this in the name of a profit or god. All of the ancient tombs, churches, temples ,etc will be looked at differently now. What would those honored really think of these places built at such costs."
A unique night out,"A very interesting temple to visit but glad we had a guide to help us navigate the area, ie the boat ride, which almost looks like a tunnel of love ride, but enjoyable and the story of the founder moving from room to room and felt like musical chairs. The grand finale was the actual light and water fountain show starting after the sun sets and was incredible. Arrive early as the security check takes time and the crowds are large, and no photos allowed, but well worth it, confusing but enjoyable."
Beautiful and Grand temple complex.,"North India has very few large temple complexes. Most of these are pretty recent and even these are guarded more than RBI or central ministries. Too long lines for depositing everything including mobile phones and cameras. This rules out selfie freaks and memory makers, so makes the hassle worthwhile. Light show in the evening is amazing to watch, though very childish in content. Ideal trips to be taken in winters and non rainy season. For rain freaks, it would be an amazing place to get totally drenched and enjoy hot coffee and food in the open. The food court is very good and decently priced. Lot of options and tasty food by and large. The shop is pretty good too. Both these are at the end of the visit. Though no one will stop you to visit earlier also."
half day not enough time,"A truly transformative experience.  Really busy, full of people but I still felt so peaceful there.  recommend giving yourself a full day to enjoy including seeing the sunset fountains."
Loved loved loved this,"Truly spectacular, absolutely takes your breath away and to think it is a recent addition. From the moment you enter the gardens to the actual temple so well thought out! The carvings were awesome, true craftsmanship. Everywhere you look there is something to see. I would totally recommend this as a must see in New Delhi, outstrips the Taj Mahal in its splendour. The shop at the end is so reasonable compared to anywhere else we visited. A diamond in the rough of the hustle of Delhi! Just beautiful... the downside would be no photos but worth buying a well priced book to remember the beauty always."
Bad Experience.,This place has phone restriction you have to submit your phones outside and you can't capture any good moment inside. And also it has nothing much to explore just the water show was very good rest it was quite expensive.
Fantastic,Fantastic place and everyone and every tourist should see this astonishing place. I hope again can see this place
Hahbas,Great nonumvshsbsjzjzhzbzbz will come back again soon to visit it again.. Hope it will remain the same
Akshardham Temple is Magnificent,We visited the temple while staying in Delhi.  It is truly magnificent.  In our opinion it is equal to the Taj Mahal in terms of beauty.  We were very surprised as we had not previously heard anything about it. Photography is not allowed so maybe this is why. If you are staying in Delhi it should be one of your top places to visit.
beautiful,This temple is only about 15 years old but the carvings and construction are fabulous.  It is set in expansive grounds and has a sound and light show and other attractions.
Mesmerizing,Very beautiful temple. Have amazing carvings and inside the dome it is very beautiful. Huge garden surrounding the templethe whole architecture and theme of Axshardham temple remains same all over.Very tight security and you can take a small purse/ pouch and water .The light and sound show is amazing.There is no place to sit in shade in summers and rainy season.
Disneyland of faith(‚ùå HINDU) with security more than a defense Airport,"THE GOOD :The place is HUGE. The place is beautiful. The temple is artistic. The inside of the temple is extremely beautiful. The statues are bling. The auditoriums for the shows were great. And the boat ride show is unique. THE BAD :1. This is ‚ùå a hindu temple. Not at all. In fact it's a disrespect to hindu temple. The agenda is glorification of Swami Narayan and project him as hindu god. He is NOT a hindu god. Our scriptures of holybooks don't tell about him for hindu scriptures were thousands of years old that can tell about an agenda started within 100years. The idea is to buy faith by spending a lot of money. That's not hinduism. 2. The place never tells about any gods of hinduism. We have god in many forms but the organisation tells nothing but one person who is not a god. They have built a massive statue of him and make it look like all the gods look up to him. You won't find a single word telling about other gods. It makes it sound like there is one god and that's swaminarayan. That's not hinduism. Hindus have one god but we pray almost everything in nature and all forces of nature. Certainly that one god(nirakar parambrahma) is not Swami narayan. May be he was a great man agreat sage who did good things about people and community but glorifying a great man as GOD is bit too much. And then Adjusting it to Hindu dharma. 3. There is no shade. Expect to be get sunburnt if u r visiting in a sunny day. And at the water fountain and lazor show in the evening, if it rains u r gone. No place to stand or sit with a cover on head. It rained during my visit and it was a chaos. 4. The entry is free after that everything comes for money.5. The security is HIGH!! You are not allowed to carry anything but water and money. The camera mobile the earphone the mobile charger the pen and paper nothing is allowed. Doesn't make any sense. What a iPhone charger can threat security and the wallet/coins can not. Visit  if u have time. But don't take them seriously. They don't represent hinduism."
Proud to have one like this in India,"Great architecture. Beautiful and grand temple with very large area consisting of beautiful garden with statues of historical personalities. Great laser light & sound shows in evening. Beautiful and large temple complex. It would take at least 3 to 4 hours to completely visit all the places in the temple complex.The carving of the temple is in its unique beauty. Cleanliness, gentle conduct of staff, you will be very helpful in strolling here. It's a great place to visit with ur family and friends. Proud to have one like this in India."
nice temple,"I visited temple, temple was really beatifull design will recomment to every who is visiting delhi first time must visit"
another amazing site in Dehli,"This is another amazing site in Dehli, India. The interior is spectacular (you will need to take off your shoes). Outside, the gardens are beautiful, and the building is surrounded by the most amazing carvings of elephants, and many other animals, people and scenes. I highly recommend it!"
Volunteer support,"We visited the Akshardham, a Spiritual-Cultural Campus In Delhi. This structure is magnificent. Taking photos were prohibited. We went on a boat ride for a short history telling journey.  Akshardham' means the divine house of God. More than 300,000,000 volunteer hours went into making the complex. We loved the The Yogihriday Kamal which is the is a lotus shaped garden.  No photos."
too many visitor limits,"we decided to view from outside sa while it invites the public, it is far too restrictive.  I am sure is is fantastic"
Beautiful visit,"I got a chance to visit this temple on a recent business trip. It is beautiful and amazing! So much intricate detail carved everywhere. Unfortunately you cannot take pictures as phones and electronic devices are not allowed, but I will never forget how beautiful it is."
Amazing mix of religious monument and theme park,"Go late afternoon so you have time to visit the temple, grounds and the underground boat ride ( think small world at Disney combined with Indian history). There is a film show about the founding of this religious group; as non- believers we found it a fascinating ‚Äòstory‚Äô to help understand others beliefs.Stay until dark for the wonderful sound and light show. It‚Äôs absolutely packed so get seated in the fountain area nice and early Entrance is free and you pay for extras.Please note you can‚Äôt take phones, cameras etc into the grounds, so can‚Äôt load any here. Men use separate entrance to women and children. Dress respectfully"
Most beautiful and well run attraction in Delhi!,"Akshardhan was highly recommended by everyone who was from India and heard I was headed to Delhi on business. Following a bicycle tour of Old Delhi in the morning (see my review of DelhiByCycle), I easily navigated here via the Metro - it has its own station. I arrive about noon on a Sunday, and despite warnings of the large crowds, was able to move my way through the entrance process with no waiting. Don‚Äôt let the high security of this attraction scare you away, but you will have to deposit your cell phone or other camera equipment prior to entry. They have a very efficient process and everything I could not take in was returned to me. Although there is no entrance fee, I did opt to pay for an English guide book and tickets to the three experience shows. Sum total: less than Rs500 ($8), and well worth it.  The experiences included movies and a boat ride through life-size dioramas where characters came to life to contributed the experience. I was part of a small group of English speaking guests who were seamlessly directed into special queues so we could understand the dialogue. During the movie. The large auditorium I was provided special headphones for the English track.The shows were on par with what I experienced at Disney‚Äôs Epcot last time I was there, and were designed to teach me about the life and legacy of Swaminarayan.  Everything was very professional and done in a manner that was easy to understand. After the experiences, I walked around the outside and then entered the Mandir, which is a celebration of Swaminarayan‚Äòs life. The architecture and detail of the stone carvings are amazing. Construction was completed in 2005 (where did they get the craftsmen!) so everything was in good order, although there were some improvement projects already underway that limited access to some areas. After exploring the Mandir, I went to the gardens, where they have tributes to famous Indians, including women - who impacted India and the world. The gardens were immaculate - well-tended and no trash anywhere. Now I was hungry. Having been told by my company nurse back in the States not to try the food from street vendors in Delhi, I found the vendors around the Akshardhan food court a safe place for a westerner to explore things like Chaat, which was availability in several styles. I think I spent less than Rs400 on lunch and it all tasted great. The good bargains extended into the gift shop, where t-shirts and hats could be found for around Rs250/each ($3). I also picked up a book of color pictures (since I could not take my own) - that set me back Rs50 (<$1).  I think the whole visit cost me less than $20usd, including gifts for family members back home. Overall, Akshardhan is a MUST SEE if you pass through Delhi. Incredible architecture and caving, rich cultural learning experience, beautiful, well-kept grounds, and great food and gift value. I only regret I did not time my visit to allow me to see the water/light show in the evenings, but if I return to Delhi, you can bet I will be back."
Skippable,"Of all the sites I visited during my 10-day stay in Delhi, this was probably my least favorite. It's impressive in its scale, detail, and opulence, but it gave me commercial, megachurch vibes. They don't allow visitors to take photos inside the grounds. That may be in order to preserve the sanctity of the space, but I suspect it's because they want you to pay their photographers for ""official"" photos. Definitely not on the must-visit list."
Jai Sriram,on the way its a nice place to stopover and enjoy the park. great parking and nearby metro connectivity is good
Temple vibes,One of the best architecture I have ever seen . It is really beautifully built . It is a piece of beauty and peace .
Awesome,"Good experience, spend almost whole day from 01pm-8:30pm.boating and lighting programs are spectacular."
Amazing Akshardham,"Akshardham visit was a memorable one. Peaceful and clean environment. Good details of the Swami Narayan's teachings. Playground for kids and refreshment makes the trip enjoyable,"
Delhi Tour,Definitely it will be first choice of architecture lovers. Must visit place. Mainly this temple is belong to Indian saint Swami Narayan.
A valuable architectural,Akshardham temple is the largest temple in the world as we all know and this temple is spread in acres of land. Beauty of handcrafted work will surprise you as this temple is situated next to Yamuna bank river gives amazing view specially in night to visit this temple.As this temple spread in acres of land One person need to walk 2 to 3 days to visit this temple completely.
Half day,A must place to visit.the grand temple and superb carvings.if you go there by 2-3pm.have a good lunch at the food court from veg thali to all different snacks..then must see the exhibition 3 in 1 ticket that takes you through the life and teachings of swami narayan. The shows are in hindi and english.also stay for the water show which is spectacular!no mobiles no food allowed inside..very close to akshardham metro..had a great visit.
Just WOW!,"We didn't have long here and wish we could have taken more time as there's so much to see. Don't miss the boat ride, it was a fascinating journey through India's spiritual and social history, really interesting and good fun.  Akshardham is an intriguing mix of spiritual and theme park and gobsmacking scale."
Well worth a visit.,"We visited the temple during our stay in Delhi. The detail in the temple is exquisite. The light show is good but we were a little jet lagged and cold, and we have seen light shows in other places around the world so it didn‚Äôt blow us away but the temple is definitely worth a visit.Unfortunately you cannot take your phones or cameras in and have to leave them stored aat the door."
NIce place to visit with family and friends.,Marvelous architecture. Must visit place in Delhi if you are visiting with family or friends. Light show at evening is absolutely amazing.
Astonishing new temple,"If you‚Äôre looking for antique constructions, this temple is not the most appropriate, however if you‚Äôre looking for a high expression of Hindu architecture beauty, the place is highly worth a visit. Get ready for long cues over the weekends and it‚Äôs better to go having many hours available, to manage to also see the shows."
Beautiful and a great value ,Though we prefer older sites with more history this place is beautiful!  And it gives a short understandable history lesson about the guru to whom it is dedicated. And it is an excellent value as it is almost free to get in. The food there is also very inexpensive ($2US!) and the cool products in the gift shop are also an amazing deal. Note that no cameras are allowed. But for 50 rupees ($0.75US) they will take a professional photo of you and print it out. This must be in your things to do in Delhi.
Wonderful and  monumental temple! ,"Beautiful and imposing temple. I completely recommend a visit.Photos are not permitted inside, just contemplate and keep in your memory :) Easy to access, underground station close to the temple, about 5min walk. The water and light show in the evening is magical and very well produced, even if you don‚Äôt understand what they are saying!!"
"CRAZY, TIME CONSUMONG SECURITY","The temple is gorgeous, but by the time we finally got to it after going through lines to store our cell phones, then a separate security line and a quick bite, I had had enough.  Actually there was security to park the car, too. We walked around the outside of the actual temple which is gorgeous.  I just didn‚Äôt have it in me after several hours of other sites in Delhi to take off my shoes and socks and climb the steps to see the jewels in the ceiling and a gold statue which you can also see outside. I think the outside is the star of the show anyway.  If you have the time, plan on most of a day as it is like a Hindu Disneyland with a boat ride and a movie and lord (Krishna) knows what else.  At sunset is a light show at the stepped wells.  There may be more for all I know.  The food court is good but the restrooms, although fairly clean and modern have water on the floor so your slab can get pretty wet if you are not careful, at least I hope it was just water!."
Amazing,It needs at least one full day to see. I wish I could have some more time to see it. It's really amazing.
Mrs Nancy Bheem,This place has captured my heart. The story behind the history of this place is phenomenal.i enjoyed the architecture and the view is something i will cherish forever.
laser show ans main temple,"I visited Akshardham temple, after months of planning. It was a slight disappointment. The grandeur looks nice from a distance. Main temple is carved well. Laser show is appreciable. Worth a visit, but dont have high expectations! Expect long waiting for most exhibitions/shows."
Amazing and Huge Temple,"This gives us a very good impression of Delhi. The temple is too huge that our 3hours time is too less to roam around this area. Food and other items here are affordable.Warning: mobile phones and camera are not allowed during our visit, extreme security checking. There is a free locker room in case you have this items with you."
Amazing,The Hindu temple was amazing. There were lots of people visiting the temple. Be prepared to be pushed along the cue to enter as you will be  separated from your partner (male/female) while entering the site. With lots of people you can get lost.
 New,"This is not an old temple (built in 2005 I think), but it is well made. Would probably recommend to avoid during high season, it looks like it could become very crowded."
Large modern Hindu temple on outskirts of Delhi,A beautiful site but for me that fact that it was only build C 2005 meant that there was no historical interest. The security whilst understandable was overly stringent at this temple - no mobile phones when you can take them into the Taj Mahal? 1 hour max needed here if you fancy the metro ride.
Absolutely breathtaking!,"Thought I‚Äôd just pop in to see this place...left 4 hours later and never saw it all. Book it all - especially the water show. Well worth the $6 it cost - yes - that is not a typo!!! If you have to chose between the Taj and this, choose this!!!"
sculpture amazing,"light n sound show was very good .kshardham or Swaminarayan Akshardham complex is a Hindu temple, and a spiritual-cultural campus in Delhi, India. Also referred to as Akshardham Temple or Swaminarayan Akshardham, the complex displays millennia of traditional Hindu and Indian culture,"
Very nice Religious and Lot of fun,"It is one of the Most beautiful monument near the bank of river Yamuna well connected with public transport and Metro from the main delhi city and New Delhi, The evening lezor show and water show is amazing."
Serenity in the busy city,"If you want to escape hustle and bustle of Delhi, take a short metro trip and go to this temple complex. It is interesting, serene, touching. Remember though, you will be asked to leave everything in the locker - no photographs. So you won't see tourists with selfie sticks :) The entry is free, but if you want to see some attractions - like a movie and an exhibition - you have to buy a ticket. I loved the movie about the origin, about the young Swaminarayan. All in all - worth visiting!"
Best oneüôèüôè,Visiting here with with the friends is a fabulous experience of mine They don't allow travellers to take mobile phone inside the temple And the temple is fabulous from inside üëåThey are also having a colorful fountain show Which is awesome üëèüå†üëèüå†üëè
Very good art work ,I visit swami Narayan temple with friends in November. November is very good time for visit in Delhi because that time not so much cold and weather is fine. This is very big temple you need at least 3 hours to see this temple. In evening time there is light and music show is also there thats very good. Overall all its example of very good art and craft.
"Ornate, commercial, lacked substance","Impressively large and ornate, somewhat commercialized with very strict security. I did not connect with this spiritual site like other sites we visited."
A thing of sheer beauty !,"An architectural marvel  and a piece of art and  beauty in stone ! This  is what this temple all about . Going there is quite an exhilarating and soul soothing experience . So even if you are not religious or not interested in Hindu temples , this is a must go place for Indians as well foreign tourists . The prashad i.e. Khichdi / Rissotto is a must try thing in their food court . The boat ride and thematic gardens are  also a must to do thing . However , since the temple attracts huge crowds , pl plan your visit in advance by visiting their website which is a really very good website . Yes they have dress code , so cover yourself full , no short or body exposing dresses . You could get the wraps/sarong  to cover your legs against a security deposit . Very strict about security , so better not carry any valuables , though they have have free cloak room.  Wheel chairs are available . keep a min of 3 hours for the tour ."
We added this site on our first (extra) day.,Well worth the effort to get there.So amazing! This site was highly recommended to us so we went on our one free day.
Peaceful place,One of the best place if you are willing to spent some time in peace and relief your brain.if you want to know more simply take ticket and see the history and cultural importance of this temple
Mesmerising place,One and only place in Delhi which leaves you in peaceful mode when you visit there. Apart form swaminarayan temple you can know about life of swaminarayan by opting for the ticket of 5 hours  which gives you how the temple arose and importance of god in our daily life
Must seen in Delhi,"Very special temple , its Hindu Temple , can not allowed camera, phone or anything to visit , check security much more than in airport. But really very beautiful temple ."
Amazing place.,I was surprised to see such a beautiful place in Delhi.I must say it‚Äôs one of the beautiful place I have ever seen In my life.We had a great inspiration experience in all of your activity...However I have no photos of that place as phones were not allowed inside but anyways was blessed to visit there!
visit to akshardham,my visit to akshardham in November 2019 was awesome.its so peaceful inside even it is in the center of Delhi and outside its so noisy. cant believe there such a peaceful and beautiful place. the structure of the temple is something everyone should see. its a marvel of the world not only of India. if you go to Delhi then make it a must to visit this place.
Student Visit,Amazing History there and good sites to visit as a group or individual. A lot of Indian history stored there given a chance i will visit again.
Outing with friends,A very beautiful temple with well managed infrastructure and arrangements. Wide options with all vegetarian Spread. Value for money with reasonable price and good quality
Food ‚ù§Ô∏è,Food here tastes super tasty and always fresh. They won‚Äôt give you a single chance to complain about the food. I always go there just for the food.‚ù§Ô∏è
Modern Marvel,"Do go on a weekday to avoid the serpentine queues. Stroll at your own pace and soak in the beauty. Not a typical temple, no poojas or aarthis, but the structure is amazing. A near by food court to quench your hunger."
Akshardham temple visit,"Temple is beautifully build with excellent infrastructure and facilities must visit place,specially kids will love the place"
It is magic,"Do you want to leave this world for a  couple of minutes, visit Akshardham. Witness miracles unfold right in front of your eyes...."
Wow just wow,The steer beauty of this temple was memorizing. Its definitely worth a visit. I compared the temple complex like a visit to a Disney theme park. The sad part was that no photos were allowed.
heaven on earth,Unbelievably beautiful creation. it seems that you are in heaven. the beauty and the cleanliness of the campus is amazing. although security is tight and time consuming but its an experience nobody should miss. Easily the best and must place to visit
Stunning,Absolutely breathtaking architecture! We were all stunned by its beauty and thoroughly enjoyed our visit.
Amazing!,"I thought this would be a 2 hour visit but ended up staying for most of the day. There's so much to see and do here, and to think that this wonderful place was built so recently and by volunteers makes it all the more incredible."
A breathtaking experience ,This place is absolutely breathtaking. Although not as old as the majority of landmarks in Delhi you would not even know once you step inside. Photography is not allowed including the use of mobile phones and very little possessions are allowed inside. I think this makes the experience even more special
Amazing temple,"What an amazing place , tours and water / light show was fantastic , only let down by restriction on camera - mobile ."
So many amazing things to see here!,"This place was our first we visited in India and it's simply stunning - get a guide or you'll miss lots, allow plenty of time and visit the gift shop there are bargains to be had here!"
Worth a visit,"Akshardham is your go-to attraction if you are deciding out of Humayun‚Äôs tomb, qutub minar and other monumnets in Delhi. You can‚Äôt take photos inside but it is an impressive and grand complex. There‚Äôs paintings and information about the history of the religion and this is really interesting."
Hindu theme park on steroids,"Went in mid-afternoon when crowds were moderate but not huge. Very very tight security presence around the temple compound - armed police, numerous security checks including full body searches - and no mobile phones or bags allowed inside. A bit of an ordeal just to get in.Once inside, the temple complex is v impressive - the colonnade and temple are lavishly sculpted and decorated and there is a huge area for ""water shows"" and other performances. Was slightly confused why there was no mention of any Hindu Gods or other Hindu teachings other than those by the Swami - it didn't teach me very much about the religion in this sense. I also found the ridiculous number of carvings of naked women slightly at odds with the teachings of modesty throughout the temple.The complex also has numerous places for pictures to be taken (for a fee), a food court and a children's playground, which shows it is geared up for a lot of visitors, but is religion taking a backseat to money making? It left more questions than answers."
Magnificent architecture,"The marble architecture is simply magnificent. The entry is free and no mobiles are allowed inside the premises.Though the temple feel missing, it's worth a visit as a standalone modern day architectural beauty."
visting,shame it's supposed to be a temple but more of a show case in a small. No presence of any spiritual feel. entrance is more difficult then going through airport security. if you looking for spiritual feel you won't find it here.
Hindu Temples Arksharmham,This complex of buildings often does not hit the tourist agenda as it is very new. However it is a ‚Äúmust see‚Äù for its incredible architecture and for its grandeur. The story behind the building is amazing. Almost 100% locals as visitors so no beggars or hawkers. Worth the visit.
Nice architecture,"This modern architecture is impressive, nice detailed decoration and the place was clean.  We went on a very quiet day so we got in very quickly, no queues.  We have also joined the boat-ride explaining the history of India.  Recommended!"
Peace ,Most secureMost peacefulMost beautiful placeIt's must visit place if u r in Delhi...Opening day from Tuesday to SundayClosing day Monday
Absolutely Incredible,A must-see in Delhi.  It is an amazing building that ranks up with the great places of worship in the world.  The fact that it was built in 2005 makes it even more incredible.  Do not miss it.
Modern temple,"+ Free admission+ Impressive stone carvings + Water and beverages inside is not overpriced. Since there are strict rules regarding entrance and the free admission, I was positively surprised by that.+/- Strict rules (no mobile phone, etc). There was a terror attack in the past. Thus it is kind of understandable. - As others pointed out - it feels like Disneyland. It‚Äòs fairly crowded and since everything is new, it has this amusement park style to it. There is also a boat ride (not free)."
Akshardham visit,"Marvelous, unbelievable monument constructed in independent India. Highly organized, perfectly clean, spacious to accommodate  large crowded. Only place in NCR where in boat show, one can have glimpse of great sanatan history and tradition of Bharat."
"Temple is beautiful, exhibitions are rubbish","The Akshardham is a temple of the Swaminarayan Hindu sect. For a religious destination, there‚Äôs oddly a lot of (paid for) attractions in the temple complex, but the focal point of the complex is the Akshardham Mandir, with its lavishly decorated walls and the large gilded sculpture of Swaminarayan surrounded by sculptures of his followers.There‚Äôs an exhibition of Indian heritage with questionable historiography which heavily suggests certain things were invented or discovered in India in the improbable ancient past. If you have a good amount of knowledge of history, I would not waste your money on that exhibition.Another important thing to note is that cameras, including camera phones are not permitted inside and you need to leave it in the cloakroom. The security guards enforces this strictly. I‚Äôm told this is for security reasons, but ironically, you can have your photo taken by an official photographer inside and of course you need to pay for the photo.The temple is beautiful and I thought it was worth visiting along for that. I did think that the complex is sadly commercialised and the historiography is cringeworthy."
Depicts Hindu Culture,Hindu culture depicted from the ages in one place. there are 2 halls and a boat ride and words fall short for comparison to the awesome experience we had. Easily takes 5-6 hrs to view and the evening light n water show is the icing on the cake. the exquisite carvings in the main temple of swami narayan are worthy of accurate viewing. proud that we have sculptors of the highest quality even in this age. there are food courts which are evenly priced and keep your belly full. Best is to visit around 12:30 pm so that you can have lunch and also see the lighting in the evening.NOTE - authorities should see that the Time taken at mobile counter & the security check-in for women to be reduced. it took my wife & daughter 30 mnts to finish the security check-in.
Amazing !,"A true landmark of Delhi in the years to come ! A must visit, comparable, or, even better than the old landmarks of Delhi like the Qutub Minar or other such places."
A Must Visit Place,"If you are in Delhi, you must visit this place. You can plan for a full day visit here. Avoid visiting here in summers as it is very hot and the floors are like burning one. You can enjoy this place in terms of religious as we well as a picnic spot. You cannot miss the evening show. Their restaurant is also very good and you will get a variety of tasty meals and at a very reasonable price (probably at no profit no loss basis)."
A must visit place,Akshardham is one of the most beautiful place in Delhi and one must visit it if he/she is in Delhi. The fountainShow is awesome
Good place to visit,Swaminarayan Akshardham is nice place to visit while you are at Delhi. It is well maintained religious place where your time will not go vain.
Not one to be missed!,"Visited for the 2nd time after more than a decade...the place is simply outstanding. It stands out for its architectural grandeur, oneness with nature and messaging about the majesty of ancient India. You need at least 6 hours to do full justice...and it deserves them, at least!"
incomparable place!,"Modern, but not inferior in beauty and skill to ancient temples. The control is very seriously checked even by electronic clocks. Be prepared to put all your belongings in a storage room. You can‚Äôt take pictures. Rely on your memory"
Beautiful and Divine,"Plus points :Easy Metro AccessibilityBeautiful TempleLush GardensLight and Laser show in the evening.Timings : Tuesday to SundayFirst Entry: 9:30amLast Entry: 6:30pmMonday ClosedVeg Food court.No Negative Points. Just remember, Mobiles and handbags are not allowed inside the temple premesis. So, either leave them in car or deposit with Temple authorities."
Great swaminarayan temple,The temple is built on huge ground..And has great architecture..Loved visiting here..You can have a peace and to get a good breeze of pure air..
Akshardham,It is typical Hindu temple. 3-4 hrs required for a show round. everywhere neat and clean. no cameras even mobiles also not allowed in the compound . the light and water show was fantastic . Best time to visit is after 4 pm
Great divine temple,The temple is well built and Best place to have peace and silence from your daily hectic schedule..It is also best for family outing...The architecture is best and great..
A must visit place,Buzzing with crowd this place has really gained popularity in past years. On a weekend or a public holiday there are long queues. Nothing is allowed inside not even mobile phones. The campus is really big and neat and clean. Better to visit in winters . Also a laser light and sound show is performed in the evenings so plan ur visit accordingly. Typically one would need around 3 to 4 hrs to completely visit the place.
Extravagant & New,"This is a beautiful Hindu temple with traditional craftsmanship. From the detailed engravings to the interior marble work, and they did a fantastic job in building a classical Hindu temple in today‚Äôs times. It‚Äôs a pity you are not allowed to take cameras or mobile phones inside. This place is clean, new, and not swarming with tourists. They even have a playground for young children that‚Äôs clean and well maintained."
"Super foundation, amazing temple, overkill on selling themselves. ",World class sight for exceptional and thoughtful facilities and architecture. Be very careful with what you bring to the temple as you must check all electronic devices and bags. Travel light. Only disappointment is the overkill on selling their swami and sect‚Äôs religion and I only wished to see more results of their work throughout the world and how they spread their good work and love.
Worth a visit - easy to get via metro,"Ornate marble and sandstone, though feels a bit run down given it was constructed in 2005. Leave your phones at home / hotel as they are not allowed, and it will be a faff to check in. Bring some socks as you will need to take your shoes off to enter. Had a great masala dosa at the canteen (‚Çπ80)."
"stunning, dont miss!","went there in the evening around sunset, security like is long but efficient and everyone was nice. you need to leave everything at the enterance and you get it when you return. the place is stunning, so beautiful and impressive, i stayed for the light water show and i would skip it if you are not a kid and dont understand the language. food was also not very good to eat before you go there and come to appreciate the place."
Awesome!`,There was a boat ride and light show! It was really native and amazing! I think it was a special one!
Beautiful temple but a bit too ,"The main temple and the area are amazing to see. It's a must! However, the other activities (food court and shows) are too much like attraction park making the place less spiritual. Thought the water show is really a thing to see. The other exibitions feel more like advertisment. Before going there take care that no electronic devices nor food is allowed inside."
Wow place ,Must visit place in Delhi its beautifully sculpted and the detail of the sculpture is really food.The place is quite crowded and the food is quite expensive inside the aksahrdham.
Interesting place,"I visited it among my day tour in Delhi. It is very interesting place. Unfortunately, my guide was not good in English to describe it to me. Instead he let me buy the book by $10 to read it in my own pace. I would preferred to understand its story while visiting. There were some explaining signs but not enough for one who didn‚Äôt know about it beforehand"
Fascinating ,It is a history of their meanings and very cleverly achieved. Support for English speakers and organised. Worth the effort to get there in the traffic.
Spiritual Tour,"Impressive, thought provoking, interesting and weary well organised. A great insight to the Hindu philosophy and other aspects of life. Visit in the afternoon to get access to the light show. Brilliant"
Beautiful. Don¬¥t miss!,Very nice place. You are not allowed to bring mobil or camera in. You can buy food/sack/drinks inside.
Beautiful architecture and craftsmanship,"Had the pleasure to visit Swaminarayan Akshardham. This place is a an architectural gem. It was completed in 2002 and took six years to build. The craftsmanship and detail in the interior and exterior of this place is breathtaking. It is refreshing to know that this type of talent, which I associated with workmanship that is hundreds of years old, still exists today. We were told that there are 33 million gods in the Hindu religion (please verify this on your own) and most of these gods are represented in carvings and statues in this building. It is an active place of worship and it requires that shoes be removed when walking into the building. Shoes are placed in a bag which is handed to an attendant. There is no waiting in giving or retrieving shoes. Please be aware that one is not allowed to take cameras, food or any other items into the property. These items should be locked up in the car before going in. One should stop at a place about a mile from temple to take a photograph of the building otherwise you will not be able to capture it. Please be aware that there are long security lines to get in. Men will go in one entrance while women will enter through a different line. It is easy to meet up at the courtyard. My wife and I did so without difficulty. We are beyond happy that we had the opportunity to visit. Allow about two hours for visit"
It looks very old but just 20 years old,Looks very good but the surprising part is not that old.. The details and workmanship is great.. Don't take your phone with you as it was forbidden to take.
Beautiful,"Big car park, amazing building, be prepare to take off your shoes. In the evening they do light shows with water fountains."
Visit to Akshardham Mandir New Delhi,"Four of us went to visit Akshardham on a Friday afternoon ... all for the first time.... 3 seniors and 1 adult.We went by car... immediately impressed by the clear sign boards with instructions to guide a visitor coming to Akshardham. In addition to the signboards, there are also a large number of volunteers to assist you.Plenty of space in the car park. Wheel chairs available for those who need them.No cell phones,cameras,bags etc are allowed to be carried into Akshardham. Cloakroom facilities are available. You can carry your purse. You go through a security screening process at entry. Entry to the Mandir itself is free but there are three permanent exhibitions on the premises for which should you choose to go, you have to buy a ticket at Rs. 220 per adult and Rs. 170 per senior. This ticket entitles you to visit one, two or all three exhibitions.Ticket counters are located inside the complex after security screening. There are also ticketed Rs.80 per person (no concession) musical fountains light shows in the evening after sunset... we attended one at 6.15 pm (winter timing) .... later there was another show at 7.15 pm.The first exhibition using robotic models that depict the life of Swaminarayan was interesting. Takes about 50 minutes. We skipped the second for lack of time. The 3rd is a 10-12 minutes mechanised boat ride through India's achievements in ancient times.But the highlight of the evening was the musical fountains light and laser show.... one of the most spectacular shows of this kind anywhere in the world... very nice!Akshardham complex is very well designed... lots of places for refreshments... toilets and washroom facilities are available in plenty and are clean and well maintained.There is a large restaurant complex as also souvenir shops. Overall, we spent about 3.5 hours... an enjoyable experience at Akshardham."
Sister's visit to Akshardham,"Firstly, Akshardham was constructed in Yamuna's catchment area. It is therefore very dangerous for Delhi. God forbid something like Chennai happens here. Delhi may flood.It is a grand temple. Beautiful architecture. Carvings are simply great.But it is not a normal temple. It is dedicated to Swaminarayan. After sometime his bio starts getting on your nerves.But it well organised. Worth a vist may be."
AMAZING!,No need to visit any other place - just spend your days soaking up this wonderful complex. There is so many things to see and learn. The guides are well spoken and help you answer any questions you have.
Heaven on the Earth.,If you are in Delhi need some peace be here. It just knocks you down coming form the hustle bustle of the city.
Best place to vist in delhi,"Upcoming journeyTraveler's storyThe best part is the best part is boat trip, it's also unique and the mandir part is also very good.The whole place is like an amazing story about Swami Narayan in a fairy tale. Perfectly illustrates Indian history and culture. I can't say how amazing the water show is at sunset. Unfortunately this place is a must see ...One of the best tourist attractions in Delhi. Amazing architecture, amazing technology, especially musical fountains, showcase the amazing food and children that every old man should visit.IntroduceGreat site structure, nice thematic shows, diorama and presentations I max. It is a must to see if visitors who despise religion have free time half a day. This is the creation of a person in five years ...

Do not take your phone or camera after waiting a long line before entering. It is a must see for those who want to spend time in a quiet place. Walking or climbing stairs is included, but it is worth the peace and tranquility you have experienced in the wonderful temples."
An Amazing Place of Worship,"This is a huge complex, with serious security. Expect long line-ups before entering, and do not bring cell phones or cameras. It's a real shame that photography is not permitted, but I can understand and accept the rationale.However, once inside, what an experience: the craftmanship that went into constructing the temple, its beauty, the obvious devotion, all made this a very special venue."
Beautiful. Worth a visit.,It is closed on Monday. One must keep 3 to 4 hours to see it. If you go in the evening you can see the musical fountains. The canteen is superb and pocket friendly. The 3 shows are good but nauka vihar is the best. The shows are priced.
A serene place,"For people who love to spend some time in a serene place, this is a must visit location. Though it involves a lot of walking and walking up the stairs, the exertion is worth the peace and tranquility that one experiences inside the marvelous temple.There are several exhibitions also in the precincts, which we did not visit for want of time as it will take more than 2 hours to go through the exhibitions. The entry to the exhibitions is also priced.They have a food court that serves tea/coffee and snacks (may be lunch and dinner also but we visited in the morning so not sure) at reasonable rates and of good quality.Cameras and mobiles are not allowed inside the temple are which have to be deposited in the lockers provided by the Institution.Wheel Chairs are also available for aged people and those who have difficulty walking. A nice place to visit if you are in Delhi."
Must visit tourist attraction,A beautiful temple complex with must see shows and good food court. Will take minimum three hours. Extensive security checks and can't carry bags etc though they have deposit windows. Crowded during weekends. Well worth a visit
very peaceful place of Delhi,"This is one of the best place to visit in Delhi and one of the best temple in India. It's so so peaceful, clean, beautiful and well maintained place. The water show is just more than perfect. The cultures, traditions and biodiversity of India has been depicted in it's wall with exceptional beauty. Your visit to Delhi would be incomplete if you don't go to this place."
WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE,Great place to visit. This visit rejuvenated my inner peace. One must visit and see the beauty and calmness
"Akshardham Mandir, New Delhi","Swaminarayan Akshardham Temple located in East Delhi. Its depict Indian culture, architecture, and spirituality. Beneath the central dome of the temple is an 11-foot-tall statue of Swami Narayan situated. "
A long walk but worth it,"We visited the Akshardham late in the day following a full day of sightseeing.  The walk from the parking area to the entrance looked daunting, followed by a long walk to the entrance to the building BUT even the flight of stairs was worth seeing the interior of this incredible‚Ä¶"
Too Luxurious,"The complex is a beautifully ornate structure carved by 7,000 sculptors out of pink sandstone and white marble with over 20,000 statues. It also has beautiful gardens, water fountains, and more."
Akshardham Key,This place is excellent for seeing a honey visit. Its building are very old and beautiful. This is a attracting place.
Must to visit in delhi,"A must place to visit in Delhi.. Temple remain closed on monday...nearest metro is Akshardham on netro Blue Line..it is walking of 200 metre..avoid getting fauled by Auto drivers adking you to drop at temple gate... Main temple is free...but cultural boat ride, light show will‚Ä¶"
Really nice place to visit,"Really nice place, lots to see. You should go before the water show begins. Be prepare to keep cameras out side because not allowed. The place is beutifull and monumental"
New temple old vibe,"This amazing temple was completed in 2005, but is reminiscent of older Indian temples.The craftsmanship is intricate and lovely. The ceilings are carved with a 3D effect and the rest of the grounds are very detailed and beautiful as well.  You can‚Äôt bring any phones or cameras and be prepared to check your bag. It was well worth the visit and I would highly recommend it."
Great Place,Great temple and interesting to hear about it. Felt a little too commercialized. Long queues to enter the place.
Water and lights show,"We visited Akshardham Temple in Delhi to view the water and light show. It was beautiful, spectacular and much much more.Some tips and info for first time visitors:The show is in Hindi but enjoyed it anyway.No phones or bags or cameras are allowed in the temple. Only small sling bags.There is a tight security protocol. Get to the temple at least 30 before the start of the show. You can get yourself some food ,popcorn and drinks in the temples and then find a spot to watch the show.It really is worth seeing and best of all only INR80 per person."
Beautiful when it‚Äôs finished ,This was a beautiful temple to visit. The intricacies of the god representations are beautiful. You have to take off your shoes and no bags or cameras are permitted. There are stairs and a very long walk so not suitable for everyone. Still working on parts of the temple.
Not a priority,"This is the new temple.  It is impressive and very large.  It‚Äôs a must if you practice this faith.  I found it dull by comparison to the many other rich historical palaces and temples and historic sites and sights in Delhi.  I‚Äôd like to have the 2 hours back, actually.  We did not visit at night for the water and light show.  The pictures remind me of the Bellagio in Las Vegas."
India in highlights,Akshardham is naturally quite easily accessible from Delhi. It is very well organised and provides an interesting insight into Ancient India in a couple of their guided tours.
Definitely a must see!,"This is a religious temple about 15 minutes from center Delhi. Its a definitely a must see. Here are some suggestions: Go early, when the temple opens. It gets crazy as the day goes on. We spent about 35 minutes or getting through security. The line was even longer when we were leaving. Leave most, if not all, your stuff in the car. They have very strict rules regarding cell phones, purses, umbrellas, bag packs, etc. If you have these with you, you'll have to put them in a locker (and the line for the lockers is another 40+ minutes on top of security). I literally only had my ID, credit card, and cash per suggestion by our tour guide. The architecture and art was definitely amazing, but everything was constructed in 2005, with modern machinery,  so that took some luster out of my review.  Food here is very clean, enjoyed a traditional Indian lunch. Credit card accepted."
Great Marvel of 21st Centrury,"This temple is located on the outskirts. Good to visit with family, but too much security. Need minimum 3 hours to see it completely and 1 hour for security and other checks.Although no enterance Tickets, but no mobile phones allowed inside and need to pay Rs 50 for the photo inside the temple."
Beautiful place to visit in Delhi,This is one of the most beautiful place to visit when you are in Delhi. The evenings are wonderful with lighting and laser shows near the fountain. Please make sure you wait for sunset and view the fountain with the light show. This is truely worth it. I didnot find the other rides and shows they offer really worth. The temple itself is so opulent and dazzling. I loved the visit.
Beautiful temple ,"Loved the temple architecture and the cleanliness all over. Lots of areas were under renovation but inspite of same, it was worth it. There are water shows and documentaries to watch. Food courts and what not. Great place to take your entire family and spend 2-3 hours there."
Everyone should visit this,The way they handled the crowd is awesome. It is not something like hyped advertisement. Simply awesome
Amazing architecture! ,"Visited this temple and was absolutely blown away, if it is not on your list, add it immediately!!!Of course when you are in India, you see dozens of temples and they all start to blur into one after a while haha but this is definitely worth the effort! They are extremely strict with security and no phones, leather items and a long list of about 30 items are banned.Once you have looked all through the temple, seen a show etc there is food like fries, ice cream, popcorn etc and a gift shop at the end so do take some money in with youAs no mobile phones are allowed in they also have a photographer in there for if you want your photo taken with the temple, it is the most impressive from the inside though!"
Very cultural place,"This is a large cultural Complex. With temple in the middle and exhibitions (chargeable at 220 Rp for exhibition, water show and boat ride). Apparently it‚Äôs also open at night for the exhibitions. The paid exhibition, ride and show will take about 105 min. But could be shorter. We didn‚Äôt go for the paid portion because we don‚Äôt have enough time. Don‚Äôt forget the small temple behind the large temple. You cannot bring camera, back pack n food  in. There‚Äôs cloak room. Entrance is free. Expect queue time."
Modern temple,"Pretty temple, with nice carving on the outside and a complete lack of spirituality. Getting though security takes an age and feels completely over the top.  Considering this was only built in 2005 it already has large areas under reconstruction/repair. As cameras and phones aren‚Äôt allowed the site is a nice break from all the locals asking for selfies."
Beautiful temple!,Me and my children (8 and 10) had a wonderful time visiting this temple.  Beautiful artwork.  Loved that no cameras were allowed which allowed us to just enjoy the beauty of the structure.
Positive vibes,"Beautiful place. You can spend min 4 - 6 hours. Fountains are amazing. Must to see. Free entrance. There are place for food and buy goods for very good prices. So, well organized spiritual and rest place."
Excellent,I visited this place with families of friends. Temple was excellent and very beautiful with lot of carvings. It is a must place to visit. There are 3 shows (in 1 package) worth watching. In the evening they organise water show which I found wonderful. All these shows are with tickets. Temple visit is free. Restaurant with wide choice is available. Food is veg with no onion and garlic. Free lockers are available for keeping mobile etc. Metro station is about 350 m. Ample car parking is available with ticket. Total time required for all shows and visit is 4-5 hours.
Akshardham,"A must visit for everyone. Makes you feel very proud. Very clean, very organized and so beautiful. The temple 8s beautiful, the entire complex us spectacular. The display of Indian history through tablaues is very well done and informative."
Must see in Delhi,"This is a beautiful Hindu temple open to all!  This is as beautiful as any church in Europe, and a must see if visiting Delhi!"
A unique experience in Delhi,This is a unique experience. This place does not allow phones/cameras and has some rules regarding clothing. However nothing to worry about as they provide lockers to store your belongings and also a sarong to wear for a fully-refundable fee. Pro-Tip: Avoid carrying mobiles and cameras. Wear clothes that cover your arms and knees to avoid wasting time in the queues near the lockers.There is no entry fee. However they charge for the tickets tos the exhibits and water fountain. We reached the place at 6:35pm and missed the last show of the exhibitions. However we got to experience the water fountain. The water fountain show is a must watch and involves some high end projection technology as well. Tip 2: Reach the place by 5pm so that you have enough time to see and experience all the attractions.
Keep your expectations HIGH!,this place is a MUST-SEE if you are in Delhi.the temple is beautiful. the details in every pillar are outstanding and done with purpose.  the main temple is carved out of marble in the inside.  it really is a technological marvel how the temple was built in only a few years.the temple is held on the backs of elephants (the base of the temple is covered with carvings of elephants depicting their relationship with humans and gods).
Interesting Temple must visit when in Delhi,Interesting and large temple that you should visit when in Delhi. You can catch the metro to this site.
Best Place to Visit,"This is not only religious Spot, but also  a good destination to know the Indian Mythology. Worth place to visit. All visitors are most welcome."
AMAZING,"This was a on our list to see while in deli, BUT this visit was the outstanding memory of our whole trip to India. You can get a cab or rickshaw to this place or if you want to save some money the metro is adjacent. As you approach from the outside you can't really see the grandeur of the temple. Follow the signs to deposit your bags ,camera, phones etc as these are not allowed in to the complex. The storage is free and they take a photo of what you are depositing with your face and you are given a token. Please don't try to sneak your phone etc in as before you go into the complex you are body searched and bags searched by army, and its embossing and a long walk back to the storage lockers.Once you enter the complex and and look right you see the full majesty of the building, it takes your breath away and does something to your soul.Before you can enter leave shoes at the shoe locker and venture inside the splendidly colourful and intricate carvings of the temple.We were lucky to see the Aarti ( service) which was performed at 6pm. We stayed for the light and water show in the evening , try to get a seat high in the auditorium for a great view."
Excellent visit,We visited the Swaminarayan Akshardham early evening to see the site in daylight and then see the night show. The Mandir is spectacular and very welcoming.Strict security makes sure no photos can be taken and the night laser and water show was excellent.
Beautiful temple,"The temple doesnt have even 20 years but it has definitely great atmosphere. The entrance is for free but you cannot enter with any electronics (mobile, camera..) so either you need to leave your stuff in the car or in a cloak room which might take some time."
Peaceful place,"A very peaceful place with modern exhibitions. You can enjoy the peace inside the temple, have good food in the cafeterias and then enjoy a movie and several exhibitions that depict the life story of Swami narayan. A must visit place in delhi."
Highlight of Delhi,"This was a stunning highlight of my trip to Delhi.  Free entry but no cameras or bags allowed and tight security, so be prepared to buy an inexpensive picture book as a momento of your trip. We didn't do any of the side tours or galleries.  The temple itself was absolutely incredible.  Well worth the visit."
Worth a visit,"Wow, such a beautiful temple to visit. Important to note that the entrance closes at 18:30- after they will not let you enter. When we visited in the evening on Tuesday it was very busy. The queues where very long so took us nearly an hour to get through everything. Also no bags or electronics are allowed inside, they are very strict with this however there are lockers where you can check your things into that are safe. The temple itself is so beautiful. We went in the evening so was lovely to see it all lit up. There is also a water and laser show that was definitely worth it. When we went there were two shows at different times and only offered in Hindi, but even if you can‚Äôt understand it‚Äôs awesome to watch. Only costs 80 rupees for the show. Entrance to the temple itself is free."
AKSHARDHAM Experience,"Leave in good time. Take the Metro Blue Line from Karol BaghStation. Nine stops to get there. Just follow,the crowd when leaving Metro. Show is fantastic and monument impressive."
Must visit ,"This is new temple and from it's designed it's look like that it's historic temple. It's well maintained, neat and clean. It's located just near by metro station"
Incredible and stunning buildiing and grounds.,Magnificent structure and fantastically decorated both inside and out. Beautiful setting and manicured gardens. Security check on entry took 20 minutes but was courteous and reassuring.. No entry fee and very good value souvenir shop.
Family trip,Great service. Great driver. Driver was very accommodating. There was a day when my son got sick and he was very helpful.
Beautiful temple ,This temple is worth a visit.  It is beautiful .   No need for a tour guide.   I have been told it is worth going in the evening for the show.
