An Oasis in the City,I love the Denver Botanic Gardens.  it's an oasis within the city to escape to if you love being in a natural environment instead of a concrete world. I enjoy the serenity and calmness I get when I visit there. Their exhibits change so I am constantly learning new things about plants. I am a member so I get to go as many times in a year that I want to.
Wow!,"This is a beautiful and Very expansive garden,. We spent two + hours there. If you like botanical gardens this is a must see."
Amazing,its like an oasis in the middle of downtown. They could let everyone know that many of the exhibits are closed due to covid distancing.
Worth seeing!,"The Botanic Gardens are well worth the time to visit. We came in the fall, but there were plenty of flowers to see. In the winter there will be lights as well. Bring tissues if you have allergies!"
Beautiful + a Chihuly,This garden is on par with other big city Botanic Gardens plus they have a Chihuly!  There are many themed areas and they are all beautifully done!   Unique to Denver Botanic is the area with the metal gates and bee boxes.  They also do a great job with plant identification signs.I know other gardens do this too especially on weekends but it was disappointing with all the buildings closed because of Covid to also have 2 other garden areas closed for special events and photographers blocking areas to take bridal pictures.  Plus a number of people sitting in garden areas with their laptops.   If you can come during the week you probably would not have any areas blocked like this.The Hive salad was a little pricey but delicious and a great setting overlooking the pond
Very Relaxing,"I've been to a lot of gardens around the country and I was impressed with the Denver Botanic Gardens. The place is not huge, but they really do make great use of the space. Due to the pandemic the indoor exhibits are closed, but you will find a lot to see outside. Make sure you go on their website to reserve a time."
BEAUTIFUL,Visited this place with my mom... If you like walking in a peaceful and nice place then you definetly have to go there... took some super stunning pictures also
Enchanted Gardens,Beautifully and serene.  Great escape from the city. Relaxing stroll through gardens with no stress from outside world.
Beautiful Place,This was our first time visiting the Denver Botanical Garden and the overall experience was excellent! The garden staff were friendly and helpful.  The Garden requires a time slot reservation in order to stay within the city coronavirus protocol. The Botanical Garden we're beautiful and well laid out for the visitors.  The Garden shop was open. But it limits the number of people inside.  The cafe was open for food and beverages. The Botanical Garden have free parking available. Worth the visit.
Wonderland,"Unbelievable how much beauty can be crammed into 24 acres! Wonderful, quiet Sunday morning filled with a pleasant surprise around every corner!  Not enough time today.  We’ll be back!"
Beautiful Grounds,The Denver Botanic Gardens are the perfect place for couples to go and check out on a date or families. They have great signage to help you identify many of the plants that they have.
Beautiful Botanic Garden,The garden was small but beautiful.  The refreshments that we had were also good and we were able to socially distance and find a place to enjoy our drinks
Always a winner,We've been here a few times and always love it. So much to explore and places to relax. I love the Japanese gardens and the bonsai collection. And finding the round hobbit archways.
Beautiful,Beautiful gardens all year around--lived in Denver for 20+ yearsWearing a mask in the hot summer is not ideal--but that is the world we live in right now. The staff are going overboard enforcing it though.
Beautiful and a delight,Went on a whim and damn happy we did. The flowers and walk paths were the perfect break from walking around the downtown area.
Beautiful,"A hot day - but not unbearable.  Not crowded (be sure to get your ticket online and show up in your allotted time frame).One place was open for food and beverages.  Everyone was very polite.The gardens are beautiful!  I think with a lot of the venues inside closed, just walking around takes a couple of hours."
Peaceful oasis within Denver,"We enjoyed our visit, even though I was probably the only gardener in our group.  The variety, multiple garden “rooms” and intriguing settings were interesting for all.  We found cool shade in several spots, some entertainment with the eager koi fish in the lovely Japanese garden. (No, we did not feed the fish, although they definitely seemed to expect hand outs.) I will take many simple ideas home to our landscape."
Walking path gardens,The gardens were well maintained and there were hand washing stands throughout. The fountains were not on but it was still nicely kept.
Very pretty :),"Family of four visited on July 4, 2020.  The gardens are very pretty and scenic, if your interested in plants.  Masks were required, even for small children.  A lot of exhibits were closed, but there we a number of accessible restrooms.  Parking was free, but admission for 2 adults and 2 children was around $53."
A top place to visit in Denver,"I loved Denver, and this place was one of the main reasons!I've been to Botanic Gardens all over the world, and this one was in the top tier.We visited during the pandemic--but the place accommodated people very thoughtfully.It's huge, btw, and will take a lot of time to experience.Even if you're not a plant person, you'll enjoy the colors--the details--the meandering walkways."
One of the best I've been to in North America,If you like gardens plan at least two hours here to enjoy and relax.  Great place with lots of Rocky Mountain exhibits.
Picnic at the Gardens,"We went the other evening for a picnic with friends.  It was easy to get tickets and with limited admission, it wasn’t crowded.  We have been there more than once recently and we enjoy the fact that each visit is different based on what plants are in season."
Fun place to walk around and look at nature. Adjacent to a big city park no shortage of things to do highly recommend yo,Fun place to walk around and look at nature. Adjacent to a big city park no shortage of things to do highly recommend you go
Great destination,"I took my extended family here on a rainy day without enough time, but it was still good. There is a lot to see and they have nice paths set up, along with some inside areas to escape the cold/rain. Don't miss the rainforest building; it's really special. There is a very nice gift shop and I have had a lovely lunch before here too."
Beautiful Garden,"We had a wonderful morning with young grandchildren at the Botanic Gardens!  Due to the coronavirus attendance restrictions, there were minimal crowds and the flowers were absolutely gorgeous. There are plenty of shady spots to sit down and relax.  We can’t wait to return!"
wonderful activity for anyone,"A wonderful evening activity for anyone or group. We saw people with snacks and drinks which looked quite relaxing. It could take 30 minutes or all day, depends on how much you like looking at flowers."
I go here to relax,A wonderful place to take a few hours to walk and soak in the wonderful outside plant atmosphere.   It is a stress-reliever for me.

Nice way to spend the day,"Walking thru the gardens is not just about plants--there are sculptures, seating areas to reflect and much more. Gaze at the fish and stand under a tall tree--all nice escapes for the day ."
Disappointing visit - weather and current events played into it,Because of the pandemic all the indoor displays were closed. Outdoors was pretty dead and desolate nothing really was in bloom - no bonsai on display. Nice layout and spread but really nothing much to enjoy maybe because of the weather and the current global event.
Breath taking!!!,We went to the botanic gardens for their winter Christmas display - it was breath taking and a wonderful experience for the entire family - HIGHLY recommended.
Another Enjoyable Visit ,"Early March is possibly not thought of as the best time to visit a Botanic Gardens, however we really enjoyed our visit to the gardens. Spring flowers are blooming and the trees are budding. The Japanese Gardens were looking beautiful. We visited the science building and had an excellent one to one talk on microscopic hairs on plants. Absolutely fascinating. As always, there were beautiful blooming orchids in the hot houses."
Peaceful and serene ,Staff was friendly and view spectacular. A must-see in Denver even if you don’t have a green thumb. The science pyramid is informative and the gardens enchanting.
Probably Better to Visit in Spring or Summer,"There should be a winter discount. Full price for the dome, Chihuly installation and a couple water features seemed excessive. We still enjoyed ourselves though."
Such a peaceful place,"Even when most things are not in bloom, it is relaxing to walk the trails. The greenhouse always has colorful flowers and growth too."
Amazing!,"We love botanic gardens! The Denver gardens are a special treat. No matter what the season, there is something interesting to see. The building that houses the tropical plants and rainforest is a one of a kind, must see, piece of architecture! Throughout the gardens are lovely sitting areas for a quiet moment of observation or a picnic. Two restaurants provide lovely food. During the summer months the Denver Botanic Gardens hosts some pretty big name outdoor concerts where you are welcome to bring your own picnic dinner and bottle of wine. It is just a very special place!"
Magical Place in the Middle of the city,"Awesome peacefully place. Parking on site. If you need to enjoy a beautiful place right in the middle of the city, this it’s the place. Instantly favorite to me. A must tried."
A must visit,"On my business travels I usually make it a point to visit botanical gardens, just to get away from the stresses of work. These sprawling gardens are of the best I’ve seen, even though it’s the dead of winter, I can only imagine how vibrant they are in warmer months. There are indoor exhibits to check out such as a rain forest; a phenomenal display of orchids; unusual plants and trees (eg. coffee & chocolate); a very copacetic Japanese garden with its huge koi pond; a succulents and cacti garden. Etc. If in Denver and you love exploring flora & fauna or you are an avid gardener, I urge you to check out this one, you’ll leave with a heart full of love and peace."
Absolutely beautiful!,This is a beautiful place! It has great variation in the plants available to see. We really enjoyed our time here. You can easily spend two hours or more exploring the beauty.
Beautiful Gardens,"I love gardens and I loved the Denver Botanic Gardens! I am not sure I was able to see everything, but it was a splendid day walking through with beautiful flowers at every turn!! If you are in the area, you must add this to your itinerary and allow many hours to relax and enjoy the beauty!"
It’s a beautiful oasis in the city.,"Loved this place I felt like in the Jardin des Tuileries in Paris. Having a picnic while enjoying flowers and butterflies with my children felt very refreshing, and of course learning interesting fact about plants was a plus."
Best light display ever!,Was such a spectacular display. Was worth the trip for sure. We will definitely be back. Will try a summer trip next time.
Loved it,"Lots of areas inside and out. Enjoyed coffee in the cafe, and explored the many gardens surrounding the building. Gift shop was interesting, and parking was close/reasonable."
Absolutely Stunning Gardens - beyond expectations!,"We'd been to Denver many times before and never made it.  Now we can say we have indeed seen one of the best places to visit in the Denver area.   Not that hard to get to, as we took a bus from downtown right to within a block from the Gardens.It is just too hard to describe in words - and no doubt being there on a wonderful sunny fall day helped - but it was breathtaking.   We wondered around most of the paths, seeing all the various plants and displays.  Enjoyed the architecture, and especilaly the Japanese garden area.   The Gardens are set right within a residential neighborhood, with houses and tall condo buildings going right up to the borders.  So it really does fell like an oasis.  Even though there were many people there, it didn't feel that crowded.Had a nice lunch there as well at the food facility.We will definitely be back since we only had 5 hours to spend and it wasn't enough."
Winter wonderland,Despite it being winter the gardens were lovely with landscapes snow coated! Indoor orchid show was colorful and bright! Significant architecture  housing indoor plants!
BEAUTIFUL PLACE TO SPEND A FEW HOURS,Whenever I go to the Denver Botanic Gardens I feel so relaxed and appreciate the stroll thru the garden. Make sure to take sun screen and wear good walking shoes. You dont want to burn out before you finish your time here. I also love a break at the outside restaurant. The food is above average and you will deserve the rest of sitting and still appreciate your surroundings. Its a great place to visit.
Great place,Great place to stroll. Lots of great pocket areas and beautiful plants and flowers. Love it here. Pizza is good too!
Japanese Garden!!,I live in Cleveland and this is the first botanical garden I have ever been to. The layout is easy to follow and the provided maps add to the ease of navigation. Lots of different themes and foliage make this an must when in Denver. The Japanese Garden is the best!
"Wonderful place, but go when things are in bloom","Just an outstanding place in every way. Beautifully organized and maintained, with a wide variety of species and settings. The japanese garden and lilly pond are particularly great. Good to go during cooler weather, and definitely when things are in full bloom. The cactus room is also just great, as is the tropical building. Never mind, it's all fantastic."
Best botanical gardens I’ve been to,This place is amazing. They have summer concerts. They have the Blossoms of Light holiday lights around Christmas time and fun events all the time. I think everything is reasonable priced inside the gardens. But the best part is being able to bring your own food and drinks in (no glass). I went with my cousins and we just walked around with some wine and snacks till we sat down and ate at one of their outdoor restaurants. They are always changing the flowers and plants around since some don’t live year around. My favorite section was the gardens section built around the Chilhuly glass sculpture. I highly recommend visiting the botanical gardens.
Need to return to visit this gem in the summer!,"I visited this lovely spot in January which is not the best time to visit a botanical garden.  The tropical conservatory was lovely, though, as was the orchid display.  I absolutely loved the Chihuly sculpture that is on display.  I am planning a trip back to Denver this summer so I can see this beautiful garden in all of its glory!"
Even beautiful in the winter,"Parking is free. There is a great gift shop. We went in winter, so outdoor plants are not happening, but there are so many water features that look cool when frozen. Still some coniferous trees that hold up. Also, just seeing the sunrooms, cactus solarium and of course the indoor sort of rainforest dome. Very nice. The orchids were on display and were so beautiful. Amazing detail on petals and leaves. I hadn't been in probably 15+ years. I can't wait to check it out in the spring."
Winter Outside but Cozy Inside,"I really wanted to see the Orchid Exhibit, in which I did (loved it), but I got a lot more than I expected when I entered the tropical area of the garden.  In my opinion the only things that were missing was the white sand and blue ocean water!!"
Holiday Blooming Lights,"Absolutely magical!!! My family and I attended January 3rd. We were unable to park in the Botanic Gardens parking lot so found off site parking (challenging since a lot of the area surrounding the gardens is for permits only) we had a chilly walk of about 4 blocks to the gardens. Our tickets were for 7pm and we got there early but it was not a problem, they let us right in. I was stunned by the amazing light displays and all of the work that would go into creating such a winter wonderland! The pictures I took on my camera just didn't do it justice. There was a projection show of Santa placing presents under a tree in a window of one of the houses that are around the property and even my teen boys thought it was cool! I felt like a little kid walking around with wide eyes and a permanent smile in place. Completely worth the drive to Denver and appropriate for all ages. We loved it and would do it again and again!"
Amazing use of colors and landscaping!,"My hubby and I loved this garden! We were short on time and spent about 1 1/2 hours here, but would have enjoyed staying longer! They are part of a reciprocal garden club so we were able to use our Orlando Garden membership to enter free of charge. Denver has one of the most beautiful gardens we’ve seen out of all the gardens we’ve visited throughout the United States. I’d really love to see them during different seasons! If I’m ever back in the area, I will definitely go again and I’ve already recommended them to friends and family!"
Christmas Lights,We had out of state family visiting at Christmas.  In the past we have visited zoo lights at Christmas and wanted to do something different.  We loved the Christmas lights.  We were kept on a path so as to see everything.  I was so impressed with the experiences we were exposed to.  There were special eye glasses to look through that allowed us to see candy canes on the trees.  We walked through a covered walkway with lights dancing and other such special features.
Beautiful even in the winter,"I haven't been here since I was a child, and the memories flooded! Beautiful pavilion and just amazing plants blooming even in January. A nice, mellow way to spend half a day in Denver."
Visiting the Gardens,"This was a great stop while in Denver.  It was entertaining in the winter, so I can’t imagine what it is like during the summer months.  Sorry that we missed the orchid show."
Should be closed in January,Everything it’s FROZEN! Should be closed or says something before you get tickets. Only wasted time.
A quiet respite in an urban environment,Great botanical garden in a bustling city atmosphere.  Great botanicals displayed-in a serene & peaceful environment & vista.Nice luncheon place @ at reasonable prices.  Good for both adults & children.Places to sit & admire the plants & gardens.
Awesome light show,We decided we would go to the light show at the Botanical gardens and it was definitely worth it. Parking was easy and getting in was a breeze. Even in the summer months it’s a great way to spend an hour or too. Food and drink can be purchased from various eateries in the gardens
Fun outdoor fun ,We went in the spring. Enjoyed the beautiful view. Great place for kids to roam. Lots of natural beauty and exercise
Blossoms of Lights,This was a fabulous evening with my husband and adult daughter. It was quite cold so dress warmly. There are very few areas to warm up and it takes at least 1 1/2 hours to really enjoy the decorations. The lights were beautifully done. Highly recommend.
Love the lights,We come for blossoms of lights every year. It's always a very well put together event. The light show at the end is always spectacular
November treat,Fab way to spend 1/2 day. Even in November when most sensible plants are hiding in the ground there is much to marvel at.
Blossoms of Light Delight,"What a beautiful winter wonderland the Denver Botanic Gardens are transformed into for the holiday season! It’s lights galore over, around and through all the plants and trees in this 23-acre playground of nature. Even though there are a lot of people taking in the colorful displays, there are benches tucked away for quiet contemplation. Bathrooms are available in the conservatory that houses tropical plants. And hot chocolate and other goodies can be purchased. This is a magical winter fairyland full of lights and colors."
Blossoms of Light,Beautiful lights throughout the gardens. Well worth the price. It was very well organized and the number of people admitted per hour was perfect. A good way to get into the holiday spirit!!
Blossoms of Light,First time at Denver Botanic Gardens for the winter Blossoms of Light.  Beautiful Christmas lights. Will definitely return during the summer to see the gardens.
Holiday Lights were incredible!,"The Botanic Gardens manages to keep bringing you back!  While it might be too cold for most of the plants, the light show is magnificent!  Each turn of the path brings a new display!  Well worth the visit!"
"Beautiful Gardens, and so many attractions","The Denver Botanic Gardens are a beautiful place to visit any time of year. The gardens  are gorgeous in the summer of course, but around the winter holidays the Blossom of Lights is spectacular. We also enjoy attending outdoor concerts at the summer concert series. And the Chihuly Glass exhibit was amazing. There's always something worth seeing at the Denver Botanic Gardens."
Beautiful even in Winter,"The residents & visitors to Denver are fortunate indeed to have this lovely space to visit.  While we did not visit during the ideal time to enjoy the beauty, we did thoroughly enjoy our time walking and absorbing the features."
Blossoms of Light,"The Gardens are beautiful year round and we visit often throughout the year, but they take on a whole new beauty and wonder during the Blossoms of Light event. It’s an amazingly beautiful display that you just gotta see to believe!"
Blossoms of Light,Cheers to the Denver Botanic Gardens for their magnificent and very beautiful displays of Holiday lights and festive creations!Thoroughly enjoyed it and will attend again! Merry and Bright!
Pretty but crowded,Blossoms of Light: Wonderful light display. Went on a sold out night so it was a bit crowded. The parking was horrible with no one outside to really direct us where to go or else I would rate 5 stars. I made a video of my trip on my YouTube channel. (Look for Blossoms Of Light Denver).
Blossoms of Light holiday lights worth the trip ,"I have been to the Blossoms of Light exhibit multiple times. I continue to return because the displays are quite beautiful and always well executed. As a denver local I make a point to visit the gardens for a Blossoms of Light visit at least once a year. Though there are always some restricted areas, generally due to renovations or revegetation efforts, I always feel that enough of the facility is accessible to patrons to make it worth it. During my visit there was an additional area closed off for a private event, an area which I had been able to experience last holiday season. Nevertheless, I felt the experience was worth it. The price is affordable. Weeknights are not terribly busy, except for Christmas Eve, and you are able to take pictures without other patrons being captured in your photos. I appreciate that there is a cafe where you can purchases hot beverages and light snacks, as well as a couple additional areas to purchase hot beverages throughout the gardens. I was also permitted to bring in my own outside beverage- bring your own reusable travel mug to save on single use packaging! I will continue to visit the gardens for the Blossoms of Light, as well as during the day, as I thoroughly enjoy my visit to the gardens every time. I have been visiting the gardens on average 2x/year for the last 9 years. Highly recommend"
A relatively nice place to walk but several closed areas detracted from overall experience,"Overall our visit was pleasent. However, there were several closed/taped off areas that we would have liked to see.The learning facility (appears new) is very interesting and would be great for kids.I would recommend the garden but would suggest calling ahead to make sure the areas you want to see are open."
Beautiful any time of the year,Great way to pass an afternoon. I have been several times and love it every time I go. The orchids are fantastic.
Nice walk,"During the winter, not much for plant or flower sightings, but it is a nice safe place to stroll or walk with little ones.  The gift shop has lots of fun items and you can view the starter plants and delicates thru a window.  Want to come back in springtime.  The layout is really nice for the space."
Beautiful gardens; a must-see in Denver,"The Denver Botanic Gardens are a lovely and peaceful place to spend the day and wander among the many exotic plants and flowers that make up these beautiful gardens. I happened to visit in late March, when the gardens were admittedly not quite as lush or green as one would expect during the summer months. However, I was very impressed with their indoor exhibits, such as the Tropical Conservatory, and the Orchid Showcase that was currently on display.The gardens are definitely one of the best spots in Denver to visit if you have several hours to spend, as there is plenty to see and experience!"
Sightseeing,"It was really nice but I think I would like it better in the Spring.  I would recommend it for families as there's a lot to see if you like plants, and I do, reason for the visit."
Very Special Christmas Display,The holiday light and color display -  Blossoms of Light -  is a not to be missed while  in Denver for the holidays. Tickets can be difficult to obtain so make sure you try early.  This wonderful garden is a special place to visit in the summer and fall but this Christmas display is very fantastic!   It's a most valuable experience - I highly recommend.  There are also unique and special Christmas gifts for sale in the gift shop.
Can be fun even in the winter,"We've visited several times here in the summer.  But while visiting family in Denver in the Winter, we went to the botanic gardens and were pleasantly surprised how much fun we had there.  It had just snowed (several inches) and was cold.  But we wandered through the gardens and enjoyed the snowy scene and the icy waterfalls.  Went into the Science Pyramid.  Even though aimed at kids, we learned some things about various habitats in Colorado.Spent time in the tropical conservatories, which are lush even in the winter.  Few people there, so we had plenty of elbow room and quiet.  Fun!"
Oasis,One of the best gardens I have been to in the USA. I have been to many and Denver's is one of the best.
Peaceful Stroll,"We visited the Botanic Gardens towards the end of our trip and wish we would have done it before going to Rocky Mountain National Park. The Gardens are really nice and have a great deal to offer. However after visiting many parts of Colorado, it just didn't match everything we had seen. That being taken into account I strongly recommend a visit. It is very peaceful and relaxing."
Peaceful & Beautiful,"The Botanic Gardens are a great place to go year-around.  During the holidays, the lights are pretty at night and definitely worthwhile.  We were there one year at night when it was near zero, that was a bit cold however it was still worth it.  Each season brings different things to see so it is worth it go back several times per year which is why so many people have season tickets.  It is a lovely place!"
Blossoms of Light,This nighttime light and color display is a must-see during when in Denver for the holidays. Try to choose a temperate night so you can linger to really enjoy the displays as you wander through the gardens. Be sure to stop in the gift shop afterward to find beautiful presents for friends and family members. Worth every penny!
Great place for a stroll before dinner or a concert,"The Denver Botanic Gardens is a beautiful gem in the middle of Denver.  In the winter the place is lit up for the holidays.  You can pay a little more and get glasses that change the look of the lights.  Great for kids too!  In the summer, you can take a stroll after dinner and walk off dessert.  The concert series sells out quickly as well as various other offerings throughout the year.  I've enjoyed the gardens dozens of times and highly recommend them.  Don't miss the Chihuly sculpture!"
Dia de los Muertos,"Super busy day. Line moved fast to get in. Well worth the wait. Garden was decorated beautifully. Dancers, kid activities, alters. Snow on the ground made the colors POP. Very interesting learning about the holiday and traditions. Even in November the gardens were worth visiting indoors and out."
"Attended the ""Day of the Dead"" event on Sunday",This was an extraordinary experience with the crowds appearing to swamp the parking facilities available on the day.  It was obviously not a good time to view the gardens with winter approaching and a heavy snow fall a few days earlier.   However it was clear that this place has many outstanding features and a visit earlier in the season wuld be well worthwhile.
Peaceful,"Though I visited in a season that isn’t normally known for gardens, the garden was still lovely. They were setting up for a Halloween event so I didn’t get to everything, however there was still plenty to see. The trees were lovely and changing colors, the ponds were well taken care of, and the art installations, hedgerows were thoughtfully designed. I look forward to going back in the Spring and following seasons to watch the progression and growth."
One of the best,This is probably the best botanic garden I have been to. It's really big and they had a cool Japanese garden. They also have inside enclosures with even more to see.
Trick or treat,If you ever go to the Denver Botanic Gardens an you go during October there is a big trick or treating festival and you get to dress up there is also family portraits they paint by hand. Even if you visit in the Summer it is still a beautiful sight.
Beautiful Walk Around the World,"Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous! All seasons of the year. You can even go into a tropical rainforest right in the middle of Denver. Every continent represented, plus a Zen meditation garden when you just want to chill. Seasonal specialties like Glow at the Garden in October and Blossoms of Light in December... Worth a membership!"
Great place to relax,See nature and relax for awhile.  This is a great getaway in the heart of Denver and a great way to spend a few hours.
Slightly disappointed,"I visited the Botanic gardens recently and was disappointed to see that there was nothing to see. When I inquired why the gardens looked the way it did, I was then told that it’s because the flower/plants were already dormant for the winter. So I payed to view brown, dried, dead looking vegetation. I think someone should have shared what to expect from at the gate so you could decide whether it was worth still paying to go in. On the positive side there was a tropical exhibit that was enclosed that was really nice to view."
A pleasant visit,"The gardens, located at the Cheesman Park, are quite pleasant to visit. I'm not sure the entrance fee is justified, though. If you can wait, there are Free Days offered occasionally."
A real treasure in a great city,"In Denver on a business trip, I had little free time during normal business hours and elected to spend my time at the gardens. One and a half hours didn't do it justice - I recommend allowing at least two and a half hours, if you have any interest in stopping to take photos, read the plant labels, or explore every path. I had to leave some areas unexplored, including the entire children's gardens across the street (included in the price of admission). The water features alone, at the rear of the property, were worth the trip. In addition to the water area, there are conservatories, bonsai, and other themed areas. Everything was kept up beautifully. The gift shop was a pleasure and most of the items were very reasonably priced. I took the bus and was let off a block from the entrance. There is construction going on in front of the gardens - not sure what is being planned there."
Ace place to visit,"Difficult not to be jealous of the people living in apartments with an overview of the gardens. The whole place is walkable- it is not too large. Glorious colors, textures and vistas. More than one place for a drink and something to eat. Altogether a very pleasant afternoon in the sun in the late fall."
Denver Botanical Gardens,October may not have been the best time of the year to visit the gardens. I was a bit underwhelmed. I did see a few beautiful flowers but some areas seemed sparse. I was hoping to see more exotic plants.
Not a good time of year,We had the unfortunate timing to view the gardens late in the season and 2 days after a snowfall.  The gardens were large and well maintained.  I would love to go back when the gardens are in bloom as I could tell it would be a wonderful place to visit.
Wonderful visit ,We spent over 2 hours there and I’m sure we didn’t see everything. Loved the Japanese gardens and the Monet pool. Nice gift shop with beautiful art work. The Off Shoots cafe had excellent lunch food.
Georgeous even in Fall,The Japanese Harden was the highlight.The admin offices are held in the beautiful original estate home...too bad as that would have been cool to visit or have weddings...definitely a lovely urban oasis and Denver highlight worth a visit.  The first cafe is okay. Not as amazing as some historic gardens but notable.
Beautiful Gardens!,My husband and I visited the Denver Botanic Gardens in September. We were impressed with the beauty of the gardens and the helpfulness of the workers there. It is a tranquil place to visit and enjoy the beauty of nature.
The Japanese Garden!,Really enjoyed the Japanese gardens.  The indoor tropical garden was excellent as well!The staff was helpful.  We went during the day but it looks like they have an awesome Halloween walk with cool lights.  Check it out!
Day with my granddaughter,"Really enjoyed the gardens, very peaceful setting. Especially liked the Children’s Discovery Garden as my granddaughter was able to run around and play in the sand. She loved it!!!!"
Huge Beautiful Variety,"It is surprising how large this botanical garden is in downtown Denver. It includes inside and outside gardens, aquatic and desert, eastern and western.  Nighttime lighting displays are well done. The many volunteers are friendly and informative. Definitely worth a visit."
Beautiful even during the snow,"We almost didn't come as we thought maybe the snow would make it not so nice. Interior gardens obviously weren't affected but even outdoor ones with the snow were still neat. Some built snowmen, put funny comments in the snow. Great place!!"
Beautiful Southwest Gardens,"The gardens are a great place to relax and reflect as you walk around the paths. There are several different outdoor themed areas, beautiful water features and various plants from several regions. The grounds was decorated for Fall with many warm oranges, browns and various gourds and pumpkins. Do check the weather before you go. We visited after an unusual cold snap and many of the plants were wilted. As this is a part of nature we were not surprised but a little disappointed."
Huge with a wide variety of plants.,"We try to hit botanical gardens whenever we travel and this was a good one. Not particularly close to downtown, if you are staying there, but Uber wasn't outrageous. Great variety of plants and seasonal displays. I don't know how it will be in the dead of winter, though."
Beautiful and peaceful gardens,Delightful walk around these gardens and excellent photographic opportunities . The water lilies were stunning and the all the water areas were beautifully presented and kept.
Denver Botanic Gardens,"Pick a nice warm sunny fall day to visit. It is delightful, educational and refreshing place to be. We took around 3 hours to walk, rest, snack and admire the beauty of this garden. I highly recommend.Moe T"
Fall visit,Beautiful areas to stroll on a warm fall day. This was our first visit and it was just after a hard freeze so most plants had suffered. Looking forward to visiting next spring!
Fall Visit to the Botanical Gardens,One of my favorite places to bring out of town visitors for a beautiful Colorado outdoor stroll on a beautiful day. One of the true gems of Denver. A must do item any time of the year. Their signature events are coming this Fall.
Family Reunion ,"This is the second time we have been to the Botanical Gardens.The gardens are in bloom for fall, and had many beautiful fall displays.The pathways were easy to get around."
Beautiful gardens ,We really enjoyed the beautiful gardens here. My favorite was the water garden area. It was so serene. You will want a couple of hours to stroll through the gardens.
Beautiful in all seasons,"This is a great spot to go on a date, photography tour, bring friends or family from out of town or a place to take a stroll through. The gardens are illuminated with a different feel in each season, making it a new experience year-round. I went while there was still snow on the ground and it was nothing short of feeling as if I was in the middle of Narnia in it's opening scenes. Definitely a must-see!"
Exceeded expectations!,"Free parking, magnificent grounds. Spent several hours but could have stayed longer. Several areas were being prepared for a halloween event and were blocked off. We did not eat there but the cafe overlooking the water features was so beautiful and peaceful. Felt like we had the place to ourselves. Only $12- what a steal! Highly recommend."
Peace & Quiet In Nature,"A beautiful place to be at peace, strolling the grounds amidst nature. Very well kept and enjoyable."
Lovely walk,My husband and I had a very nice time meandering through the gardens. We especially liked the bonsai and ornamental gardens. Next time we’ll bring a picnic lunch as there are many places to sit and enjoy a meal.
A different world,"Simply put, a gorgeous place in the middle of the city. I really enjoyed strolling around this place. In the middle of august it’s hot but incredible. Just go there"
Sisters gathering ,The gardens are beautiful. We couldn’t have asked for a better experience. There is an exceptional gift shop - something for everyone there.
Creative arts ,☆☆☆☆☆Just amazingly beautiful!!!The gift shop is great....Bofa bank holder get in free☆Educational
My visit ,"Place was good, we caught them in the off season, the volunteers we very knowledgable and helpful,  would recommend for the 12 dollars we paid."
beautiful,This is a great place to spend a few hours while in Denver.  Many types of flowers and plants to enjoy.
Saturday Garden Stroll ,Beautiful Free Admission day in the gardens.  Took my mom and was able to use a free wheelchair.  There were several weddings and a baby shower that day.  We enjoyed the beautiful gardens and landscaping.  We had a great snacks and refreshments at the Hive snack bar. And we found some lovely souvenirs at the gift shop. It was a nice Saturday afternoon.
Beautiful place ,"We though we were going into this small garden but it ended up opening into this world of flowers and trees everywhere your look! They had plants from all over the world, at least what they could grow in the climate, full of colors and scents. They had tropical plants, plants from Asia, Germany, north, west, south and east!! I’m sorry I could only show you ten pictures because I have lots more. They also had this cool little place to eat in the middle of the gardens with fresh sandwiches with greens right from the garden and pizza with house made basil on top! Sorry, can’t remember the name of the place, thrive maybe?? Organic fresh food 😋. I tell yea, what a beautiful world to see. Great for couple and family. I could go on and on about place but check it out for yourselves, you’ll love it 😍."
Ms,"Loved it. Especially the Steppe Gardens and low water gardens. Very Informative. Would have enjoyed a longer visit. (From Virginia, but heading to NE Colorado to see friends.)"
Must see! ,"In all my visits to Denver, this is my first  visit to the Botanical Gardens.  By far one of my favorites, I’ll be back here many times for sure.  Love the little hideaway nooks of absolute paradise.  A little bench just about everywhere to sit, reflect and take in the beauty around around you. Our teenage girls loved it as well."
A breath of fresh air!,"Go, go, go! A serene retreat in the middle of the city. We were lucky enough to visit on Rosh Hashanah with a large private service set up under a tent. We enjoyed the music and singing and feeling of reverence that enhanced the gardens. Very friendly staff and volunteers. We got there easily from downtown via a #10 bus. Another plus."
Wonderful scenery,Always love a great botanical gardens. Beautiful Japanese tea garden and lily pond. If you visit in spring you can view daffodil's and tulips. Summer with bring an all new spread of tree and Bush flowers and fall wraps up with hardie varieties for native plants and foliage. Love this place so much. Highly recommend visiting the winter lights at night.
Great place for photographers!,"Beautiful place to visit! A haven for photographers. I got tons of great photos of plants and flowers as well as animals. I saw bunnies, dragon flies, bees, butterflies, fish. There's many different varieties of gardens which was really cool. My only complaint is that the map is extremely confusing and getting around is difficult. Also two weddings were going on when I visited so a few areas were restricted and unable to be seen by the public."
Fantastic,Largest garden that we have ever been to. Very well maintain. It was wonderful to take the kids here. You probably will need an entire day just to get to enjoy the garden.
Very peaceful gardens. Lovely to see and smell!,"There's a lot of variety at this botanical gardens.  Even a children's garden, for them to explore and learn.  I enjoyed the colors and the smells of all the flowers.  There's even a place in the center for the kids to play.  The day I went there were kids activities (like scavenger hunts) all over the grounds."
Beauty,What a truly amazing site right in the middle of Denver.  Such beauty and color all around.  Don't miss these gardens if you are ever in Denver.
A piece of heaven,"This is a ""must see"" while visiting Denver.  The beautiful array of flowers, winding trails, English and Japanese gardens, along with the most amazing lily pond, capture nature at its best.  Nourish your soul with the peace and tranquility of this botanical garden.  You will love it!"
Spectacular flowers where the bees hang out,Outstanding presentation of flowers and trees. Really enjoyed the lily pond. Beautiful dahlias! Easy walking for elderly. Setup for all ages with free tours.
Nice place to visit or hold an event.,"Beautiful place to spend time, nice variety of plants and artwork. Good place to hold a party, wedding, or other event."
Very nice gardens,"The gardens are lovely. I made a mistake of going on a holiday, so it was super crowded. Won't make that mistake again."
A Must See,These are some of the most beautiful Botanic Gardens I have seen thus far. Not to be missed are the beautiful water gardens. I could have spent an entire day there. The gift shop itself is incomparable to many!
A Beautiful Place to Spend an Afternoon in Denver,"The footprint of this botanic garden is smaller than others I have visited but they do a lot with a small space.  I enjoyed the farm to table & secret gardens the most.  Spend half a day when you go, it's worth it."
One of the best botanical gardens there is!,"My wife & I visit botanical & formal gardens throughout the US, Canada & Europe. The Denver Botanical Gardens is top 2 of all the botanical gardens that we have ever visited. The gardens are well kept, spacious & the design is exquisite! Every area has different layout & building design while keeping with an overall concept for the gardens. Looking forward to another visit next time that we are in the Denver area."
Just made a 4 star rating,"We arrived slightly after opening time on a week day so it was still nice and quiet, allowing us to enjoy the greenery in peace before the school trips started to descend on the gardens. On the whole the visit was enjoyable but I did feel there were a few areas that were a little lacking and looked a little unloved. The tulips were beautifully in bloom, a welcome pop of colour and I was fond of the Japanese inspired zones. We could have been in a transition time and waiting for some new plants to show above the soil level to fill out some of the areas but I felt there was just something missing to quite make it a must visit."
Love This Place,"The Denver Botanic Gardens are beautiful, tranquil, relaxing.  Some 25 acres of gardens, tastefully and thoughtfully laid out for strolling and observing wonderful plants, flowers and trees.  The water gardens are awesome and the inclusion of sculpture throughout is a great addition.  We spent two hours here on a recent weekday afternoon and would have stayed longer but for impending rain.  It wasn’t that crowded on this occasion.  Staff are available to answer questions and I believe there are tours, although we just walked on our own.  There is a small gift shop.  Parking is in a covered garage immediately to the east.  Admission was reasonable in my opinion; $9.50 for non-members, but no discount for seniors or military."
One of the best Botanic Gardens I've been to,"I strolled (in mid-late September) for 90 minutes and found so many wonderful places and people to talk to. The volunteers who tend the gardens along with the horticulturalists and very friendly.  My favorites were the lily pad ponds, dahlias, and Japanese tea garden. Definitely will go back."
Wow.  Stunning. ,So many little paths and trails to stroll.  Stunning.  Very well done. The Japanese garden should not be missed
Refreshing Oasis,"During my visit here this summer, I enjoyed the gardens tremendously. One thing I found nice is seeing weddings in progress along with a bridal shower.  Being able to see those events while enjoying the gardens was a plus for me.  Can’t wait to return."
Amazing,"My husband and I spend several hours in this spectacular and huge place.  Our favorites were blooming dahlias, the ornamental gardens and the gorgeous waterlilies in the water gardens.  The human nature sculptures throughout the gardens were a pleasant surprise."
Beautiful oasis in the middle of Denver,Spending a few hours in the York St. gardens makes you forget you're in a city.  Open year round but particularly beautiful summer through early fall when everything is in bloom. Art and periodic exhibits add to the beauty and tranquility.  They also have concerts and classes.
Excellent,Visited over two days with garden conference. Grounds are immaculate. Staff is very knowledgeable and anxious to share. Wish I had more time there.
To enjoy the flowers and plants. ,Excellent garden of beautiful Plata and flowers. Special events are presented to please a wide variety of visitor's tastes.
Enjoy & Relax,"Amazing Garden, so many difference Lotus flowers that i have fall in love with.i spent all day but not enough. So many thing to see Love it Love it, will come back for sure :-)"
"No very large, but beautifully laid out and interesting","We walked to the gardens from downtown. In hindsight, I'd take an Uber, the walk is all uphill and sapped our energy. The gardens were lovely, especially the Japanese and water gardens. They had a sculpture exhibition underway which added to the enjoyment. The cafe was impossibly crowded and short staffed. I'm not sure if that's normal, but if they do have a line, skip it."
Hidden gardens in the suburbs,"We enjoyed our stroll through the varied gardens and pathways during our mid-summer visit. Organized in a very orthogonal manner it was nice to find moments of whimsy and art in the landscape. In the hot sun of July, many areas looked a little starved for water and there were only a few larger shade trees to be found for relief."
Beautiful day to walk in a garden.,"We took the bus from downtown and 20 minutes later we were at the gardens. We walked the trails and sat and admired the Monet pond, strolled the Japanese garden. and enjoyed the Chihuly exhibit."
Unique and Beautiful,We spent a beautiful afternoon there. We loved the Bonsai exhibition and the Chihuly sculpture. There was also plenty of shaded areas to escape the heat for a few minutes.
Came back for a second visit.,We visited during January of 2018 and saw the orchids. Enjoyed it so much that we came again during nice weather to revisit the grounds.
Absolutely stunning!,"The Denver Botanic Gardens are an absolute “must-see”!  If you want to view all the gardens give yourself 3 hours so you can experience everything. There are herb gardens, a stunning water lily area, an enormous vegetable garden, cacti, sensory gardens, grasses and more. The staff were very polite. There are also classes you can sign up for. They have a nice little food area that gives you a view of the water gardens while you sit back under the covered patio area.  As you finish exploring the gardens, stop by the gift shop. There are wonderful books and gifts if you’d like a memento of your visit. We left with a profound feeling of peace and well being."
Relaxing Denver Visit,"Cute garden. It was a fun visit before we flew back home. This place was definitely well taken care of. We were here on a partially cloudy day (misted a bit at the end which was refreshing on a hot day). All in all, it was relaxing. Lots of plant varieties and water features. Easy parking across the street."
You won't regret going to the Denver Botanic Garden,"Amazing marriage of art and nature. Beautiful well maintained plant exhibits, great  rainforest inside plants, great sculptures in gardens, artistic buildings."
Amazing gardens,Enjoyed this so much. Beautiful gardens everywhere combined with art. Definitely worth seeing especially if you like nature. One of the most beautiful botanical garden I have ever been.
Perfect Afternoon,"This has to be one of the most beautiful and well thought-out botanical gardens I’ve ever been to. It is a true oasis. I enjoyed exploring all of the different gardens and the many water features. The diversity was very impressive. They even have a large herb garden where, on the day I visited, volunteers were cleaning up and pruning - I felt like I was walking around in a spa! The wildflowers and butterflies were abundant throughout. The cafe towards the front severed me the best iced latte of my trip, and the lunch options at the restaurant (not to mention the water views from my outdoor table) were superb. The staff and volunteers clearly have passion and pride in their gardens. You can easily spend 3 hours here. Great for all ages and groups. Only a 30 minute walk or $10 Uber ride from downtown."
Lovely morning ,"Spent a few hours enjoying the beautiful gardens. Got some great video of hummingbirds, bunnies and a lot of very busy bees. The grounds are well kept. I did find it a little difficult to get around in... could use some better signage. Lots of beautiful spots to sit and enjoy the surroundings. Ate at the cafe - it was OK:  had the Cubano. Generous portion but not even warm all the way thru. Disappointed after reading the good reviews. $4 for water seems a bit out of line as well. Pretty pricy considering the quality. Gift shop had a lot of nice things that were way overpriced as well."
Very peaceful place with a lot of interesting Plants and Art works,"It is a great place to visit. If you like nature and art work, you will enjoy it. lot of great species of plants and trees and also beautiful art work and sculptures through out the park"
What a wonderful place to sit back enjoy and relax,Denver Botanic Gardens is always a joy to go.The only time you might consider waiting is at the beginning of the season when plants are just getting started...Their exhibits are interesting and attractive. The grounds are greatand so are their concerts!go and have a great time
Garden Lover,"I'm a bit nature obsessed, and never pass up an opportunity to visit a botanical garden. Even though it was winter, I was still able to enjoy a lot of the beauty here. I would say the Japanese gardens were the most vibrant during this time of year, and provide the perfect thinking spot to sit and reflect."
Wonderful visit!,"Exceeded our expectations in every way! Well worth the time. Unbelievable collection of plants, flowers and trees growing in mature settings interspersed with outdoor art."
Family outing,"We had family from out of town and not a lot of time, so we decided to go to Denver botanic gardens.If you are a vetran you qualify for a discount at the gate.It is very refreshing to see a garden next to cheesman park. They actually border each other.  There are many different themed gardens here, we went in early August and most of the flowers were in bloom. I really enjoyed seeing the very large Lily pads, a duck was resting on top of one. The gardeners were in a pond weeding or planting.it was a really hot day and I asked if I could jump in, they were not amused.Maybe because water is used for the plants it's a rare commodity there. For 3 bottles of water and a blackberry tea were $16.00 but spending time with my family was worth it.  We stayed about 4 hours but did not see all they had to offer. There is plenty of free parking and in that area is a good thing."
Great place to visit lot of different gardens.,I visited the Botanic gardens on my trip to Denver and I asked a resident from the area what was go to see in the Denver area and she suggest it and it was wonderful
Beautiful and Diverse,This was my first visit to a botanical garden and I don't think a better garden could of been chosen. It was an amazing experience. The Japanese Gardens were a personal favorite of mine. The cafe on the grounds is quite delicious as well. Highly recommended to anyone visiting the Denver area.
A piece of heaven ,A tranquil spot!  Family friendly and space to roam in any season.  I think it's best enjoyed with kids who are curious and are comfortable roaming ahead of their minders. Return visits are probably certain.
Nice way to spend a couple hours,Beautiful landscapes and informative placards. Shady spots available to cool off. Water Lilly displays are incredible. Suggest wearing comfy shoes there.
I loved this day!,Took my Mom and Sisters and enjoyed the morning time.  Way to hot in afternoon.  You should put this on your list for Denver great places.
A must see if you're Denver during the summer months.,"The Denver Botanic Gardens are one of kind, as we have visited many gardens all over the world. The beauty and tranquility is amazing. They have great water features and many unique and magnificent flowers throughout. The water features were also very unique. You could watch them for hours. If you have a few hours while in Denver, we highly recommend visiting the gardens."
Lovely day out,"July is a lovely time to see the gardens as most plants are in bloom. Interesting variety of plants made for a lovely visit. Go early as the sun gets hot, although they are cooler shady and indoor areas too. The kids area is fantastic for youngsters."
Gorgeous!,"This is a great place! Its beautiful! Nice restaurant, nice gift shop. It is great to stroll around the gardens and sit on a bench to relax. Kid friendly!"
One of the best Botanic Garden experiences ,"The staff is amazingly friendly , the layout gorgeous as one flows from one garden section to another , always being surprised by the change in terrain right around the corner"
SECOND VISIT WAS MORE INTERESTING!,"My first visit was on a hot summer day and it seemed that. there are more exhibits and more plants today. The weather was cool with some breeze.We enjoyed the Annual  Plants Garden, Perennial Plants Garden, Japanese House, the Pond with the beautiful, flowering water lillies, various sculptures on display, etc. The various colors, smells and sizes of the plants are beautiful and picture-perfect.Vegetables Garden - they also have tomatoes, beans, peppers, Bok choy, kale, etc. in these Garden Beds.  How I wish that my Vegetables Garden Beds are as bountiful as they are.Restaurant  - we had our delicious lunch here, different types of sandwiches and salads.Highly recommended to visit!"
Nice change of pace among beautiful flowers,The Botanic Gardens are a wonderful respite after a week of hiking in the Rockies.  The grounds are impeccably maintained and the trails contain informative signage throughout.  The lotus pond was especially pretty and well maintained.  There are activities for the little ones as well.
Relaxing green space with spectacular views,This is a must see when in Denver. A diversity of flora and landscapes from countries and regions around the world including plants that thrive in Colorado’s climate. The water gardens are a real highlight particularly the water lilies. An excellent exhibition of sculptures exploring the human form was so cool! An adult ticket costs $12.50. A real bargain for this 24 acre oasis. Highly recommend.
Beautiful Gardens,I am not a plant person at all but visited here because it was rated so highly.  I was not disappointed!  The gardens are immense and varied.  They are so beautiful!
Peaceful lovely gardens,We enjoyed a respite from the heat and noise of the city by strolling through the gardens. Flowers were so fragrant we stopped to drink in the aromas. We also had dinner at the cafe. There were two weddings going on so we got to watch people too! Our evening ended with the magnificent Chihuly sculpture!
Beautiful !,"Nicely laid out, both inside and outside.  Very convenient parking.  Highly recommended.  Japanese gardens were beautiful!"
Beautiful  Flora ,"Beautifully landscaped botanical gardens, especially if interested in Denver & its environs. Great displays of natural, drought tolerant species."
Beautiful,"Beautiful place, wonderfully maintained with super friendly staff!Walk thru the rainforest building, very cool"
So beautiful ,"Came here on a work “field trip” and I loved it.   It a great place to sit and/or wander and enjoy being outside and enjoying nature.     They have different areas including a huge greenhouse, Japanese inspired gardens and water gardens.   Each exhibition is unique and breathtaking.  The pictures do not do the beauty of the gardens justice.  Grab a map or just wander aimlessly either way you will love the gardens.   You can have lunch there at the Hive bistro and the food actually tastes very good.  An adult ticket is $12.50 and you can stay the entire day.  Parking is free."
"Wonderful, serene place.  Absolutely breathtaking!","This was our favorite place on our 3 day trip.  We could have stayed there forever!  Quiet, serene and just awesome.  Make sure to go to the Japanese Gardens."
The most beautiful place in Colorado,The gardens are flawless and beautiful. The atmosphere is peaceful and inviting. An absolute must see for anyone visiting Denver. Great summer concerts.
Gorgeous oasis ,"These botanical gardens are absolutely gorgeous!  Such a nice calm retreat from the busyness of Denver.  The children’s garden is ok for young children, but my 9 year old found it boring.  Otherwise we really enjoyed the sprawling grounds and meandering paths, I highly recommend it.  Also, the food in the cafes is delicious and I saw many gluten free options."
A Beautiful Landscape to Enjoy,"After recently spending time at the New York Botanical Gardens, enjoying the fascinating Orchid exhibit, my expectations weren’t very high for my first visit to the Denver Botanic Gardens (DBG). In its own unique way the DBG was equally lovely with several indoor and outdoor exhibits bursting with colors and textures from various countries and US regions. If you enjoy strolling through beautiful gardens, you’ll enjoy DBG."
Wonderful Gardens-lots of activities,"I am a new season pass holder to the gardens.  I live over an hour and a half away but it is always a seasonal visit with friends and the membership is worth it.  I have been on special event days (holiday lights, pumpkin fest, spring bulb bloom & lavender fest at Chatfield) and regular days and it is always a good visit. Clean well maintained grounds separated into several different gardens.  Always something to see and do.  Parking can be a challenge-they do have a small parking garage but I would suggest public transportation or off street parking if possible."
Nice garden,"Denver is actually dry. The tropical plants are in a done to keep humid. The gardens are nice. Lots of interesting statues. There's a ceremonial teahouse, wasn't open. Bonsai plants were on display. Lots of succulents. ( Side note. We were going to go to zoo, but it was free day. Check before you go. Avoid free day. All of Denver was there."
Ode to the Gardens,"Botanic Gardens, full of plantswith brick-fired pizzas and few ants.You may see bunnies or, per chance,a tiny spider on your pants."
Great place for a slow day,Parking is pretty good but we came on a Thursday. It's only $12.50 to get in. This is a great day for a leisurely stroll looking at beautiful places and flowers. If you aren't into flowers and plants you might be bored.
Relaxing place to stroll,Went on Friday evening when they are open late. Apparently two weddings were going on at same time and saw times for concerts throughout the week. Just took a walk around which took about an hour and took lots of pictures of the beautiful nature.
It Really Is As Great As People Are Saying...,"Went for me, but my husband and teenaged daughter enjoyed it (almost) as much as I did. We spent way more time there than we expected and had lunch at the restaurant under the trees overlooking Monet’s water lily pond, which was really special. The afternoon at the botanic gardens was the highlight of our Denver time!"
"Beautiful, Varied Gardens ... Lots of places to find solitude, although crowded ","Really awesome botanical garden. Stroll, sit, nap, photograph, eat/drink ... and enjoy. Special place."
What a gem hiding in the City,"Not usually my thing to visit plants, but this was a nice stop. Beautiful grounds with plenty of variety to look at. Took some great pictures too."
The Beautiful Gardens.,"This is a very nice place to visit in Denver. We buy an annual membership which pays for itself in about three visits, and come often. Best time is summer of course, but the light display at Christmas is drop dead gorgeous as well."
Outstanding gardens,"We really enjoyed our visit to the botanic gardens. We were staying near the downtown Convention Center and didn't have a car, but it was easy getting to the gardens via the #10 bus.Once there, we loved wandering through the grounds, taking in the beautiful flowers and plants. We especially liked the Japanese garden and the Monet pool (such beautiful water lillies!). The grounds are very well maintained.There are many places to just sit and admire the beauty if you want to take a break from walking. Don't forget to bring your camera -- there will be plenty of great opportunities to capture nature's beauty."
Garden beauty ,"5 star visit. Beautiful and a great way to spend the day!  Many separate gardens of interest, plenty of quiet places to people watch.  A nice shopping area and food areas."
Beautiful and unique,"This place is WOW. If you have some time off in Denver, you gotta go here. Beautifully landscaped and great variety. Nicely laid out."
Beautiful grounds,"This place was amazing! The gardens are huge and so much to see. Beautiful flowers, ponds, and sculptures."
Beautiful!,we went early and enjoyed our walk thru the gardens before the heat of the day.  The gardens are lovely and well worth a visit.
Photographer Dream ,"Denver Botanic Garden is so well presented, has a really vast collection of plants/trees & accompanying insects/wildlife. Among them: butterflies, dragonflies, bees, a squirrel in the Birds & Bees section, plenty of koi fish in the Japanese garden and tiny frogs on lily pads. It provides decent shade throughout but I recommend bringing a big bottle of water & to dress sun-smart. Coming first thing in the morning was great because there was less foot traffic and heat. For a $12.50 USD entry fee, I would go again to take more photographs. The more you look throughout the garden, the more you will fall in love with nature. The only downside of my visit came when I was told by a Colorado local that the Denver Botanic Gardens & Cheesman Park were built on land that was a cemetery in the 1800’s. Would have reconsidered my visit had I known."
Beautiful but limited at times,The gardens are beautiful and have fun areas to explore. The only negative was that there were a few wedding events happening while we were there so a few areas were closed off. We still paid full price so that was disappointing.
The parking situation must be handled,"We were visiting Denver and thought we would take the opportunity to utilize our partnering membership from another garden. The parking situation is horrendous. Since I am not from the area, I had difficulty knowing where I could find alternative parking solutions and ended up driving around for 40 MINUTES. I came across a spot around 30 minutes in but the guy behind me was unwilling to back up an inch so I could allow the car exiting a little more room and instead pulled forward. The actual garden was nice enough, but the others ones we have visited were more enjoyable. Having to leave the main garden area and cross the street to find the children's garden was a hassle as well. Another child threw a sizeable log into the water feature and it landed on my son's foot. I looked around to see if the kid's parent was nearby but too many parents were inattentive so we just left. My rating would have been higher though had the parking situation not been so dismal."
Wedding reception,Beautiful places for a reception. Very well kept with lovely flowers.  Would like to return see to  more.
Glorious Gardens,This is a beautiful space with different gardens close to downtown Denver. There is ample free parking available. There are frequent changes to the garden spaces making it easy to visit often and see something new. The Chihuly exhibit was stunning with numerous glass sculptures through the entire space. Docent-led tours are also available.
Beautiful place!,This place is gorgeous. We had a wonderful time visiting and walking through their breathtaking gardens.
Always amazing,"Pretty much any time DBG is a wonderful experience, spring, summer , fall and December with the million lights."
Denver Botanical Garden,Great place to visit through out the year. During the warm months parking can be an issue. My wife and I are members and can’t think of a better community investment.
Denver Botanical garden more than what I expected,"Whao..... not only the incredible variety of plants and flowers, but also the sculptures around. It is maintained with love. It has a tropical plant area that’s to die for. Even a tree house. Good for the whole family. I really recommend it and I am not the type of person to go to this places but loved it"
Don’t miss it,"Spent the morning wandering around the beautiful gardens in a very peaceful setting.  There are a variety of garden types, from Japanese to rose gardens, with many benches to sit and take in the beauty.  The Monet garden is especially lovely with a pond, lily pads and colorful flowers.  Each of the gardens were well maintained and lush.  Highly recommend."
First Date,"Great place to have a first date.   Public, lots to see and talk about.  Good food a bit pricey for what you get but regardless healthy and a nice setting.  I will likely get a season pass as there is always something new to see and the events held. Lots to learn and great people watching."
Stunning gardens,The gardens are stunning and capture gardens from around the world all set out in away so you can meander your way round at your own pace. They have a couple of food outlets at the gardens we chose the ‘hive garden’ ample selection of food for all palettes and reasonably priced too.Well worth a visit if you are looking at spending 2-3 hours enjoying some quiet time.
Denver Botanic Gardens,Beautiful all around. Many garden areas featuring different landscapes and vegetation variety based on themes.
Beautiful place to spend some time,"What a lovely place! Husband was not too sure of my plan to visit, but ended up really liking it. There are lots of different spaces to see, from prairie land to a tropical conservatory. Beautiful statues also on display. Our favorite spot was the Monet lily pond. We had lunch at the bistro near the pond and the food was good. Did not visit the children’s area across the street. Don’t miss this!"
Simply Beautiful,"We were there on a scorching hot day, but cool shade, fragrant flowers, and riots of colorful blooms provided relief from the heat.  One of the best botanical gardens in the USA.  Knowledgeable staff answered questions.  Free covered parking, lovely shop, and several places to sit and grab a drink we're great!"
Wonderful place to visit in the summer!,"We visited the Botanic gardens in July, and it was wonderful.  On a hot day, there was plenty of shade and cool spots to relax in - plus all the beautiful flowers, landscapes, and art.  These gardens are very large, with plenty of space and attention paid to the different areas - the Japanese area was quite nice, and the water garden was filled with flowering lily pads.  We spent 3 hours there and saw everything, with a short break for a snack.  Would definitely return!"
An excellent place to spend the day,"Our Son/Family live in Denver and while we were visiting, we had an excellent experience visiting the Botanic Garden. It is truly beautiful, extremely well maintained, with several most excellent exhibits. I see that they also have a concert stage eith many events scheduled."
Beautiful Path to Enchanted Moments,"This was the first time my wife and I have had the pleasure of visiting this amazing garden and even on a HOT day this was a wonderful place to stop, reflect, speak softly and carry a memory with you for always.  The garden had so many areas of wonder, from the exotic plants found in places across the globe to the peaceful bonsai tree's that seemed to speak the soft message of slow down and enjoy each lesson in the garden is giving.  We laughed and enjoyed the sweet smells and surreal sounds of rushing water and even had time to stop at one of the many many benches to sit on and take it all in by embracing the stillness of dragon flies and bumblebees playing tag with the many flowers.  Just when this place couldn't get any better we see off in the distance this tower sculpture and even from 30 yards away It was obvious it was a masterpiece created my the one and only Dale Chihuly.  It was in the most magical setting  with flowers all around and lily pads and ivy and it was hard not to freak out and ask for a picture in this enchanted setting.  The day was a complete success and we could not have been more thrilled and thankful for this moment together...oh and did I mention it was on the day it was FREE!  Thank you Denver Botanic Gardens for giving this gift to us and for exceeding our expectations."
Excellent!,Highly enjoyed the gardens. You could spend all day here. So much to see. Would put this on my list again.
Mile High Beauty,The gardens are beautifully well maintained. I was especially impressed with the many water gardens and the tropical garden area. The visitor map made it easy to follow our journey through the different garden areas and The Offshoots Cafe provided the perfect lunch.
Beautiful and Relaxing,Great place to relax. The water lilies are beautiful! They also have interesting sculptures. Plenty of shaded benches and places to sit. Wonderful place to visit.
beautiful visit!,"the denver botanic gardens was a must on my list while visiting denver! even though i went in january and it was freezing, the plans and flowers that were there were beautiful! i loved the asian garden and pond the most!"
Denver garden ,Great garden alot of variety lovely japan garden Enjoyed water lilies blooming and volunteers information talkNice restroom easy free parking
Amazing variety,Impressed by the different setting for both plants and flowers.  Incredible variety from all over the world.  Interesting educational areas for kids and adults.  Plenty of benches to sit and well kept walkways to stroll and observe.  Recommend for an hour or all afternoon.
Beautiful ,"What a great way to spend a morning, despite the heat of August.  Wear a hat! They offer refills on iced tea at all their beverage locations, to help keep you hydrated. The many water features, shade structures and some shade gardens are also well placed for cooling.  The beds are beautiful and inspiring."
Beautiful place to visit,"We loved looking at all the different species of plants in the gardens,  We just strolled around the grounds taking our time to view so many different plants.  It is an amazing and beautiful place."
This is a lovely get away in the City,"This a a great place to get away from the city.   I have gone here for a number of events and concerts.  Also, during the holidays the lights a fun thing to do with family or friends"
A fine place for a special event,We attended a reception there recently in the evening and found the accommodations for socializing and a sit down dinner very nice.  The only negative was that the paths back to the parking area are unlit and unlabeled.
Absolutely Gorgeous ,We have been to a lot of Botanical gardens so I don’t say this lightly....it was possibly the best we have been too.Laid out beautifully...upkeep impeccable.....many different areas of plants represented.You can purchase and eat food in the gardens.Great place for a wedding!
Great place to walk and chill,I love coming here to practice photography.  The docents are friendly and engaging. There's several places to find shade and a bench.
Too confusing!,"I love botanic gardens and visit one every time I have the opportunity.  This botanic garden has some unique features such as a Lilac Garden and others. Usually in a botanic garden signage is enough of a guide to understanding each area, its attributes, sources, significance, etc.  Here, I had to look hard to find the label of the grouping or area I was viewing. Another problem is the layout.  I admire the effort to include as many displays as the space allows, but it is very difficult just to walk along and move easily to the next exhibit.  I think that other visitors were having the same problem since we were frequently ending up face to face with another family also trying to find the way to go. Finally, I was tremendously frustrated with the map.  It is highly stylized such as a subway map but I could not line up the displays with the map no matter how many times I tried!  I may be spoiled by the fantastic layout and signage of Longwood Gardens which is a few hours from me.  If I’m in Denver again I’ll give the botanic gardens another try but I’ll study up before I go!"
Absolutely breathtaking,"Wonder place for a walk. Saw so many different plants, gorgeous art and animals. The architecture is amazing. The cafe looked wonderful and the gift shop was fun. The Japanese and cactus gardens were beautiful. I came away with some great ideas."
Beautiful!,"While my husband did some work, I ventured off to the Botanic Gardens with my daughter.  I was most excited for the Children's Gardens, but was really disappointed with those.  I understand the reasons for not putting many flowers in that area for fear that children with pick them or trample them, but it wasn't very pretty to look at and there wasn't ""much to do"".  When we finally got across the street to the main gardens, she was so excited!  There was so much more to see that she voluntarily climbed into her stroller so she could ride and see everything.I was there right when the gardens opened, so by the time we got to the main gardens it was maybe 30 minutes after opening.  It was nice to be there early.  There weren't crowds and it was nice rolling along seeing everything.  Another complaint would be that not every section is accessible with a stroller, so I had to miss some areas.My favorite was the Monet area.  The indoor tropical garden areas looked nice, but the elevators were broken, so there was a lot of stress getting from floor to floor and retracing my steps.This might be my #1 recommendation for what to see in Denver.  Beautiful!"
Denver Botanic Gardens,"I visited the Denver Botanic Gardens this summer and I found the gardens to be gorgeous, with great layouts and some really interesting sculptures and artwork throughout the grounds. If you are ever in the Denver area, you must visit the Denver Botanic Gardens,"
Good for Denverites and tourists,I like to bring visiting friends to the Gardens. It’s beautiful and vast enough to spend a couple of hours meandering and talking. Good cafe and gift shop onsite as well.
One of the Best Gardens in the US,"I've traveled to gardens all over north America and DBG is second only to Huntington in LA.  DGB is always expanding and improving its gardens making them creative and stimulating.  Also, high marks to the volunteers for keeping everything looking perfect."
Lovely gardens,"We had a morning in Denver and the gardens are a great place to spend a few hours wandering around. As you would expect, there are different zones, sculptures from well known artists and a gorgeous gift shop. The lily pond was one of the nicest I’ve seen, with so many species of lily. If you have young children there is a special area for them and they have children’s activities at one end."
Amazing place,The caretakers of the Gardens have done a fantastic job of creating a place where you can truly get lost.  Both physically and in seeing all the different plants.  There are numerous winding paths and water features.  Be prepared to spend some time.
Beautiful and Relaxing ,"These gardens were such an oasis in the city.  The garden was well laid out and had many distinct sections and interest levels.  The offered map was very good and identified the sculpture in the garden as well.  There were lots of benches to take a break and reflect, and volunteers and staff available for questions.  There is free WiFi in some of the buildings and the parking garage lets drivers know if it is full before you enter.  The military discount applies to retired military as well as active duty."
Great way to spent your summer evening,"We went as a couple between 6pm to 8pm and we loved it. It's really beautiful with different themes. The Japanese Garden was the highlight. That said, if you are going during summer time, will recommend after 5pm so it's not too hot."
Beautiful place to spend some time,"I loved this place! I wish I lived in Denver so I could visit more often. It was huge and had all types of gardens and plants. The water gardens with blooming water lilies were my favorite. This would be an excellent place to spend some time on any trip to Denver. There were people there painting, reading, practicing their photography, and just sipping drinks and visiting on the outdoor patio at the restaurant, how relaxing! I could tell they really care about the upkeep of the place because all of the plants were happy and I say caretakers in several spots working in the gardens."
Beautiful gardens,"Huge site to walk around, beautiful plants and flowers, well kept. Gift shop amazing but as I don't live in the US I couldn't buy the stunning ceramics and pillows/cushions as impossible to transport. Cafes attractive with a good variety of refreshments. Free parking on a Sunday."
"Gorgeous Gardens, Very Relaxing Atmosphere","After a very busy week, my family and I decided to meet a friend here to relax.  None of us had ever been here before, and it was quite the treat!There were several different gardens within the complex; plants range from succulents/desert plants to tropical ferns, depending on where you are in the gardens.  Additionally, there were several themed areas of the park that ranged from traditional Rocky Mountain flora to a Japanese zen garden.  It was very quiet and peaceful, despite its location in a busy part of the city.  The signage indicating areas of the gardens, as well as the signs informing visitors what plants they were seeing, was fantastic!While walking, we decided to have a quick bite at Hive Garden Bistro; drinks and snacks are served starting at 1000, and the lunch menu is served from from 1030 onward.  We each had a coffee (or tea) and a small pastry.  The bistro's location adjacent to a giant lily pond made for such a great, relaxing time!  There was even a mama duck and her duckling wandering around the bistro, picking up food scraps the humans accidentally dropped.There was also ample parking (we arrived when the gardens opened) attached to the complex that's free for patrons.  We learned that this place also has various classes/lectures/educational opportunities that guests can sign up for online; I'm definitely interested in the lecture about tea!"
Best botanical garden,"Denver Botanic Gardens is the best botanical garden I’ve visited. Wide variety of types of garden environments, inspired plant combinations, and great programs. Visit on a weekday if you can for a more tranquil experience."
Wonderful Botanical Collection,"These gardens are very nice. Many different garden areas and enclosed / hot houses. Take your time to stroll through them all. I really liked the tropical conservatory, (the large glass dome-like structure), it contains so many lovely topical and sub-tropical varieties. Don't forget to check-out the Japanese Gardens."
Denver Botanical Gardens,"Our threesome visited the Denver Botanical Gardens Tuesday July 23rd in the early afternoon. It was nice. It was clean. I did not get the ""awe"" factor though, anytime during our visit. I didn't feel that the tour pamphlet was of much help. It was hard to follow. We just wandered around for several hours and enjoyed each other's company. Comparing these Gardens to others I've been to East of the Mississippi …. well there is no comparison. I kind of wonder why it has such high ratings as I probably would not return."
Amazing Place,"These gardens were amazing and we could have spent the whole day there. Well laid out, large enough to get away from the crowds, great facilities - highly recommend a visit. We walked there from Union Station and too the #10 bus back. ."
Botanical garden,Beautiful. People were friendly and able to answer any questions I had. Found some lovely gifts. Easy to walk through. There is construction around the area.
A lot of plant goodness packed into a small area!,"I liked how there were various themes around the richly landscaped gardens here, to help me put it all in context.  The bonsai display was great!"
A feast for the senses,"What a wonderful facility. Many lovely paths meander through a wide variety of gardens. Water features, educational exhibits, and lots of room to just explore or sit and contemplate. Visit throughout the year to see seasonal changes. Try a music concert or another special event. I can't think of a lovelier backdrop."
"Even during construction, it was a nice place to visit","My wife and I spent a hot and sunny day exploring the Denver Botanical Gardens. We had walked across town on a 90° day to visit, so we were hoping it was worth the effort. We were not disappointed. It was not the largest gardens we've visited, but there was a lot packed in there to enjoy. When we visited in early July, there was construction happening near the front gate, but we found it fairly easy to ignore once you got inside. There were both indoor and outdoor displays to explore. Considering the sheer volume of tourists attending, the grounds were very well maintained. It was definitely worth the price of admission to take a break from the sights and smells of all the homeless people lying around on the streets of Denver to enjoy sights and smells of nature instead  :)"
Great way to spend a day outdoors !,"We spent several hours walking around the Denver Botanic Gardens.  The array of plants, trees, shrubs and flowers are amazing.  Free parking."
Absolutely Beautiful!,A true gem in the heart of Denver. It’s a wonderful oasis and is wonderfully maintained. There are so many different garden “areas” I’m sure we missed some even though we were there for a little over 2 hours. I would love to go back at different times of the year to see the changes that I’m sure occur during the changing of seasons. Give yourself enough time when you visit so you don’t feel rushed – this space is much bigger than you think.
Oasis in a jungle!,"Located in the middle of Denver, the garden is a true oasis. Quiet, lots to see, tropical garden of amazement. Unique art work scattered through out.  After walking for an hour and half found great cafe,next to pond. We were able to relax and regain our energy to continue on,still only saw about half in 4 hours. Great day or 1/2 day for all."
Something for everyone,"This is a favorite destination of mine while in Denver which is often now. The botanical gardens are spectacular; varied and well appointed.But so much more to do here. Summer evening concerts with top talent, art classes for young and old, tours, art installations in the main building and Halloween/ Christmas evening light show events. And a terrific gift shop.Top notch and one of the best around."
Denver Botanic Gardens,"This is one of the best gardens I've ever visited. It is well laid out and so beautiful. There are many sculptures. We spend more than 2 hours there, wandering around. It is so well-maintained, there were no weeds in any of the many beds. There are several water displays and places to sit an just relax and enjoy. Well worth a visit and it would be the perfect end to a  hectic day."
Peaceful paths -- Japanese-inspired,"Many intricate, peaceful paths. And of course, beautiful plants. Many shaded benches in out-of-the-way corners."
Most amazing gardens,"This has the be the best thing to do in Denver. There were many types of gardens. Japanese gardens and desert gardens were highlights. Instagrammers’ paradise. My teen daughters took tons of photos. Normally, they do not bother, but there was so much beauty all around, you simply had to capture it. I enjoyed the many sculptures and gazebos and doorways throughout. Beautiful gift shop too. Take a Lyft there as its not really walking distance from the other Denver attractions."
Excellent Botanic Garden with easy access,"My wife and I visit the botanic gardens in every major city we visit and we would rate Denver's with the best. We visited in mid July and flowers and bushes were blooming everywhere. There are great water features, a wonderful conservatory with two different tropical ecosystems, and all kinds of featured plantings around the paths. One thing I loved which is often lacking, is the seating. There are plenty of benches and sitting areas around the garden, usually shaded."
Beautiful place,Did not expect it to be so big!! Such a beautiful place to go solo or with someone else. Be sure to be hydrated on a hot day.
Beauty everywhere,"The Denver Botanical Gardens has recently seen a great deal of renovation and it shows in the amazing flora and unique areas showcasing water, magnificent flowers, shrubbery, trees and sculptures found throughout the Gardens. There are numerous places to just sit in the shade and take in the quietness while surrounded by nature. It appears to be a great locale for events and the summer concert series includes some big name acts including Ziggy Marley and Bruce Hornsby - lawn seating of course. Wonderful place to visit and unwind surrounded by beautiful plants one might never take time to appreciate in other settings."
Incredible family experience!,"To be honest, I didn't want to go to the botanic gardens, but a friend from the area talked us into going.....and it was INCREDIBLE!! It was so much bigger than I thought it would be and offered so much diversity! My daughters loved looking for fish in the coi ponds, while my friends' son loved rolling down the hills! The Denver Botanic Gardens also offered tranquility in the middle of town, which was a nice break from the hustle and bustle of the city streets. We loved seeing the unique art the park had to offer and enjoyed smelling a variety of different flowers. We will definitely be back!"
A perfect way to pass some time,"If you have a few hours in Denver, you will be hard pressed to find a better way to spend it than to wander through these gardens.  It is a great place to meet a friend for a coffee or lunch or wander by yourself contemplating all the different plants.  I visit about once a month and enjoy seeing all the different seasons of blooms throughout the gardens.  I meet friends here often and really enjoy the different programs they offer here.  There is always something happening here.  if you haven't visited yet, you should and if you have already, you should go again and again!"
Awesome place,"We were in town visiting and my wife loves flowers, so we made a stop here. We didn’t know it was a special free day, which was a nice surprise. The gardens are well done, and there are plants everywhere. Nice trails, very flat and walkable. The science building has some cool tricks to see as well. I really enjoyed the bonsai exhibit. Most places have 1-2 trees, but there were probably around 20 here and all different styles. Very cool. We also ate lunch at The Hive. It’s not cheap, as you’d expect in a site like this, but had surprisingly good food. Usually at venues like this where you are a captive audience the food is average, but here it was very tasty. We had the chicken sandwich and a Hive salad. The salad was very fresh, the sandwich was quite good."
Absolutely beautiful and wonderfully maintained gardens,"We loved the botanical gardens. Beautiful with sculptures throughout. Paths w in shade and sun with all sorts of flowers, trees and foliage.I highly recommend a trip here if you are in Denver."
Absolutely fabulous botanical gardens,"I visited the gardens in July with my daughter, her husband and their 10-year-old son. We all agreed that it was the most wonderful botanical gardens. I have been to many gardens in the United States and abroad. I would rank this as one of the very best. We kept wondering how they could manage to do such a beautiful job. It was very large and beautifully executed architecturally in every way. They must have enormous funding.  An absolute must if you are visiting Denver!"
Beautiful Gardens,"A lovely place to visit, easy to wander about the walkways for hours. The science bit was interesting but really the pleasure was simply enjoying the plants."
Denver Botanical Gardens,"While on a business trip, I took a quick visit to the Denver Botanical Gardens. These were beautiful with a variety of both indoor and outdoor exhibits. I loved the statues that were included in the gardens; it added a nice touch. Although I did not eat during my visit, there were dining locations on-site. The sun had set before I left so I got to view the gardens’ beauty at in the daylight and at night."
best botanical garden I've visited,"I love Botanical Gardens, so checking this place out was a must.  But I didn't expect to be completely transported.  I've never seen so many interesting plants.  And the place is huge...so much diversity, and the gardens are beautifully designed and full....none of those empty spaces with tons of mulch...also, the Hive bistro is very tasty!  If you like plants and appreciate good design, don't skip this."
this is a fabulous garden with many special events.,"the gardens are a combination of a beautuful gardens with many special areas and a series of special events.  The flowers bloom in their season from early spring until late fall.  The Japanese garden alpine area, xerocaping and teaching vegatable gardens are special.  The many pools flowering water plants and indoors topcial garden with many orchids is open year round.  The concerts are small and under the stars and can be a very special time.  It is a great place for a picnic (bring your food or buy from the multiple venders within the garden.  They have traveling sculptures from chouli glass to exotic bird houses that are always interesting.  The walk of lights around the winter holidays is a fun way to walk through the holiday lighted garden and drink a cup of chocolate."
Amazing ,"If you love nature this is a ""must see place"" beautiful landscape, flora and fauna. Multiple species of plants. Very peaceful, serene and beautiful."
Enjoyable Stop,"This was an enjoyable stop. We spent about an hour and a half. It was a really hot day, we could have spent another hour to see everything. The snack shop/restaurant was pricey, but we enjoyed the slushy. There are many details to the park, all the plants, trees, grasses, etc. were labeled. We never saw the bonsai exhibit that the ticket lady spoke about, but we probably missed 1/3 of the place. There was a kids museum/building we didn’t go into. Parking was tight, but we did get a spot. Overall a good experience."
Alpine gardens,"I love learning about plants that grow nicely in the weather and altitude of Denver.  This is the place to do it!  Relaxing for an afternoon stroll.  Good for kids, but possibly a little boring for teens.  Since I live in Denver, I visit often so I can see the impact of the seasons."
Nice,Great place to relax and a visitBeen there many times for concerts what a great venue. When the concerts are going on you can bring your own picnic bring wine and beverages. What a great value. If you’re running late you can also buy a box lunch before the concert while they have them
Absolutely Stunning Gardens and Sculptures!,"My daughter and I visited the second week in May. A friend suggested that when in Denver, this should be on a list of places to visit. That suggestion was spot on! The morning weather was perfect and there were few people. The gardens were coming to life and I was happy to see the just how many flowers were blooming! We even caught the end of tulip season!I was amazed at the number of volunteers tending the gardens! Kudos to the volunteer team - you are amazing! We visited all areas including the children's garden across the street. We both loved the insect houses, the Solarium in Victorian style and the Japanese Garden was stunning! I highly recommend a trip to the Gardens!"
Beautiful water features and bunnies everywhere!,We visited on a very hot morning and enjoyed both the outdoor and indoor sections. Well marked names of plants and special displays. Beautiful glass sculpture and water features. Lovely bunnies hopping and resting if you look for them!
GOOD CONCERTS BUT GENERAL ADMISSION,"they have some great summer concerts with some big names.  keep in mind, the concerts are general admission.  this means you need to get there early, cue up on the sidewalk, then rush to find a spot on the lawn.  the concerts sell out and therefore the lawn is very crowded.  and if you find a spot, great but good luck.  the lawn area is small which means you are quite close to the stage.  you are able to bring in your own food and beverages even alcoholic.  we saw Ziggy Marley a few days ago and the concert was fantastic because of the show his band put on.  we had a decent spot on the lawn but were crammed in with many surrounding us.  great experience but you really need to plan for it."
"Photgraphers dream!  Larger than thought, many different areas.","We were thinking this was going to be a small place and we would be in and out in under 30 minutes.  Boy were we wrong!  It was huge.  Indoor areas were warm (weahter in Denver was in the 90's).  But tons of walking paths that took you to another area.  We did not even see it all.  Photographers dream for sure.  I like to dabble in pictures and I could not get enough.  And the smell, was wonderful.  Well done."
"Sculptures, water garden, rainforest and weddings.",Great place to visit. Beautiful setting with lots of variety no wonder so many choose it for their wedding though on a day when it was over 90 I did not get why so many men could be wearing black suits!  Couple of casual lunch spots were fun and a designated ride share made a ride to wonderful Cherry Hill North neighborhood convenient
Fun separate area for kids,Great outing with kids. They have a lazy Creek that kids can wade in. Fun for the whole family!Bring a picnic because there are lots of spots to stop and linger.
Great smells and beautiful gardens!,Very quiet and great sculptures and artwork throughout the gardens as well.  Water features are great as well with wildlife!
Beautiful morning to be outside ,"We had some extra time one morning and decided to head down to the botanical gardens.   It was absolutely beautiful!  Everything was carefully designed to optimize our visit.  We expected to see plantings native to Colorado,  but were pleasantly surprised to see other regions of the world represented!  My favorite was the alpine plants growing in a mountainous display complete with a stream and waterfall.   My husband enjoyed the tropical plants in the enclosed dome.   Beautiful koi fish and Japanese garden.   Like an oasis in the urban jungle."
Buy The Glasses!,We had a phenomenal time wandering through a holiday fantasy land. Pay a couple bucks and get the glasses - we promise it’s a laugh riot!
"A small area, but jam packed with good stuff","Lots to see here - indoor jungle, a cooler rainforest; lots of outside eco-systems nestled into beds traversed by curvy paths.  The bonsai was fascinating, and everything was a treat to examine.  Highly recommended."
June has to be the optimum time for visiting the Gardens,Temperatures and rain showers combine to make June the perfect time to tour Denver's Botanic Gardens. The flowers are in full bloom and everywhere you look is breathtaking. The staff has done a fantastic job landscaping the property. Every inch of the Gardens has something spectacular to see. Downtown Denver's greatest attraction.
Wedding and Visits,"Amazingly beautiful and special location for a wedding ceremony and reception! We had the absolute best time celebrating my best friend’s wedding there last weekend! The location is also incredible for day trips, evening trips, and summer concerts! This venue will never disappoint as its beauty is unreal!"
Relaxing place to visit,"I have been to better botanical gardens, but if you enjoy seeing different types of flowers and plants, it is worth a visit.  If you have been to some of the gardens in Boston, MA or Longwood Gardens in Kennett Square, PA, you may be somewhat disappointed, like I was...but I was still glad I went, as it offered a relaxing break while on a business trip."
Gorgeous,This is an excursion you do not want to miss! The gardens are huge and beautiful. There are many paths and areas to look at so even if it’s crowded there is plenty of room! Don’t miss it!
A photographers delight,"Looking to use up a little time before a flight and decided to see the gardens. Its really pretty with lots of different gardens in it. There are statues and water features in each garden. There is even a Chihuly sculpture in one of the gardens. And if you are quiet you might get a glimpse of a bunny or two. There are also ducks in and around the gardens, we saw a mother duck with several baby’s in the big pond. They have a science center with interactive technology, and several green houses that have plants from all over the world. There is a very large terrarium with lots of plants to walk though and take lots of pictures. They have concerts there on the lawn which I would love to see, maybe one day. There was a wedding going on while we were there also. It was a wonderful place to spend some time and take beautiful pictures."
Family Vacation,We had a summer vacation in the area and stopped.  Very beautiful and loved the glass sculpture.  The kids enjoyed themselves despite being teenagers.  Glad we took the time to smell the roses.
Lovely Gardens ,We visited the Botanic gardens on a very hot day. It offered some welcome shade and plenty of seating in its extensive gardens. We thoroughly enjoyed our visit the gardens are well cared for and very varied. Our only disappointment was the limited food choice available at the eateries. Great value.
"Beautiful, Simply Beautiful","Our friend, a Denver resident for at least 65 years, took us to these gardens.  How well arranged everything is.  Unobtrusive signs identify plants and flowers.  Meandering trails lead one from one gorgeous display to another.  When in Denver, do not miss  this absolutely delightful venue.  It is so much larger than other gardens we have visited around the country."
Amazing,"The best botanic garden I've seen.   It is beautiful, large, well groomed, has a huge variety of plants, and has detailed information about the plants.  It would take more than one visit to really go through it.  It is popular, so best seen in the morning soon after it opens.  I visited in June, an excelent time.  There would be less to see in wintertime."
Oh to live near here!,"As an easterner, I was overcome by the beauty of plants that I had never seen before.  This garden is so beautifully and thoughtfully designed with speculation pathways leading one to more and more hidden gems of areas where one might sit in solitude and read or contemplate, or one might sit quietly with a friend or loved one for a conversation while enjoying the plants their aromas.  Of course a picnic is a grand idea as well!Water falls, ponds, fish, turtles and rabbits abound here!Embrace this gem in Denver and you will be glad you did, whether you live in the area or are passing through!  I am so glad I did!"
Loved this place!,What a beautiful and relaxing garden in walking distance from our hotel (in cherry creek). Very clean and well taken care of with outstanding and caring people who work there. Thank you for such a nice visit!
Favorite,"Quit, serene and so lovely. It is always changing. Even the food is good. They have healthy options although it tends to be expensive."
The Most Beautiful Gardens I've Seen ,This is really well done.  Flowing water everywhere and so many different flowers and trees. All of it is plainly labeled. They even have a solo audio tour and the gift shop is great.
