Fun time,We visited the fort during afternoon but still it was worth it. So much for information and also how they created the fort was also incredible
Good,"Basically there are hundreds of small homes inside this Fort along with many small shops selling local souvenirs , gifts etc along with some restaurants/cafes.  We expected something to do with Fort of Kings when we went. Though they have some museums inside but it was very crowded and we had to avoid that. There was some small museum as well haveli kind and good experience to see that.  Overall , a totally different experience and worth a visit…"
beautiful fort,Jaisalmer fort one of the most beautiful. i was there first time and u shocked to see such beautiful work on wall. amazing fort
Walk inside the fort living area as well .. So lively,The beautiful living fort in the desert golden land with golden yellow stone houses around ..  what we experienced further than visiting the various halls and exhibits inside the fort .. was going around inside the fort area where lot of people still live ..   .. still as real as live in our memory...  Would suggest tourists who are more curious to spend more time inside the living fort and around..…
Sonar Kella,The princely lifestyle prevailing is a must watch. Most of the inhabitants are visitor friendly and acts as trusted guides.  The shops are never found to be charging extra with a vivid display of products.
City within City,"A grand fort, located on a hill, overlooking the whole city and desert. Damn! I wish I could go back to live here like a princess. Nevertheless, it still has the same feel to it. But now it has also become a tiny city within the city of Jaisalmer. Like a mini jaisalmer!The fort is casa to families for generations. Not only that, it offers abode to a lot of businesses, shops, restaurants, museums and temples. This fort is architectural marvel and a cultural artistic temple in itself. The old relics we get to see here are sight for sore, archeological and artsy eyes. And that's not the best part. While exploring the palace, everywhere you go, you see another side of the city and the dessert. And the best views are of skies from the roof of it. You can actually see Akashganga from this gorgeous fort at night. I mean, is there more you want?!"
The Royal Golden Fort..primemost attraction of Rajasthan..,The Golden jaisalmer fort is one of the prime most attraction and a symbol of Royal Rajasthan..A fort..with yellow sandstone wall surrounded fortress..the maximum part inside fort is is house..people resides for generations..many turned into staying options..with shop n restaurants in many..The main tourist attraction is jain temples..3 cannons ..with city view point and obviously the main building- The Fort Palace Museum or Raja ka mahal..the preferable Audio guided tour makes a good trip with rich history n exhibits and sandstone crafting masterpiece architecture inside the palace..The shop inside the fort is for good buy of Rajasthani crafts n mementoes.. with good food of different taste available..A sunset n sunrise time at Cannon point is a must do..Make planmess trails of the lanes..explore the haveli like houses..feel the pulse of the life inside the fort..have a full day time to explore it..to feel the real hues of the fort..It gonna be a lifetime experience indeed...
The Living Fort Of India,"You must be thinking why I am saying it a living fort because still inside the Fort like a small town is established.Still, the people from centuries are living here from one generation to another.So I visited in the month of Feb and the best time to come here is Nov- March because of the Desert.It's a very old Fort and we hired a guide who helped us with the complete history of Fort. When we entered the Fort we saw the shops all around, a few antiques, traditional clothes, famous stones for jewelry and I bought famous Red Stone Glass which is good for Drinking water. The structure and walls are very old and they are not maintained and everywhere will found scooters, cycles roaming inside the Fort. It's established in a big area but because of less maintenance, the places inside different Fort areas are not kept properly.Suggestion: There are different places inside Fort and every entrance needs ticket so do not go at all places inside Fort and one thing not to miss there is Birla Mandir.Also, don't spend more than 2 hrs there that is sufficient to cover the Fort"
Average,"Jaisalmer fort does have nice history behind it and nice carving and all in it, but given the fact that people live and do business inside this fort, the fort is very noisy, dirty and somewhat smelly.  People ride by two wheelers honking for no reason, just plain noise pollution.  Even though Jain temples inside the fort have very nice carving and beautiful history, the public bathrooms are also very dirty.  You are walking on narrow streets fighting street sellers If you have been to Jaipur or Jodhpur and not willing to shop, you can skip Jaisalmer fort and Patwon ki Haweli. I must admit, Patwan ki haweli is a masterpiece in terms of carving and stuff, but again, very crowded streets and small canlas of dirty water going around.   There are many small small Hawelis inside and people will charge you to visit there.  Gadi sagar lake is not maintained , you can may be take a photo. Better visit Desert camp (stay in a tent) instead of going to Jaisalmer.   Mehrangargh fort in Jodhpur is awesome, much more impressive."
Great tourist place,"Canon point, good place to see entire Jaisalmer city. Jain temples & entire fort has very good architecture of ancient nature. Very intricate details."
Superb architecture,"Amazing architecture. Take a guide to know more about the fort, it's history and the palace.  It will take around 3-4 hours to visit all the places "
Jaisalmer Fort is not a Fort but city within a fort,"What you like is what you appreciate. We like forts to be Forts, and not a fort with a city within it. The approach and entrance to the Fort gives the impression of a Fort - but when you get to the square it all changes. The waste is spread around and the buildings are tight so…"
Very Crowded with Nice Views,"Fort was nice, but get there early before it gets too crowded. Went in the morning before most shops were open and it was easier to enjoy the views from the fort without every shop keeper in your face."
Jaisalmer fort,"I personally fell the fort view is magnificent from outside when compared to inside.we viewed in day light and night in illuminated fort,both were impressive,till 9pm lights of buildings inside the fort adds on to fort beauty.select a hotel which has fort view so that ur…"
Fort : marketing place and residential complex ,"Cleaniness is not as supposed to be inside the fort. Full of market. Remaining of Satyajit Roy’s film “Sonar Qella” not preserved properly. I would like to request from this forum for building a “ statue” of Shri Satyajit Roy , that can be a visiting place, as the local people…"
Living Fort | Amazing experience | Take guided tour to explore,"Personal Review: One of the very few living forts in the world, and the only reason, for you to travel to this place apart from safari. Fortunately, we planned our stay within the fort (Zostel) which I would recommend you to opt if you are a group of friends or colleagues without any second thought. To give you a brief about this fort, it is quite old, built-in 1156, by Rawal Jaisal. Hence, the name Jaisalmer. There are a few quite interesting facts, I would like to put:a)	It is one of the very few living forts in the world. You will find people still living within it and doing with their usual business (handicraft etc.). Mostly populated with Rajputs and Brahmans. 40% population lives inside the fort.b)	It is built using golden sandstone using an interlocking system, which is quite amazing, given, it’s 800 plus year old.c)	It is 1500ft long, 750ft wide and 250ft high. (You can also opt for a guided tour which I would recommend if you are interested to know more about the culture and traditions which are still being followed.)d)	An interesting fact about it is the way, a family invites the entire fort for the wedding, where they paint an idol of Shri Ganesh with the wedding details, but only the fort residents are invited and not tourists (such a bummer).e)	It will take you around 1 hour for the entire fort tour including Jain temple, canon point (good for sunrise view) and try Zostel common area (epic sunset view).Food: You will find many eateries and cuisines here especially Italian which you can try. I would recommend a German Bakery which is nice. Jaisal Italy restaurant and Free Tibet are a few others. These restaurants are nice and you can explore. Apart from that, there is a legal bhang shop just outside the fort (do try:p) and in the morning, there is a famous local kachori wala adjacent to this bhang shop that can be explored for the breakfast.For any queries related to helping you prepare your itinerary or choosing a place to eat or stay, drop me a message and I will try my best to assist you as soon as possible. Also, if you found my review helpful, don’t forget to give a helpful vote and follow me. Thanks."
Hire guide Suraj for detailed history and excellent photography skills,"Ask around for guide Suraj, small frame bengali guy who is very knowledgeable and has excellent photography skills."
Take the audioguide tour to the palace museum,"The museum housed in the palace is beautiful and well maintained. The rest of the fort is overrun with hostels/hotels and is none too clean, but charming in parts."
Huge and nice one,"This fort is one of the very few 'living forts' in the world, means some population of the city still resides within the fort. It is also called as #goldenfort  or #sonarquilaIt has massive yellow sandstone walls, with four huge gateways for visitors. Must see -Raj MahalJain templesLakshminath templesHavelisThe fort has many hotels, restaurants and shops within the boundary.Fort ticket - entry is free but to visit Raj mahal ticket is Rs. 100 p.p. One may take a cab to the fort or an auto. 'Rajput forts were not easy to build.'"
Spectacular Fort ,Saw unique past achievements.Good day trip.Well organized and useful guide info Take a guide to enjoy the detail. Not crowded like other venues.Rajasthan's pride
A Must Visit,"All I can say is that it is a must visit if in Jaisalmer. It's the only living fort and offers up an insight into old fort cities.Plenty to see within I.e. jain temples, museum etc  Definitely worth exploring!"
"A Fortified housing of Beauty, Commerce and Hospitality","In Rajasthan, India, to experience valour one would visit the fort of Chittorgarh. For understanding the political jugglery between Rajputs and Moguls Jaipur is the fort to visit. Jodhpur Fort would represent the fortification for Defense. Jaiselmer, the living fort, however, would be visited for its throbbing hospitality and beauty. Primarily, designed in 12th Century to secure the trading community that lived there, to this day, the residents within retain the flavor of enterprise in a very harsh desert surroundings. The negotiating skills of Marwar region coupled with the valour of Mewar is one reason why India survived the onslaught of invasions from North West. No wonder foreigners thronge to Rajasthan to experience this rare battle for survival fought and won there."
Beautiful architecture in this living fort,Stunning  fort  well worth exploring and it is right within the city.  It is good that Unesco are helping to  restore the fort which is being eroded by water damage.
Amazing living fort,"What can I say other than ""visit it""? It is the only living fort in the world and if you go to a roof you get a view of the all engulfing desert and wind Mills. Also, jaisalmer is the windiest city in India. So even if the sun is shimmering down, you don't feel hot."
Amazing! ,This is totally worth a visit. You’ll find lots of shops and places to eat in the fort. It is definitely worth going to the museum too.
"Stunning from a distance, not so inside except for the Havelis","Dominant over the town and magnificent, this 12th century fort has been the view from my window for 4 days.Up close it’s polluted by motorcycles and tuk tuks and crowded. Tourist shops on every corner selling mostly the same ‘junk’.Shame you can’t walk along the walls like at Nagur.The streets of havelis and the Jain temples are the reason to enter the walls.I believe UNESCO are now involved. Let’s hope they can save it from the water damage from the leaking pipes and drains which are throughout."
India’s only living fort ,Worth a visit as this is the only fort that still has people living in it. You can even find a hotel and stay in. Love the architecture and detailing of the place. Felt a little like Aladdin. Spent about 3-4 hours here
Beautiful: The only fort in India that people still leave in it,"This was my first fort to visit in India. It is well kept, even though people still live inside. The locals say that the fact that they live in it, makes sure that the maintenance is done constantly. Inside the fort, you may want to visit the palace, the Jain temple and shop all the various merchants. The view from the fort is remarkable, especially in the early morning or on sunset."
Nice fort,A must visit place at Jaisalmer. Second oldest fort of Rajsthan after Chitaur. Need a guide to understand history. Takes about 90 minutes. Guide takes 200 rupees (Choose a guide with a badge after entering fort). Lots of steep slopes. Not a proper place for elderly. Lots of stairs and steps. Nice palace with lots of photo points. Nice Jain temples. Excellent architecture. Nice carrvings.
Visit to see “living fort”,Most of the tourists visit the fort as its one the few “living forts” of the world. More than 5 generations have been living in the fort area & many have converted their houses into heritage hotels. It is said that the fort was the “city of Jaisalmer”. This is the 2nd oldest fort in the state of Rajasthan & also called Golden Fort.
Great trip,Great place....must visit.Lovely fort with lovely architecture in sand stone giving it the name Golden Fort.The registered guides take you round this living fort and tell you about the history.
Super Sunday ,It is an excellent attraction in this small city. The visit to this fort will give engaging moments of 1.5 hrs. Take a good guide who will impart a comprehensive story of every facet. Since we visited during feb the fort occupied with moderate crowd and hotels were also cheaper. We stayed at a decent place which charged us 100 per person only and it can compete with good hotels in terms of cleanliness. It was occupied with foreigners who had been staying there for over a week. Overall it is a good place and deserve a visit.
A stunning location,The Fort is just amazing inside and out. Ignore the tourist hype and stride out on your own. Good shops cafes and views. Koko Coffee and Sunset Cafe have really good views. Probably avoid the temples unless it’s your main interest. Try the Italian Indian restaurant Jaisal Italy above the gate.
Awesome trip,"Must visit eat fateh kachori take good guide  which Will explain u all fort slowly and in detail, then go haveli"
Crowded and local Guide is must ,Entry is 100 per Indian national and RS 150 for camera . Always crowded place . It will take 2 hours for the entire fort visit . Better to hire a local guide for saving your time . It will fit you Rs 250 for 1 to 4 pax
A must visit but very crowded ,It is a living fort with some residents living within the fort premises. Has some amazing Jain Temples and interesting homes and guest houses to visit.
Totally worth it!,"My girlfriend and I loved going on the tour of Jaisalmer Fort! Stunningly constructed, we enjoyed listening to the audio guide and learning more about its wonderful history. The staff was very helpful and made sure we saw all the important parts. Also greatly enjoyed talking to Roop, the art jeweler about his craft."
Great visit,The audio guide for 400 rupees is fully worth it. Don't bother with the local guides who are around the fort.The audio guide took us about 1.5-2 hours to get through at a slow pace. Some sections of the palace were unfortunately closed for maintenance and in some places (18-19 iirc ) the audio guide numbers didn't match what was on the ground. Minor issue though. The tour gives a great overview of the royal life in JaisalmerI wish the audio guide had some more of the local music
Awesome place,Take the audio tour - allow 2-3hrs to do. Great place to visit. Interesting antiques and history and great views
Beautiful,"Fort for tourists opens after 9 am. Instead of paying for private guides at the Fort, visit a Government office near by Fort who will provide you with the guide. Don't trust anyone here everyone will try to fool you here."
Wow place,Such great vibes and mesmerising journey through out the fort - living fort makes it like a little town in itself ! Kind people and pleasant travel experience
Number 1 attraction in Jaisalmer ,"This fort was built in the 12 century and is 860 years old . Has 99 watching towers and 1.5 km length of upper wall , the royal palace used to be here until moved in 1993 to the Mandir palace , now hosts a museum . 5000 people live here as well as hotels restaurants and shops .very nice visit and view points"
Jaisalmer Fort,In the fort they don't have much thing to show. It is only for collecting the money. They are charging 100 rs each person. Nothing is there to see. I will not recommend to visit this place.
Safari tour,One of the best fort of india during winter season go and enjoy your journey it's art and crafts and havelis of jaisalmer awesome
The Golden City ... Jaisalmer,"A remarkable city , the fort with it's habitation of hotels , whose residence runs into  multiple centuries old , The city it's museums , Camel ride , desert Safari wonderful"
Best fort of Rajasthan,Best fort of Rajasthan. The temple in fort has a yellow stone works. We mat the king of jaisalmer and he asked for tee at his hotel mandir palace.
Welcome to Agraba!,"The walled old  town of Jaisalmer is fairytale like, I thought I was in Aladin’s Agraba. The word fort does no justice to this whole town, one of the few in the world that is fully surrounded by walls, like Carcassonne, Ávila, Dubrovnik or York.  You’ll need a local guide to pinpoint all the temples, palaces and havelis (Indian mansions). The two jainist temples should not be missed: Chandraprabhu and Parsvanath temple. They’re next to each other, so don’t put back your shoes until you visit both. Beautiful carved  latticework in facades, window screens and balconies are  all around. Some  modern buildings copy the traditional architecture, but a guide will tell the difference. Beware of the crazy bikers and tuk tuk drivers. To ad insult to injury, they honk as if they own the narrow alleys and you´re an obstacle.  I really think they should be forbidden and all the walled city should be pedestrian. Also, be careful where you step, because the pavement is irregular and stray dogs and cow’s droppings are everywhere."
Living fort,This fort is huge in a desert area. It’s very well maintained and people are living here. It’s full of market with all Rajasthani goods. We need to do lot of marketing. Big vehicles and cars needs to be parked at some distance. The construction is of Hindu and Mughal architecture. We need at least half a day to visit this place. Very nice and worth visiting.
A memorable trip,The fort is a living fort and has very interesting stops   However the whole fort is overcrowded and dirty. The people are friendly and the shopping competitive.
Golden Fort,"Living pride of Golden city, the Jaisalmer. Shows power, far sightedness and determination of Indian people who built such a wonderful building in old days when there were very few means."
Good heritage,Good heritage place. There are jain temples in the fort. Also a palace to see. The lanes are narrow.
"Awesome, Amazing and Excelent Experience to the Trip of Jaisalmer Fort (Golden Fort).","It was an awesome, amazing, excellent and unforgettable experience. Walking and roaming inside the Jaisalmer Fort is amazing. The Fort itself is a history. It is a rich, gorgeous fort. The fort is MUST place to visit in Jaisalmer."
Absolutely stunning,We staying inside the fort and didn't want to leave. It's absolutely stunning with great food and shopping options throughout
Amazing place ,I enjoyed wandering around the alleys people watching. The tourists intermingle with the locals visiting their temples .  The colour is everywhere and needs at least half a day to explore
The most chaotic fort ever visited (in a good way),"Jaisalmer fort or sonar killa as usually known also holds the title of only living fort in world as many families still reside inside fort. Due to this there always a hustle and bustle inside fort just like a city. There are shops, temples, restaurants, cafes, hotels inside…"
Good experience,Nice fort with people staying inside..Great story about kings and their life...Beautiful city view from the fort.
Rae,Well worth the effort to walk up the hill to.This is the only fort in India where some of the community still live.The Jain temple is interesting.
Average,"I visited there in February 2020,& liked it so-so.From fort you can take Auto for RS 50/- for reaching entry of fort because it has steep height.You should hire a guide but bargaining was there so fix it accordingly.Also fix time with guide that guide has to give minimum 45 or 60 minutes because they(guides)hurrily try to complete tour and catch another customer.Dont forget to go to a place from where you can see the whole Jaisalmer."
Good one,Jain Temple is a must visit. Quite and serine. Neat and clean. Also called as Golden fort sonar kella.
Average ,Though it is a unique fort as it boast of being the only living fort of india. But they should take a leaf out of there counter part in Jodhpur where they have regulated guide and tickets thus creating a better experience. Overall the place has lot of potential just try to get a decent guide as the wrong person tends to spoil the experience as it happened with us.
Awesome fort,It’s the main thing of Jaisalmer. Great place with awesome buildings. Views excellent.  Question whether it’s worth the travel here though 
Nostalgia relived- but saddened by the current state of affairs,"We belong to West Bangal & have nostalgia associated with ""Sonar Kella"". Had wonderful tour of the fort, thanks to our learned guide Keshav. Visited many parts, including the ""Ba ri Haveli"", Cannon point, Mukul er Bari etc. Also witnessed traditional miniature painting in action…"
Amazing,One of the best fort I have seen.  Architecture is wonderful and magnificent. It's like a magical place
incredible,"A fantastic sight, incredible to live in a haveli inside the fort. It is an adventure. Go there when in India!"
Very nice to walk around,"Nice just to walk around and get lost in small alleyways, few hidden away shops and restaurants but these are normally a bit more pricey. No need to visit interior palace as walking around inside of fort is free and fun"
Awesome,Jaisalmer is a very good city.Jain temple inside it.very nice view city  It is also called the Golden Fort?
Old Living Fort,Arranged a hotel taxi to go to the fort.You have to walk up from the taxi stand.Was nice and went without a tour guide.Some small streets and some nice views of city .Small boutique shops but nothing extra ordinary.People still live in the fort.Still nice to visit if you are in Jaisalmer
A real golden treasure,"Awesome experience! Its literally the Sonar Kila: the Golden Fort the golden hue is due to the shining sun rays on the yellow sandstone. Built by Rajput Rawal Jaisal in 1156 AD, this massive structure 1500 x 750 feet and 250 feet above the ground level stand above the Jaisalmer skyline. You cannot miss it. The winding path with the 4 gates : Akhand Pol, Suraj Pol, Ganesh Pol, and Hawa Pol all in different directions; the entire path is lined with shops, restaurants, and musicians on the flute or string instruments. A living city within the fort; my guess at least 4000 inhabitants inside.The Chauhata Square with its Raj Palace, its intricate architecture, designs, balconies and cupola, the Marble Throne of the Rawal King, the Rani Mahal (dilapidated) and the Kumar Mahal (dilapidated) along with the canon on the top guarding the Fort from invaders. Also saw huge round boulders on the top which used to be thrown on the invaders in the bygone era. The views of the city from the top is exhilarating including the Gadisar Lake. This is the Rajput Quarter of the Fort. Adjacent to the Chauhata Square is the Shree Chandraprabhuswamiji Temple; an architectural delight with its sandstone shikharas and carved pillars. The Temple Quarter or the Brahmin Quater houses the temples of Shiva, Parvati, Vishnu, Ganesh, the Jain Temples of Rikhabji and Shambhavji all intricately carved along with the houses of the Brahmins and the havelis (Artistically designed) of the rich especially the Vyas Haveli. The path is dotted with shops selling leather bags, shoes, souvenirs and restaurants with Rajasthani and Continental fare. To appreciate the entire fort one needs at least 3 to 4 hours. Come prepared with walking shoes, your camera, comfortable clothing, cap and water. ( It gets pretty hot in the afternoons.)"
Trip,Present in the main city on main highway itself max 1km inside city. You can find amazing architecture and museum inside the fort. Excellent view from the top near the canon(topp).
Golden fort,Nice to spend your evening beautiful carvings on stone market is small but you can buy leather overall if you are in Jaisalmer do make a visit.
One of the few living forts!,"This is one of the gems of Rajasthan! Beautiful and full of live, go and take your time to walk around enjoying the amazing daily life scenes... there is also temples and the palace, and of course food, chai, coffee and things to buy is you are a shopper, otherwise walk walk and…"
Overrated place not sure if this still considered to be tourist attraction fort,"This is not a tourist attraction  Will never recommend this place Way too much crowd, all I saw was only people all over the place, pushing, taking selfies, shouting at each other not to stamp each others legs.. Worst place in our rajasthan dairisa 500+ families live inside Fort…"
RJ TRAVELS8,Hello friends I and my guest reached Jaisalmer on 22nd January 2020.And my guest saw Jaisalmer Fort and was surprised to see.And he said to me that this fort is the best.And this is also the Golden City in terms of looking at the Bole City.
Jaisalmer trip,"It's fantastic living fort nearly 4000 people stay there.its having history.i have seen a movie called sonar Kella,directed by late renowned film director Satyajit Ray.its a come true for me.. whatever we have studied..we saw the real one.."
Better From the Outside,"I wouldn't have believed it before going in but there's not much to see from the inside. It's pretty chaotic inside the fort with trash of every type everywhere. The restaurants and cafes are overpriced, not offering much value including the views. But again, it's a must do if…"
Best fort,"Really beautiful fort I had ever visited ,the special thing is that the people are very helpful and nice. Narrow streets but beautiful architecture."
"Magnificient fort, the only with life inside!","A huge, walled, live, golden in color, sitting high on hill, with an overwhelming view, grandeur and magnificence spilling fort, with none other to match and a legend to admire!  It is visible from the entire city and appears basking in the graceful golden hue...  It was walking…"
Magnificent fort,Only fort where people still live inside it. Magnificent technology of building fort with stones without cement. Must visit
Full of shops,"You walk the height in old age to see only shops selling juice, Bhel puri hot milk , clothes which we could better see  in delhi. Families residing inside. Their three wheelers and two wheelers coming and going always a fear lest some vehicle may not hit you."
Nice fort but crowded,It is very beautiful ancient fort with people living in it. You can book a hotel in the fort area. Many types of street food is sold in fort area. 
Aladdin Comes Alive ,"If India could ever make come alive a fort with actual markets, residence and royalty it would have to be in Jaisalmer. Undoubtedly the best fort that Rajasthan has to offer. I was surprised that vehicles were allowed into the fort but apart from that, walk in and you can visit it’s old remains, various temples, walk the alley ways of coffee shops, cafes, a bustling bazaar and actual occupants who live there in tiny compact houses which are so cluttered but probably worth the majestic feeling it gives. The remains of the fort itself made Princess Jasmines own palace come to life walking through its golden passages and royal remains. Apart from this, Jaisalmer as a place itself brings with it some amazing food, a really laid back bike and a proximity to the desert- and the fort seems to capture all this and take you through a walk back in time."
One of best fort of the country,"This is not a fort , this is a mini walled city!! This fort also gives the city its color: Yellow/GoldenA magnificent yellow on a hill top , it has different mahals ( royal rooms) of king and queens along with Jain temples and Chamunda temple. You will also find city view points, old cannons. Also it is a city itself , around 4000 people live here, so you can find many shopping stalls and small eateries. It is a good place to taste local street food and buy local items"
Very attractive and famous fort,This is very attractive and famous fort. Historical place for visit. I was there at evening time with friends. It was good experience.
Great fort in yellow stone,The fort is maintained well and the views from the top are very good.. Road side stalls and eateries give the whole fort a very nice and vibrant vibe.. The entry fee is steep and in this age they ask for mobile/ camera fee which is absurd..
Golden fort with amazing craft,"Jaisalmer as a whole and also the fort really fills you up with the Golden colour all around, so much that you fall in love with the golden sand stone. The fort is a lived in fort and that adds to the charm, similar to Bhaktapur in Nepal. It takes short time to see though, as there is no museum inside (unlike Udaipur and Jodhpur) and there are few buildings like the Jain temple and the Chamunda temple that you can go into. But it is good to trudge up to the main square and also walk around to the cannons and see the city beneath. The sore points are the amount of filth and stray animals. What is also bad to see is the electricity wires which come in the way and spoil all pictures."
Beautiful Lively Fort,Quite lively and beautiful fort. It is made up of yellow sandstone which gives the appearance of SONAR KELLA or GOLDEN FORT.  This fort in habits close to 5000 people. They are successors from the King and his courts. There are only two Hindu castes of people residing there.…

Good but not managed properly,"Good for sight seeing, may be one time.

Best fort in India,This is my favourite fort in India. If you are in India you should definitely visit it. It is a living fort and the people here were really friendly
Free admission,"Nice fort, free admission, lots of restaurants, hotels and shopping. Quiet at night. Super busy in the day, tons of foot traffic, cows, motorcycles and cars. Center of the city and a fabulous view of the surrounding city and countryside."
Our first visit to a living fort,Jaisalmer fort is one of the few forts in the world where people are currently living and we had the privilege of visiting such a place for first time which made it really special. The beautiful architecture and use of local yellow rocks is worth noting. There are numerous local…
Dirty ,"Nothing great in the fort. You can see all dirty clothes hanging as family stay in the fort. Outside thugs are every where to fleece you. Astronomical parking charges without any service and miles before. Vehicle are in the fort, you might get heart as, someone might knock you…"
A huge and majestic structure,Jaisalmer fort is one of the largest fort i the world. It's huge and tall. I had a amazing experience.  Best time to visit Jaisalmer fort is in winters and don't forget to carry water bottle along with you. Fort covers a large area and it is in the mid of the city.
Nice to walk around in the fort area ,"Fort area where people are living, havelis, temples and at occasions very crowded. Interesting to stroll around and look at the building and daily life."
Superb and Different,This fort is a must to visit. Very different comoared to other fort of Rajasthan. It is older and feels like you are deep in a silk route stop. Best walked in an evening when it is darker and the dim lights are on. It creates century old ahtmosphere
Jaisalmer’s royal heritage ,"Its the main attraction of the city. A living fort, the various streets and paths have a lot to offer to all travellers. Unique scenic sights, history tours and loads of street shopping for clothes and local handicrafts can fill your day."
Sad experience,"Rajasthan has many beautiful forts but Jaisalmer one is a bit average. The most sad part is that it looks more of a fish market than a fort. There are so many shops and ferrywalas inside the fort, which is quite surprising. The vehicle entry is also permitted inside the temple…"
Not too good,"From the outside it looks good, even many landmarks to visit are there but when you you see many houses are there,local people leaving in side the fort, restaurants occupied too much property. Fort is  not well maintained even raja rani museum not have anything special."
Historical Fort,"This is a landmark of Jaisalmer city,Build by a Rajput king this fort is a piece of architecture. Since last few centuries, residents of forts are staying there. You can see many restaurants and shops within the fort. Hotel properties are also in the fort. Nice experience."
Average fort if compared with other forts in Rajasthan,The sad part of this fort is people living inside the fort occupying substantial portion of the fort. The main section of the fort is only Raja Mahal. Avoid guides - they just show you the fort and do not even allow to click photos as they are in hurry. Do not miss the top of the fort (Canon section) as you can see entire Jaisalmer and have nice photos. There are other sections inside the fort which one csn explore if have time.
One of the best fort in Rajasthan!!!,More than 950 years old palace100₹ per person fee for Indian nationals. Slightly high for foreigners .150₹ camera feeTotally worth!!
Average fort comapred to other Rajasthan Forts,"I did solo trip across Rajathan, Jaisalmer fort is very well situated midst the city looks beautiful from outside. but It is not so much maintained from inside."
Unique Live fort...top attraction,Jaisalmer's primary reason for a visit will be the fort. It's a live fort. As in there are families staying inside the fort. The bazaar inside is lovely and one can get very beautiful knick knacks. Best food options also are inside the fort. All in all an interesting place
It is one of the best tourist attraction in Jaisalmer,"Jaisalmer fort is different than other forts of Rajasthan. There is a city in fort, you will find Hotels, house, market, temple everything inside it. If you want to experience tru Jaisalmer than you need to visit this place."
Excellent peek into the history of Jaisalmer,"Must visit when in Jaisalmer. Photography enthusiasts would love this place. Historic Jain mandir  and viewing point are two other places of note in the fort.   Compared to jodhpur, it's not as well preserved due to this being a living Fort. But this aspect adds to it…"
Interesting place - very different to other places in Rajasthan ,It is in a relatively remote corner of India - but it is 100% worth the visit. The architecture is different to many places. I would highly recommend picking up a guide the first time you go for the city as the streets are fantastic but small so you can easily get lost!
Tourist Spot,Nice place to visit. its in the Jaisalmer city. One must enjoy at there with boating and other activities
Leisure,"If you like forts you can spend half a day as its massive and people live in it. They have temples, museum, shops for souvenirs, dining.  There are various canon points where you can see different part of the town and the access to the canon points is pretty steep."
Jaisalmer Fort - A architectural marvel and living fort,"The golden sandstone fort was  built in 1156 By Jaiswal Rawal , and is one of marvelous Rajput and Islamic Architecture.  It is a 250 foot tall fort, protected by 30 feet long walls. The fort constitutes 99 bastions .There are 4 gateways to reach this fort i.e. Ganesh Pol,…"
Walk it to get a feel of the city!!,"You must visit this place...The entire city is built around it...  A great feel of the bazaar-shopping-eating... For a feel of the city, you must spend a day here..."
A must visit.,Amazing city amazing food amazing people.  It's cold usually in season but amazing over the day. Lots of food to taste. You need to do a lot of negotiations everywhere. 
Historic living fort,"The beautiful  fort can be seen from all over Jaisalmer, it's a living fort with thousands of people living and working within its walls   There are several shops and cafes within the fort and plenty of souvenir shops too. Try to stop off at a roof top cafe and you can see the…"
Only Living Fort in India!!!,"Jaisalmer Fort is the only ""living"" fort in India. By ""Living"" fort, I mean that people still live inside the fort. The main Palace of the King has been converted into a museum. However, it is like a mini city which ancient families still living there. It is a 4-5 hours' trip to…"
Very gracious and reminds of the splendour of past India,one must visit and enjoy the grandeur.  Dont miss on any place. The guide was very good and and showed all the places.

History,The fort with thousand families  living was amazing to know The king of the fort gave these family generation to generation way of living even after 300 years.  This is amazing. The feeling inside the fort is very good. 
wonderful & large,easily u can spend 2 days exploring the same. city views are excellent. have coffee at kuku cafe at sunset. have Apple pie at German bakery 
Looks Better from outside.. Overall good,"It looks much better from outside, I mean better if viewed from the city.. However Jain temples inside the fort are really worth to see...good nothing great.."
Living Fort,"A huge and majestic structure. The Fort sometimes feels like a little town of its own. You'll find many Cafes, Hostels and little shops to buy apparels and a lot of other things. What's even more fascinating is how there are so many people living inside the fort.  "
Nice Fort and good local market around.,Nice Fort and good local market around. Go from back side directly to King and Queen's palace. Hire a guide to know about haunted place around Jaisalmer.
Don't miss to see Jain Temple and Ba Ri Ki Haveli,"There are many places to visit inside the fort. I went to the view point, Jain temple and Ba -Ri- Ki -Haveli (near jain temple). You can take your pics in antique settings at Ba-Ri Ki -Haveli at no additional cost. Also the view of Jain Temple and city from its terrace is good."
I've Done It.....,"And I never have to do it again. 4,000 people live here with all their motorcycles, tuktuks, cows, dogs, and garbage. The day I went  SO crowded! We even had trouble getting out one of the exits because motorcycles, cows, tuktuks, SO many people just absolutely packed the…"
"Worth to visit, but not a real historic monument ","It is more a market place then a historic monument. Much small shops, trash and motorcycles are inside the fort. But it is  still worth to visit if you are in Jaisalmer and you have a nice view over Jaisalmer. "
Just shopping lanes and nothing big in terms of fort.,"If you have been to Jaipur or Jodhpur and not willing to shop, you can skip Jaisalmer fort and Patwon ki Haweli. Better visit Desert camp, Kuldhara and Longewala. The fort is heavily crowded with so many shops inside. People are just in hunt of money. There are many small small…"
Prebooking is required.,"Before reaching to Jaisalmer, you are supposed to get an idea about the camp or you should book it before, and also make a proper deal with your guide. So that you are not cheated later.  The day you reach try to travel local sight and next day you can go for safari.  Don't miss…"
Jaisalmer Kella is very crowded and dirty,The fort is situated in a very large area. The colour is gloden. the design of the jali in the balcony of the inside Mahals are very heavy. Although there are markets no less than the half of the fort. The fort is also dirty as many cows are roaming inside the fort.
One of the best fort ,I have made a visit at the Jaisalmer fort/Golden fort. The name is just apt as the fort (constructed using golden-yellow Jaisalmer stone) appears like a golden structure when seen from a distance. There are various things to see and do while exploring this magnificent fort. 
Fort,V large fort.unique type .Full village of 4ooyrs.diff culture.narrow lanes.architact special.mesmerising.good food points.old temples.even small house attract much with cleanliness.
Living fort as it says,"Definitely worth a visit , museum inside fort is small and very basic. however view from old canon point is breathtaking"

Nice,The And can you walk around the market on foot or is it nearby? Very good nice very beautiful is very nice.
HORRIBLE,This place stinks like if it was someones unclean washroom. The place is not maintained and there is nothing nice to see. You will just lose your money and time. Skip this place.
Bahia,Very big fort built with yellow sand stones. Dry stone walls with no cementing material. Only interlocking technique. Beautiful Jain Temple inside. Wonderful museum having eight centuries old culture. Awsm city  view from top with coffee sitting and food.Perhaps only fort having…
Very good,"It was very beautifull fort , many people stay in this fort , fort was near by railway station up to 2-3 Km . "
Not different from anyother fort in rajasthan and expensive.,"It is ok, with an expensive entry and mobile fee given that there is not much to see in this fort. Pretty average in my opinion."
Large fort and like a city within the fort,"Dec 27: Jaisalmer Fort is a World Heritage Site declared by UNESCO. Quite a large fort unlike other forts. This fort is like a city living within the fort - people stay there, there are temples, shops and even restaurants."
Adventure with gold City,Wonderful experience . The Golden city fort and dezart . Life Time memory. With family and friends .folk music and traditional dancing.
Beautiful fort,"It's really very beautiful fort which I never seen before, beautiful hand work on stone makea more beautiful"
Brilliant monument,"It's a beautiful fort. One of the best I have seen in India. The fact that it's one of the only 2 living forts in India sets it apart from the rest. Do take a guide while going in, they charge a nominal amount of 200/- and will also be your private photographer! There is a lot…"
Big place with small shops,"There are some good cafes inside the fort where you can sit back and relax the beauty over there,for some traditional shopping you can always try but be sure that you don’t forget to bargain! "
Great Place to discover,It is a nice well built 800 years living fort avoid visiting it in the afternoon lot of people best time morning and evening in the dusk. Must see inside Raja Rani Mahal and Jain Temple.  
Stupendous!!,Delighted.....we took hired a guide.... a lot of things to know about this place.... winters are best to visit this place
Eye opening.,"To think that centuries ago without modern construction techniques/vehicles a structure of this magnitude and beauty was built and it is still in use.       That said, be aware that it is VERY crowded, uncomfortably so for those who are accustomed to a much larger personal…"
Large fort at Jaisalmer ,This is a large fort with inhabitants living inside. Quite unkempt and shabby except for the Parshwanath Jain temple that has some outstanding carvings. Street vendors line up at every available space. Quality of stuff: unsure. Bargaining is compulsory..!
"Golden city, Golden Fort.",A must visit. Lovely market. A good city view. A historical place at the heart of the city. You can see the fort from every nook and corner of Jaisalmer. Looks lovelier at night.
Living fort,"Wasn't impressed with all the shops there..felt like I was walking on just another street in the city..but the fort was very nice to walk...nice view point of the gold city...I will say it was nice to have Cafes in the fort....to stop for a tea, coffee or juice...all in all nice fort."
Truely Golden,"The fort truely embodies the golden city with its otherworldly charm. The intricate carvings on sandstones, the winding ramparts & carefully designed passages for light make this residential fort a delight for tourists & scholars alike. Do watch the sunset, taking in the evening breeze, from one of the rooftop cafe's within the Fort. It is sure to leave a lasting impression & moments to cherish. Although, the Fort could have have done with a little cleaning. Enjoy"
Fort jaisalmer,"A very nice and lively place, so many lanes and in those lanes so much to experience and explore there are so many places to eat and you will get anything you want to eat there...It's the only living fort in Rajsthan (I think)"
Awesome!,"This is a truly impressive fort looking from the outside and inside. It is Indias only living fort with approx 5000 people living inside, so it is all hustle and bustle with all the amazing sights and colours India has to offer. A must see. Also take time to view the Fort from sunset point in the evening for fantastic sunset photos. The Fort is even more impressive after dark when it is all lit up."
"""Take Care of this Palace""","This Palace and the surroundings are difficult to describe ! Just amazing !!  You must be there to have a look of 400 years of history.  The people who live inside ! should be more careful and keep this fort cleaner.  That means  ""Respect"" of this historical place. Get rid of…"
Lovely place,"Had an amazing experience, loved the sunset and the view from the top. It's a must see and must experience thing to do when in Jaisalmer. This fort has people living inside the fort, which is quite a fascinating thing.  Plan for 4-5 hours and have a great time. Lots of good…"
Step back in time,Be prepared to get lost ( in time space and history) in this lived in 400 year old   fort. Make sure to visit the Paradise hotel rooftop for a sundowner and spectacular views.Lovely stores and very interesting book stores.  The old stone paved windy passage through the fort…
A Decaying Palace,"The palace is approached by a three-wheeler through the narrow bylayes of the fort area. The place is all strewn with filth and garbage dumps by people living around the fort. It has intricately carved Jain temples around the fort. As you go inside the fort, there is not much to…"
excellent monuments but need cleanliness,"good architecture, only living fort in india. but need more cleanliness inside the fort, carving inside jain tamples are marvelous."
Very good living fort- Truly a Golden fort,There are not many things to see in Jaisalmer and The fort is an important tourist sightseeing place. It is quite intriguing to see a fort with so much of activities inside. Primarily it is a major shopping area inside the fort as you climb along. The place area is beautiful.…
Amazing architecture,It is very beautifully carved and made with locking system of local gold sand stones. It is even more stunning at night with all the lighting around and inside it. The view from top to the city is breathtaking! I just want government there to help locals more and maintain it…
Golden fort visit,One visit pay is awsm. But beware of guides and pivk pocketrs. The place is really good. To roam around with frnds or in couple.  Day time us of strong sun. U can visit jaisalmer in early morning or late evening. U ll live it.
Not one of the best,The fort is touted as a living fort. There are families which have been staying here for decades. The lanes are narrow and you have to watch were you step. The Jain temple is nice but you can skip the museum. 
Best fort to visit in India,"It is best fort to visit as it is India's last and only living fort with hotels,shops,cafes and many more things inside.You will love the vibe there. It's amazing and godd to visit with family and friends."
Nice ,The view on fort look like light city. It's amazing view. It's really peace full city. I loved the place so much. We having fun with friends and family.
Average Place,I am really upset to see this place. This place was crowded with local people living inside the fort. Not well maintained place. infect fort of Jodhpur is much better and bigger.
Very good fort with long history,"Fort has great scene all it around and their like another city been settled inside the fort. Architecture of the fort was fantastic and history is long long and long.... very interesting to listen, it just need some proper water exit system."
800 years of history,"I knew I was going to love this fort and I wasn't disappointed.Built in 1156 it is home to 3000 residents, 350 houses and 28 hotels.  It stands at the crossroads of important trade routes including the ancient silk road.  It was madness on the way in, motorbikes tearing around,…"
Amazing!,We have been to many places but this one was so special.teh architecture is so unique with an unmatched attention to details!
Jaisalmer fort visit,"Its not autumn as stated in the travel websites, hot weather.  From entrance can take tuk tuk. When walking up and down be extra careful, as tuk tuk and motorbikes passes by horning non stop. The walkway slippery too.  Price is considered reasonable.  Somethings sold in the fort…"
Nice but crowded ,"We had a very nice walk through the fort, all though it is very crowded. You don’t need a guide unless you would like one for explaining things to you. "
Fort with people still living !,Visited in end Oct. and the best thing was the climate which was not very warm as moving through a stone building can be quite difficult during hot months.  Better choose afternoon hours to visit the fort as most people head toward Sam thus one does not find the fort too…
Good,"I loved every part of the fort, both inside and outside. One of the best monuments in India. It just transform you from present to past while walking around those nerrow hallways, stairways, king and Queen palace within the fort. The outside sellers are friendly, and persuasive.…"
Good ,"Fort Jaisalmer's very good location was very good the fort is very good, the stone of the fort is very good."
Good fort to visit ,A very good fort to visit to learn about its history. It is the only living fort in the world. I hope and wish the Government of Rajasthan improves the civic amenities and the overall upkeep of the city. 
City in the fort,"The fort is being restored, some of the places are under renovation. The fort has several restaurants and shops, even hotels. It's an entire city. People started settling on the fort in late 19th century and since then it's generation after generation they had been living the…"
An Architectural Marvel,"Nestled on the top of a hill, the Jaisalmer Fort, also known as the Golden Fort (due to it's yellow brick walls), is a place you cannot afford to miss.   From the terrace, you can get a panoramic view of the entire city.   Lots of antiques are available for display.   For better…"
"Finally I made it to the ""Sonar Kella"", A dream came true.","I had seen Satyajit Ray's Sonar Kella (the Golden Fort) for the 1st time in 1980. But finally i got a chance to visit this place on 27 Oct 2019. A great feeling, and I was not disappointed at all (as opined by some reviewer). The Fort is the only live fort in India where 5000…"
Ok,The fortress it's just amazing and a pleasure to see but I didn't found the audio guide and the visit where worth the money you pay for it. The visit happens in a small area of the Fort and its not that impressive from the inside as it is the outside. I wouldn't recommend it for…
Worth your time and money on this timeless beauty,"I am a history and culture buff. I loved every part of the fort, both inside and outside. One of the best kept monuments in India.

Jaisalmer Fort,"A working Fort, very interesting both inside and externally. A good local guide will help you sort out your best places to visit. "
Beautiful Palace,Jaisalmer Palace is very beautiful. The carved stone walls and windows. It showcases amazing carving work on the Jaisalmer stones. Intricate carvings on the windows is fascinating. Jaisalmer Palace is located on the Fort. One can see the entire town from the top of the palace
The Living Heritage,This is perhaps the only fort where people live and work The fort is unique in its look and feel. You can enjoy the time seeing the local artists perform. The shops are quite nice with interesting stuff to suit all pockets
Best,It was an amazing fort for me where many people living inside the fort its entry was free. There were many shops also.
nr 1 fort of India,Beautiful fort made of sandstone. 3000 people still live there. The temples are intensely and fine sculpted. Nice narrow streets to walk trough. But most beautiful is the overview of the fort you get from the sunset viewpoint downtown and it is free.
Must see place,"Must see place in n Jaisalmer, as this is a living fort so little congested area with narrow lane,lots of thing to see inside the fort. For old aged persons auto is available for travelling, good place for photography."
Fort of jaisalmer,It is full of people who wants you to buy something or take a rickshaw... Some many people arround you make you feeling that you need to come through as quickly as possible... Such a pity.. For such a nice place.
Tourists trap! Merchants trying to sell you with lot of pressure!!!,First advice: don’t pay for a guide!!!  2nd advice: be aware it’s a huge tourist trap with tons of pushy merchants using all their tools to sell you at all cost!!!   Great if you want to practice your bargains: always offer 4-5 times less that they ask you!!!  It’s a real maze…
Unplanned and crumbling,Though it's a beautiful thought to go live inside a 800+ years fort. This same thought of all the tourists flocking to Jaiselmer is the very reason the fort is crumbling. Unplanned structures are adding to the already stressed structure. Would request you to just keep a visit to…
Golden fort,Jaisalmer fort is very beautiful. It's very beautiful architecture with golden stones. there is beautiful view of lake and city from canon point
This place will remind of those days when the people lived around the castle & close to the king,"Well I have never seen a place like this, clearly beacuse this fort has houses where people actually live. They have shops, temples, resturants and everything available in the fort. They are so warm and welcoming. You should definitely visit this place. Try talking to the shop…"
Wow,"This is a residential fort. Around 6000 people are staying in this fort. Also one of the only fort which was never captured by anyone.  It has beautiful 7 jain temples. There are people staying inside the fort so as you go inside you can see shops, restaurants all over the place…"

"extremely interesting, living fort","there are 3,000-5,000 people living in the confines of the Jaisalmer fort. It's a living town...reminiscent of towns in Tuscany. A lot of fun. There's touristy stuff for sale, but, overall, sales people were not too pushy. So many nice old buildings and rooftops with great views."
This fort has different charm than others,This fort is inhabited by successors of the people who stayed in it when this was built. Beautiful architecture. Main attraction is the market inside it which is not at all costly unlike other tourist places. Moreover this fort is opened to all for 24hours. Ideal place for…
Amazing,"Jaisalmer fort is situated middle in city, build by golden colour sand stone. This fort is a living fort with narrow street.here you saw museum of encient history, jain temples,maharaja palace, city view point. Great history"
Excellent Audio guide,Well worth a visit and the audio guide was the best we have encountered in India so far. Avoid the touts/‘guides’ outside the gate. Entrance on the right up some stairs as you enter the fort. 
Worth visiting,"Went to the fort during day tour of Jaisalmer. It's worth visiting for the art work, grandeur. Would take 2 hours approximately to cover entire fort. "
Has problmes,"The place is beuatifull, but people really pushed us to buy stuff and it was expensive to get into the main fort."
Wonderful experience in Jaisalmer Fort( Sonar Kella),Best experience gathered in Fort at night time... It was really golden in colour with historical appeal. I suggest to take feeling of Fort at day and night time to enrich your memories .
indian architecture at its best,this place requires an effort to get here and direct flights from Delhi helped. this is absolute must to go and see. Fort is an amazing piece of Indian architecture and culture without Muslim influences
Nice place to visit ,Nice fort to visit.  We missed walking around the fort.  It looked like a nice place to visit.  We took a guid right from the bottom of the fort. Our hotel Pleasent haveli to here was a nice walk.  Would recommend walking up rather than taking a rick up.
Living Fort!!!!,"Living fort, the only fort where people still have their home. Around 6000 people are staying in this fort. Also one of the only fort which was never captured by anyone.  It has beautiful 7 jain temples. Beautiful carvings and nice old stories to listen from Poojari. The place is well maintained and clean. Be careful while buying stuff as they ask for more that’s it’s worth. Too much waking so difficult for senior citizens to visit this place. Worth a visit"
Interesting experience in Jaiselmere ,We visited this fort early in the morning. It has more than 3000 people living in it. We took the 3 wheeler up and a walked down. I recommend having a guide. There are many shops here. Interesting place to visit. The lookout over golden city is an incredible view
Must visit if you are in Jaisalmer ,"Massive structure, it seems to maintained well in comparison with other Forts of Rajasthan. Guide charges 100 bucks, Audio tour is also available.

Beautiful fort,It is very beautiful fort. Within the fort there are temples and shops. Carving was really beautiful
Living Fort,"Around 5000 families still residing inside. Entrance to Fort is free but for visiting King's n Queen Palace, there is a fee Rs 100. Do go deep inside the Fort to see beautiful Jain Temples of 12th century. View from Fort is very beautiful. "

A wander through the fort,"Definitely a nice place to have a guide. This place, with Gulu (Bharwani) our local, took on an air of small town. Everyone knows each other and it feels friendly. We did not look through the museum this time but wandered around the streets, had chai to freshen up and talked…"
Worth a visit for 1-2 hours.,Huge Livable fort where 3000 people still live.Free to enter and then pay for attractions.Fort light up at night.Many things to see inside the fort.Many try to give you guided tour or take you to their shop.
Historical but not neat and clean,"There are many awesome views of Jaisalmer city from this golden fort. Every blocks are made of stones and that are golden in color.

Nothing special,After visiting a few palces in india Jalsamier Fort leaves one a little disappointed. Climb to the top is littered with pushy merchants and loudly beeping failing to keep safe distance motorbikes and tuktuks. Wiew from the rooftop bar on top makes the experience worth 3 stars. 
Golden fort (living fort) ,If you are in Jaisalmer must visit that a old and beautiful fort made by yellow  stones  shining like gold  people's are live in fort in old houses and also you find hotels in fort with beautiful old room's
Traveling back in time,"We were fortunate to have had an excellent guide in Padam Singh Ratore, who was born and raised inside the Jaisalmer Fort. He knew the ins and outs of the Fort and led us through alleys and havelis with equal ease, all the time ensuring our comfort and enlightenment. "
A living fort,"Unlike all the forts I have seen so far in India, the Jaisalmer Fort is still populated. Almost 2,000 people live within the fort (although some of those are shopkeepers from other cities who rent space in the fort from locals to sell souvenirs to tourists).  The palace is…"

Heart of Jaisalmer,"Almost you can see the whole Jaisalmer city from here, Jaisalmer Fort is situated in the heart of jaisalmer, It was first considered as the home of the King of Jaislamer, later on after the death of him his precedence and other family members have now acquired the fort and gave…"

Fascinating but hold your nose and ears,"What a beautiful place with such history and still relevant as a home today for thousands. Unfortunately parts of it are covered in trash and cow dung. Also, the nonstop horn honking and soliciting by local vendors create a boisterous atmosphere that really detracts from would…"
Unique ,"Has 4000 people still living inside this fort. Worth exploring how the people manage life inside in narrow lanes. Cows roam around in small lanes. Two wheelers pass by. In bigger lanes, three wheelers as well. Has restaurants inside. Due to electric cables hanging over the…"

Live Fort,"People call it live fort as in India you will not find any fort where people are still living. So here you will find a lot of families who are living inside the palace. because of that, you will lot of 2 wheelers here. There are a lot of shops inside the palace if you want to purchase anything antique. They have famous utensils made of stone there which is very famous. But the palace is not maintained at all and inside the palace also you will not find any beauty and attraction except the Jain temple."

"""'Gold in the Desert""""",This fort is huge and magnificent.. It's a very big structure present amidst the desert city of jaisalmer.
Terrible,"With much expectation we visited the Fort at Jaisalmer.  It was a horrible experience.  It is no longer a fort.  People have built unauthorized  houses, shops and hotels inside the fort.  People have no sense of history or heritage.  They have made the fort a pigsty.  It is…"
The only of it's kind.,The yellow color of the fort is the most appealing over. It is better to visit this place during January-February as it's too hot during May. Although the nights are cold even in summer. The accommodation is very cheap as compared to the normal tourist places. If you visit in…
Ungated community,"In addition to lot of small shops , tourist destinations, temples, small eateries , lot of families live here. There are some good hotels too"

Only living fort in India and It's just outstanding,"Being the only living fort in India, this fort is nothing like seen before.

Golden Stone Fort with Tourist Hassle,"There is no denying the beauty of this fort with its crenellated walls, golden stone and rounded bastions. It is especially memorable by night when it is lit up above the city.   Of a day, it is a nice place to wander around, getting lost in the laneways. There is fine…"
Off season very very quiet ,I visited the Fort in late April when the temperature was 43oC. Most restaurants were closed for the off season so it was pretty quiet.

The Golden fort of the Rajasthan,"This is known to be the golden fort and only fort where people are living inside the fort city. The fort is crowded & as the people are living here, not so well maintained. The people are living here whereas the Royal Family shifted to Gurgaon, near Delhi. This fort is open 24…"
Jaisalmer visit- Close view to the most underrated attraction.,One of the best place to be in and experience things. Best time to visit is SEP to MAR. Sunset in the dunes is something which can be experienced when you are there..
Fort with a Difference,"Jaisalmer Fort boasts of the only living fort of India. Its a fort which is still inhabited by the local people who call it their home. Although the fort has the palace of the king which is the main place to visit, but the area inside the fort, especially the tight lanes and…"
Nice view,Only living fort in jaisalmer can visit this fort by just walking through the pathways and people are selling books and beautiful artworks nearby
Golden fort,The fort has one main entrance from where the city starts people living inside the fort makes it the only living fort.You can also wander in the streets where you can find nice graphic t-shirt's.
This fort is amazingly .,Enjoyed walking around this fort made of sand and still occupied by families that go back generations. A must see in India.
Only living fort,This is only living fort in india as i have been told by guide and the locals it has to main attractions which king's place and the queen's and also you can see people living inside the fort have luch or breakfast on a rooftop restaurant.
Nothing great.,"The fort is a residential fort and there is not much to see. The guide will take you to ! haveli which is also not worth. It is 400 years old and that is it. Still if you want to go, you can go on your own. No need for guide."
Nice,"This may be one of rare resort which is still inhabited by the local population. Gives one a good idea about the earlier times , lifestyles etc. has many hotels and restaurants inside the fort premises. Will need about 2 hours for a complete tour of the fort."
Okay,The fort is interesting but not well maintained. The toilet is terrible. The fort in Jodhpur is much better. 
Majestically Built!!,One of the most amazing Forts that I have seen and would surely recommend people to visit this on their way to Jaisalmer!!!
Lots of shops. ,You can pretty much find anything here. There are so many shops with all sorts of awesome souvenirs. Try to avoid during the middle of the day as it is bakin hot. Night time or morning would be best. 
Only fort with residents,This is the only fort in india in which people are staying. The colour of the fort matches with the golden colour of city. Inside it has many shops to buy antique items & handicrafts.
Its beautiful but poor management ,"Jaisalmeer fort is majestically beautiful but its inhabitants family   & local auto drivers made our excursion in Jaisalmeer fort really bitter; we with children never feel secure in the fort because local guide, auto rickshaw driver even trusty security guards also misbehaved & also tried to cheat seeing us accommpanied with children"
The only only fort where People still reside,"its a very happy and safe place to stay and raom around .within the fort there are temples , stay places and restuarnats .and its full and lighted win the evening ."
Really the only reason to go to Jaisalmer,The fort is really the only reason visitors come to this city.  The fort itself is very interesting while wondering within the city walls where 4k people still live is really the best part.
Amazing trip it was ,I totally enjoyed my jaisalmer trip with my cousins.. i was wondering why jaisalmer is called the golden city then when I visited i came to know in real it is golden city.. all the houses and forts are golden there.. the view from jaisalmer fort is Amazing.. sureal during night tym also the view from that is so amazing.. its just during night time beaware from dogs.. my friend has been bitten by the dog..
