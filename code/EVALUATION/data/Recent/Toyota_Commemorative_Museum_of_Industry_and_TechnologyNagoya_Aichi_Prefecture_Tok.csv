Through History Of The Motor Giant ,"We took a walk up to the Museum on a rainy day, it was a memorable experience on the two plus kilometres journey which was through some less commercialized area. The museum housed inside few historic buildings gave visitors rich and impressive information how the Toyota giant began as a weaving machines maker to become motor giants.  More so there is no anything bullish show off during the journey.   A lot of classy Japanese vintage cars couldn't find anywhere.  Almost a must see in a Nagoya leisure trip."
"More than just the ""Cars"" that are the ""Stars""!","Arriving in Nagoya mid-morning by train from Matsumoto, I thought I would abandon my luggage in a locker at Nagoya Station and head to the Toyota Museum before checking-in to my hotel for a 2-night stay.  A short hop (1-stop)  on a local Meitetsu train to the nearby Sako Station and a few minutes walk down the street brings you to the main entrance.  Just entering the attraction, it immediately earned 5-stars for me when I discovered that the normal Y500 entrance fee is waived for Seniors (over 65's) like myself.  Audio guides are available if required for Y200, but for me the informative leaflet in English was sufficient to find my way around.I was blissfully unaware of the Textile Machinery Pavilion and Toyota's history of spinning and weaving prior to visiting and found this part of the exhibit surprisingly interesting.  Like most people, I had been drawn to the Museum by the ""Cars"" and the Automotive Pavilion contained a reasonable cross-section of models across the decades since Toyota's first passenger car (Model AA) was produced in 1936.As well as the cars, I particularly enjoyed the Production Line Reconstructions associated with the Model AA and the exhibit  where robotic arms assemble a modern car chassis (.... press the button, stand back and video the balletic performance!).Before you leave, make sure you take in a performance of a Toyota robot playing the violin in the South Lobby (see leaflet for times).  It's not only the ""Cars"" that are the ""Stars""!"
Toyota Fans - Must Do!,"Museum first begins with the interior of the vehicles, textiles, steam engines, and metal work. My husband was a little disappointed as he wanted to see Toyota vehicles. Once we got to the Automobile Pavilion, he was in heaven. We've been big fans of Toyota and own a Toyota. To see the first type of Toyota to the most recent was exciting. We spent over an hour and half at the museum. Entry fee was 500 Yen per Adult."
Toyota,Very nice visit recommended for all ages.Good information in English.Some interactive attractions.
Spent all day - super interesting!,"Half of the museum is about the original Toyoda Company that made industry-changing textile machines, and the other half is about the Toyota Company. The textile section tells the story of the textile industry going back to pre-historic times. On display are every textile machine through history until now, with demonstrations. I knew some about this topic, but this section blew me away. The car section does the same for the Toyota car company.We went to Nagoya just to go to this museum and to the SCMaglev museum, but really underestimated the time it would take to see both, and never made it to the SCMaglev.  For someone on the geeky side, like me, this museum is a whole day event. They also have a nice cafeteria, where we had lunch. I didn't see much else of Nagoya, but I liked the vibe and I'm already planning to go back for a longer stay on my next trip to Japan."
Surprised by how good it is,"One of my travelling companions wanted to visit this museum as her first car was a Toyota.  As the Toyota museum is part of the sight seeing bus we made it our last stop before heading to the hotel. We arrived before 3pm but was surprised by how much there was to see and learn.  There is the Weaving/Loom Pavilion which tells you about the original founder of Toyota Loom, Sakichi Toyoda.  There were really good videos (in English) detailing Sakichi-san's passion and the original of the looming machines that are still in use today.   This section was large.  It took us more than 1 hour to finish this hall.  We then moved onto Toyota Automobile which tells of Sakichi-san's son, Kiichiro Toyoda's passion and how he started researching and building cars in Japan.  We ran out of time, but I estimate we could have stayed for another hour in this area. Next is the future of inventions.  There is a TechnoLand for children.  We didn't have time to go in.  But through the hall we saw that it was very interesting for primary and junior high school students. If you show them your One day Bus Sightseeing pass, you get a discount on the entry fee.  We regret not having enough time to fully enjoy this museum.  We will definitely come back next time."
Surprising and informative,"Whole family eniyed this museum which provided lots of information, courteous staff and hands on exhibits.Interesting to learn how Toyota started in the textile industry and its developments there before moving on to the automotive industry.Great working exhibits for both industries which were well laid out in a spacious setting.Probably not one that immediately springs to mind when planning an itinerary but certainly worth considering."
Not just cars  ,"Easy access - walkable from Nagoya station or from Kamijima station (yellow line) There are student rates. Suggest to follow the English tour and guide for various machines. Made it much better. Large museum, informative and eye opening."
Toyota surprise,"Nice museum in Nagoya. about 20 min walk from the station. The museum are in two section, one obvious about the car manufactoring and one more, for me, more surprising section about cotton fabric manufacturing.  I din¬¥t know about this at all. The exhibition was very instructive and showing a lot of machines and different technics about weaving. All very interesting. The car manufactoring part is more what you can expect from a car museum."
Very Impressed,"Loved touring the plant.  From the past to present, it did not disappoint.  It is a fantastic museum, very well run with all the different stations of productivity in the textiles machines.   Put it on your list of places to visit while in Nagoya."
Great displays and demos,Loved the Toyota Commemorative Museum. The looms and automobile museum were amazing.  Wheelchair accessible.  Beautiful old cars as well as new ones.  The robotic manufacturing display was awesome.  We stayed about an hour but could have spent more time.  We walked from the Nagoya Station took about 20 minutes.
"Robots, textiles and autos","Had the pleasure to check out this fantastic museum.  All the textile machines and auto machines displayed work and they show them working.  This is a quick museum pit stop but the cost is minimal 500 yen, worth the price to see the robots."
Toyoda !!,"We arrived at Nagoya station at around 2 pm, directly go to Toyota commemorative museum. We took a city bus from the bus center inside the station. Pay ¬•210/person (for the bus).Only 1 or 2 stops, and then walk for about 3-5 minutes from the station. Inside, we need to pay for admission fee ¬•500/ person and they got FREE coin lockers üòÄYou need to put ¬•100 to use it, but you will get your coin back.The museum itself was very interesting and give lots of information about Toyota and their history also about the machines they build. They have a guided tour (certain time) and audio translator but you need to pay extra.Overall it was a unique and interesting experience üòÅ You should visit when coming to Nagoya. Oh and they have like a small game stations after you exit the museum. And it‚Äôs free too.. just show your ticket to the officers üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
Very informative,Hi tech interactive displays.  Loads on the future of the hybrid and electric cars. Good info on the production process.
"Not really a car museum -- Toyota History, Weaving & Spinning, manufacturing","Not a car museum -- as much or more about Toyota's start in the modern textile industry, manufacturing machines for spinning & weaving (cotton, wool synthetics), history of company and founder, and development of modern industrial and manufacturing techniques. Lots of great exhibits (especially in the textile machine section) with working demos and touch-able demos, etc. Some good exhibits on the auto manufacturing side as well, including historical metal working hand techniques, as well as modern robotic demos. If you like machines, you'll love this place; if you're looking for cars and/or automotive technology, go to the other Toyota museum..."
Study tour,This museum preserves the history of Toyota . Basically Toyota starts as textile industry then switch to automobile industry. Here you can have a demo display of their activities from textile to how to make a car . Very systematic. Well preserved.
Almost too much for one afternoon!!  But brilliant,I could have spent many more hours in this fascinating museum.  First the looms and the history of Japans early textile industry and then the car museum with very interesting and interactive exhibits.
Nagoya - The Home of Toyota,".Toyota is a must to see while in Nagoya. The founder of Toyota first stated in the textile manufacturing business. Then they manufacturedthe toyota car and truck. Toyota manufacture the automobile from the metal foundry to all the parts. So we saw the step used in manufacturing. We also saw the many famous models of toyota from engine to hybrid, from toyota to lexus. All in allvery educational and delightful."
Amazing,"The Toyota Museum in Nagoya is excellent.  They tell you all about the weaving business, metallurgy and of course the cars.  They might try to do it English but I joined the Japanese group even though I speak only one word of the language.  Fascinating.  Worth every penny even if you are a senior and don't have to pay.  The Toyota cars and trucks are must-see exhibits."
One of the best,"Probably the best industry museum I have seen. The many working machines and demonstrations make this a must see for all travelers solo, couples or families. Clearly Toyota is using this as a business card and it's a very good one."
Good museum that can cater for children and adults who love automobiles,"We went there as our last activity of a day and we found out we should have spent more time there. There was a good history of Toyota company, its philosophy, products and services. There were a wonderful display of its automobiles and other AI devices and children would definitely love it!"
So much fun and so interesting!,If you love Toyota cars or even just cars in general it is an extremely interesting and fun experience and day trip! Would 100% recommend!
amazing Toyota,"very interesting and advance Technology, I was enjoy from history and structure of Toyota company. Useful for car lovers."
Great Museum Even for a Non- Motor Head,"Visited this great museum in the former Toyota weaving factory. Visited the two pavilions with a free tour led in English. The guide was great, indoor marine and entertaining. We did one tour of the Weaving Pavillon and a second of the Automotive Pavillon. Many innovations came out of the Toyota efforts. Displays are very informative and well done even for someone who isn‚Äôt very mechanical."
Interesting find!,Didn't know that Toyota started out as a cloth factory. Lots to learn from here. Love the showcase of machinery.
Brilliant experience for all the family,"Aside from the Port of Nagoya Public Aquarium, we had most fun visiting the Toyota Museum. The cost of entry was very reasonable, 500 Yen for adults and 200 Yen for children. And our children who are aged 7 and 8 had a fantastic time here. The entire place is fully air-conditioned, fully of history, and includes various halls and rooms displaying the different aspects of the history of the Toyoda family and Toyota. There is even an area just for kids.The first hall we visited was an absolutely huge one full of machinery including those used for spinning and weaving and grading cotton. The machinery is pretty amazing and many of them were running for display and included jacquard weaving machines.The next massive area was full of car machinery, robotic assembly lines and heavy machinery used to manufacture different car parts including those to weld together the different main parts such as body panels, roof etc. In addition, there was a wonderful display of old Toyota and some modern Lexus cars.In one area of this hall was an area for kids where they could make a toy car from parts.Finally, there is a nice gift shop, cafe with decent food, and a robot that plays the violin.For anyone that has an interest in history or cars or machinery and manufacturing, I would absolutely recommend visiting this museum. It really is interesting and pretty unique."
Lots to do and learn,"Paid a minimal entrance fees and the children could learn basic science and road safety in the technology section. This section is educational and children could have hands on experience on activities that educate on wind resistance, among many other concepts. For adults, it‚Äôs interesting to learn that Toyota started off as a garment weaving factory before moving on to manufacture automobiles in the industrial era. The museum preserves machinery from yester years and there are staff at certain stations to give informative in Japanese. There are English tours available at certain time of the day. The showcase of different Toyotas from different era is highly educational and brings back memories. Overall this museum is a highlight is Nagoya and highly recommend to visit if in Nagoya."
Interesting of toyota,Do you ever know that toyoda family start up with weaving business ?This is the must visit place if you are in Nagoya. It is not like the normal museum but its full of story and technology ideas.There are Toyota cars collection which you can see. You can also have a chance to view how automated car making and assembly process.Very interesting.you will never get bored in this meseum.
Interesting !!,The Toyota is a wonderful model of a motor car . They have alot o show to their client who visit their museum .The staff are so good in explaining anything to do with the model.
Surprising,"Very interesting visit as I didn't know that the founder of Toyota was Mr Toyoda....! A nice overview of the ""Mr. Toyoda intelligence"". He didn't start his business with the well-known car but in the ""textile fabrik"""
Auto History ,"The place surprised me if the number of vehicles they had. Not just Japanese cars but European. American, Indian, and other models from the world. Full of history and good stories of each vehicle."
Toyota - Weaving Machine Maker,"The Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology has a lot of information offered to anyone interested in the history of car manufacture in Japan and of Toyota. A tour of the museum for about two hours was enough to enable me to understand the history of Toyota developing from a weaving machine manufacturer into a worldwide car maker. You‚Äôll find out that the car maker began as Toyoda. The museum is near the city center, very convenient if you have the time. I must commend the services provided by the guides inside the museum for the enthusiasm and professional explanation on the operation of the different machines."
Well worth the money,500 yen a little over 4 euro. Take your time walking around. Plenty to see and tour guides are very helpful. We'll worth a visit.
"The complete history of Toyota, and so much more","This museum documents the history of the company, from the early life of the company's founder, history of weaving looms and motor vehicles, through to today's automotive technology. You could easily spend half a day here or more. There are practical demonstrations of the weaving looms and metal casting/stamping. Many exhibits are interactive, and allow you to see stamping machines, robots and engines in operation. I enjoyed this museum way more than the Toyota automobile museum. Highly recommended for anyone interested in automotive technology or Toyota history."
A Totally Complete Museum Experience,"I regret that I only visited here for 2 hours ... an enthusiast of any of Toyota's industries, past and present, could spend an entire day here.The facility is 5 mins. walk from Sako Station. It's a beautiful building on the inside, with large and open halls and a very nice restaurant. Those with an interest in textiles will thoroughly enjoy and be impressed by the the Textile Machinery Pavillion. It has live and guided demonstrations using the looms of the day. For me, the interest was the Automobile Pavillion. Very informative descriptions in English, immaculate exhibits including parts of the assembly line, helpful staff everywhere, and guided live demonstrations.The highlight for car enthusiasts is on the floor where there's a beautiful selection of Toyota's and Lexus's flagship models through the years. Quite fantastic."
Well Above Expectations,"I visited and enjoyed the Toyota Auto museum on my last Japan trip, so I decided to visit the Technology museum on this trip.  It was great, I wish I had given it more than the half day I spent there.  The demonstrations were the best part, it seemed that all the displays from giant looms and metal forming machines to the oldest cotton spinning tools were functioning with informative labels and personnel, including lots of english.  The building was very nice and had lots of space to walk around.  I think this was my favourite visit on this Japan trip."
Weaving machines galore!,"An excellent, interactive museum that traces the history of the Toyoda family and their company, today's Toyota. The most interesting part for us was the weaving museum that illustrated the company's early days as a pioneer in mechanised weaving in Japan. Also three hours or more if you want to really see this museum."
Nice cars!,"Before coming here I thought that it would only be Toyota cars.  Boy, was I ever surprised. There were numerous examples of historic automobiles. This is a good stop!"
Extensive dispaly,Those who would like to know history of Toyota and to learn Textile and Automotive evolution in Japan
Fantastic experience,Unique museum where 100 year old machinery are still working.Gives us good view of automotive evolution  made by Toyota.
Great Museum for Textile and Automotive Industry,It was a great experience in the museum as most of the models on display are working models and very easy to understand the function.Route map of the museum is very easy and marked on the floor itself so you don't miss any important thing by mistake.Staff explains all the model very well and with passion.
Nirvana for (working) machinery enthusiasts,"Learnt that Toyota actually started out doing textiles before it got into automobiles.  Very extensive collection of machines - many of which are working.  Informative and fun.  There are periodic demos, including the robotic violin player.  Just one subway stop from Nagoya station - well worth a visit"
Fantastic exhibit of Toyota history,"A very extensive exhibition of Toyota history in textiles and automotive industries. Well worth a few hours, with excellent interactive displays."
"Great Museum For Automotive, Machinery and Textiles ",This is a well organized museum definitely worth a visit.   The textile machines are amazing.  Staff is available for answering questions.  Having owned a few Toyotas over the years seeing some of the older  models on display was fun.  The metal working machines were also interesting showing the transition from imported machines to locally built.
Toyota is not just about cars...,You will be amazed by the technological marvels developed by Toyota in the automotive as well as textile industry. Great way to inspire young minds. Its a lot more than you would expect when you hear the name Toyota.
"Need 3 hours for this fantastic museum, highly interactive",We thought 1-2 hours might be enough but 3 hours is about right for most people.  For an engineer or mechanic you will need more time. We got an audio guide but there are lots of signs in english and plenty of staff who can guide you. Take time to attend the demonstrations as scheduled. Such a cool museum where lots of machines work when you press a button.  Not crowded as the place is huge. Closed on Mondays.
Excellent exhibition,"I think I learned more about weaving than car manufacturing... Prepare to spend at least three hours here. A lot to see, touch and absorb. The maintenance of the exhibition is amazing. So many huge and complicated machines that can actually operate and showcase the evolution of technology with a button pressed."
Don't miss this place,"Come and visit this museum, you will surely be surprised to learn the origin of Toyata business and how Toyata started from.Everything is well organized, lots of things here makes us amazed. We have new knowledge of how yarn is made as well as how the robot works in the car industry.Come and have a look, you will be happy with what you see."
Interesting Museum in Nagoya,"Nice museum which describes the roots of the Toyota empire from looming machines to modern auto technology.  Very informative guides who speak English as well.  Nice cafe area.  A lot of looming machines on display many of which still work.  Also, a display of the newest looming technology for example the machines on which auto airbags and seat coverings are made. It is a nice connection from old technology to modern day. Small gift shop.  Wish they had more Japan specific Toytota items but were mostly generic that are available online."
Great Learning Expereince regarding Toyota,"It is very  morden museum, which is able to shw//demonstrtae how Toyota company progresses many years ago. We had about two to three hours for the museum which is not adequate to see and experince what it has to offer"
Fun and interactive! ,"A section of the museum is housed in the original TOYOTA factory, which originally assembled textile machinery. Amazing display of heavy machinery, including an automatic mounting of car engine and chassis! You can turn-on most machines yourself with the push of a button. Spent 3.5 hrs. Facilities: restaurant, restrooms and lockers. This is a must if you are in Nagoya."
"Museum with Actual, Working Machinery","Our 2 hours visit in this museum could barely cover the automobile part. What amazed us was that many of the heavy machinery, including part of the assembly line, are actually working. There are also plenty of exhibitions explain how a car and its parts work."
Amazing for everyone,"This is the best museum I have been to in Japan hands down. It is super interesting, interactive, and amazing. It is great for everyone literally, from kids to adults. It is the best thing to do in Nagoya. It is a must in Japan."
A Geeks paradise,"This place was great - so many machines! I did not know that Toyota began life as a Textile manufacturer - the museum is well laid out wonderfully presented and ""japanese"" organisation is very apparent.Well worth half a day"
Be prepare to spend a whole day in this museum,"We didn't plan to go but our friends highly recommended it.  We were glad that we went.  This place will surprise you.  It gives you a history about Toyota.  There are lots of cars from old to modern.  Kids can build a mini car by putting small parts together, the car can move.  You can also get a mini plastic car decoration."
An amazing museum,I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to this museum. It is huge and covers textile and car manufacturing. There are a lot of demonstrations of machinery and robots and the staff are incredibly helpful and willing to show visitors how everything works. Definitely worth a visit!
A must see for all car enthusiasts,"This museum was absolutely amazing! I would suggest it as an absolute must see for all car enthusiasts! Beginning with the back story behind Toyota and how it became to be what it is today progressing through to interactive displays including cut open sections of gearboxes, engines, alternators, starter motors and much much more to give an in-depth insight into how each component works. The lower floor included displays on the manufacturing processes in making a car. This would be an absolutely priceless experience for a young apprentice mechanic or someone interested in getting into the trade!"
Best Museum we visited in Japan,"We were pleasantly surprised by this museum.  We had assumed it would be mainly a car museum with lots of Toyota models.  If that's what you are after, you might be disappointed.  In fact it was so much better than we had assumed.  We had no idea that the Toyota company started with cotton spinning/weaving.  Half of this museum is dedicated to the development of technology for that part of the industry, and the other half of the museum is dedicated to the technology development for their automotive industry.  Everything is interactive, with so many of the machines operating at the press of a button, or demonstrated by very knowledgeable staff (in English for us).  We were given sample wash-cloths from one of the weaving machines and a sample engine part from the forging demonstration.  In the automotive section we watched full-sized automotive manufacturing robots demonstrating how they put a vehicle together, weld and paint it, and a full-size model of the inner workings of a car demonstrated how a car works, complete with English commentary and lights indicated each component as it was spoken about.  The whole museum was just incredibly well set up and very informative.As a bonus all our kids got to construct a miniature pull-back model of the Model A Toyota for no extra cost, as well as a stamped key ring and molded plastic key ring, which were designed to demonstrate industrial processes.There is a kids play area that you book into a time slot for (no additional cost) and a cafe."
Must Place to visit,"This was our second stop in Nagoya [Day 1] of our visit. We almost skipped this place as we were tired. But finally we decided to go in. We were happy that we didn't miss. It talks about history of Toyota - how they started [ Didn't knew they started business in looms].  what an transformation.  They have working looms - waterjet based, air based, and then various car models and tons of information on journey. We took m- guru bus to see this place."
FOR MOTOR VEHICLE ENTHUSIASTS,"Not really my scene but suprisingly enjoyed it. Loved the car of the future and also the one person pod vehicles. Cars from days gone by and all sorts of makes, makes one realise how far we have come in the vehicle industry. Three floors to explore and druel over. Cost to enter $1000 yen."
A great visit you should never miss.,I have a Mechanical Engineering degree and I understand how was the effort of Toyoda passion in invention. I salute to him and I am so amazed with how the museum presented the master pieces. I am touched while i was there read his timeline of achievement.
"Intersting, but harder for English speakers.","The staff here was very nice but few spoke any English and those that did spoke only a little. We noticed the Japanese visitors got a much more in depth presentation from staff.That said, we downloaded the app and were able tofollow the story. Spend only a few minutes in the textile section and leave more time for the automotive section which is much more interesting. It is still worth a visit even if you do not speak Japanese, but you will have to work a little harder."
Indeed top attraction in Nagoya,"We were there to see why this place is no 1 in tripadvisor for Nagoya. It was indeed justified. The tour started from textile machines, then we are transitioned to history on how kichiro toyoda started car business, and the current  technology edge of Toyota and Lexus cars. It was an eye opening of perseverance and successful for Toyota. We spent easily 3-4 hours there to see the whole thing ! make sure you attend the spot demonstration of robot as well."
Proud to work for Toyota,"We visited this amazing museum during this toyota discovery program and we were amazed about the history of our company. From the looms to the cars, a never ending emotional discovery!We had an introduction speech from the director and he was great!"
"Nice, best use of your time",This is a great car museum. You‚Äôll also learn much more about Toyota and their cars than the Toyota Kaikan plant tour. Lots more interesting than their plant tour farther away from Nagoya.
Amazing exhibits of textile and automotive innovation.,"The Museum is housed in parts of the original red brick textile factory buildings dating back to the 1910‚Äôs. The museum is home to around 4000 exhibits, the majority which work at the push of a button to explain the working of some textile machine or automotive production or part. Amazing examples of practical technology. We had an English guide for 45 minutes to give us an overview of the textile machinery and how the automotive industry started."
worth seeing,"if you love cars, you will be amazed by this museum.  We enjoyed it very much especially our little boy loves it as they have all the process in making cars and also partly is the textile industry where the founder of Toyota starts with,  Worth visiting and its very close to the Nagoya station, can take bus or subway to go there."
Ultimate Toyota nirvana!,I already gave a description in my last review..couldn‚Äôt post my pictures...Must visit for all automobile enthusiasts! Regardless of you‚Äôre a Honda guy ( I am ! Yes sue me! It‚Äôs sacrilege!)
Amazing display and showcase of Toyota Motor Corporation,"This is probably one of the most elaborate and beautiful museums I have been too.  There are plenty of showcased textile machinery (Toyota was first a textile company before it became a car company it is more well known today) and they even move.  Lot's of staff open to explain (only in Japanese) the history of the machinery.  Of course I went there for the cars and that did not disappoint either.  They have various Toyota models in display showing significance in the company's history such as the their first ever car.  The first hybrid car, the introduction of Lexus among others.  This is a must see for fans of cars and Toyota and in general if you are in Nagoya.  Entrance is very cheap too at just Y500."
Amazing weaving machines!!!,"We went here thinking Toyota == cars, but boy were we surprised by the AMAZING and VAST array of weaving machines, which was the original technology powerhouse of the Toyota company. DO NOT MISS THIS PLACE, and arrange to be there concurrently with a tour, as they will demonstrate many of the machines for you!100% best thing we saw in Nagoya."
Best Museum,"So we were in Nagoya for the Formula one Race at Suzuka and we decided to go to this museum when we had some down time. Firstly, it was great to try and find because it is in one of the original buildings, therefore not exactly in the tourist area. Anyway we had a nice walk through some backstreets to find the place even though there is a train station almost out the front haha (found this out later). I am a massive tech nerd and this museum was the best i have ever been through, even my wife loved it!!. The journey takes you through Toyoda company's history in textiles (with live demos) into manufacturing and the auto industry. Almost every exhibit is interactive and you get to see how all of these machines work. I never knew how an automatic transmission in a car worked and now i do. Also i got to see a humanoid robot play canon in D which is my favourite classical song. For me, if your in Nagoya, this is a must do. Loved it. Well done to everyone there"
"Oh, what a feeling!","Brilliantly laid out with immaculate presentation, as is typical of the Japanese efficiency and attention to detail. The explanations were in dual language and a recommended route marked on the floor. The depth of range of the textile machines (and some working examples) were impressive. We did not appreciate that the beginnings of Toyota were in the making of textiles and the invention of key machines. The automobile part was no less impressive with the working robot station a marvel that you can appreciate at a close proximity. Engineers, school students and rev heads alike can appreciate the detailed workings of most car components. Their car development history is presented with imagination and detailed clarity."
Toyota's Excellent Industry Museum,"This pavilions are two section.  One is Toyota originally started from textile company so how evolute fabric-weaving technology by Toyota.   Another section is automobile pavilion, well known in the world.  For me impressive was Toyota standard Sedan model AA, the first founder of Toyota automobile Toyota Kiichiro and their evolution story."
One of Nagoya's Best Museums,"The Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry & Technology is housed in the original red brick buildings of the Toyoda (the forerunner of present-day Toyota Corp) textile factory and research center. It is divided in two parts in separate buildings: the Textile Machinery Pavilion and the Automobile Pavilion. Initially I was surprised that the origins of Toyota was from textile production. The Textile Machinery Pavilion begins with the history of spinning various types of fiber throughout the world including hemp, cotton, flax, wool, ramie, nylon and silk. There are numerous displays, exhibits and demos which provide an interesting & comprehensive history of spinning variations. The Auto Pavilion is all about car production which includes the history of Toyota models, and production line. Similar to the Textile Pavillion, there are excellent, interesting displays and demos. It's easy to spend a morning or afternoon exploring both pavilions"
Don't Miss the Toyota Museum,"When visiting Nagoya, it is an easy subway ride to a station in walking distance from the Toyota Commemorative Museum.  Anyone visiting MUST visit and take in the history of the company which transitioned from making fabric looms in 1880's to automobiles in the 1930's.  Wonderful exhibits, free headphones to here explanations in English or other foreign languages, and very interactive and fun.  I'd say this and the Castle were the top two attractions year around"
A museum worth visiting,In this museum one can know everything about how Toyota started as a small wool company to become what it is now because of the strong will of the people who founded it. It included a lot of exhibitions by chronological order from its entrance until its the exit. Interesting place and a treasure for car lovers.
Fantastic Museum ,I really enjoyed visiting here. It‚Äôs a massive place and takes at least an hour. The story of Toyoda family and how they transitioned from cotton mills and cotton weaving technology is amazing. And not easy.It also helps you understand quality control and why Toyota has such a positive reputation for quality.Loved the robots playing music....what‚Äôs next Toyota?
WELL WORTH A VISIT,"My husband just loved this place.  Full of history, wonderful displays and working models.  This is especially a great place for men to visit, while the wife visits the Noritake Garden, just up the road.  It is a good idea to have the address written in Japanese by your hotel concierge as we found taxi drivers could not understand easily."
Don't miss to visit Toyota museum if you are in Nagoya,"Toyota Museum is a nice and very interactive place in Nagoya. You can go there with metro plus 10-15 min walking, on very enjoyable streets. The first side of the museum is a textile industry part (the founder Mr. Toyoda invent in 1924 the first automatic loom machine wich was a revolutionary product in Japan) in min. 3000m2, you can see in progress all loom machine from 1924 till 2018 (every machine is working, and the staff is very professional and friendly and present you every detail of textil industry). The second part is all about the vehicle factory. This is approx. 6000m2 very informing, accurate and enjoyable exhibition to learn the car buliding from 1937 (hand assembly ) until present days (robotic based assembly). You can see the evolution of the motor, chassis, transmission, electronic system, robotic assembly systems, and the economic friendly car planning and building. In the end you can buy a lot of great things in the Toyota factory shop, and take an enjoyable break in the little restaurant."
Awesome! So many things to see.,"I expected to see an automobile museum here, but it's apparently only half part of the museum. The exhibition starts with the history of Toyota corporation as a textile company. So many things and demonstrations to see here, such as loom machine, machine press, and robot arms for assembling and wielding car body. Exploring the whole place would require at least 2 hours. There's nothing bad I can say about this place."
Amazing ,I‚Äôve been to the Toyota museum with my schoolmates and they explain to me everything and was really amazing to see the cars 60 years
So much to see and learn,"Interesting, interactive, well-designed museum. There is a lot of information and the guides are well informed too so feel free to ask questions. Engineers would especially love this place. Worth a visit."
Enjoyed so much we spent more time there than expected,Enjoyed so much we spent more time there than expected. Fun games style entertainment area for kids that you should reserve on entry. No extra fee just limited space per hour. Kids got to make an AA car toy and stamp a metal key ring souvenir. Fun & educational. young kids and teenagers can enjoy.
Amazing industrial machines and Toyota story,"It is a must visit museum in Nagoya.  To us, Toyota is only about cars, but it is more than that.It started with weaving business.  In the museum, it has different kinds of weaving machines from old times to now.  There is demonstration on how certain weaving machines work and that is amazing.  I hardly see that anywhere else, (I guess except factory visit).Of course there is a section for cars.  Instead of exhibition of different models, it tells the story how Toyota began to manufacture cars, the hurdles encountered, and now how machine help out in manufacturing.The exhibits and demonstration are impressive and hard to find elsewhere."
Fantastic!,It was astonighing! A fantastic trip from the roots of the Toyoda company up to the modern Toyota!The beginning with a completly different field and then the insipiration for building cars and vehicols.Everything is well explained during the visit at the museum and there are a lot of people of the staff ready to explain to you all you want! They are almost all able to speak in English! So fantastic from my point of view.Another fantastic thing is that you can see real movements of motors and plants.Wow!
fantastic and interesting Museum,Toyota started out in Spinning and weaving and moved into Automobiles thus setting up one of the largest car companys in te world. Very interesting and well run.
Not enough time!,"I had an hour to spend at the Toyota Commemorative Museum and it was not nearly enough time.... The weaving section or the automotive section.... decisions, decisions!  We focused on the automotive and made time for the violin playing robot near the end!  I really enjoyed the beautiful facility and the displays.  On a side note this is an unusual museum in that many of the displays are kept in running order and are working while the visitors watch.  Want to learn more about how a car works? they have a display with all the key structures clearly visible and moving!!"
Homage to Toyota,Nagoya is the hometown of Toyota. A museum on the grounds of the first Toyota company charting the history of Toyota from its start to its present day. Lots of industrial machinery on display. Very good laid out museum. Extremely interesting. Very good for adults and also kids alike. Recommend spending a couple of hours here. There is a JPY500 entrance fee for the museum
Good Automobile Historical Museum,My 1st automobile museum and was impressed with how they started and slowly progress to automobile which now has become among the top players in the worldWOrth visiting this museum
Boring,"This was without a doubt one of the most boring factory tours I‚Äôve ever been on. Admittedly, it‚Äôs cars and not chocolates but I was expecting some fun. Yes there was a lot of Japanese jargon like Jodiko and Kanban but in a post-internet world these sound more and more like stuff that belongs to the previous century. Also, the place is really hard to get to. They recommend 2 hours from Kyoto, but it‚Äôs actually closer to 3, with multiple line changes. Save your day, skip it altogether."
Look back on how Toyota starts it's business ,"This museum takes you to learn how Toyota starts it's business. It has 2 pavillion: textile/industrial and automobile. The industrial is all about looming machine, how to make thread from cotton up to yarn. The automobile one tells how they build this first car in 1936 (from Ford model) up to fuel cell cars now. It also has kids activities at end of automobile pavillion tour : build their first car model, rubber key chain, and car stamp coins. Just before exit, there is small playground to complete your kids experience."
"Must visit, if you're in Nagoya.",I think it's a great museum with all the history and exhibition. It's worth every penny of visiting this place. I've learned a lot from the start of the tour. I still can smell the Japanese style of telling the story.
Don't miss it,This is one of the best days out in Nagoya.  And it's free for pensioners.  Beautiful car showroom museum with the fantastically interesting Toyota story from the very beginning. Also exhibiting spinning and weaving machinery from Lancashire!
Family of 6 Tours,Very educational.  Not too missed and don't be surprise that Toyota is not only automobile at start.  Beautifully set up and well preserved engines and etc
Wonderful well stocked and maintained museum,The walk from subway Kamejima was quiet long 15-20mins. I think there is a nearer station Sako station. At the looms museum.. The museum has a very large collection of looming machines from past to present. Very interesting to see how materials are produced for both young and old visitors. It was also amazing to see the different machinery/tools technology progression from the years. The automobile museum was also well stocked with lots of displays. At the end of the museum is a kids play area to try out looking games/ wind chamber/ car rides which was great fun for both big and small kids!
Industrial grandeur ,"Paid the museum a visit and saw the many industrial machines, automobiles and assembly equipment. Finally understood the connection between weaving and automobile. The place is good for a short 2-3 hour visit. Many of the exhibits allow some the visitors to press a button and watch what happen."
Very educational ,"Booked a free guided tour in Toyota and it was such a memorable tour of the manufacturing plant.The guide was extremely knowledgable as he used to work as engineer in the plant. Every highlights and major milestones that the company went through was brought to live! You will find a complete set of their models from day one until now. Best part is the robot playing violin at the end of the tour when the plant closes. So impressed with the level of detail and professionalism in this attraction. If you are car enthusiast, must see, don‚Äôt miss this."
"Great museum, great technical details","Great technical museum. I liked the car exhibition very much, but I liked the history of the textile company even better. The museum shows very well how Toyoda built up his company, with innovative ideas and dedication to detail.A must for every engineer."
Amazing!,I did not expect the plethora of historical vehicles and the doffeeent marques.   Well worth the visit!
Worth to spend half day time here,"The museum is separated into 2 parts, which is textile and automotive related.In textile part, almost there will be a guide beside every machine to explain the production flow while the machine is running (not sure whether there's any English session as we joined the Japanese speaking in random).As for the automotive area, it is more enjoyable (in my opinion) as there are many automated demonstrations including the assembling sessions. It is more relax as we can see the demo repeatedly by pressing a button.There are also some guides to explain the vehicles' specialties.The souvenir shop is also worth to stop by to buy some limited edition goods.There will be a robot violin performance few times daily, before the exit."
Excellent tour on history of Toyota,"The tour of this museum starts with the origin of Toyata as a textile company founded by the father. The son ventured into automotive. Historical information systematically arranged and presented on struggles, challenges and successes went through generations. Visitors will appreciate the transformation from old to advanced technologies including robotics.An excellent venue  for educational and historical tour. Allocation of half day for this attraction is recommended.  1-day bus pass entitles to discount on entrance ticket."
this museum has it all cars trucks cotton machines and a very good libary.metal working tools on display,another wheel chair tour this museum is well laid out and has many guides to provide information in my case the guide did not know my question but followed up when we went past again now that was service visitors over 65 free others 500 yen.nice caf√© for drinks etc I had a ice cream lime soda very good
A half day visit,"The museum is not very big and can easily cover in 2hrs. However, if you are bringing kids, be prepared to stuck for very long cos they will find it very fascinating with all the machine demo n there's an indoor kids playarea! It's a nice place to bring small kids to. Buy the Nagoya 1 day bus pass to get 100yen discount on the entrance tickets. There is a cafe at the entrance area too and they provide reasonable delicious food at a good price."
Surprisingly awesome!,Wow. This was on the itinerary to appease the hubby but it was actually very interesting and fun with lots of interactive displays and explanations that we spent around 3hrs there!! (lol). This was one of the main reasons we came to nagoya and i was surprised at how awesome it turned out to be (thank goodness or i would have had a very boring day).Japan does museums very wellWe got the combo ticket with the Toyota Automobile Museum so saved a few yen and got around with the metro day pass.
One of the best museums,"Toyota commemorative museums is easily one of the best museums for people who want to learn n also for automobile n handloom lovers. There r more than 4000 exhibits n more than 50% r actual working ones. You can actually see the looms run, cotton convert into thread, history of toyota, see how forgings are made, see how robots work to weld a car, paint a car... an overview of the assembly process in olden days. Though our trip was for only 1.5 hrs, i felt minimum 4 hrs r required for covering the entire museum. If u want a guide u can be one of the 1st 20 customers. It opens at 9:30am. But even without a guide you can understand most of it. English or japanese you'll not hv a problem. The demonstrators r very courteous which is typical of the Japanese culture. There's also a museum shop where you can buy some artefacts related to Toyota like scaled versions of actual cars. One'll also get to know the entire history of Toyota. Fascinating and rivetting. Must go if u r around this place in Japan. You can reach Nagoya by the Shinkansen n hire a taxi to this place or a metro taxi combo. Have fun."
Don't miss the robot violinist,"It is an excellent place to learn about the textile industry and the automobile industry, the 2 major backbones of the Toyota corporation. It is interesting to see the evolution of textile and automobile production from manual equipments to high-tech automatic robotic technology. Scientific principles and historical facts are very clearly explained and there are ample English signs around the museum. There are many interactive exhibits, such as the 600-ton metal press which can be controlled by visitors. (Very fun and fascinating.) Don't miss the robot violinist, who plays 2 musical pieces every 2 hours. In my opinion, the robot violinist is impressive and plays like a real violinist, but the violin sounds squeaky due to insufficient rosin on the bow."
From looms to vehilces,"Very informative.  Truly enjoyed the last exhibit: hydrogen hybrid engine. But the transformation, which was started by a gutsy call, was the result of hard work and tenacity."
Great great great museum ,"Really extensive museum, entrance fee is fantastic value for money. The first part of the museum is dedicated to cotton and machinery and starts from the very early looms to the most modern ones now. The staff are really good and are all over the museum ready to give you demonstrations.  You could spend an hour or more just in this area. You then go into the history of cars in japan before going onto the cars. There are old cars to new cars and you can learn about the development as well as machines doing displays of how to construct cars. Again there are loads of staff around to ask questions. One of the best museums I‚Äôve been to in Japan and a must visit in Nagoya."
Obviously not my thing,"As I‚Äôm not interested in cars or engines, this place was not for me. My husband enjoyed it, but I could have spent two hours otherwise occupied."
Toyota as textile Company,"The first part of the Museum shows you how Toyota started as a textile company. It is quite interesting to see how cottons from trees are made into thread and eventually made into textile products. My 3 adult children were very attentive to the explanations of the personnel, even with just a few English. The car part is not as interesting."
Comprehensive overview of Toyoda family and their business dynasty,"This museum provides a comprehensive overview of the Toyoda family and the Toyota conglomerate. We found the textiles section a bit boring, but the automotive section was fascinating.The first half of the museum was about the textiles background of the Toyota company was well as the history of the founder of the company. There was a big showroom on looms, but we weren't too interested in that. The second half of the museum was dedicated to the Toyota automotive company and that was much more up our alley. We saw a robot play a couple of songs on the violin, which was astounding in its level of detail and perfection (we saw the 2:40pm performance - check the guide as there are only a couple a day). We saw footage other other robots performing, although those robots were retired and just on display. We went on the 3:15pm free English speaking tour and we were lucky enough to have a private tour as we were the only attendees. Our guide took us on a 45 minute tour of the automotive section. We liked that there were staff posted at each main exhibit and our guide would ask them to demonstrate their exhibit for us. Some staff opened the doors of vintage cars to show us their interiors. Others did live demos of on shaping machines. We wouldn't have known to ask them for a demonstration if the guide hadn't been with us. We were shown how automated car production is these days with the use of robots. The robots that put together the cars were awesome. There was also a large exhibition hall containing different types of Toyota cars from vintage cars to the latest models. We were particularly impressed with the electric and hydrogen powered vehicles and are keen to own one ourselves one day.There was also techno land, an interactive section of the museum mainly for kids (and big kids) where you could go on rides like a car ride where the object of the ride is to leave a safe space between you and the cartoon vehicle in front and a wind tunnel where you can experience what it's like to be in winds of 15 miles a second. We spent 30min in that section."
Very informative!,"If you are interested in cars and engines, this attraction is for you!  The exhibits on Toyota's history as well as the development of its automotive parts are excellent.  There is also a demo on the car assembly operated by robots.  On the day we visited, there were a lot of students on an educational tour.  I would highly recommend this to engineering students."
Unexpected and well done ,"I didn‚Äôt expect much but was pleasantly surprised. I loved that there were constant reminders to touch and try the displays which were well done and interactive, and learnt so much about the textile manufacturing process. Had no idea about this part of Toyota‚Äôs history. We only had 90 minutes for this museum so did not get to do the automotive portion in detail - you could easily spend half a day here."
This is not what you expect,"We thought we were going to see just cars.But was the history of how it got there. Spinning and textile machinery, up to car production machinery. The exhibits are well presented. It is a huge place to walk through."
If you curious with the history of car you‚Äôre riding,"Basically the visit is giving you full of knowledge about Toyota history and leadership.  I myself just aware that it was started from fabric manufacturing before automobile.  All and all if you have boys who likes car a lot this will be a super right place to go; from traditional to robotic car making process are displayed here.  For women and moms maybe not too attractive though.. but for me, 500yen ticket is ok to spend."
The origin of  toyota cars in nagoya,Came to learn that the toyota plant was a textile firm.it layer changed to automobiles by importing the original ford car whi h they ripped apart reomelled a prototype and renamed it toyota from toyoda.
Good Experience To Know The History of Toyota,This is an inspiring and knowledgeable experience to visit and learn about the history of Toyota and where it came from.  An easy 2-3 hours spent here if you are into Toyota......
Interesting and disappointing. ,The historical building is worth preserving and this has been done well. The display of the early years of textile manufacturing was well covered. The car section was my interest and while there was some interest it was disappointing that whole sections were missed. As a veteran of nearly forty years of owning Landcruisers  I was aghast that they received no coverage.  Their input into Australia was significant. The Toyota robots were interesting and the violin playing robot was entertaining.
Great afternoon,"This museum was the reason I stopped of in Nagoya and I  was not disappointed. Starts off in the textile section,  then through the to the automotive section. Easily spent a couple of hours there."
Nagoya City Bus Tour Spot 1 ‚ò∫Ô∏è,Not so much things to see and do ‚ò∫Ô∏èAt first I thought I was going to see old cars and new concept cars but this was a museum to see how fabrics were made before. Staff are so nice though and place was very clean :)
Best place to visit in Nagoya,"To be honest, Nagoya is more of a transportation hub than a tourist spot.  The Nagoya castle is only so so, and the famous Nagoya wings are not that special either.Toyota Commemorative Museum in Nagoya is surprisingly a great place to visit and definitely the top attraction in Nagoya. To set the expectation right, this is not like Geneva car show or one of those full blown automotive museum in Europe. But it does have its unique charm and definitely worth a visit if you are in Nagoya area.Location:======It's about 10 to 15 minutes by bus or taxi to the museum from Nagoya station. I'd recommend a taxi for a party of 4 since the fare would be about the same as that of taking a bus.Admission:=======Ticket admission is relatively cheap and seniors can enter for free. Note that senior discount in Japan is usually limited to local residents of that particular region, not to mention foreigners. So, it is unusual  for foreign seniors to have this type of discount.Museum:=======Museum is separated into two section, the textile and the automotive section. (Toyota started off as a textile company). Even if you are not into textile , the display of many full scale textile machines are very impressive.  Even if you want to skip this section, try to stop by one or two of the demo stations to watch the huge machines in action.The automotive section mostly focused on how Toyota started and how it turned in to the automotive giant. Most exhibits are in Japanese with some English. I'd highly recommend the free English guided tour.  (See below).Even if you don't like cars, you can easily spend 1 - 2 hours in the automotive section. There are demos of many full size manufacturing  machines to explain different phase in the automobile production. There are some very modern manufacturing robots too. Since the focus is more on the toyota automotive technology as well as its manufacturing, don't expect a full display of all Toyota models even though the display floor is huge. Unlike car shows, for most of the cars displayed, visitors are not allowed to sit inside. Children friendliness:================Throughout the museum, there are numerous children friendly display for kids to interact with. However, live demos are explained only in Japanese.  But overall, kids can still have a good time fiddling with the different exhibits.Don't miss out do it yourself model car  assembling station for kids. They give you a kit for model cars for the children to assemble. It's a lot of fun.There is also a violin recital played by a Toyota robot. Unfortunately, that performance was a bit disappointing , maybe I was expecting too much. It was nevertheless an engineering marvel. English guided tour:===============You'll need to check  the time of the English guided tour as well as sign up for it when you enter the museum. They will give you a receipt for the guided tour. Some reviewers complained that the tour guide's English was hard to understand, but that's not my case. The guide we had was excellent and we had no problem understanding her English. I highly recommend joining the guided tour , it helped me understand many of the main exhibits in a  quick concise way. Tour lasted about 30-45 minutes.Recommendations:==============- Remember that seniors get free admission- Take a taxi from Nagoya Station if you are a party of 4- Sign up for English guided tour at the entrance (where they collect your ticket)- Model Car kit for children.- There is a cafe but I'd have a meal before coming here.- I would allocate at least 2-3 hours for the museum, (or more if you are a car enthusiast)"
My next car,"Just seeing the technologies through the years and what it takes to make one car and all the machinery that goes with it, is mind blowing. If you like invention and history, this is he place for you."
A Gem in the Heart of Nagoya,"I can't say enough great things about the exhibits and live demonstrations in this museum. Easy to get to by a quick bus ride, you can spend the better part of a day here. There are two main sections (textiles and cars) and both are equally as interesting. (We spent too much time on the textile side and almost forgot about the car side!) The live demonstrations of the machinery on both sections of the museum bring to life processes of history. As an engineer, I completely appreciated how things were presented with plenty of information for someone with a technical background. However even for children and people unfamiliar with the technology, there are many fun things to see and enjoy. Even if stopping in Nagoya for a short stay - this is one definite stop to consider."
Great educational visit!,"It was an exciting experience. While the basic concept of this museum is to show the history of Japanese corporation TOYOTA, they carefully display how much the cutting-edge European technology shocked and stimulated Japanese intellectuals and engineers in the mid-19th century and how much they made effort to catch up with the western countries. Lots to learn. Worth a visit."
Great History Place,Good place for your history knowledge. You should be here if you are engineer man. They show a lot of machine for make a car.üöóüöóüöó
Hidden Gem,"We visited this place because we ran out of stuff to do and didn't really think anything about it before going in.That changed quickly. We absolutely enjoyed everything about this visit. The attention to detail of the Toyota museum, the hands on sections, the great explanations, and the helpful guides. Everything was pot on.At the end of the museum is a car science playground where you can try out everything yourself. For roughly $4 per person, I didn't expect something this elaborate and fun. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone visiting Nagoya, even if you are not into cars."
Toyota History,"A good place to appreciate the history of Toyota. The museum is very educational and inspiring. The place is also a place to relax because of so much space to wander around. No need to hurry to see all the exhibits. Highy recommend for those staying in Nagoya, a 10 mins travel only by bus."
Cool place especially the activity centre,"We, especially my little 5 year old loved this place!  The museum is well arranged and our eyes feasted on the cars displayed in the museum.  We use the Meguro 1 day pass to go to the Museum and it was worth it having the assurance that the same bus will pick you up to bring you back to the either the station or another tourist destination in Nagoya.We originally allocated 2 hours in it but we forgot about the time especially when we got to the activity centre. The kids will surely love it!"
TOYODA,"Where it all started! A trip to memory lane. Located around the Nagoya downtown, serviceable by Me-Guru sight-seeing bus"
What a great museum ,"My parents and I were here last August. From Nagoya station, we took two subways to come here. It‚Äôs not that close to the city center but definitely worth a while to come out here.  We really enjoyed our visit here. We were so amazed by their huge car collection. The museum did a good job to tell the history and story of the antique cars there.  There‚Äôs also a restaurant on site that you can have lunch there."
A must-go in Nagoya,"This is an excellent place to with family.  No doubt the whole museum is a propaganda of Toyota, its story is inspiring and still worth learning.  The museum is clean and well maintained.  Some games and self-made souvenirs are free.  Transportation by bus (loop line) from Nagoya station is easy, the second stop from Nagoya station.  Coming back to Nagoya station by Meitetsu is also quick and not complicated.  As a half-day activity, this is a good choice."
Impressive interactive exhibits,"I decided to go here based on a review that raved about a part of the museum that we didn't even get to visit! Still enjoyed it!  The first section of the museum is about textiles that were made by the Toyoda company before they got into the car business.  The sheer quantity of machinery they have here is astounding.  I'd recommend trying to spend under an hour in the first part so you don't get so burned out that you don't appreciate the rest.  Honestly, you could spend a full 8 hour day in this museum. The second part of the museum is automobiles, of course.  There are a ton of interactive exhibits that explain how a car works.  Throughout the museum (both textile + cars) there are staff members giving demonstrations and explanations in both Japanese and English -- maybe not everyday, but we went on a weekend.  The final segment of the museum is an area probably designed for kids but anyone can enter.  However, this is a ticketed attraction that has reservations for entrance times.  We didn't realize that until very late in the day, and couldn't get into that section for another 2 hours because it was all full.  Ask about how to reserve a time for it when you get your tickets.I would definitely go back here.  Entrance fees were insanely cheap considering what you get.There is a cafe inside and a gift shop, too."
No 1 place to go in Nagoya ,Great English guide tour for leading us on both textile and automobiles part. It did learn a lot and know more to Toyota corporation history. Even for kids who can enjoy the whole tour.
Good museum. Very informative,Very informative. The entrance fee is only 500 JPY. There are 2 sections: textile and automobile. Could take around 2 hr to complete the museum. Staff is really friendly and willing to give the info.
"No 1 museum in Nagoya, have to go!","This museum is totally over my expectation. My hubby and I went there and also signed up guide tour for English session. There are two sessions: one for Fabric Dept and one for Mobile Dept, each dept will take 45-50 mins. Although the accent of Japanese lady I can't 100% understand, she operated many machines manually with explanation, so that I can totally understand what she tried to explain. I like the Fabric Dept and its fun to enjoy the production from cotton to fabric. Also, if you already watched Japanese opera ""Leaders"" and ""Leaders II"", you will be very familiar with their mobile industry."
Awesome display of history ,"We went on a Wednesday not busy at all, easy to get there, reasonably priced, kids got a bit bored looking at all the things on the display floor but plenty of bottoms to press kids loved that, the guys inside explaining all the processes on thing where awesome, went out of there way to help, English tour machines, money worth spending if you don‚Äôt have any other distractions ie kids, easily could have spent more time there, but need to get going, Kids entertainment area at the end have to pay :("
While waiting to join the vessel,This was 100% good decision to visit this museum. It cost only 500 yen for one adult person and we rent additional audio translation for 200 yen each. We took reservation for toure guide on english which was included in price of ticket. We spend around 5 hrs there and it was not boring at all. They have demonstration of all this machine which was and still using in toyota industries. You must visit this place
Hopped onto the tour on Toyota!,Had a in depth understanding on how Toyota manufactures Toyota vehicles and Lexus premium cars. We were explained on the stringent checks on its cars and the different explanation on its assembly lines. The tour guide told us the history of Toyota and how Toyota became one of the largest automobile brands in the world!
Toyota Cars!,"If you are car enthusiastic, specially Toyota, you should visit the museum.Actually our visit to museum was followed after a visit to Toyota Motor Industry where we got to see the Toyota Vehicle assembly first hand. After that, the visit to the museum was kind of wrap up of what we have been hearing from the smart conductor of the motor industry tour.If you can avail both, you must take it.For visit to museum only, you can see the history and probably the future of the Toyota Motor!You can take photos with exotic Toyota cars, buy souvenirs , learn Toyota history!"
Very interesting but at times I felt like I needed an engineering degree :),"I enjoyed this museum a lot but it was almost too much information!  It was extremely detailed and I certainly learned a lot but I guess since I am not a car person a lot of it was a bit lost on me.  I did enjoy the staff demonstrating various machines in both the textiles and the automobile sector and was very impressed with the ""scale"" of the museum.  I do have more appreciation for all the developments of the automobile and got quite nostalgic when I saw an old Camry!"
Worthwhile,"Looked long and hard for the best attraction on Nagoya for 2 teenage boys, and they really liked it. We skipped the textile part, and spent over 2 hours at the automotive displays, and only left when it closed. Great interactive exhibits on how cars work and how they are made."
Educational trip for the young and old,"This should not be confused with Toyota Kaikan museum, which would include a tour of the car production assembly area. This Commemorative museum is interesting for kids as well as adults.  Shows the history of Toyota and their areas of specialisation.  This place is big, should cater for about 3 hours here.  There is an area called Technoland where kids aged 3 to 11 can play games.  It‚Äôs not far to travel to this place from Nagoya station. I wished we had more time to view the exhibits in greater detail."
Nice Nagoya Attraction,"Nagoya isn't a tourist city, but if you have the opportunity, this is a great place to visit. The museum commemorates both the textile and automotive empires of the Toyoda family. Admission is free for those 65+ years of age and there are free guided tours, in English, available."
History and future at one place,Very interesting. With many life demonstrations. You can easily spent there 3 hours and you do not need to be automotive fan. Adults and kids as well will love the robot playing an instrument.
Walk down memory lane,"Marveling at the well preserved vintage cars Corolla, Corona and the Celica which i grew up with in the 70s and happy that Toyota continues to grow in strength with their new line up of cars for the future. And they are still producing mechanical looms which was the genesis of their company."
Nice museum to understand textile & Automotive history,A well know museum that you can spend 2-3 hours here. Tip: Remember to join the English speaking tours:2 pm: Textile and weaving315 pm: AutomotiveEach tour is about 45 min duration. Our tour guide is Nagamine San - pretty young lady who is very sincere. We did enjoy this 2.5 hours attraction.
enlightening,"Just not to be missed if one is interested in learning about industry in Japan and, in particular, about Toyota. The explanations are most useful especially when given by the staff and the exhbitions are impressive. Not crowded and one can easily spend up to two enjoyable hours at the museum."
Really fascinating museum on the history of Toyota,"Very cool museum that features the history of Toyoda/Toyota starting with their loom business and eventually moving into cars. They have a number of manufacturing machines that you can see operate (at least in part) that I found really interesting. They also have examples of their cars, both past and present, as well as a glimpse into their future potential offerings. Really little kids might not love the textile aspect of the museum to be honest but the car part might just spark their imagination."
Unexpected fun,I went thinking would just be a mock factory you walk through.  I was very wrong. They had a huge area on textiles with ancient looms and advancing up to current methods of making cloth. The car area walked you through the history of every part of the car. They did have mock sections of a factory and explained the process and then they moved into future cars. Was there only a couple hours but could easily stayed longer. There were also interactive things for kids to do
For every technology-geek!,"This was just an amazing visit. There are so many things to see and explore at this site, that I almost regret not having more time. The staff is also extremely friendly - and really shows you so many nice things."
TCMIT - Toyota History in 3 hrs.,"If you are in Nagoya, have 3 to 4 hrs in the afternoon and love Toyota, find time to visit this place.Key Tip - join  both the afternoon English free guided tour.14:00	Textile Machinery Pavilion	45 minutes15:15	Automobile Pavilion		45 minutesThis should be more than enough for you to cover everything.Excellent museum - education / learning experience."
not just cars!,The Toyoda family has put together a fabulous display of their weaving machinery/steam generators and car beginnings.
A very informative museum for any Japanese car fan,"I am a Toyota fan and had always wanted to find out more about it's beginnings. We missed the English guided tour. Those interested in the place should check out the timing for the guided tours. Otherwise, there are audio guides which costs ¬•200 each.  Parents with kids will also enjoy the place as there are many hands on activities and also a technoland for kids to explore."
Toyota,Toyota=Nagoya.. learned about the humble beginnings of Toyota. Saw the looms that turned the company into an international car giant. Must see in Nagoya.
Excellent place to go,Follow the story of the mechanising of the cotton industry leading to the start of the huge Toyota vehicle company.Located on the original factory site with many machines still running as demonstrations this was a good place to go. Not forgetting the violin playing robot in the entry hall.  If your in Nagoya I would advise you not to miss this place.
Excellent Museum,"This museum was a huge standout, I would highly recommend it to everyone who visits Nagoya. The exhibits were informative and inspiring as it depicts the story of Toyota. Pros: Beautiful exhibits and displays which tells a good story of Toyota evolvement. It was a real inspiring story! Tickets were very cheap also at only ¬•500 per adult. Cons: none!"
Amazing Learning Experience,"The museum showcased Toyota's beginnings from manufacturing automatic looms to being the largest automotive manufacturers of the world.The museum is also very interactive for kids, they can turn knobs to operate looms,  watch a car production line, and see a robot violin soloist perform.For the car enthusiasts, there is the automobile area showing the very first Toyota vehicles, vintage cars, and the latest hybrid and concept cars.  This museum will appeal to people of all ages."
Excellent Museum ,"In Nagoya for business and stuck for what to do at the weekends, a friend suggested a visit to Toyota. Very easy to get to, really friendly and informative staff. The cars are everything, some of the rarest models you will ever see and get very close to. So pleased to see a Datsun 2000GT, Bugatti, Gull wing Mercedes and the modern Lexus LFE. The museum is such a delight, family friendly or just on your own. Thank you Toyota, a thoroughly enjoyable experience."
Excellent,"This place as a quick train ride up from Nagoya Central and is really worthwhile -especially if you have a bored wife or kids in tow. The staff are superb, plenty of English spoken and the exhibits are really interesting. A couple of hours will tell you a lot about how Toyota started and the company history which tends to gloss over the unpleasantness during the early 1940‚Äôs but nevertheless very informative.It is a bit of a faff getting on the right train but a taxi or even a long walk makes it easily doable."
Great way to learn about the Toyota company,"This was a good museum to visit to learn about the Toyota company, but it focuses more on the looming company Toyota was before it started in the automotive industry. There are a lot of good cars on display though and you can see a robot pay the violin. I suggest going to see this but also the other Toyota Museum which is a bit futher out. Best to see both"
See where the Japanese got their ideas about how to build vehicles from!!,"Good exhibits. Functioning cut-away engines, gear boxes, etc. Working presses, robots, etc. Well worth a visit for the technically minded!!"
Really interesting,"We did not arrive here until 4pm so unfortunately only had an hour, so it was a whistle-stop tour.Really interesting displays and demonstrations, would suit any age groupWould definitely recommend"
Robot music band,Very Interesting.Need to reserve at least at three to four hours to look at all exibits.Fans of motor cars need much more time to study the machine models.
interesting museum with lots of activities for kids,It is an interesting museum with a display of the old and latest production of Toyota. There are many interesting activities for children during the visit and a dedicated technical playground room. The museum provides free tour in English at certain times.
This museum will blow a car fan's mind!,"This museum is a rather unique idea. Firstly there is a historical display of textile machinery and then a very comprehensive historical display of Toyota cars and their engines.  There is a computer controlled car engine which shows what happens when a car engine is fired and also shows what happens to the wheels etc when the car turns a corner. We were all fascinated by the orchestral robots and in particular, with the robot which plays a violin. There is something for everyone here."
Great museum for adults and kids,"I have to convince both my parents and kids to go to this museum, but it turned out to be quite a nice surprise, and they all enjoyed it. Not only it shows the history of textile and automotive machinery but it also explains in details, shows how things work, and displays interactively the technology evolution in a very nice and interesting way. It is both very educational and fun. The building itself was renovated from the original factory and already worth the visit. Location is close to Nagoya station with free parking. Young kids also have a separate session for they to play games. Can easily keep whole family 3 to 4 hours there without boring anyone. Price is reasonable with discount for kids and free for elderly."
Not just a car manufacturer,"you will find out a lot of history for Toyota from this visit. The founder, their original business and how does it get into auto business."
An Interactive Automotive Museum With Many Surprises,"I consider the Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology in Nagoya a must-see for not just gear-heads (like myself and my brother who visited with me) but also for families with children who will be interested by the myriad interactive displays. But the tour starts where inventor and industrialist Toyoda started; with textile loom technology and development.  In the entry lobby to the textile museum stands the massive circular loom invented by Toyoda at the beginning of the 20th century.  This intriguing 1906 machine is still operable and is demonstrated by a docent on a regular schedule.Many of the machines and processes of both textile and automotive technology are actuated by your press of a button or operated and explained in both Japanese and English by one of the many museum docents.  In the auto section the kid in me enjoyed simultaneously pressing two large buttons (just as a press operator must do) to actuate the 600-ton sheet-metal press on display.The signage is in Japanese and English and the docents, who are assigned to particular displays, have enough English to explain their display.  There is a cafe in the museum where we had an inexpensive light lunch.  The museum's admission charge is a very reasonable 500 Yen for adults (currently about $4.50US).  Children are at a reduced rate but my brother and I as Seniors (65+) received free admission."
It is the thing to do in Nagoya for a good reason,"If you have a Japan Rail Pass, I suggest that you take a morning to come to these Museum. It takes you to the history of Toyota (including English guided tours) to their evolution through time with many activities to keep you engaged (even if cars is not your thing)"
Great museum,If you're interested in cars (and/or Toyota) you have to visit.  Great opportunity to learn about Toyota's history.
excellent museum,"In this museum you will learn the story of Mr. Toyoda (name of company changed later to Toyota) and his interest in developing better weaving looms, and how that morphed into one of the world's foremost automobile manufacturers. It is really the story of the 20th century, told through the lens of a Japanese entrepreneur, and also gives a glimpse he future of cars. It was well worth the visit for those interested in cars, science, engineering and technology, and also for those who are really not so interested in those topics, who also will learn something. The site is well laid out and easy to follow. They have a restaurant (did not try) outside the admission area, and a nice cafe which I did eat at. They also have a great shop with lots of interesting things (can get to the cafe or shop without admission). The admission fee is only 500 yen for an adult, and free if over 65."
Illuminating museum,"OK I have my personal bias towards technology, but this museum is really a gem. It‚Äôs small and takes little time to visit; still, it is very well maintained, all historical machines (including engines of first car models) are fully functional and you can turn them on. There is also a little corner for children. There are many guides employed by the museum which will show you around. They were very professional and helpful 5+ for the service, 5 for the attraction. Cost is 500 Yen, 400 if you have a daily pass."
Awesome museum if you like Toyota,"The museum is dedicated to telling the story of how the biggest car company in the world was founded.From early pre-war weaving machine development to R&D to build and maintain cars.It features timelines, old industrial equipment, cars, historic items, and all is available in English or a guides tour. We strolled around for a good 4 hours, and had an awesome day."
Gear Head Heaven!,If your a gear head like me or just anyone who loves being with cars this is one place you would really be want to go to if you happen to be in Nagoya.. My kids loved the place cause it also offers a lot of Fun Areas and activities for kids which is a plus! It is also friendly for seniors which i happen to have with me on this trip..  Having to see this place with my family was an enjoyable experience.. I do hope you guys get to see it too..!
"An amazing museum, just wish I'd had more time!","I decided to split my day between visiting the Toyota Automobile Museum and here. To be honest I wish I'd skipped the Automobile museum and headed straight here as I don't feel the 3 hours I spent here was anywhere near enough to take it all in! The museum is huge and laid out beautifully, the exhibits are very interesting with some of them working and some of them interactive as well, which is exactly what I like in a museum. I can throughly recommend a visit to anybody, there is quite a bit of English signage but it could certainly do with some improvement in places as there was information there in Japanese but not in English that was quite interesting so bear that in mind."
More than expected ,The museum tells a great story of Toyota's founder and how they started from weaving to automobile manufacturing. They have machine displays and manufacturing demonstrations. Kids and elderly will enjoy spending some time here.
Worth a visit,A surprising interesting museum and definitely worth the visit.I thought I would only spend 1 hour In here but it's very interesting and I spent almost 2.5 hours. Entrance fee is 500 yen per adult and there's free parking.
Well worth a visit,I'm slightly disapointed that I didn't allow more time for this museum.  We stopped off here on whim in the morning to fill in some time.  It's fair to say I'm not all that interested in weaving or cars however I found this place fascinating.  The exhibits are well laid out and signage is great.  The staff are more than happy to explain things to you and show you some cool things as well.  There are plenty of hands on exhibits as well.  I'd put this at the top of list of things to do in central Nagoya.
"Fun place, and amazing to learn about Toyota","This museum explains Toyota's roots and growth front various industries into the global juggernaut it is today. It is fun and surprising in many ways and an excellent way to learn about automobile construction. There is a nice library on site, a small coffee shop/restaurant and a souvenir store.Worth a visit, particularly if you like cars or manufacturing."
Toyota museum,excellent display of exhibits both in cotton looming and development of toyota motor company. Most machinery seem to be in working ordering well taken care of. There are number of staff employed to explain the exhibits but often these are done in Japanese. Some more English could be used in exhibits as well> Overall well managed museum.
Unexpectedly interesting ,The place is more interesting than expected. The museum shows each single parts of the car in details with demonstration. It is a place for both kids and adults!
Excellent Working Displays & Demonstrations,"I visited the Museum from the U.S. and do not speak Japanese.  There is English-speaking audio tour equipment available for Y200 (about $2).  Toyota started as a textile manufacturer.  There are textile and automotive sections.  Throughout both sections were clear, live demonstrations of spinning cotton, from spinning wheels to modern equipment.  I was amazed at how many working pieces of equipment were there.  Numerous times, the staff would start a demo when I approached their area.  The auto section has many displays with moving parts showing how auto systems work (e.g. steering, brakes, transmission, etc.), and the manufacturing process.  I don't have young kids, but there was an interactive section for kids that looked very engaging.I would highly recommend this museum."
A gem.,"My 12 year old son and I went on vacation in Japan.  We could not secure a factory tour, so we opted to do this instead since we were in Nagoya.We went to see the car museum in mind, but were fascinated by the Toyota looms and spinning machines that were the foundation of the company.  It was a lovely learning experience to see how machines take raw cotton and turn it into yarn, thread, and then fabric.  Many of the machines are operational and show you the entire process.The car museum is cool too.  In expected Japanese fashion, the museum get into the small details of the inside of a car and how it is made.We also watched a robot play a violin."
Excellent,A real learning experience for my 13 year old. This is a truly great museum with so much working evidence of the growth of technology.   Very impressed.
Worth to visit,"It is a good place to visit. You are going to learn the history of the company and story of its founder, which is really inspiring.There are lots of mechanical demonstrations and interactive activities. Elementary school students can get souvenir free of charge."
Super interesting for kids and adults,I came here with  my teenage daughter who was doing a language course at a Japanese school near Nagoya.  We loved this museum and learned a lot about Toyota and the car industry in Japan.  There are lots of interactive activities and it is designed with non-Japanese audience in mind.  It is easy to get to and inexpensive.  Highly recommended.
Nice for all ages,"The museum is very informative and interactive, which makes it fun to walk around in. Toyoda started out as a weaving company and there are museum employees that explain each step in the process and development, letting you touch and see the fabric and cotton. Then, as you move on to the Toyota we know today, everything is displayed in a clear and (again) interactive way, making it a true sight. There are also many activities for children to help them understand the mechanical part of Toyota. Definitely fun!"
Must Visit !,"We stayed in the Marriott hotel in Nagoya Station and it's just one railway station from the hotel.  Very fast and convenient to come here.  Maybe we came on weekdays and there were not many visitors, so we could walk freely and enjoy all the exhibition. There're a lot of exhibitions and demonstration.  We didn't join the guided English tours, but it's not difficult to understand.  It's actually like a science museum, but focusing on weaving and car related (Toyota was started up as a weaving factory). Besides exhibition, there is a game center which games are also related to car science.  For sure kids will have fun there, don't miss it if you've kids.  Even I and my wife enjoyed the games there.Last but not least, it costs only 500 yen for entrance fee and it's really worth it.  It's a MUST visit in Nagoya"
Fascinating ,I'm not that interested in cars but found it surprisingly interesting. Also it was quite cheap with entry being ¬•500 (adults). There are two Toyota museums - careful not to mix them up!
Toyota Museum,"This is a must see for any one interested in motor vehicles.It has an amazing array of vehicles from all over the World,as well as the first Toyoda passanger car in 1934,as well as most models of Toyota cars..The Textile Mill Museum is an amazing part of the Toyota manufacturing empire,as it was the first foray into mass production by the founder of Toyota,before cars.Its a little way from Nagoya,but assessible by train and a walk."
Toyota came from cotton,"This museum will totally change your view and inspire you at all. How many people know that Toyota age was established from cotton factory!! Those change were made by group of person who change the World. All is about inspiration, don't stop yourself keep going everyone"
My favourite museum of all times,"This is my second time in Nagoya and I needed to come back to this museum.  It's so lively in there, I'd probably go again!Great for kids on the weekends as they get to make their own toy cars and key chains.You'll spend minimum of 2 hours there, give yourself plenty of time!"
Toyota Great experience ,"I have visit the Museam Dec 16, I was really impressed well organized , easy to walk around , guided signage everywhere , Toyota history from A to Z, different manufacturing machines from high-Tec industry to car manufacturing .   What ever am gonna write or explain is not enough to describe the Toyota museums .  Great work done by Japanese mega company . For sure will visit agin .. make sure you visit it ..."
Great journey thru Toyota history,The museum is great to visit but only covers Toyotas areas of production (textile machinery and automobiles). The automobile part is displayed in a very good way. Loved it! A lot of car history.
History of Toyota / Toyoda,This place is really more of telling the history of how the Toyota Company came about....from its start of a loom facyory to what it is now known today as the leading car manufacturer.Perfect for people who want to learn about how cars are manufactured...but not really for car enthusiasts. If you're looking to see vintage cars..this place just has a few.There is another automible museum dedicated only for vintage cars by Toyota but its an hour away from this place either by bus/train.
For car lovers,"Although this is not a ""must see"" or ""must do"" attraction, it's a nice place, specially for car enthusiasts like me. Besides, in Japan there are not so many really options of leisure and fun, so it pays a visit here if you have plenty of free time. Half day is enough, though."
If you love cars,When in through the Nagoya hop on hop off bus and it was free entrance when we got there.Great place to learn about Toyota and how they transition from cotton to cars.
What an amazing place!,I'm not an engineering type but so glad I picked this Museum when I had a few hours in Nagoya.  It is an easy 25 min walk from the train station.  I took the English language tour of the textile portion and it helped me understand the main points of each machine.  I did the auto section alone but wish  I'd had time to do the tour.  I did really enjoy the film of the factory and then watching all the machines work right in front of me.  Don't miss it!
A museum with plenty for everyone,"This museum is a wonderful place to spend a day in Nagoya. So much about the history of Toyota and the lives of the company's founders can be learned here. There are a large variety of exhibits meaning someone is bound to come across an exhibit that are fascinated by. In addition, the staff and guides can be found throughout the museum and are extremely accommodating to help with whatever you need. I would highly recommend this museum to anyone who's curious about the history of one of Japan's most successful companies."
"We are into cars, so this is a must visit site","About one hour from Nagoya with slightly confusing train route since part in the middle was not JR and had to pay extra. We arrived on time for the tour. Very organized and punctual, Japanese style, with friendly tour guide. We visited some of the conveyor points in the factory, and some fun games along the walk. We saw enough to understand car making Toyota style, All in all, a good visit and very organized and clean factory. The museum displays the history of Toyota with the important cars on display.We visited Mazda factory before, and we rate Mazda tour slightly better because more of the car making process was in display, color selection, engine placement on to the chasis etc. But that should not deter your visit here if you are like cars."
"Amazing displays, not only of cars but looms as well. Loved it!","We visited this museum on May 26, 2017. This was a very interesting and educational place to visit and we fell in love with this museum. We got there right before they opened. First we went into the looms warehouse. Looms are weaving machines. We were so happy to see this because we had no idea we would find such huge display of looms, the history and the time line of the Toyoda Looms Works who later became Toyota Motor Corporation.  You can observe the many different types of looms from the antique and very simple models to the very huge more modern types. The entrance fee is very affordable and it is a very popular place to visit. I recommend going early.  After seeing the looms area which by the way is very big, we moved on to the car display warehouse or show room. Again we were amazed to learn the history of how Toyoda became Toyota and the whole line of cars that were produced in the early years. This is an amazing place to visit and it will not let you down. They have a gift shop and a place to buy food as well. Do not miss going to this museum when you are in Nagoya. Strongly recommend it!"
Very interesting array of cars.,This was a great place to view the history of Toyota and the growth of their brand in Japan and how they took it overseas. The layout was very well done cars from US and other country vehicles were represented as well. It was a great spot to stop for a few hours. Far from downtown but worth the stop.
Interesting,"I went to this museum with a group of friends. However, I think this attraction would suit all ages. It's educational and gives you another perspective on how Toyota has evolved over the years."
What better way to appreciate the history of a remarkable brand - Toyota!,"We absolutely loved this museum, and would have stayed much longer had not we reached closing time.The first major exhibit is about the history of Toyota, and it's humble beginnings in the loom business. For me the highlight was the car exhibit. It was like walking though a mini assembly plant with every possible Toyota car part being explained, along with the parts' history and evolution. The exhibit was interactive too, with buttons to press to witness how certain car parts function.Even if you are not a car enthusiast, this museum is just awesome, and a museum I would love to return to some time again in the future."
I thought I'd be bored.,"Well I wasn't bored.. The place itself is well keep and filled with lovely and entertaining staff, happy to show you all the interesting machines etc within the museum.Really is worth a visit ..nice little caf√© and gift shop too.."
Excellent education place for all ages,"It was a fun place to learn not only for kids but also for adults. The museum gave us new perspective of Toyota evolution from a textile manufacturer to huge car manufactory (They even demonstrate how to assembly cars with robots). The museum provides a lot of interesting (and expensive) tools for kids to understand physics, how car works, etc. With such cheap tickets fee, your kids will reap a lot!"
Eye Opening,"My friend made a reservation for English speaking tour in the morning. The tour guide brought us to Toyota assembly plant. The guide's English was only decent and I could understand selectively what was conveyed. Everything about the plant, from human to processes are organized and systematic. Everything spell efficient. As the tour goes, tourist are allowed selective controlled glimpses of the process though a guided walkway. No cameras, including all camera devices (yes, iPhone counts), which we have to either locked up at their given lockers or stowed behind a guarded room for larger bags."
A great way to spend a couple of hours,"If heading to Nagoya you have to go to this museum. There's a very interesting history to learn about - the history of Toyota is intriguing. Beautiful cars on display too. Not hugely into cars and found this very interesting. Nice and quiet, with friendly and helpful staff too! Would recommend."
Best technical museum I ever visited,"The museum is just awesome for anyone who is technical interested. The very nice and friendly staff explain every detail of the machines shown in perfect English. A lot of machines can be operated, so its easy to get a detailed insight of the operation principles. Price is very cheap for a lot of things to see."
True Car Collector Amazing,"Went with wife & 8 yr old son , I love cars & Toyota Meuseum was very impressive .What an amazing collection , very comfortable to walk through as well . Like others I didn't know what to expect but well worth seeing"
Knowledge increased,Did not know the famous car-maker started off on an industry so different.A very eye and mind opening experience.The museum staff were very helpful as well!
Above my expectation. And I'm not much into cars!,"My family enjoyed it... and we're not into cars! Planned only to stay a 1 1/2 hours, ended up staying until after lunch (3 hours+). They had two museum areas... one for textiles and the other for automotive. Both areas are huge and informative. There were guides that will demonstrate in different areas in Japanese or English.You can easily spend a half day here."
Interesting and good value.,"The museum is neat; well organized and of easy access. It allows an interesting view of Toyota and the tour can be as quick or long as you want; three hours will cover most of the facility and they have a few activities for small kids. The context can be a bit technical but they managed to offer exhibitions that are also fun to watch, with robots and parts of the production line that go in motion at the touch of a button. Easy to access; although subway stations aren't as close and a 15 min walk is necessary. The museum is open until later most days; and taxis are available. A small souvenir store offers toys; small models of the Toyota cars and some clothing; sizes are limited to small - medium. Perhaps not as exciting to small kids, but teenagers would find it interesting."
Informative and interesting,We began our excursion with a visit to the Toyota assembly line where we watched how it all works. Most of it is self explanatory but we also had a guide with good English to help us although it was hard to hear clearly. It was fascinating to see cars being assembled with a mixture of people and robots. In the museum we saw some of the latest models and future innovations as well as some parts of the company's past history. A very glossy high tech display that was well worth the visit.
Superb museum,Great displays about the history and the manufacturing process of Toyota...a little too much is dedicated to the looms but the automotive section would impress even those not interested in cars...good few hours spent here!
Great Experience,definitely worth an afternoon in Nagoya. A lot of Toyota history to view. From the early days to present
"NIcely spent few hours, but dedicated mostly to looms, not cars","NIcely spent few hours. But if you are a car enthusiast and expect tons and tons of Toyota cars, please be aware that cars and car industry is roughly just a one third of the whole museum. The rest is dedicated to circular looms and this kind of machines, which made Toyota successfull and recognised worldwide.Despite the ""Direction & Public Transportation"" information at the official pages, I do recommend you to go to ""Sako"" station instead. If you come from Nagoya station direction, the exit and museum direction will be towards your direction. Just go downstairs in the train station and walk towards east. Cross the street to your right side and continue walking east. You will arrive in 5-10 minutes, tops.In April, the entrance fee was 500JPY for an adult, students have 200/300JPY discount. You can also buy annual ticket and several others, but most of you will stick with the 500JPY basic. The tickets can be purchased at the vending machine, which is also in English (I remember seeing there also Korean language, one kind of Chinese and maybe also others, but do not catch me there). The ticket machine is really easy, nothing complicated like Japanese subway ticket machines.You get English leaflet and the staff also speaks somehow English, so they are able to explain basic stuff to you as well,The museum has also restaurant, few vending machines with soft drinks and several toilets. Cannot comment on the restaurant, as I have not used it's service.If you are looking for an easy spent 2-3 hours, this is the place to be."
The staff are the best,"The museum is good but the staff was the best.  Everyone would great us and try to speak english ( no matter their level they tried).  We felt so welcome.  The staff always warned us before they showed us loud machinery in case our baby would be scared.  This is perfect for car fans, engineering geeks, and we'll  everyone.  The first half is all about the cloth industry( Toyato started with making fabrics).  Then the second half is about cars.  On weekends and holidays there are special crafts for kids!"
Technical wonders,"I have wanted to visit this museum for the last 4 years I have been here and finally got to go. A fantastic museum, taking you from the early Toyota textiles to the modern Hydrogen cell cars design. With machines working from the textile periods and full demonstrations it is the most interesting museum I have ever been to. Well thought out and so much to hold your interest I'd like me you are a technical buff. The crime de resistance was pressing the button and watching the car being put together, all this for only JPYen500, ¬£3.50, you simply cannot go wrong. You will need 2-3hrs to fully appreciate the place. Also make sure you watch the robot play the violin üëç, this happens hourly at .40."
Impressive!,This is a big place so expect to spend at least 2 to 3 hours there. The admission charge is only Y500 for an adult and there's lots to learn. There's also a section for kids (I believe) but I did not go there as the museum closes at 5. The pavilions are very informative and there are free demonstrations. Definitely worth a visit!
Excellent museum,Very technical and very interesting.  Certainly a lot more than just a simple museum of Toyota automobiles.  This museum goes deep into the manufacturing processes and machinery used in both the textile and automotive industries.
Excellent- must visit,I was aware of Toyoda family's history of starting out with the textiles sector yet I expected the museum to be largely focused on automobiles. The other surprise was the location- it is in the heart of the city. It's a must visit place if you are in Nagoya
Interesting museum,"Very technical, but worth a visit! Makes you think about all the millions of processes that go into making cars and machinery. Not as engaging as the Nagoya Science Museum."
Great fun for kids and adults,A lot of exhibits to go through. Some fun activities for kids too. Note long walk from subway station. Should consider taking the 'yellow' tour bus.
Good to visit,"This is a historic museum of Mr.Toyoda's business.  I did not only see the evolution of the Toyota cars, but also learn about the textile manufacturing from cotton seed to fabric.  The entrance of the museum was a huge weaving machine, developed and engineered by the Mr.Toyoda's previous business, textile manufacturing.  The first section was dedicated to this.  As walking along the suggested route.  I saw many demonstrations from making cotton seeds into threads then to fabric.  This part was well organized and well explained by the staffs as well as the displays  The car manufacturing part was less impressive to me, perhaps due to my limited knowledge and interest in mechanics. Lastly, I saw the robot playing the violin, not as good as human, but amazing to see how it can do."
Drove my first Toyota for 28 years,"Very interesting history of the company. Both textile and vehicle sections were well thought out. A ""must see"" if you are in the area. Inexpensive and self paced. Take as long as you like, or zip on through."
It was okay,"If it is raining then go here, it is overall very good but it is probably a man thing. The museum shows you how they went from making looms to making cars. Interesting at some points."
toyota's history,"come here to learn about toyota's history, amazing stuff inside from automatic looms to how car assembly robots."
Hard to see it all at once,"I spent most of the morning and early afternoon at this museum, which was bigger and more interesting that expected.  It's not just cars here -- also see textiles, steel, architecture, robots, etc."
Well worth the entrance fee,"Great place to visit for anyone who enjoys automotive and industrial history. I am not a Toyota fan (I prefer VTEC and rotary), but had a good time nonetheless. The exhibits for the textile and automotive production are very detailed, the descriptions and models are great, and the museum is expansive enough (physically and information-wise) that you could spend an entire day if you wanted to. The only negative is the small collection of antique Toyotas. Only a couple are displayed, which doesn't do Toyota's history (e.g. Celica lineage, the FJs, Supras, MR2s, and unique one-offs such as the Toyota Classic)"
The revolution how textile machine become a vehicle.,"When I came here i thought Toyoda san starting Toyota by making a cars...it's totally wrong. He started with machinery for making fabrics. Nevertheless the industries will growing up based on the country need. The museum is in Aichi Perfecture. At Nagoya city but now all Toyota Industry located at the same place so we calling Toyota City. Like other Vehicles world museum, it's content the vehicle from the beginning to the present.The philosophy and concept is more attractive when You are visiting this museum."
Interesting history of Toyota!,The museum is quite big. Minimum of an hour to go around. You can explore it at your own leisure but you have to pay for the entrance fee. About 400 yen. discounted. There are a lot of staff inside who can answer your questions and even take your picture. The museum also has wheelchairs for the elderly or for the disabled. They offer it for free. There are also restrooms inside. It has a central courtyard.  Very interesting.
Really enjoyable museum to visit,"This museum looks deceptively small from the outside, but there is an amazing amount packed into this museum dedicated to the industrial and technological achievements of the Toyota name.It seems every effort has been made to make your visit to the museum a memorable one, and it is wonderful - English tours are available, staff stationed at special sections of the museum to demonstrate the workings of devices and buttons for you to press as you walk along and see the huge contributions the Toyota company, especially father and son, Sakichi Toyoda and Kiichiro Toyoda respectively has done not only for Japan but for the world. This museum was a truly wonderful and educational way to spend an afternoon in Nagoya- I found the staff to be very nice in the museum- they would try their best to explain demonstrations in English, or approach us and help demonstrate particularly inventions that require explanation to fully understand its concept and purpose. There is a cafe and a souvenir shop after the museum ends, but also a few of Toyota's robots on display, one of which will demonstrate its ability to play the violin every so often (performance times are listed) just outside the souvenir shop. For children (and big children like me), there is a centre called 'technoland' where intelligence games can be enjoyed."
So Much Fun!,"We grew up with Toyota and the visit to its museum is like visiting your grandparents' home.  I learned so much and appreciate more the determination of the wonderful pioneers and the spirit of the Japanese people.  Moreover, we got to see close-up parts of the previous assembly line in automation.  The kids would surely love the museum as much as we do!  If I live nearby, I'd definitely visit it more often."
Must see to know Japanese workman ship,It's amazing  to see the progress of manufacturing shown and explained in detail.I'm not sure if there is English explanations provided by the guides.Japanese industrial revolution with Toyota as main focus is displayed beautifully.The making of car with simple working prototypes are interesting to see.
A very enjoyable experience,"We really enjoyed our visit here, the interaction and live machinery was very well done, seeing the clutch and gears working through cutaways on gear boxes and getting samples from the looms where Toyota made their start made for a really great visit, all done in under three hours."
Must-see,"This is probably one of the best attraction in Nagoya, if not THE best.Toyota may be Japan's leading motor company, but it didn't start out as such, and the museum would tell you that it NEVER abandoned what made it take off the ground.Recommended to visit it in the morning, and go to Atsuta afterwards, as both sites are most conveniently connected by Meitetsu, instead of the Nagoya city subway."
Will you go travel to Nagoya? You'd better visit Toyota Commemorative Museum.,"I felt a certain fidelty in all kind of objects and displays, with staffs' explanations. All children and teenagers who like machine and mechnic will surely love all therein with good impact. Must visit spot..."
Lively museum ,"With most of the equipment/ exhibit items operational, this museum is full of energy ( lot of demo ) however it could be a noisy for traveler with young kids. If you like history and how things work, you will like here."
Great informative museum,"This museum is a great display of machinery, cars and engineering. If you like any of these things it is a must for you. Close to Nagoya Station and  easy to find (about 20min walk).Great layout that is always changing. Not just for Toyota fans. Live displays of aluminium casting, drop forging, machining, and various fabric automatic looms. Also has a kids discovery centre where they can also learn fun engineering stuff"
Amazing!,Interesting history of the first car manufacturer in Japan. Amazing evolution of the car industry. Powerful display of the equipment used to make cars.
Historical automobiles,You can see historical famous automobiles over world. Defineitely you'll enjoy your sentimetal journey with your car history.
Great Museum!,"This is a great place to learn about Toyota's history in a really cool and visual way! From a loom maker to one of the largest auto manufacturers in the world, this museum is packed full of cool things to do.I also rode the little cars around the track in the Children's Area and tried some of the special Toyota Curry and Soft Cream~ :) Overall it was a super fun way to spend a Friday in Nagoya!"
visited while I had to kill my time,Initially I wanted to go to Noritake no Mori but it was closed then I found this museum by chance. It was great to know how Toyota started and founded. I didn't know. Great place to spend half day
"Best textile manufacturing museum in the world, excellent automotive manufacturing museum","Toyota started as a textile weaving company, and they have preserved this heritage with the world's best collection of spinning and weaving machines, most in operating condition. No other weaving/textile museum is anywhere near as complete and interesting as this one. The automotive manufacturing section is also outstanding.The museum Guide Book is probably the best written, most informative museum guide book ever written -- 324 pages!My suggestion is to spend a few hours in the museum, buy the guide book, read it and then return a day or so later to further learn about what was most interesting.If you like industrial history, I suggest a solo visit -- because you are unlikely to be able to visit with someone who wants to spend time at the same exhibits you will enjoy."
Toyota factory visit ,It was much better then expected and made incredibly more interesting by the free guided tour.  Worth a trip and spare at least three hours to see it in moderate detail of you are interested in textiles and automotives. The textile area have Toyota the ability to make cats and is rather interesting even for people with minimal interest in textiles like myself.
Interactive ,"The Toyota Commemorative Museum has a wide exhibition of machines, notably cotton processing ones, from the origins of Toyoda corporation. Also the history of the shift to car manufacturing is well explained."
second highlight of the trip,The museum is partially interactive and most of the machines on display actually works. Very interesting.
Interesting History of the Toyota Corporation,"A group of US car buffs visited with the notion that this would be a museum of Toyota Motors. Instead, it turned out to be a museum of the Toyota business empire - how it began and grew into what it is today.  Nonetheless, we all enjoyed it and found it worth the time and money spent."
Informative,"Visited as it was a stop on the hop on/off bus, was pleasantly surprised by how enjoyable it was.Lots of information, interactive demonstrations, a robot performance and car models with a fun technoland for kids ( or adults ‚ò∫)"
A must see during your stay in Nagoya,As an engineer I thought it was awesome.  You can spend hours in the place and I think it's great if you have curious children.  I learned so much about Toyota that I didn't know about.  I think this was the best site I saw during my stay.
A FASCINATING Experience,"I went here based on a recommendation from one of the great folks at the lounge at the Marriott Associa Hotel.  It was certainly one of the most fascinating places I went to on my trip.  I had not known that Toyada-san, the inventor of the Toyota automobile, had started out in fabrics.  The museum showed you the whole process of making fabrics, from picking cotton to making the different kinds of cloth.  It was totally engrossing.  Then there was a HUGE room showing literally all the Toyota cars from the very beginning.  It was just wonderful.  I would recommend this to anyone visiting Nagoya!  I can't remember what the cost was, but whatever it was, it was worth every penny (or yen, if you prefer).  Definitely, GO!"
Must-visit museum in Nagoya,"Good exposition, highly educational. Basics of automobile functions clearly explained and demonstrated. Just a bus ride from Narita Station (the tourist route)."
Very informative museum,"Museum that provides a lot of information that I like. Arranged in accordance with the development flow of information. Adequate lighting, explanations can be obtained easily. interesting for all ages. Facilities required travelers are provided with well. The cost is quite affordable, convenient access to transportation using buses Me-guru."
Educational,Who would have known that Toyota has roots so far from what it is now ?One train station away from Nagoya Central Station leads to the factory site where Toyota began. Very clever interactive displays all around. Very good facilities for visitors of all ages.
Learning Opportunities for Children,I would recommend parents who want to teach children about determination and perseverance to visit this museum. I did not know that Toyota started off as a textile company and later dabbled into automotive industry on part time basis. Later it became global player because of shear determination from the founder and his team. There are exhibition of both industries. My boys enjoy making model car at car exhibition floor. The boys were happy to bring home self-made souvenirs. You can reach the museum by taking 10 minute ride by bus in front of Nagoya Station. Ask Info centre in Nagoya Station for more details.
A Very Informative Place To Visit,There are so many exhibits - would be good if you are a mechanical person and are interested in machines. It proves a very informative place to visit where I could learn about the history of Toyota. The layout of the museum was very systematic and it was a breeze to navigate. The Nagoya Meguru Bus stops right in front of the museum so it's very easy to access.
Amazing Toyota,"One of the best attraction in Nagoya. Don't miss it, Very interesting, The robots , Fantastic. Japanese technology the best in the world."
Day with worlds best technology partner,"This museum gives you the history of the toyota. From a spinning and weaving textile industry to worlds  best automobile industry.  Ticket is cheap 500 yen.Take train from nagoya station to sako station and 3 min walk.This museum gives you the brief information about the old textile machineries, and there r lot of live demonstrations about material forging, casting and making of engine parts. There is a automobile pavilion which gives you the latest technology of toyota cars and its manufacturing machineries used in the industry.Try to download the pamphlet from internet . It gives you brief idea of this tour.You have english tour guides at specific time intervals. You need a full day to make use of all the things in the museum."
Best museum in the world?,"I have never ever seen such an educative, amusing and interactive museum.If you have just one day to spend in Nagoya - forget about the castle, the port and everything else. Spend the whole day here!"
eyes opening museum,With working machines this museum provided interesting deep dive to Toyota's history and how it became such company what it is today.
History of Toyota,A very nice & tourist friendly museum. Great place to learn more about Toyota's history. Most folks are unaware what Toyota were manufacturing before being the top car producer in the world. Visit the museum to find out more.Was a bit disappointed with the Toyota gift shop for not selling specialty gifts geared towards Toyota/Lexus car fanatics.
Worth seeing,This place is huge.  It is very interesting and eye opening to see how car mechanisms work.  There is a section with looming and weaving displays (Toyota started as a weaving factory) and another on car mechanisms.  Fascinating place.  Some of people who man the displays speak English. It is well worth the price of admission
Fascinating history of Toyota Industries,"This museum was an educational and fascinating history of Toyota.  The founder actually started the business as a textile manufacturer; his son branched the business into making automobiles.  This museum is a must-see for car buffs, and those interested in business/commerce and history.  There is also an interactive area for young people; we ran out of time and didn't have a chance to visit it, but it looked fun from the outside!"
Great exhibitions!,"WOW! Who would know that Toyota started as a mills company? This place is huge and basically divided into 2 major exhibitions, the mills and autos. Both equally interesting and interactive and a few english speaking ""guides"" on the floor. My 5y old and hubby love this place so much!"
"Very interactive museum, operate a 600 ton press.","I'm very impressed by the level of interactivity of this museum. Highly worth it, Toyota doesn't hold back on the energy usage vs single serve impressive buttons. Be sure to ration your time, between the cloth section and the car section, might find yourself running out of time if you dally at part one for too long. Car section was far more impressive in my opinion."
History of Toyota,"This museum is located not in the center, but the way there isn't complicated. If you have some time to spend in Nagoya, I would recommend it for visit. The history of company is told and illustrated with different objects, mostly machinery. A lot is explained about processing."
Fantastic museum - presents another side to Japan,Have to admit that we are very interested in industrial history but even so this is a really great museum. We learnt a lot and had not appreciated how Toyota was originally a textile firm.Everything is available in English.Staff are really helpful.Its only 500 Yen.Several demonstrations of different machines - check out the timetable for these as you do not want to miss the circular loom and the robot playing the violin!Good value caf√© and nice gift shop.We were there about three hours but could have stayed longer - its huge.Access is also easy - its a ten minute train journey from Nagoya Central and then a five minute walk.When we were there - a weekday in late October - it was comparatively empty.
Great museum to spend a few hours.,"After a few weeks in Japan I had had enough of art/history/gardens so on reading the reviews on Trip Advisor I decided to get the subway to Sako station and go the Toyota museum. I spent 2 hours here but if you are into machines, mechanics, cars, manufacturing etc you could spend much longer.Plenty of demonstrations of the machines actually operating, staff to answer questions. There is a kids play/ experience area called Technoland which would be good for families.There is an audio guide available but I did not bother. They also have English speaking hours at specific times and you need to book as the afternoon one at 3.15pm was already booked out.Great building and a lot of attention has been paid to make this a very good museum and good advertising for Toyota as well.Recommended."
Authentic if you are into Museums!,"Went here on a Sunday afternoon and was very impressed with what was available to see.  I am by nature a museum geek and this one was high up on the list for most interesting.In short, the museum is broke up into 4 main parts:1) Loomworks2) Automotive3) Metal works4) Technology I spent a small time in loomworks and a majority in automotive (I work in automotive).  In both portions of museum, what amazed me most was the amount of hands on, active exhibitions they had.  For the loomworks, there must have been 50 or more loom machines that various workers were operating when people came up.  For the automotive, they had the same type of on hands exhibitions.  Specifically, they took you through the different mfg processes of building a car.  Forging, Casting, Machining, Pressing, Welding, Painting, Assembly.  All of it was super hands on and authentic to real processes.Cost was so cheap (500 yen + 200 yen optional rental for audio set).  The Toyota companies sponsor the museum which makes it so cheap the public.Please take time to go here as it was great.Onegai shimasu!"
Impressive!,Thought we'd spend a couple of hours here but ended up with nearly a 4 hour stay.  It's a very well organised museum which tells the history of Toyota from textiles to cars and beyond.  What I found fascinating was the early history of the cotton and wool industry in the UK and reconstructed early machines such as the flying shuttle and water frame.  It was all very well done and cheap to get in too!
Excellent place to go ,This museum is awesome in several ways:1. The content is all about how TMC and TICO started from the Toyoda family2. Almost all exhibits are interactive not static3. The museum personnel are friendly and helpful I hope I can come here again!
A blend of history and modern technology,"Whilst I am not a car fanatic, I enjoyed the visit to this museum, especially being able to see examples of how the vehicles are put together by robots. The history of Toyota is also interesting. There are lots of displays, information boards in English and Japanese, and it is all very bright, light and clean. The violin-playing robot is worth seeing, and there is a good gift shop as well as a cafe."
You can see the history and  technology of the textile and the car.,"If you want to see the history and technology of the textile and the car,you should go to this museum at Nagoya and you can find the style of Japanese manufacturing."
Informative visit,"I'm a Toyota fan, my car is a corolla altis. We went to the museum via the Meguru bus which you can catch just outside the Nagoya station. I was awed by the vision of the company founder and his son. The journey from textiles to cars was well demonstrated by the exhibits. Some of the tour guides really try their best to show the exhibits and read aloud the English prompt cards despite their lack of fluency. Capping off the tour were the model cars on the ground floor. Wish I could just drive off in the luxurious Toyopet! But the futuristic Mirai model may well be my next car.Really enjoyed the tour. Even if you're not a car fanatic you may wish to come here if you're over dosed on shrines & castles."
Experience kaizen at the Toyota Commemorative Museum,"It's heartening to see how all great things start small but grow through vision, patience and hard work. That is the story one sees in the Toyota Commemorative Museum, which is an interesting and educational homage to the Toyota brand, with entertaining interactive exhibits and step by step displays on the development of Toyota, very much in line with the spirit of continuous improvement and attention to detail Toyota, and the Japanese in general, are known for. We took the Nagoya Sightseeing Route Bus Me~guru, which has a stop directly in front of the Museum, and spent perhaps an hour and a half viewing the exhibits and watching the video presentations along the way.   This tour is good for young and old, but especially those with an interest in engineering, as the development of Toyota's technology would probably make a greater impact on people who like to take things apart and find out how stuff works."
Wow,"Amazing museum,a must for any car enthusiast. be prepared to spend a couple of hours here. the cars are beautifully displayed. Well worth the visit"
Toyota: Textiles to Automobiles,"We really had an amazing experience here. Even without English speaking guides, there is enough content to keep you learning, enjoying and wondering on Toyota's milestones from textiles to cars. Overall, a truly impressive showcase for the family!"
You must see,"Wow. If you like technology, cars, industry etc. you must see this museum.First you will be suprised, because most of people dont know about toyota history. You will see textile background of company.then you will be able to see all the steps of automotive industry. giant hydrolic presses, metal casting, machining, painting and assambly. You can see all the mechanism of engine, transmision, brake systems etc.Also you will have chance to see very first cars of company"
WOW!,"This museum is amazing!!!!!! We spent just on 4 hours here and still didn't get to see everything.The first part of the museum has really interesting displays of fabric weaving and the technology involved - this took nearly 2 hours just by itself. Full English signage which helped too. There were a number of live demonstrations that run throughout the day, with the demonstrators explaining how the looms work, both old and new. There is also a little metal working area with live demonstrations too just before you enter the next exhibition.From here you enter the more modern world of Toyota, namely cars. I was really pleased to see my first car here - a little 1969 Corolla :). This huge showroom has a number of cars and a press from the original factory. It has areas that display development and production technology over the years. this took us nearly 2 hours also. It is such an interesting museum."
Book in for the factory plant tour ,"We booked this free, 2 hour tour prior to leaving home. I'm not a car buff, but it was very interesting. You can wander around the museum, then you hop on a tour bus where the guide gives you a lot of history in perfect English. You actually walk through the assembly plant, walking mainly on overhead viewing platforms. The cleanliness, technical skill and precise organisation are readily apparent. Well worth the visit."
Great place for children,A great place to take young children. It has an awesome play area including a ball pit. There are also plenty of ramps and elevators.
A recommended visit,Our family visited here in August. There are many locals (families and school) visited this museum.  But we do not find it crowded at all.  It is very neat.  Recommend to go.
Very interesting to learn about the story behind Toyota!,"One learns so much in this museum both about the story behind the Toyota factory, but also about the Cotton and textiles industry and then to the car industry, and we were also Lucky to be there when a robot was playing the violin for about 5 minutes."
Disneyland for engineers,"I am an engineer and have probably never seen a better museum. It's a combination of that TV show ""how things work"" and an automotive fantasy camp.  Sure you get high quality videos of the whole line in many different languages. But only here do you get to see the entire production of cars from raw steel to die casting engine blocks, forging and stamping steel, panel assembly, painting, and final assembly -in person. Even better, you get to run the actual equipment from the 80s (push the button and 30' tall gigantic machinery runs). To top off the experience they have a metal working demonstration where they actually perform the forging etc in small scale and kids can take home a sample.  There's ask a kids techno zone where they can drive a car, experience a wind tunnel, and more. Almost everything is in English.  For the serious engineer who loves the Smithsonian museums I'd recommend this as a day trip from Tokyo. There's also a hands in area I wish I could have seen - they have sample engines and impact wrenches!"
"As a mechanical engineering student, this was heaven.","I had an amazing 4 hours going through this museum. 4 hours wasn't even enough to take a look at everything individually. I wish I had a bit more time to go through everything. The explanations are written well in both Japanese and English. But most of the demonstrations are done in Japanese unless you take the English tour in the afternoon. Nonetheless, I love this place and I would love to go again."
An Underestimated Visit,"Actually, we'd never stopped by in Nagoya if one of my friends didn't stay there. We were on our way back to Tokyo so there we were, in Nagoya.My friend didn't even know that this museum is existed, so that was the first time for him as well after been staying in Japan for 6 months.It was only one station away from Nagoya station, and we didn't have to walk far to reach it.When we entered, we were exposed to textile museum, different type of cotton, the different of cotton vs others, etc. Frankly speaking, I was not excited to see it. But hey, we're far away from home and put an effort to stop in Nagoya, a-not-so-popular city for Indonesians.But then it started to change when we were about to reach the next exhibition, then.. We can see the integrated showcases, different type of machines, how the showcase technically explaining the mechanism of a car, and not to mention.. The showcase of retro cars, first generation of the brand lines i.e. 1970 Celica GT, first generation of Camry.. Wow!!On the background, we could see the showcase on how a car was produced. Our daughter was pretty much excited as well for the kids activities, she can build a toy car from a scratch and got a helpful hand from a granpa (haha) for construct that toy car. At the end, she can bring that toy car for her. She was also allowed to make a keycahin and choose the color. Very interactive. My husband, spent the most of his time looking at the machines one by one üòÑüòÑ we delayed our departure to Tokyo almost for 4hrs.By the end of the tour, you can listened to Toyota robot playing a biola by itself. Incredible. You will not regret to visit this museum."
The best car museum ,This museum is a very well demonstrated car museum. I would say the best among many famous ones! You can see all the developments Toyota has bern through from the beginning. I highly recommend it. Even for kids we saw a lot of entertainment places around the exhibition.
Kinda cool,"Big time on the textile part not as many cars as I would have hoped for, but I work in the automotive industry so maybe would impress people more if it wasnt something I did everyday"
Spectacular history lesson of Toyota Group,"It was nothing short of my expectations (after reading tens of reviews here), and it was totally worth the 2+ hours spent here.The history of this group is quite rich, albeit shorter than other holdings, so there are plenty of facts to show off. It depicts so vividly the business principles of the group, its resilience during hard times and its inner force to move on. Not only the automotive section was impressive (btw, there is a free English tour in the afternoon, I think starting at 15:15, for 45 min), but also the textile section (the oldest one actually).It's very cool also for kids, with several interactive places for them, including the live shows of a robot playing a violin.Nice shop for souvenirs (I couldn't believe what was their top selling souvenir, a small spoon with a mechanical key at the other end)."
Very informative,"I have traveled to this Centre on a few occasions and I still find it very appealing and interesting. This is a great place for any person interested in cars and how cars are made.  The have interactive equipment such as presses, spray booths and other large pieces of equipment.  They also have an area for children to do some craft type activities which they can take home with  them. Great place to spend a few hours"
Textiles and Cars,The textile section is incredible.  It shows the progression from textiles to mass producing looms to mass producing automobiles.  It is located just one subway stop from the Nagoya train station.  The automobile section is brilliant and worth the trip.  There are aluminum casting and  forging and cutting demonstrations that are fun to watch.  There are cut away engines and transmissions and suspension systems that really explain the mechanical aspects of automobiles.  There are hands on activities for children in elementary and middle school.  They looked like so much fun that my wife wanted to participate but she was not allowed.There is a functional restaurant that serves curries including a vegetarian curry.
Good for people who loves cars,I went there with my friend very good place to see cars and history of cars not only that they also have newest car models.
Very good,"Really interesting visit , got guided tours around both, definitely worthwhile. Very interesting to learn the history of Toyota and see its original loom making beginnings, and all the tech used for the auto part."
Fantastic museum for all ages,"This is one of the best museums I have ever been to. It's split up into two main parts, the first about the advances Sakichi Toyoda first made on weaving looms. Before going to this museum, I knew nothing about how cloth was weaved, not did I really care. But they do a fantastic job going through the history looms, and the numerous advances that Toyoda made as well. By the time I left, I felt like I understood the process of weaving, as well as the machines we use to weave, fairly well. The second part is what I went there for: the automotive museum. They again do a fantastic job of walking through Toyota's history, including motivation, the earliest automobiles and engines, and they even have demonstrations for manufacturing techniques. They also have exhibits showing many individual subsystems of an automobile, including the engine, transmission gear box, steering, suspension, crash test safety, and the panel. And for most of those, they show them through Toyota's history. I'm an engineer and walked in knowing a lot of this stuff, but I was still able to learn a lot more from all the exhibits. Similarly, a lot of the information is simple enough that even young kids can learn. This is an excellently presented museum for everyone."
Not just cars...,"Those museum details not just the Toyota car company but what they were before. At least half the museum is full of textile machines and goes thru the process of turning cotton into fabric. Honestly it's far cooler than it sounds. The other half is what you'd expect, a really cool car museum. Not only is it a car showroom but also a detailed setup showing how each and every car is made and the progression over the years. It's definitely earned it's #1 TA rating."
A paradise for the engineers,"A must-see in Nagoya, clear English descriptions on the exhibits so language is not a problem. We went there on a Monday (regular closing date) but as Monday is a holiday, the museum remained open, make sure to check the schedule on their official website. The textile section with all sorts of spinning and weaving machines is amazing so is the automobile pavilion, where one can see the mock-up production line. The all you need-to-know about textile and automobile under one roof."
Very interesting history of Toyota,We did this on the hop on off bus tour and spent a few hours there. Lots of displays and information to take in. My husband really enjoyed this stop.
Must to visit in Nagoya,Here you can sea the birth and growth of Toyoda converting to Toyota. Very amazing and valuable manufacturing history is waiting for you.
Interesting museum for all ages,"I went to this museum with my 10-year-old son. We both enjoyed it. I'd say it's great for people who are interested in history and/or technology. It's a great place to go on rainy days. There are two separate museum sections, the car side and the loom side. Both have the complete history of the Toyota company's involvement in the two industries, as well as demonstrations of how the different machines work. There are craft activities for kids on the car side, as well as an interactive play area. You will need tickets for the play area, on a first come, first served basis. I recommend picking those up as you enter the museum so you get the time slot you want. Lots of English signage."
