Kissing the water,"When you travelled to a place you much chose many things to explore over there. In my case when I planned to travel to the place my main motive was juts to do rafting by trying every possible water experience I can get. So, the process as followed first you need to get near ram jhulla or laxman jhulla for the ticket( approx 600 per person) than they will take you to the starting point by keeping all the no water proof things with them and also with any carry baggage. when you start with the trio they will give you all the proper gears and also checked them by own so no need to worry. Then when to sit in the boat it will gve you the basic training of raffting listen properly it is helfull and important foe safety. So, after traveling haf way you will reach a cliff jumping point which is really worth it you can do it once( but I did three time different spots) as many are just wasting at the edge just measuring the height by their eye vision. At last you will reach the under the ram jhulla where you can sun bath with chilled water if you are capable of.‚Ä¶"

A Fun Filled Adventure Sport,River rafting is one of the best thing to do in Rishikesh. Rishikesh is a place full of multiple activities for everyone. It was one fine weekend in the office and we decided to go for river rafting in Rishikesh. Shivpuri was the start point of our 16 kms river rafting. We wore the gears and the instructor shared the instructions with us. The day was sunny and the water was blue in the Ganga River. There are about 6 rapids in 16 kms river rafting. It was an amazing experience of life time and would love to perform that again and again.
One of the best Rafting in India,Rishikesh is well known for white water rafting. And yes it was just superb. Totally safe and the guide with us was very nice explained each and everything upto mark and made our rafting more interesting. One should not miss rafting here and please go for 16 kms rather than 10 kms one will enjoy a lot. And yes ganga water is absolutely super clean over here.
Awesome experience,"It was an awesome experience. Clean, clear and cold Ganga water to dive in.. there are 3 options available, I opted for 9KM rafting and ready to go for 25KM as well. Definitely recommended!!üëç"
Truly Incredible,"One hell of an experience doing the 17 km rafting on the holy Ganges, which is the clearest I've seen at Rishikesh. The instructor was great and took us thru many rapids which we negotiated delightfully without toppling. The instructor also took us thru long tracks letting us in the water, which was cold yet good.Recommend to try this early in the morning"
Fun everytime! ,"I try to visit Rishikesh almost every year and one of the reasons is the rafting rapids, especially after the monsoons.My experience this time was the best of all, the rapids were in full glory and made the body surfing an awesome experience. There are multiple operators in Rishikesh, choose anyone of them. I tried out the Marine Drive stretch this time, took about 2 hours and lots of smaller & bigger rapids. My favourites were 3 blind mice & roller-coaster."
The adventure  trip ,"To¬†enjoy trill and adventure especially  with friends, Travel to the adventure capital of India, Rishikesh and ride on the mystical but fierce fast flowing waters of Ganges. Rishikesh is a must visit place in India if you haven‚Äôt yet crossed the age bar.its an amazingly  trip.Best time to visit:¬†September to November and February to June"
must do,rafting is a must to do activity when you come to rishikesh. infact rafting is the most popular in rishikesh after offcourse yoga. it challenges you at one time and other time provides a enjoyble experience.
It's must have adventure experience in Ganaga River ,I perosnally didn't have the experience of river rafting. And it is also very experience. But I had an opportunity to see the river rafting from  very close distance while we we were going to a Shiva temple on a scooter. It was amazing. You will be given life jackets and trainers help in the river rafting. Since we had a small kid we couldn't take the experience otherwise we would have gone. It felt amazing just see how the river rafting happens in the holi Ganga river.
Must do ,Rafting in the Ganga through rapids and floating in the cold water surrounded by mountains is a surreal experience.
Rafting ,Great river to raft. Great guides.  Couple of 4s. Lots of fun cooling  off  in the Ganges river.  Then jumping off a cliff approx 10 meters.
Existing ,This was my 2nd experience for river rafting after Manali.It was a great experience. My sons were also with me.Thank to Mr Surendra who was our guide.
Adrenaline rush ,A visit to Rishikesh is so incomplete without river rafting . It‚Äôs a must do activity when in Rishikesh. Highly recommended for all
Visit to Rishikesh India,"Rishikesh on the banks of Ganges is a beautiful town. Rishikesh is a gateway to Char Dham - Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Jamanotri. The sight of Ganges flowing through the mountains on either side and two suspension bridges- Ram Jhoola and Laxman Jhoola is mesmerising.The whitewater rafting is Ganges is an adventure not to be missed. Ganga Arti is once again an experience not to be missed. Rishikesh was made famous among international travellers by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. We had lunch at the iconic Chotiwala restaurant.."
Fun,It was my first time river rafting and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The guides were very helpful and polite. The Rapids was not too scary but the view was awesome and so peaceful in the middle of the ice cold Ganga river. I would recommend trying it out.
Nice rafting across moderate rapids and a horizontal stretch.,This River Rafting is only for groups of young to middle-aged people and is pretty safe because it takes you along a horizontal stretch of moderate rapids. Small families or individuals cannot have the ride because a full raft needs to be booked from local unorganised agents. The Government or the Department of Tourism has little control over these agents.
A must do in Rishikesh,I went there with my friends during off season and we got our tickets only for 275rs for the raftingIt was a thrilling experience of life
Rishikesh Trip,"Rishikesh is always a great experience whenever I go there. Visiting Rishikesh in the month of April and May promises you a terrific rafting experience however, the weather will be a bit hot than usual. If you want to experience a pleasant weather plus a great rafting experience, I'll suggest you go in the month of oct."
Best experience ever,"Rishikesh is the place for River Rafting, Camping and other adventure activities in Uttarakhand. Though it was raining when we went there and we were disappointed that we won‚Äôt be able to do rafting. But our guide was chill out and he said, ‚Äò Aree madam tension nahi leni, bilkul krvayenge rafting‚Äô. lol.No need to sorry also because there are are many camps are located in the bank of river Ganga and yes the pics I am attaching below has default date and timings."
Must be done,Recommend this activity for adventure seekers. Due to strict Govt regulations safety is given due importance. Depending on rush and road traffic may take 3-6 hrs from start to finish so plan accordingly.
Awesome,"Damn cool, won't forget this lovely experience. I went with friends yesterday and totally had a great time"

must do,river rafting is a must do activity if you are in rishikesh. i choose the easiest option of 9 km rafting but had the most amazing time. also not to miss is the small cliff jumping that i did 3 times and was amazing
Great Time in Rishikesh ,It was a great day spend with friend in the wild Ganga. We had a great time with friends and the guide were very helpful.
Jumping into freezing waters of Ganga,"River Rafting in Ganga is the mandatory thing to do if ever been to Rishikesh. The place got to offer you the best of adrenaline rushes that you cant get over anytime soon. The best part of our rafting was when the guide asked us whether we want to take a bath in Ganga when we reached a calm part of the river. Me and my boyfriend jumped without a second thought that too in chilling December. Trust me ice feels better than Ganga water.  Getting back to our raft, the guide took us to a nearby spring that joins Ganga where two vendors selling tea and Maggi gives you the best of feels after a freezing bath in Ganga."
"Adrenalin Rush, Thrill, Adventurous","River Rafting on 6th April 2019Rishikesh in a Day : Jai Mata Di : River Rafting with DU students : Ganga Aarti9.35am : Time to go to rafting office at Ram Jhula and chose 'Himalayan Expedition' which is just facing the car parking at Ram Jhula. 1 raft = 8 person = INR 800/- per Person + INR 20 Environment Tax. Bag deposited in the office after change of clothes and now ready for the Rafting action. While I was alone I was happy to be combined with a group of Delhi University students from Final semester BSc(Electronics) department who were 15 of them. Drive till Shivpuri took about 30 min. 15 min. to fit the life-jackets/helmet and safety instructions. Mobiles and purse in the special waterproof bag carried by the Raft Guide... 'Jai Maa Gange' chorus and off we start. The next 2 hours was sure thrill, jumping in water, forward, backward, drift, balance, tea break, cliff diving till we reached Ram Jhula again through the mighty river Ganges.1.45pm : At Ram Jhula bod farewell to DU students and the Guide and took share auto to Bus-stand for lunch and booking ticket back to Delhi.Rafting is available till 20/June every year when it closed for rainy season."
Worth a lifetime experience,This experience can't be described in words. Though all in our team of 18 people were bit scared when our guide instructed the safety rules. But once we cleared the first rapid  the fear was bit less. Then we went with the flow and followed our guide instructions prominently. When they asked all of us to get down the raft in the water it was an amazing experience. We cleared all 9 rapids successfully. It was full of fun.
A unplanned trip to Haridwar and Rishikesh,Have been there for several times and still would like to go there. Had an amazing experience. Rishikesh is the place where enjoyment begins with full of energy. Loved the place Rafting was superb and the most likeable thing is environment. Superb weather wonderful atmosphere.
Indias Best Riverraftin,We travelled to Rishikesh as offsite form the company and the main attraction was River Rafting. You will encounter around 10 to 12 rapid and it is real adventure and fun. We had people falling in the river in the rapid but all were wearing life jackets and so no need to worry.
Amazing day,"Rishikesh is a great and really cool place with lots of fun activities. You'll feel comfortable as a foreigner because you'll see other foreigners from different countries. It's also a good location for rafting ; which was the best experience for me in Rishikesh. India is a beautiful country with great tourist destinations.A must experience adventure.You can't afford missing this adventure whenever you visit Rishikesh.We did it twice. Although it's risky but this adventure gives you a lifetime story to share with your family and friends.Asthma all breathing patients are not advised to go here.In the way you will find four different rapids.Each of them gives you a different experience.Awesome experience. Our guide was good, as he explained all the instructions well, and explained the spots that we saw along the stretch."
River Rafting In Rishƒ´kesh with Trip India Holidays ,"I had an amazing river rafting trip on the Ganga organized by trip India holidays, who are the best, most experienced and safety conscious tour guides operating out of Rishikeshüëçüëç If you‚Äôre brave take the 26km white water class 3+ option which had many thrilling rapidsüôÄTour guides Dev Chauhan and Manish are really great and took me to a very special Babaji sacred cave for meditation prior to our rafting adventure. You must book 24 hours in advance to raft on the Ganga. Make sure to use Trip India Holidays when booking through your Hotel in Rishikesh üòäüëçüôè"
Adrenaline rush..,One of the best river rafting experiences in india to try. Trainers are very supportive if you are first timer than also its very safe and thrilling at the same time. Bit costly but totally worth it.
One of the best experience,Those who like adventure should do this activity at least once in a lifetime. Rafting in Ganga river is an awesome activity due to the speed of the Ganga river. Ice cold water during winters. The preferable time during summer. Book rafting with Adventure Nation.
Brahmapuri rafting,"Myself and my 10yrs old son did rafting from brahmapuri.Its a pretty easy one with less rapids and very much suitable for families.Water is pretty chilled,if anyone is interested in serious rafting..better do from shivpuri."
River rafting,"Oh god, the adrenaline rush that you get when you do river rafting in rishikesh. It is simply out of the world. Fab."
A must!,"Looking for as many activities as we could near the holy Ganga, we chose river rafting. It was surprisingly well-organized (if you‚Äôve travelled around India this makes sense). It is not as adventurous as rafting in other rivers, but what more could you ask for than rafting along the beautiful (still relatively clean) Ganga! A must!!"
The best activity in rishikesh,"River rafting what an experience it is. Rishikesh means temples , laxman jhula and offcourse River Rafting. The rates were quite economical for a single person it was 400 for 16kms. The boat has 8 people and we were just 4 so had to put energy of 8 people. It was damn fun activity to do . The excitement was at its peak once i started it and when the rapids come it is more than fun. The instructions are to be heard properly so it can be done carefully with no harm and injuries.. Overall This is must for everyone who knows swimming or not this has to be done in rishikesh..."
Adrenalin Rush... Thrilling Experience,"If u r the one going to Rishikesh for adventure (other than Pilgrimage), then please do not miss the river rafting across the clean, cool, gushing & beautiful Ganga... lots of shops are there which hire rafts..."
Must do when in Rishikesh,"Just do not miss this adventure. Its fun, its thrilling and its not scary. Don't worry, just go with the flow. A 16-18 KM ride is advisable since it will give you the real feel of the Ganga and the ride. Starts from Shivpuri and ends at Khara Srot near Ram Zula. You can book a ride at offices at Khara Srot. Price would be 400-500 Rs, based on how you bargain. I advise not to pre-book. You will get a good price at the location itself.They will take you in a Bolero type vehicle till Shivpuri with boat tied on top of the vehicle. A short information on how to row will be given. One boat will have 8 persons + guide.A short stopover for tea during the ride is refreshing. Also for cliff jump at tea break, if you like. At 2 or 3 places, you can jump right into the cold river waters, which is absolutely fantastic. Your life jacket will save you of you can't swim. And you get a holy dip in Ganga :) The ride duration will be around 3 hours. Plus conveyance to the place. Go for afternoon ride to avoid chilled water. But I think last ride starts at 3.00pm. Wear clothes which can dry soon. You will get totally wet. And they have waterproof bags to keep you purse & mobile etc.You will spend the best time of your life, that's sure."
Rafting ,Awesome experience in Rishikesh..We do rafting first time in Rishikesh and it will be memorable for us ..of water Of Ganga river is very cool ..and clean all over good experience.
"It was daring , It was Safe","Arrangement were done by Atali Resort. They had taken adequate safety measures like two Kayaks were safeguarding us in case some mishap happens. It was 24 kms run, with 10-to 12 rapids, of which 2/3 were caategory 3."
It was amazing and unforgettable moments,River rafting was planned all of a sudden and we had mix feeling.. We scared and well excited.. However our guide made it memorable with his expertise and encouragement to us. We crossed all hurdles without any slippage or mishappening.. We also take dive in deep water from 24 ft or so.. It was worth
"""Thrilling and adventurous","Rishikesh has so much to offer other than yoga and spiritual peace,one of the major attraction here is river rafting and camping,rafting in cool blue river helps in refreshing your body & soul, don't forget to get a fantastic view while u raft and for sure jump in the river and go with the flow (with all safety measure) its so much fun.."
Best experience so far,We went to Rishikesh and were staying at Aloha on the Ganges and there we went for river rafting with the Paddy adventures group . We loved the experience with lifetime memories. Would recommend it to everyone who goes to Rishikesh. Their staff particularly Vicky was very helpful and friendly. üëçüëçüëç
Rishikesh camping + rafting trip,"We visited rishikesh in October end this year. We had took a package of camping and rafting. We stayed in Riverside camps in a very beautiful location. Living in camps, surrounded by mountains was mesmerizing. We also went trekking to Garudchatti waterfalls. It was a very small trek 1km to the top and was very rewarding. The waterfall at the top was one of the best things of the trip, with water droplets in the air and fast cold winds blowing and a small pool of ice cold water. We went rafting on the next day. This time we opted for 11 km rafting which was nice but not enough. We should have opted for a longer rafting, like last year we opted for 32km rafting which was simply the best thing I have ever done in my life. However while rafting, the experience was otherworldly and blissful. This was my second time to rishikesh, and I can't get enough of this place and wish to go there again!"
Rafting,It's actually a must do for all ages . Very well organised the safety measures are in place.Our guide Ashotosh was wonderful and made the experience more enjoyable.
Rafting and Rishikesh are synonymous to me,Rafting is a must do In Rishikesh. It‚Äôs a city where all age groups can have fun in their own ways. From temples to Yoga and Rafting to Bungee jumping. Such a variety of activities is difficult to find in one place. We talk of a complete person and here I see a complete city.
It was fun & adventureous!‚ù§Ô∏è,"It's an amazing experience...River Rafting in rishikesh was in my bucket list..And I am glad that I get chance to come here...I enjoyed it the fullest.. it's an amazing experience (I did it twice). From rafting to getting hit by water and by getting thrown in the chill water. It's a perfect thing one can wish!There are so many shops that offer rafting.. do some bargaining they will give you discount. Also, go for 26km long ride. They will try to negotiate on that but the longer the rafting the more you enjoy.Also, you will get chance for cliff jumping... And that's also an amazing and unexpected experience. I love every single thing there. It's an amazing place to visit and to do some adventure."
River ganges rafting,"Had a 16km rafting from Brahmapuri to Lakshman jhulla covering 5rapids,body surfing,cliff jumpingWell set instructor & safety life jackets plus harnessThe end point is maggie point where tea & maggie will be served"
It was such a disappointment doing 9km river rafting during mid Oct 2018,"We were more enthusiastic about taking the white water rafting specifically in Rishikesh. We inquired with one of the river rafting company and they suggested to take 9km, but it was so disappointing as there were only 2 rapids in 9km rafting which never felt like a rapid but a mere jerk :( and ended with in 30 mins, if you are more enthusiastic and adventurous, you should never go for 9km stretch, Please go for 26km streach with more than 5-6 rapids to really enjoy, however we got a chance to jump inside the river ganga for 10-mins which was cool. Temperature was quite good around 25 degree and water was also not very cold when we took a plunge inside."
Camping in Rishikesh-Book Hotels & Resorts in Rishikesh with Rafting,"Had Good Experience. Resorts in Rishikesh.All Package rates are affordableHi,Thanks, happy to know that you have enjoyed our assistance...  Best Regards"
Thrilling experience,"We have done river rafting from shivpuri to Nim beach. The total journey was one in a lifetime journey. It was thrilling as well as breath taking. All the ups and downs of the boat,the jumping and swimming in the river ,the move and stop command of the instructor made the journey an unforgettable one."
Value for Money Experience,"We are group of 4 friends started rafting from Marina Beach to Shivpuri beach, This is a very thrilling adventure, when rapid came  it was very thrilling and challenging, not suggested for heart patient."
Glide across the Ganges,"Being a fan of casual white water rafting, I had heard that Rishikesh was the best place to do it. And it didnt disappoint!!Gliding on the icy cold Ganga river, in midst of towering mountains is a sight to behold. The rapids are challenging themselves giving a thrilling ride from start to finish. I tried the 26km one which despite the time of over 2 hours, still felt short!!One thing to keep in mind though: Always do the rafting using a reputed company with years of experience. Things can get out of control very easily on the river."
Thirilling white water rafting,"We were group of 6 freinds started rafting from J2 point few kilometers ahead of marine drive point. If you are group of must go for whole 26 km rafting (marine drive to lakshman zula ) . You will get to enjoy Three major rapids . Take around 3 hrs . On the road you can have a chance to jump from a cliff at 15 ft. You will get no of chances to swim in the river ganga. You will starve like hell after completing, but you feel accomplishment of great task. For safety we were provided with two guides on raft  and one guide with kayak in case of rescue is needed when raft toppeled."
YOU MUST DO IT!,"people usually afraid of doing river rafting, but you must do it without giving it second thought. it is done under proper guidance. Its total fun, u cannot miss it if you are in rishikesh."
Must Do,"If ur Rishikesh, u can't leave Rishikesh without trying out the River Rafting Adventure. We were too scared to try it out first but thank God we didn't skip it. We had d most memorable experience of our lives. It was so exciting. The waves, the rapids, the pure Ganga water. Everything was such so amazing. Can enjoy the beautiful views too. They do a quick stop in between for tea/coffee, snacks."
Rafting,it was an amazing experience fighting with tides and protected by the most professional team of Atali.
Disappointed.,It's very  sad to  hear they ban river rafting from gangs. I came here for  racing and have to go üîô with lot of disappointment.
Must do in Rishesh,This is a must do activity when in Rishikesh. Initially we were little scared but once you are into it - it‚Äôs a lot of fun and a lifetime experience. Do not miss this.
Best thing to do in rishikesh.,Loved the river rafting. Take 26 km route to enjoy more. Price is very reasonable. Don't miss the Clift jump in the route. You will have a lifetime experience.
Awesome experience,Important that you do with someone who has reputation of handling the safety issues. Do not just take the service of a random service provider
Rafting,"Rishikesh is all about adventure....  River rafting, bungee jumping, camping, Bon fire,  and sports activities in Camp areas. Rishikesh is for short vacation like 2 days...  The nature and the atmosphere is really beautiful. Must visit place at least for once....  üëå"
FUn Experience,"It was my first time and was pretty excited and after seeing lots of people doing it, I was very eager. The rafting is of 16km and 32 km. We opted for 16km one. Rate varies according to the tour camp or hotel. Offseason it can go as low as 250rs per person.It has around 7-8 rapids with different names and the experience is beyond word. Jumping from the cliff, Taking dips in the clean water, the thrust of coming waves and the flow of Ganga hitting your boat. Such an exciting experience. One must visit and do some adventure sports like this. If you are staying in a Camp will take you around 3-4 hrs easily to from getting up and down and the time spent in the rafting.They have a waterproof bag to carry your essential belongings like phone, camera and money. What to wear?  Have shorts and sandals or shoes (kapde wale)."
Conquering the waves!,"It was an exciting and thrilling experience. We went there in the afternoon and the water was still so cold. Just get on the boat and drive your excitement. Don't forget to jump in the water and feel the chilling experience! Jumping off from the cliff was also a good experience. Make sure that you are wearing your life jacket while doing so. Overall, it was a great experience and it is a must do thing if you are at Rishikesh."
Har Har Gange,"Wow !!!We were a grp of 6 people and got a raft for us...Holy river Ganga gives great rafting experienceWent for 9Kms ride (not the longest) and luckily climate improved (wasn't hot)Our family members who had water phobia, also gathered courage and enjoyed the rideWorth an attempt for everyone...stands to the hype around it...!!!!"
Atali Ganga offers the best rafting ,We went on a official offsite to Stall Ganga and they had Rafting as a part of the package.Atali was again outstanding in this activity and still offers by far the best rafting experience which is most professional and extremely safe.Highly recommended
Enjoyed ,We was group of 7 for rafting arrangeged by hotel holiday hill perfectly. Enjoyed the rafting. Over mas gang a
Awesome Experience,"Mostly might get Banned as that was the news cause of some Deaths due to Negligence and some illegal operators etc , however we chose a good and experienced operator , 2 different options a short distance and long distance , from the tour operator place we were taken in a SUV and we carried the raft from the SUV to the river , depending on the season the Rapids increase and decrease , water was cold and they allow you to Jump into the river if you dare an also from a small rock about 12 to 15 feet high!!! Totally worth the money would recommend to listen to the Guides and follow their instructions as people actually have died!"
Amazing experience,"Its really safe as well as exciting to do river rafting in Rishikesh. Adventures will sure love it. My son who is 13 yrs old,  enjoyed cliff jumping as well as rafting too..Its really dream come true. No need to worry..just Enjoy Gangamaiya.."
Ultimate fun,Every Indian should visit Rishikesh and experience river rafting at least once in their life. With adrenaline pumping in your veins while you face waves of water is just mind blowing feeling.
Rafting trip,I & my friends enjoying rafting in our life. I experience is very good and enjoy in my first trip in Rishikesh . I am come again in future .
Adventurous ,Must do atleast once in a lifetime. Really thrilling and adventurous. Ensure to go through proper agencies for same to ensure safety. Avoid weekends due to heavy traffic and footfall..
Must do,This is something every must do. In fact the flow of water and feeling a control over the raft is an experience beyond compare. The hotel offered us a mini raft. Three people accompanied us. Two were trained lifeguards and boatman. The water was so clean n cold. We even drank it and took a dip in Holy Ganges. Enjoyed my river rafting experience.
Thrilling experience,"A thrilling experience of River rafting in the holy river Ganga. Your skill, concentration, thinking ability in trouble all are tested in this activity.It will be worthless if you are in Rishikesh and don't do this.Really wonderful experience and want to again and again."
Cold water of Gangga,"The river difficulty is moderate, more as easy. I book with Himalayan travel and apprently I was the only foreigner on the boat. We took 8km length start from Shivpuri area. In the middle of the trip we stopped by to get some noodles and masala chai. When the skipper ask us to go down thru the water, I feel like freezing as the water is so cold for me. But all in all it was a great experience I had with the Gangga."
Rafters paradise ,"One of the best place for white water rafting, Rishikesh is rafting enthusiasts paradise! The ambience was so appealing and after I got into the raft along with few other members, it was so irresistible feeling. Though the total rafting distance was not so long, there are very few chances of you being satisfied with only one go... you will definitely wish to go for more rounds as the entire experience is so alluring. The entire rafting thing was pumping up the adrenalines as expected and  every single moment on the rapids of Ganges is countable, it was the thing any rafter will die for! Rafting guides and instructors were very helpful and kept us confident all through the expedition. In addition to this, the green beauty around the region made our rafting so adventurous. Loved the entire time spent here. I would recommend this destination for all including the beginners as well as ardent adventurists."
Ratting,"Very good, get down at Madhuban, best rafting service provider there, then get   down at Shivpuri to commence your trip."
Rafting in the Ganga,This is another adventure in rishikesh that you people don‚Äôt want to miss out. Go to rishikesh pay INR 500 per person in peak season and enjoy rafting an unforgettable experience. I have tried and would suggest this experience is worth for those who want to try adventure sports or for those who have check list of adventure sports that they want to accomplish over the period of time this is not as big as the professional rafting sports but neither that easy too. And dont forget to do cliff jumping at the end from 30ft height straight in to open river.
Must do!,"This is something that you should definitely do! It offers the best rafting across the nation, so bookmark it while visiting this place! The thrill is amazing !!"
Excellent River Rafting of 16 Kms,We did River Rafting (arrange by hotel - Raga on the Ganges) of 16 Kms which was very nice and we enjoyed alot. Trainer was very nice & helpful which is very important to make your rafting smooth & enjoyable.
Enjoy it,"This is for the 3rd time I have been to rishikesh for rafting, just love it. It is safe and absolute fun, if you are not scared of water don't miss it"
Get splashed and have a blast!,"Our group of 10 ""middle aged, young at heart"" adventurers signed up for the 9 km Gr 2(?) rapids with some trepidation. We had 3 good swimmers and 1 water phobic person in our group. The only reason the latter joined in was because she didn't want to be left out alone. And we had a couple of hyertensives and 1 or 2 with back problems too. The reason I am mentioning this is so that those of you on the wrong side of 40 and with minor health issues don't miss out on this really beautiful adventure.    We set out on our journey to Brahmapuri on a warm afternoon in a ramshackle tempo with the rafts as our roof. A slightly bumpy drive later we arrive at the launch area, put on our life jackets and set off on the rafts. We are given instructions on maneuvering by our guide and we prepare for the 1st splashing.   It was an exhilarating ride on the Ganga, thrilling but not very challenging as we had only taken on the gentler rapids. in one of the calmer areas of the river some of us jumped in the cold waters of the Ganga for floating while hanging on to the raft's rope. A very lovely albeit cold experience. A must stop at the Maggi-point, and too soon we are nearing the finish line. Really happy that i could finally tick this item which had been for long on my ""Bucket list"""
Amazing Experience,We had a very good time in Rishieksh. It is best for Summer Vacation. Camping & Rafting are the best activities to do there. It is must visit city in India....
Great experience,Here river rafting is amazing and one can get a great experience out here and it is also a great tourist attractions .... loved this place
Awesome,Wonderfull excellent memorable rafting under the surveillance of paddy adventures.... The staff and the guide was so very concerned protective n humorous
White water Rafting ,This is probably the best Rafting in India.Hire a raft from Rishikesh auto stand near Ram jhula.Will cost around 300-400 per person.Experience the thrill n chill of Mother Ganga for yourself.Surreal experience.Do enjoy Maggi n tea at mid point.Must do while visiting rishikesh.
Superb!,26kms stretch from marine drive to Garuda chetti. Level 3 Rapids. Loved it. Every bit of adrenaline rush. Would keep going back for more if I could. Needs lots of stamina as you end up paddling yourself.
Life time experience,"Amazing experience to holy river gangaWhile you book your rafter ensure they also have ""Kayak"" safety gaurd along with your rafting to have double security it's the  raging is natural and purely at your own risk."
What a rush!,We went for rafting in a group of 6 in a raft with 2 other people who were managing and briefing us. It was a thrilling experience  navigating through the rough water rapids and feel the cold Ganges water splash on you. The person guiding the raft was experienced and very informative. Tried body surfing which was so much fun. Another highlight is cliff jumping into the water. What a rush! Please do try it.
A must to do,Fantastic. I think no one should leave Rishikesh without this thrilling experience. This should be the number one activities in Rishikesh.
Rafting and camping,Good experience nice traveling very good very Gud service and staff very Gud cooperativ we have travel last week Delhi to rishikesh masoori haridwar there is Gud facility by trip advisor staff and nice staff person nice advised for traveling rout
Ride of adventure!,"It's great fun to do river rafting in any time except rain. But in winters water is chilly.One can take 18 or 26 kms package along with camping food included. Types sport equipment also provided by the package provider. I took 26 kms package and it took almost 4 hrs to complete. There is one mid break where one can maggi and chai, also do little cliff jumping in water.It is really fun and must do atleast once."
Rafting - One should Go for it,Rafting + Rishikesh is great combination of Joy & Culture. You can cark your car or vehicle at Government Parking spots & take local transport to visit all temples & rafting place.If you are Bargain King/Queen then you can be in profit. Rafting + Tent starts from INR 1800/-Plan it :)
River Rafting,"One of the most popular adventure sports in India. Loved by all the adventure seekers and witnessed a thousands of people every year during the summer time in Rishikesh, Uttrakhand. So if you are also looking for some adventure sports and that too without spending much of your time and money, rafting is surely one of the bookmarked things you wish to tick off from the list üòã"
river rafting,Rishikesh is known for its white water river rafting in river ganga.The fare for an individual varies from km to km and the longest rafting one can do is of 25 km and the fares are according to the distance covered.
Thrilling adventure ,River rafting was a thrilling adventure and I would recommend all the people visiting Rishikesh to must go for this once.
Rishikesh Rafting should be in your to do list!!,"I had been waiting for Rishikesh rafting for quite a long time...i had always heard that its one of the best in India. After doing after in Thailand nd Kolaf this was my third rafting experience and i must say its worth and must do activity for travellers. Even those who doesn't know swimming can do it without fear. Life jackets and helmet provided were of good quality, safety was not compromised. Guides are good and experienced. Travellers should avoid swimming without life jackets (even though they are good swimmers), no one can predict river current, its better to get down in river with life jackets on.Most popular is 16Km rafting, 24Km would be too tiring for bigenners... One can take video recording service from guide which would be memorable. One can carry mobile, each guide carry ocean bag in which you can deposit your mobile or camera and can be taken out to take pictures while in still water.Wear sandals of floaters which will be helpful while returning after raft, because you may need to trek a little to reach to the road."
Excellent adventure sport,"River rating in rishikesh needs no introduction. It is an affordable adventure sport that one must try. There are several rafting lengths  - Brahmpuri - 8-9 km (2 hours) - Shivpuri - 16 kms (3 hours) - Marine Drive - 25 km (4-4.5 hours) - Kaudiyala - 36 km (6 hours)The best for first timers would be the one from shivpuri. ""The wall"" rapid has been closed by the government. Please do ensure the following while booking for river rafting :1. What is the starting point2. What would be the end point (some rafts ends about 100 m before laxman jhula)3. If they would provide the conveyance to reach back the starting point (if you vehicle is parked there). Do negotiate on this.4. At least they should drop everyone on the main road as it is quite a distance and steep from the point where rafts end to the main road.I would prefer to hold some amount to the end until they fulfill all the promised facilities. We did go for the video recording ( not the one on raft). It was a wonderful decision. Also please keep in mind that one raft can take only 8 of you (excluding guide).  Do apply a good quality sun sun screen before you enter ganga. The sun at its peak would show no mercy :) and do not forget to put on sandals. You might have to walk the rocky road all the way back up (where rafting ends)"
River rafting was amazing ,"Amazing river rafting in Rishikesh.... we were 6 of them , we did 18 km... which was excellent and memorable .... in between Maggie point we had jump from big rock which was terrifying superb .... I loved it , I want to do it again n again"
Lifetime experience,"It's a place which comes with  peace ,stunning views and a experience to be cherished for the lifetime . Going there being around the nature is one of the best feeling and being into the river ganga doing rafting  gives you major adventures goals ."
Good experience but depends on the guide. ,"I went for rafting twice in a few days and they were completely different experiences. I don't know if the guide decides to be adventurous according to the gender or the nationality of the participants, but it certainly seems to matter. The first time, all were Indians with a few girls, and it was disappointing. The next time, I was with foreigners and just one girl and the guide (with the same tour operator) was excellent. We were allowed to jump into the water and swim around for a while. The approach to the rapids was great and jumping off the cliff at Maggi point is something you can do all day. Do the Shivpuri 16km rafting for approximately 450INR. Anything shorter or cheaper is not worth it. You can also go camping along the river side for a night. Rafting is included in the package."
Must visit for travellers even if you do not want to raft,"This place is amazing. One need not to go to Gangotri to experience clean and fresh Ganga.If you want to Raft, nothing like it. Besides rafting trying a jump from low rise cliff into water (it's safe if you know swimming and went there with professional agency conducting the rafting)"
Rishikesh Rafting.,Before I left For Rishikesh I so wanted to do Rafting.  I was anxious n wandered how to go about it alone.  I made friends.  And those guys who take you Rafting are very skilled and know each and every inch of the river.  I had fun and it was an experience of my lifetime.
Must do activity,It was amazing and unforgettable experience I think everyone who visit Rishikesh must do it our coach cum guide from Paddy Adventure Mr Surender Negi was very cooperative and he encouraged us alot.Simply it was amazing.
A must do for all the adventure enthusiast,"You can book for rafting through your hotel itself anywhere you stay in rishikesh and trust me this is one of the best experiences you will have with loads of fun and if you have done any other rafting and thought that was great you must try this, you will definitely be amazed"
Must do! Don't be scared.,"So there are tonnes of places in Rishikesh for river rafting. There are three types- 9km, 16km and 25km. From what I have heard, in the 25km stretch, the raft mostly flips in the river. We went for the 16km raft. They gave the gears and a quick brief and instructions. Out group was very well coordinated. Everyone was listening to the instructor and responding well. Our raft thankfully did not flip but the instructor will let you go into the river where the water is calm. It was one hell of an experience."
Adrenaline's Fear,"16 km rafting has 3 major rapids and 7 smaller ones. It starts from Shivpuri to Lakshman Jhula and takes around 3hrs to thoroughly enjoy the birds, secluded river banks, and of course those gasping for air in the middle of fun filled yet scary at times rapids. The water is freezing cold too. Best part is the instructors are usually professionals and are good at it. The boat usually never flips unless the fate is sealed. There are shorter versions of 4km, 8km, 10km stretch of rafting available and accordingly the pricing. The 16km one cost us INR 500/- per head. Life jackets, helmets are provided for safety.Wonderful experience to earn at any age."
Chilling Experience!,"I had done rafting at various places before, here it is Ganga, Green Ganga! We jumped into chilling Ganga water took a holy bath. Then at a tea point there was rock of around 20 fts. From where we jumped in Ganga. Truly thrilling moments. You may take a short ride."
Muat do activity.,Booked it from the hostel.opted for a 16km river rafting.The course included around 10 rapids along with cliff jumping and dip in the Ganges.Was an amazing experience.Please note: a common dry bag is provided to keep the electronic devices.
Unmatched adventure of Rafting in turquoise water of Ganga,"Rishikesh is about 245 km from Delhi so while we were suffering from hotness of Delhi then we decided let‚Äôs go for rafting, it was sudden plan of ours.It was a superb experience first we went to Haridwar after that Rishikesh. It was scorching sunny day which was good for rafting. It was a challenging and breathtaking activity in which a rafter navigates through the river. A number of rapids across different zones and stretches made us so exhilarating.It was total stretch of 27 km. A memorable trip."
Amazing scenery and fun rapids ,"Rishikesh was a great place to go rafting. The river is beautiful and clear and the rapids (up to grade 3) are fun and exciting without being daunting for less experienced rafters. We rafted over two days and it was brilliant. The water is ice cold and refreshing but definitely worth jumping in for a dip as you warm up again quickly, though I would recommend a wetsuit. You will be able to see the beautiful mountains, temples and shrines and lovely beach spots to stop at. Absolutely incredible views."
Adventure!!!,"Went through the 12 km rafting...apart from the multiple RAPIDS, the jump from the cliff point - from 20 ft height into the ice cold water is the most amazing thing.... do tell the person to include this..."
Must do Adventure Activity in Rishikesh !!,Did rafting in the river Ganga with my family. A wonderful lifetime experience !! The tips by the guide are good and his guidance during the rafting can make all amateurs turn into rafters and enjoy the thrill in the Ganga !! One should wear synthetic clothing and no shoes as one tends to get wet during the rafting. Highly recommended adventure activity while visiting Rishikesh !!
adrenaline Rush...,Very Thrilling experience..they literally throw in chilled water of Ganga. Kaudiyala is the best place for the river raftingKVNL is the best agency as they take good safety measures
Amazing adventure ,One of the best and must do adventures in Rishikesh. So much fun and laughs. Swimming in the Ganga river is amazing. Wonderful views all the way.
adventure,once in life people must try for a river rafting in shivpuriamazing experience of river rafting with experience guide
Rafting Destination ,Rishikesh is just 5 hours away from Delhi and is know for it's adventours sports/ yoga and spirituality. It's a best place for a weekend fun. You can try rafting and camping which is common as well as will cost you around Rs. 1500.
Love this adventure Activity,Loved this thrilling adventure ride in Rishikesh. River rafting is one of the best adventures  activities to do in Shimla
Can‚Äôt come back without doing it !,"River rafting in Rishikesh was an awesome experience!!! Though we we‚Äôre worried about safety initially but it was a super fun once we were in the water. We did three rapids and a surprise spin which was a really good. Having a proper guide and ensuring adequate safety measures which also included an additional support by way of an expert doing kayaking with us. Of course, not all rafting companies provide that but one which we hired for rafting Paddle India ensured it."
River rafting for first time,"The experience was wonderful !We booked the slot in advance with an agent but we found that since that was the off - period, there was no need to do so.It was available on the spot with less fees too.The lower temperature of water is difficult to deal with,hence would recommend to go in the afternoon."
Must visit place,"If you are adventrous,you must visit Rishikesh.You can do river rafting, bungee jumping, mountaineering etc. Its safe with full of adventure. Add this place in your itenary and enjoy cool Ganges."
Must visit at sun set for prayers,"The river Ganges aarti (prayers) at sun set is so very beautiful and well organized. No rush and pushing around. Be there before sunset and watch how the prayers are done. And the water here is so clean and beautiful.  Small stalls are available for souvenirs too. As for rafting,we did not go for it but did see many enjoying themselves there"
Lifetime experience ,I booked a 16km rafting thru trektindia. They will take you to shivpuri in their vehicle which is the starting point of rafting. Instructions will be given to you by the guide which needs to be followed all along while you are in the raft. The whole experience amongst many rapids and cold Ganga water was just thrilling.
White Water Rafting at Rishikesh,Went to Rishikesh for a family outing in Nov 2017. Decided to go for a rafting and enjoyed every bit of it. The cost for the rafting was 400/- per head as we went for shorter distance with 3 rapids. Maggi point provides a good short break to have some snacks and relaxing your nerves. Taking a dip in middle of the river is also very exciting.
Fabulous Experience,Loved the Experience on The Ganga .. we had such a skilled guide who made it all the more exciting !!
Fun Ride,Amazing it was...Jai Ganga Maiyya ki...Ganga Maa is called Maa for a reason and I understood it when we first touched the holy water and felt the purity within us...Such an amazing feeling to be able to be in tge middle of the river and RAFTING - Lovely experience. Please do not miss it... Who doesn‚Äôt know swimming also should do it. DO NOT MISS...
River rafting,"It the best in India and also must for those who travel to rishikesh, advisable pls have a prior experience of the same in order enjoy it better"
Enjoyed rafting ,A very good place to enjoy rafting and it is available at very affordable prices not only this but also a very good place to visit .
Rafting time,"If you want to try river rafting, then rishikesh is the best place for that. Tides, chilled white water and lots of entertainment and thrill."
Thrill and Fun,"We started the our journey from shivpuri rafting point. It were quite exciting boarding the raft and wearing the safety equipments,though our excitement turned into fear anxiety the instant we encountered our first rapid. The rapids are sudden growth in flow of river which moves the raft up and down. We stopped at the Maggi point close to bhrampuri for cliff jumping and had magii and tea.After that the flow as ordinary and we deboarded the raft somewhere below laxman jhula"
Rafting,"It is one of my favorite location and is very good for trekking, rafting. This place gives unique experience of rafting as it offer 24 Kms long rafting session which is thrilling and exciting. During summer the days are hot but night is cooler."
Awesome fun,"Absolutely Thrilling and adventures sports place. Chilling water of the Ganges, with water flowing at a good speed. Boats drifting against rocks and waves. Visitors not familiar to swimming should stay away from this adventure."
River Rafting,"This is not a boat ride mind you, this is some serious adventure and not meant for the faint hearted at all. One must be cognizant of the fact that the raft can topple and can be in the water, which can be freezing cold. But if you like adventure and enjoy such things like I do, Then this is just plain fun...while there are few routes to do this, we did ours from Shivpuri back to Rishikesh. There are two major rapids on this route both happen to Grade III. The first one is the Roller Coster and the second one is the Golf Course ( Mind you it's anything but one) both of which are very thrilling if you happen to be a adrenaline junkie. Depending on your level of adventure you can choose a rafting route."
Great fun!,There are loads of company's that are offering rafting in the Ganges. I booked via our hostel and paid 500 rupees for 16km which lasted around 2-3 hrs. I found the level as low to moderate but you defiantly get wet and a good thrill from the rapids.
River Rafting at Rishikesh - Thrillophilia Review!,"THRILLOPHILIA DID A WONDERFUL JOB!We had taken a package from Thrillophilia, and they did a wonderful job with respect to allocating the right operator to giving us extra support when delivery did not work in our favor at two instances to also actually caring about how our trip went, and genuinely taking the feedback!We had gone to Rishikesh in May 2016 (PS - I did not have the option to put May 2016, and hence have put November 2016 as the Date of travel), primarily because we wanted to experience the foothills of Garhwal Himalayas and its surreal beauty. Reaching Rishikesh is pretty easy - once you're in Delhi, you can either take the train to Haridwar and then an auto ride to Rishikesh or self-drive the car. However, since ours was a purchased package, we were transported in a Tempo Traveler to Rishikesh. The ride was really tiring at some point of time, but if you have your set of friends around, everything goes smooth with respect to the journey. We stayed at a campsite which was just 500m away from Ganges, which meant easy access to the river bed as and when wanted. It was beautiful, simply beautiful - at night we had piping hot food - rice, roti and paneer - and later indulged in bonfire at the campsite. The attached washrooms were a life-savior, and bathrooms were neatly maintained just like you have it at home.The only issue we had initially was with the allocation of one extra person (quad sharing instead of triple sharing) in our camp. However, Thrillophilia promised us to look into it at the same time, and our problems got resolved in the next 45 minutes. This was commendable, because generally travel platforms waive off their hands stating that they are just the platform, however, here these guys took the full ownership. Special thanks to Nikhil from the team for such special care for our group.Rafting was yet another amazing activity, and to be honest our true calling to Rishikesh was the rafting from Shivpuri to Rishikesh (since we were beginners, we chose the medium one) which was a good 16km rafting session. Right about when it was to end, our operators asked us to engage in cliff jumping which was a real delight to everyone!! Please don't forget to have the amazing hot Maggi at the next stop, where they ask you to board off the rafts! Overall, a very comfortable and crazy 2 day relaxation getaway - Rishikesh! Will recommend to stay for a week at least since there are loads of activities which we could have done, had we had time - for example, Yoga, Bungee, Jungle Trekking, etc.The operator team and Thrillophilia, both were very professional and I would recommend them to my family and friends! Suggestion: I guess the best time to go would be October-November when the winters are starting to kick in. Also, your operator might tell you to leave your shoes inside the bus/tempo traveler/car. Don't - The white sand is very heated, and you might actually get blisters :("
Trip to paradise,We went to rishikesh for rafting... Costed us 250 each... Most tgrilling experience of my life... A thing u surely want to do in your life...
must do activity in rishikesh for above 12 years of age person,"one should experience the white water river rafting at rishikesh , doesnt matter whether you know swimming or not. advisable to go for stretch of Shivpuri to rishikesh for a beginner."
River Rafting is awesome experience. ,River rafting was better than I expected it to be. Its an adventrous activity where rapids make you skip your heart beat. You have to be ready to paddle the boat as fast as you can and at the same time be careful not to drown into the river. Wear comfortable clothes with flip flops. Try the maggi at the mid point. You can ask the river rafting guy to keep one phone in his pouch and take pictures in between the rapids.
Weekend getaway adventure,"At just ‚Çπ600, you can go raft for 18kms. This has many rapids and includes cliff jumping also. You've more options of 12km, 21km, 29km but I find the 18km the best and worth. Make sure you book your hotels in advance as it's always full."
 Had a blast experience!!,I never did rafting earlier and was having fear before going ahead. But finally i enjoyed and i even made a 2nd around with a thrilling experience which made a memorable visit to Rishikesh.Even the guide was great with us on the rafting:-)
Must do ,River rafting at Rishikesh is really good for people who love adventure sports. It's really really fun. I did from shiv Puri .
PLAYING WITH THE WAVES,"It was my best tours ever, and going with colleagues added to the excitement. Never in my life had I gone for river rafting so I was really excited and a bit nervous as well..On our way to the rafting start point we could see the rafters dodging the waves and that sent some fear in me as I set out for rafting myself, I wished it to never end..It was so much fun. After the initial nervousness, I literally craved for more and more, paddling the raft, going through bigger and bigger waves..It was a dream of a time spent by all of us..And I would love to do it Again !!"
Adventurous & Thrilling,"Rishikesh River Rafting was adventurous as well as thrilling experience for us. Rafting is being done in holy river Ganga. There are three different rafting are available- 9 km, 16 km & 26 km. We went for 16 km rafting. There were 9 rapids. 9 km is having 3 rapids. Boat has capacity of 8 people excluding 2 guides. Price is nominal. 16 km ride starts from Shivpuri & end at NM Beach while 9 km starts at Brahmpuri. You have to move the paddles provided to & from when you are asked to do so by guide. The main thing is you don't have to panic. Two times we jumped into river holding the rope of boat. It was amazing. Guide then pulls back into boat after sometime. Cliff Jumping is thrilling. Cliff height is 30-40 feet. You will have to jump into river. Only saviour is your life jacket. It was really awesome. One must do it. We also get rain during last part of Rafting. The natural beauty of hills with sacred water of Maa Ganga will call u again."
Rafting,"Excellent loved every minute of it, Ganga panga dhum dharakka, amazing and happy to repeat for the season again later with others"
Fun adventure in Ganges,"Rafting is an adventure by itself and then doing it in the ice cold waters of the Ganges adds to the spirit of adventure. It's fun, the river has enough rapids to keep it exciting. And in the places where it is flat...one can get down in the river and enjoy a swim or just paddle along with the boat. All in all...it's worth the time spent...good fun and exciting."
FLOAT THE GANGES,This is a once in a lifetime experience. You will want to make it more than that if possible. We ran the river with Paddy Adventures. They were a very good and safe company. Their guides do speak English and have been running the Ganges a long time. Many of them have 10-20 years of experience. Great personalities and competent guides.
Let us flow,"As Harry Potter says there are some things in the world if you do together, they binds you forever and RIVER Rafting is one of them."
Loved it to the core ,"Technically i am not an adventure boy at all and when ever I have tried any sort of experience,  it's always been the bad one in terms of my luck with the same However when I went to Rishikesh with friends,  they were all game for river rafting and I was not ! Between all the friends they did not hear me out and forced me to do that and once the activity was been done I loved it to the coreThe first saftey instruction  brief by the rafter and it makes you more scared and person like me who had bad experiences with regards to the adventure , however it's very good safety brief and make you aware what to do in case of emergency We had lots of fun while we were rafting and lots of places where it was super fun The guide was super cool and supportive where ever it was required Post that rafting I have been to the sane place so many times now with different team and experiencing it Loved it and super place to have fun ! Recommended"
Regain yourself,"Just like every other weekend, I reached this place. During this weather (September), the river flowing extremely good and it has stolen my attention.You can find many river rafting or adventure camp there and ask anyone and do little bargaining and after that enjoy the sun kissed skin and divinely water kissing your soul. What a beauty, still remember the flow of Ganga."
Great little half day hike near Rishikesh,"Its been so great! Even thought it was a bit rainy at the beggining, we could see and amazing sunrise, and the views over landscape were great! The bath at the waterfalls near the end of the hike was supergreat!!Our guide was really good, he explained us so many interesting things about Indian believes and costumes, local plants and herbs, etc. He helped us so much to make this experience even better!!"
White Water Adventure,"Rishikesh, the place is now famous for spirituality and the white water rafting. There are many companies operating on the river ganges that conduct rafting and kayaking trips clubbed with camping. A must try, one should chose the operators carefully as their are many operators, who can turn your experience bad."
Great experience,Had a very great experience . First time did river Rafting &  it was really well experience.. enjoyed lot...
Rafting in ganges...,"This summer we have enjoyed the Rafting in the chilling water of Ganges. The Guide named ""Ashu Negi"" was amazing person, he made us to jump in Roller Coaster Rapid, which is considered to be fastest of all rapids in that region. Amazing experience. Later we did cliff jumping several times. The guide and his swimmers were very much helpful and they did not make any hurry in finishing up the trip. We paid 300/= per person for the Rafting, which i consider to be the cheapest and best of the all."
Adventure and Adrenaline rush ,One of the best adventurous activity. Had a super fun while rafting. Good to start by 11 so that you will be in water when there is Sun outside. We paid 600 for 26 km rafting may be because it was Saturday. I cam to know that on weekdays the rafting can be done in 450 for 32 km stretch. Best is to jump from Cliff at Maggi point.  They should identify way to take video of rafting. We also had a person with kayak. He allowed us to do Kayak which is also a super fun. We got to different bird while sitting on Maggi point. Overall a worthy experience
Fantastic,"That was my first river rafting and I just tell you it was just amazing, everything is perfect suggest everyone to go for it and the place is also very good for river rafting"
Never take your kids ,Never ever take your kids there it's problematic to take care o them if you want to enjoy rafting. One need to come and go back 16 kms and with the tension of loved ones who are not participating in rafting
Most awesome place,I went to rishikesh and this place is so beautiful surrounded by greenery and has a lot of opportunities for travellers seeking exciting challenges and fun.
River Rafting good experience,This summer we went to Rishikesh and we did river rafting . This was very exiciting . We started from Brahmapuri. There was 3 rapids . In first rapid they allowed to jump to river . my 12 old son cant stop himself to jump to river . he was very happy . water was so cold and fresh . he said this is one of my memorable trip . rest 2 rapids also we enjoyed. I can say everyone should try it atleast once.
Awsome place,The view of ganges was outstanding... awsome place.. must see place... the temples and ashrams were so good... please stay in the camps..
Great Adventure ,"For me, the best part of my holidaying was the White Water Rafting at Rishikesh. It was an enjoyable experience which is a must if you visit the place."
Delhi to rishikesh,It was an awesome trip with guruji travel. Really an excellent service. Driver was so friendly. Tempo was so comfortable.
Utmost fun ,"Had an extremely amazing fun, very cheap and adventurous. Cliff jumping and raft jumping were one of the amazing experience."
Superb trip!,Enjoyable and memorable trip i had in rishikesh with my friends.It was my first time and i would like to come again the next time soon.
Best Rafting Experience Ever!,Rafting in Rishikesh is by far one of the best experience in my life. You experience the best part when you step down from the boat and take a dip in the Ganges.
Must Must try adventure !,Dont dare miss doing river rafting if u r planning a trip to haridwar rishikesh. Its full of adventures and you are going to admire it after doing. Go nd have a blast ::)
Very exciting and challenging,Rishikesh is famous for advanturous games. Rafting is good for people with no heart or breathing issue. It costs around ‚Çπ700 for 16 KM and ‚Çπ500 for 9KM. There are many companies which offers rafting.16 KM rafting is more enjoyable and it takes around 2 hours 30 minutes.At Maggy point there is a place for cliff jumping and is very exciting. Don't ignore the security else there are chances of getting injured during activity.
Wow experience....,Go for it while you are in Rrishikesh..............Can not explain the experience in words........Only wow........Go for it...... Undoubtedly......Still if you are afraid of it.......
Family trip,It was very excellent trip to Rishikesh with my family and society friends.I have taken the tempo traveller service from Guru ji Travels..it was excellent service to overall trip..and tempo driver was also good person and never feel that we are travelling first time in Tempo traveller..
A must have experience. Had an awesome time!,"If you want to go River rafting in Rishikesh- keep in mind the following:1. If you're going on a weekend. Book in advance. And if possible do rafting on saturday. Sundays are crazy crowded. 2. You can book your stay in a hotel separately, no need to go with a camp/ resort package. It is quite economical - at max Rs500 per person. 3. Reach early in the morning - about 8.30 am to reduce waiting time. They wait to make a group of 8 people per raft. You need to reach either the rishikesh parking area, from where groups get created Or the booking office. Dont directly land at start site. If you're travelling with your own car, park it at rishikesh , where the rafting ends. From rishikesh, the rafting guys will take you in the car to the start point. 4. Rafting happens till about the last week of june, depending on the river levels & monsoons. Go when it is crazy hot to enjoy the cold water. The water is cold.5. Majority of the rafting starts at either Shivpuri (16 km, 9 rapids)  or Brahmapuri ( 10-12km, 3-4 rapids) and ends at Rishikesh. Same route, different distances. It depends on the water levels & the guide on the distance you go. There are other routes too, which end at shivpuri. 6. It is very safe, you dont need to know how to swim or raft before hand. Go with your enthusiasm, a full breakfast & ready for some physical effort (not too much).7. Rafting includes, rafting & cliff jumping. There's a point where they stop & let you do a free fall jump from a small cliff - super fun. 8. You can carry your wallet & phone, which go in a common waterproof bag in the raft. Dont carry too much stuff. It is not a big bag - just a sack.9. You do get tired after rafting, so plan to relax the rest of the day. It is an experience you MUST do atleast once in a lifetime. I plan to go back again! It is exhilarating!."
you cannot miss this,"Travelling to Rishkesh and experiencing the river rafting will be a huge disappointment. was at Rishikesh specifically for the river rafting experience. Took the 16 KM rafting stretch starting from Shivpuri till Rishikesh and costed and economical 350/- per person (can you believe it). The ride has some major rapids and you are sure to enjoy the entire ride and then they even have names for the rapids.The instructors are quite safety conscious and will give you a brief safety training as well.Once you are settled and seen a few rapids they will encourage you to get into the water and you can go ahead an enjoy a Ganga dupki. It is certainly great fun, but the real fun lies ahead.At the maggie point, they will take the raft aside and you can enjoy some maggie there, but thats not the real attraction. The real attraction is a ~20 feet jump, from where you can take the plunge into the ganga. Its a fantastic experience. for 2-3 secs and then you enter the water. A must do, putyour fears behind and take this plunge, people literally queue up on the rock face for the jump. Don't hesitate a lot, just do it. Its a must do activity.The raftting after this is regular stuff and you get to see Laxman Jhoola and Ram Jhoola along with the 13 majili mandir etc.All it all, Just don't miss the rafting and the dive. Note: Very Crowded on weekends and long holidays and may struggle to even find a raft. This activity will take around 3 hours + so plan accordingly."
Have you got adrenaline???,"You have got to have guts to thoroughly enjoy it -the 18kms shivpuri lakshman jhula one. It has some of the fiercest rapids on its way and I have seen raft tumble upside down on one of it. I myself was thrown into water by the wave in the rapid. I had done rafting earlier also in Manali but this was mind blowing.The rapid didn't allow to come up whereas the life jacket helps you. OH Gosh!! where am I?-was the only thing I could think of at that very moment. I could see my boat way ahead of me but couldn't mutter up the courage to get near it. The river bank was away even and I was being swept by the ghastly current of the water. Was it a life-death moment-No; life jackets keep you safe for even 75 hours and this was just nowhere near it. I knew I had to be calm, somewhere someone is looking for me over my raft. Calling them up could fill my mouth with water so there I was just going up and down in water swaying with the current until finally my raft came near me and guys pulled me up. Do I want to try rafting again- Yes I want, always :-). I was more determined and confident now, more than anything else. I am sure I want to try it some other day again. I am looking forward to it."
River Rafting in Rishikesh,"Great adventure‚Äã , experience of life time, the rapids are awesome , same couldn't be found any where in India, the safety measures are also good, you get down in holy Ganga and feel the flow"
Second Rafting Experience. ,Last year I visit Rishikesh first time for Rafting and also don't know the swimming. But before my second visit I learned swimming üèä and give myself another attempt and guys my second experience was awesome. I enjoyed the Rafting with full confidence and without any fear üò± to dipp. Body surfing üèÑ and cliff jumping I like the most.
Understanding the atom of the universe,"Well I have been here four times, and each trip is cherished. The very idea of being one with our nature is just so special. The peace that we get during the silent night, sitting besides the mighty river flowing from the cradle of civilization, the rafting thrill, the cliff jump is just unparalleled. Off late, during my last visit, I saw innumerable tents, and rafting enthusiasts which is just so dangerous. Most of these tents are run by local youths without any license I presume, going by their highly illtrained people. The banks are never that clean which I experienced during my first visit in 2007. There were too many rafts with innumerable people on board crashing into each other sometimes, most of them high after last night's fest. It looked life a traffic jam of rafting enthusiasts all out in one time zone. Many resorts have also come up with no frills service catering to the frustrated city youth.Inspite of all this, just the sound of the river flowing calms your mind."
Wowoooooo,Excellent ..mind blowing adventure enjoyed with our family n friends ..nice arrangements n care by staff n guide ...best in our holiday
Must try experience of rishikesh,"There are lots of people in rishikesh which you can go to for rafting. Their prices are negotable depending on the demand. There are various types (9 kms, 15 km, 26 km) with different difficulty levels. The guides are very experienced and make you do the work so that you get the‚Ä¶"
Exhilarating and addictive ,"Rafting is not a one time activity, it is an addiction. It gives you an adrenaline rush line no other readily available adventure activity.  The rafting at rishikesh is unique because it is relatively very safe and yet it offers adequate thrill for the adventure seeker.   The‚Ä¶"
Amazing experience with river rafting,A must do activity when you are in or around Rishikesh. Go for 25 or 32 km rafting to experience more rapids and a lifetime experience. You can also get the video shoot of the entire journey as the raft riders have started keeping portable cameras. They will quote a higher price‚Ä¶
Feel the zeal with river Ganga,A must and amazing experience ..... with multilevel and multiple grades tides .. its one of the must do activity when you are in rishikesh ... followed by enjoying floating and cliff jump .. its one of a lifetime thrill to chill !!!  
River Rafting Experience,"Do start your journey from shiv puri, the waves are good and difficult, so you will enjoy.  we started from there and experience was very good,enjoyed it so much that we will plan another trip once again. The trainer was also good."
My first experience in river rafting ,We planned a family trip to haridwar and booked v resort rajaji National park online without reading that it is not reachable from 7 pm to 6 a.m. . While inquiring at the hotel he suggested the river rafting.  We booked for 12 km. But the another group with us had booked for 18 km.  As we reached at 18 km starting point near shivpuri we also decided to do 18km. And this was the right decision. It was amazing journey can't describe in words.  Yes I had cliff jumping and swimming in the cold and holly water of Ganga was an event to be remembered.  I would like to do it again if gets the aportunity.
Enjoyed ,Enjoyed this adventure  with family and found satisfactory  services by river rocks adventure  team . enjoyed. .recommended
river rafting experience,"Do start your journey from shiv puri, the waves are good and difficult, so you will enjoy. We started from brahmapuri since we didn't knew of the same. But still it was a good experience. The trainer was good."
Lifetime experience,This is the best experience of my Uttarakhand visit. The 17 kms rafting crossing 10 rapids was a memorable experience.
For the love of Adventure ,Try river rafting once if you are planning rishikesh there are three levels of rafting easy moderate and hard. Which is determined by kilometers.. i took the 22kms one and it was amazing.
River Rafting experience,"It was my first river rafting with family. It costs 400 per person, but before paying just confirm whether they are arranging the river rafting from Shivpuri or Brahampuri, Rs. 400 is longer route and it should cost Rs. 400. Its a thrilling experience. Everyone should enjoy this, no matter whether you now to swim or not. You can also get down to river with the permission of the Captain and enjoy the chillness of the river water. Don't try to be extra smart, maintain the safety and security measures instructed by your boat captain. Must take your video, it will be a lifetime achievement."
Had So much Fun With Tourbite.com,We are just planned suddenly to go for Rishikesh river rafting and suddenly start finding operators  near delhi online and then found Tourbite. They planned rishikesh tour for us with in budget with best travel facilites.
Had so much of fun,The river water was green and chill which saved us from the hot scorching sun. The tides were just awesome
Adventurous River Rafting in Rishikesh ,"We went for my first one day adventure trip to Rishikesh with my friend. Weather was sunny till afternoon followed by cold winds in the evening. We stayed in the hotel Aloha on the Ganges having captivating view of the Mighty River near its big swimming pool and eating hub. Enjoying the thrills of various rapids of the River Rafting and meanwhile jumping in the holy river, we ended our Rafting Adventure by having hot Maggie in the cold breeze on the banks of the river. Next morning we were given guided walk for Ram Jhula by the hotel."
Twice in two days,"Had the opportunity to do rafting both with friends and family, separately.One of the most amazing experience. The rush of the rapids, the power of the ganges and the strength of the team.. everything is amazing. Took my 8 year old son as well and he is hooked."
Xciting,It was xciting and full of thrill. 18km rafting was great and one cannot manage to miss it. What xcite you most is the cliff jumping.
Rafting..!,If you have group of body builders then you can enjoy like anything. 14-16 kms rafting is advisable. You can enjoy and can pass 3-4 hours
Full of Adventure!!!,"An Awsmm adventurous trip to rishikesh for rafting. one must try it once, i will go for it every year. love it , full of thrill and enjoyment. we are six members from my company and we gone for a rafting of 26 km in noon and finished it around 3.30 pm. we also jumped out of our rafts and float in in thrilling river flow. after that we get into our camps.one must also go for stay in camps with the rafting."
Nice place to visit,"I do usually try to provide reviews based on saving money and travel by bikes. Would recommend to take your own tent, you can get places for pitching up your tent at Naalkanth Mahadev road. Come back and negotiate for rafting only, you may want to exclude the tent stay and food if running short. If not give it a one time shot for the whole package. But they do negotiate a lot depending upon number of pax."
Adventurous rafting ,"Good rafting members ,they give good instructions , describe every rapid names , wonderful experience, never forget the golden moments"
rafting,"amazing experience in the rapids. its totally safe and adventerous, we had an excellent guide in the raft with us and was wonderfully organised by the river valley resort staff headed by Mr Rawat."
This is really amazing,Loved it. Really amazing. We did 26 km long rafting and what an experience. Too good. Must for everyone. Go for the longer version as it has most rapids and there lies the fun.
Adventurous fun,Amazing it is!!! Though i am not much fond of adventure sports but this sport made me feel wow!!!  I enjoyed rafting for two times in my 3 day trip!
A MUST DO FOR ALL,This is the best attraction of RISHIKEST.  If you are visiting Rishikesh dont miss it.It is quite safe however it is not recommended for persons above 50.  But if you are over 50 and physically healthy you can do it.  I did it at the age of 63.  Specially jumping out of boat into the water is very interesting.
Great attraction ! Loved it !,"Great attraction ! Loved it !Water is a bit cold as it flows from the mountains. But still it is great, and you will have a possibility to jump from a kayak in to Ganga, do it ! Thats fun !"
River rafting and camping,"It's been totally amazing journey from beginning till end, thanks trip advisor for making my journey memorable"
rafting ,it was an awesome trip...i would like to suggest that everyone should try this.just have fun with lots of thrills
"RAFTING, WOW, CLASSY !!!","One experience you should not miss when in Rishikesh is Wild river rafting! At first I was hesitant to participate,since I did not know swimming! But my 12 yr old son inspired me to take a chance. And I tell you, it is an experience of Lifetime! And yes it is very safe, but please choose good Professional Agency.You can enjoy the Rapids and feel so close to the nature!!"
Up n Down...Up n Down....n...dushhhh,"Superbbbbb activity to die for!! Seriously.. people come from all over the India n globe to try dis adventure.Go for 16km ride if u really want to Enjoyyy. 9kms wil get over just before u actually start enjoying the rafting!No need of booking in adv, it will cost u 400 to 450‚Çπ, if u r in group the amount wil reduce.Only Imp Thing is - THE TRAINER NEEDS TO B VERY WELL TRAINED N CONFIDENT in taking all u along. Becos der r chances ur raft may rollover in mid and dis is d guy who will pull u up & save u! But not to worry, der r manyyy rafts following u to save u. All d best."
A must Water Sport activity if you really think that you like doing adventure Activity,it was an wow Experience specially the cliff jump at maggi point try to be in water when your trainer asks you to do that dont be scared
Once in life time experience!!,"The most exhilarating experience till date for me.I did the 28 km rafting from Marina point which is 15 km above the more common starting point at Shivpuri and ended at Rishikesh .There are around 10 rapids along the path.I have done this activity along with friends and colleagues from work place.We went on 18 January 2017 , the water was cold and yet that did not deter us from this activity. We started from Rishikesh at around 10.30 am and reached the starting point at around 11.15 am.After putting on the life jackets/helmet and getting the basic instructions from our instructor we begun this adventure of our at around 11:30 am with the ""Jai Ganga Maiyya"" cry.The start was quite easy and the water even though cold  was not very turbulent.Then came the rapids and the scary, fun and adventurous part.The raft swayed, yawed pitched and even rolled.The view along the path was mesmerizing however the one thing I wont forget is the sound of Ganga , the sound of the gushing water and you are out there in the middle,something out of an adventure story.The views along the path are great but obviously it is the whole experience that is so irresistible.There were a total of 7 of us on the raft i.e, 6 guys plus instructor.i was seated upfront so every time we headed into a rapid , the waves would hit me.But I hung on and managed to get through.At one point where the water was quite we even took a dip in the river having one hand to the raft.We took a break at a maggi point and did cliff diving another experience to remember.All that rowing did not tire me one bit  and we completed the activity by around 3:30pm,This is an activity that I will remember for a very long time."
 Thrilling,Rafting is one of the most exciting yet safe adventure. The river was not unsafe to be in. And trainers guided us safely around the rapids. Memorable experience
rishikesh river rafting,"Rishikesh city is situated near the ganges of river Ganga,which highlights the beauty of rishikesh,the rafting tour was awesome experience as it is a best adventures sports..dont be ever panic because instructers are well trained to care you with lots of fun"
A Holy Experience ,"Rishikesh is a holy place for the Hindus and is situated right in the banks of the Ganges River. This place is so calm and heavenly that the moment you enter you will find a inner satisfaction and happiness. One of the best things to do here is River rafting. The normal level 4 rafting starts from Shivpuri and ends in Rishikesh with the total distance covering up to 16kms. There are around 6-7major rapids in this journey and the entire experience will leave you spellbound. However, this is to be done only with the local registered rafting/adventure companies. Apart from the rafting you can also swim in the holy Ganges where the water current is little lesser. I personally swam underneath the Ram Jhula and it will remain an immortal memory in my life."
Unique,River rafting is a unique experience in itself and cannot be compared to any other adventure sport. Few tips are:Don't eat before rafting.Always wear life jacket and helmet tightly.Trust your guide and you're all set to go.
Lifetime experience,"Such a lifetime experience. Require lot of dare if someone dont know the swimming and doing it first time. But instructure make you comfortable, you have to follow his instruction only."
Marine Drive Rafting,"One of the famous and most taken stretch by people. Consists of many rapids (Roller coaster, 3 blend mice and some others) a wonderful experience. Have done it several times now but the eager never ends. There are many places in India for rafting but Rishikesh is the best and safest in all as they have a number of available options (Low to High grade). Kaudiyala (36 kms) is considered the best & difficult in all the stretches as the flow of the water & rapids are high, One should know swimming if going for that. Then Marine Drive (24 kms), Shivpuri (16 kms), Brahampuri (9 Kms) are the other options.Have tried Shivpuri once but there was no thrill in it so upgrade a level to Marine Drive next time and from the last 3 times, I am doing the same.. Sometimes i wonder to go for Kaudiyala but have to hold on the horses as i don't know swimming.It is really very nice to sit in a boat for 3-4 hours and to enjoy the rafting.. Cost is very cheap, Just 600 bucks per person for Marine drive stretch and can be book easily from their Shivpuri office on the spot.Just make sure to listen your guide carefully before the starting of your rafting as sometimes a small mistake can be a big fatal."
adventurous place,river rafting is great experience..it such a thrilling job..you have one tube and one guide some time if guide is not experienced then may be 2 ..in one boat there is place for 8 to 10 people ...so many rapids in ganga river ...and this is thrilling part... one mistake and all fall down in river and the flow of water is very high ..there is place from where you can jump in river.
Camping In Rishikesh,"I personally loved the whole trip arranged by Wondrous Travels.I went there with my friends from delhi,we checked in a premium camp,the location was awesome,we loved that location,the weather was amazing,the fresh breeze of rishikesh refreshed us.That camp where we stayed was facilitate nicely,whole staff was very generous,the food they provided us was really very delicious.Most enjoyable thing i remember was bonfire and light music in the evening.I would personaly like to advice every one to visit Rishikesh and enjoy every part of nature.Thanks to the team of wondrous travels to arrange the amazing trip and to provide such an amazing experience."
I loved it.,I had done couple times rafting in Ganga. I enjoyed the rafting there. This is India's best place for rafting and it's safe also. If you can't swim also no issues. Make sure that you take a good raft.
Review,"It is an adventure activity. If you Go Haridwar or Dehradun or Rishikesh somewhere nearby, you must do it."
No words to describe,Do i really need to review it???? Just go for it....It is adventures..its amazig...its awesome....If you are going to rishikesh and dont go for rafting....it means you are missing the real fun...
River Rafting....,"had done rafting in Leh-Ladakh in 2012 but this was more amazing experience,would suggest all adventure loving people to do the same."
Fun experience,"This is must to do activity to anyone who goes Risikesh,very safe and well trained people, clean water through"
Rafting,You can find numerous rafting providers on the river ganga. Provided during this season of winter one can go for rafting during afternoon only preferably..As the sun is hot on top. Orelse u can not withstand the chilliness in the evening. As water is just chilling you spine.
Dont miss this adventure,"I went in the january beginning, it was damn cold and I believe this is right time as the river was completely emtpy. No mess and crowd. Water was so clean so that we are able to view the depth inside water. Never miss the rafting and swimming in the Ganga"
Sooper feeling though horrifying,"Adventurous rafting experience, view is awesome and yes it's a lifetime experince.  One should not miss this."
Ganga Rafting,"So, if you are a person like me who enjoys participating in adventurous sports.If you love water, I bet you will enjoy rafting in holy Ganges in Rishikesh.Was here with my friends for camping, rafting and full on masti. Enjoyed every second of it, we booked a package of 1500 including 16km rafting, three times meal and some awesome ambiance.We started with rafting early morning. We chose a red color raft, life jackets on and wonderful guide to help us know the water flow.We start with rafting, with some amazing water cycones. Woohhoo our excitement level was at pick. I love water, so I spent most of the time in water tied to a rope. Cautions - Don't dare to get down into water without life jacket or guides instruction"
Worth Doing it!,"I have great memories of rafting that I did in August 2016. First I was scared because it was my first time and the rapids that I could see. even the amazing this was were only three girls in the raft initially later a couple around their 50s joined us. I think it was a great scenery that I could see from my raft. The hills were looking like island and I was just wondering that I am at Adaman island. LOL. We chose the route from Shivpuri to Ram Jhula(as all of were beginners.). It was a 16 km route with around 10 major rapids that we faced :) and the cliff jumping at Maggie Point. I think Cliff Jumping was more dangerous than sitting in a raft :PBut, I think to take the terror out from you rafting is the best thing. Adventure, fun, Thrill.. :)"
Best experience,"It's a must do activity whenever you visit Rishikesh. I did it for first time for 16 kns and I don't know swimming that well. The instructor was very good taught us all quite well. It awesome experience to remember for life. Its beautiful all around. Rafting, diving un ice cold cleanest ganga water , jumping from small cliff. Wonderful"
Worth an experience.,A good guide and a rafter would make your experience a lifetime memory. If you enjoy thrill choose only 16 km or more for rafting. Good rapids. A dip in ganga with life jacket is safe and worth a try.
Been there done that.,Must do. Was very impressed by the way the guides instruct you on all safety aspects.  I am sure I could have bargained on the rates but what he heck it was worth every penny. Do it in December
So much fun,"River rafting at the Ganga keeps you enchanted with its beauty, frozen with its waters (when you cross some of the rapids in water), excited with jumping down to its waters from the 20 feet cliff, and finally makes you happy with such an experience. It's just awesome!! Go for it!"
Thrilling ride,This was my first white water rafting experience ever and was most enjoyable. We went for the 16km section which has plenty of thrills for a first timer. We were seven in the raft apart from the coxswain who was very experienced and enthusiastic. There was an experienced kayaker accompanying us and positioned himself to help anyone who fell in the rapids. The best part was when we jumped out of the raft and floated along for around 15-20mins. We only realised how cold it all was when we stopped for tea. I would recommend it to everyone visiting Rishikesh. Next time I will take the longer 26km run.
You will just love it justttttt lovvvvveeee itttt,"What can I say anything about my mother Ganges, she gives joy, she gives life, she gives beauty, she gives blessings but she also gives adventure. Rafting is no doubt one of my greatest adventure done here in the laps of river ganga. We were total 5 people including a guide who was on top of the world during our heart whopping life adventure. You have to just live it to know what I wanna say. Please go and enjoy with great pleasure and joy. But chose a good water rafting company for your enjoyment."
That Amazing Water Splash,That down the hill thing you have to try with water. and to get the max experience and thrill you have to visit RISHIKESH. amazing place for rafting and some river side cafes.
Amazing place to enjoy.....,"Its a wonderful place to enjoy with your friends, river rafting, hill tracking, temples, valley, smokes available, foreigner came here to smoke......"
Amazing!,I loved the rafting in the Ganges. The scenery is gorgeous and the we got a lot of fun. We did a 26 km and I believe this is best distance. But can be very cold from november onwards. If you are going to do the rafting in the autumn/winter I recommend you to choose an operator which provides wet suits.
Adventurous and enthralling,The experience is amazing and will stick with you for a very long time. It's adventure at its best. I just have one advice- choose the right weather and right company to do rafting.
Amazing experience ,Toooo much fun.... truly adventurous. Very exciting experience. All safety points were considered then to it was full of excitement.
Must go..,If you are visiting Rishikrsh and not doing rafting is a crime.. Just awesome.. Go for min 16 kms rafting.
Rishikesh River Rafting,Just do it !!! open for all ages.. my kid of 6yrs and mom of 65 yrs were there in 10 km ride.. It is magical. there are lot of shops near laxman jhula.. I did @300 for 10 km from a shop opposite to 13 floor temple... River Rafting is must in Rishikesh.
Awesome - Must Do!,I love water activities a lot so for me this was awesome & I never get bored!But for others River Rafting in Rishikesh is a must do activity. There are many starting point/ distances of rafting options are available based on your interest & experience you can choose.Will do it again!
Worth it!,This was my first rafting experience and I enjoyed every moment of itIf you could arrange for a group you know it'll more fun and to avoid any delays
Experience of a lifetime,If you are in rishikesh....u have to try this out....and believe me....u won't regret it....it ain't that risky as one may suppose it to be....as they provide experienced people along with u in the raft....the view while on the river is awesome to say the least....and crossing the rapids (especially the mountain dew rapid!!!) Will give you all the adrenaline rush that you want...midway u cn hv a go at cliff jumping....or even float on the ganga.... wat more do u want? Go in a group and have a blast....
Holiday,Enjoyed and it was a thrilling and amazing experience for all of us.most of my friends it was a first time experience but for us it was second time.great adventure!
Ultimate thrilling experiance @ White water rafting in Rishikesh,"My 2nd adventure with White Water Rafting in Rishikesh was on 8th Octobar. We were a group of 5 family members and did it from Shivpuri to Ram Jhoola. The guide was pretty much quiet without giving too much information about the upcoming Rapids. Having experienced Rafting once before  4 years ago at the same place, it was a very subdued experience and left us disappointing.We decided to give it another shot on 10th Octobar. Only 3 of us went this time (My sister, wife and me). The experience began at a much brighter note as the guide was extremely enthusiastic about the sport and seeing all 20 year olds, prepared us for the upcoming adventure. He took us to the center of all rapids where it required huge efforts to get out of them. The epic point of the adventure came when our Raft flipped leaving us all in a Rapid. thanks to our life jackets we were able to float with the river flow. We went along with the river for about 1 Km before we could get on the raft again. It was the breathtaking and exhilarating moment of my life.The raft went through few other smaller rapids before our only stop at Maggie point. We tried a jump off a cliff (approx 15-20 ft) into the river Ganga which was an amazing experience. Post this we had hot maggie with chai which acted as icing on the cake. After our half an hour stay at the maggie point, we proceeded towards Ram Jhoola. I would recommend this adventure to all those young at heart and fit enough. An experience of a lifetime!!!"
Memory to treasure,"The team was very professional. We stopped mid way for a quick plate of maggi and chai. The guide let us take a dip in the river by jumping out of the raft and experience the chillness of the water. As we have good floatation jackets, even those who don't know to swim can do this. The guide was not in a hurry to make us complete the stretch fast so the two girls with us also enjoyed. On the route, he explained about the rapids, the temple that was destroyed and still closed due to the flash floods that happened, etc. One amazing experience! Don't miss it. As we were 4 adults and 1 kid, we took a full raft for ourselves. Its 300/- per head if you are sharing the raft with others or a little higher if you want the full boat for yourself."
Jai Ganga ma ki: Do it. You won't ever regret it.,This is the primary thing for which people com from all over the world to rishikesh to do. You start at shivpuri and it's a 16km ride with 7 major rapids and a cliff to jump off into the water from a height. You get to body surf in the ganga and watch the laxman and ram jhula from the river. You have to row the raft yourself according to the instructions of the guide. It is a must do!!!
A thrill in river.. ,"Must do activity for every one to over come your fears.. There are different distance to cover like 12 km,  16km,26 km 32 km.. Depending on your risk taking capacity.. We did 12km which is decent for first timers like us.. Best part was jumping in the ganges and floating with help of a rope.."
Best place for Rafting,"After experiencing Rafting at so many locations, found Rishikesh to be the best place for Rafting.  If you are looking for some adventure and thrill go for 26 kms Rafting which has maximum number of rapids. theres a stop at a location, where you can have maggie and coffee and do Cliff jumping as well.  Guide was experienced, he also made us swim in chilling river with life vest afcoz.  An activity should not be missed on trip to Rishikesh"
Rafting a Life time experience,"Cool, Really cool and reasonably safe. Even if you dont know how to swim but can hold on to the life jacket. Deep water calm at places but the real challenge is the Rapids. Thrilling. Will get wet irrespective ! Obey the instructor at all times, except when they tell you to dive in! Which they all tell u is safe but if you are paranoid then don't.Reasonable price about 800-1000 per person minimum 4 persons."
Not to be missed,A visit to Rishikesh would not be complete without experiencing rafting in the sacred river. Go for one that takes an hour at least and has some rapids. It is very safe but everyone has to paddle hard as instructed by the boat leader.The shorter rafting is like a normal unexciting boat ride and suitable for old people.  If the hotel has a tie up they will pick you up from the hotel.
My first rafting experience,"One of the most amazing thing or sport activity i had done in my life.A thrilling experience when you face the real power of water in various level of rapid.Also it feel so nice when you swim in the middle of Maa Gange River.Must do the cliff jumping if you are faint heart do not try it or overcome your fear.In my suggestion do the small rafting activity first like 8km or 16km then try the bigger one which is around 28km and take approx 4-6 hrs and cost will be around 500-1000 INR per person,It is safe you follow the rafting guide properly and feel the amazing experience when you face the rapids.Good luck and enjoy safe."
Lives it....!!!,Just awesome.. We are group of 5 people. The rapid (drift) are awesome. Took from shivpuri 14 km. Guide Mr. Ravi guide us very well. Loved to that.
Adventurous Thrilling Experience,"We went to Rishikesh with a gang of 6 guys and aimed at the Rafting experience very eagerly. It was a great feeling. We did camping for 2 days and the night we enjoyed in the bonfire. In the day, our rafting experience included Body surfing and cliff jumping as well. Irrespective of your fears with height and water, this is something that you should attempt and once you do these successfully (as they are very safe at the same time), the sense of achievement you get, thats priceless.PS: Cliff jumping is not at all as easy as it looks to be. It scares the hell out of you. :P"
Feel the nature and adventure,"We did the 18 KM rafting in Feb 2016 and this has been one of the best adventure I have ever had in my life time. There are a lot of shops for rafting and mostly they are same. They will put you in jeep and take you to the starting point based on the distance you want to cover. Once you start rafting, you will forget everything. You can jump in the water at different places. There is one Maggy/tea point in between where you can warm yourself again. This place also has one jumping point where you will jump directly into river from around 15-20ft height. That feels so good. :)"
"Famous by name, not by experience","I was not satisfied with the rafting..There were no much tides.. Was like a normal still water rafting...May be I got this feel because I have seen a few better ones before this or my expectation was too much after hearing about this or may be the time of the year I visited (June-2016)...But if you are headed to Rishikesh, this is a must do item.He said 9 kms rafting, but never felt like it was 9.. Hardly we took 4 turnings... :-)"
Must do once ,Rafting is a good experience in rishikesh. It's a very simple. We are vary afraid at beginning but after start rafting we enjoyed a lot. You can do with your family also. Rafting is closed in monsoon.
River rafting ,Its a my most awating adventure of my life. It is a lifetime remmbering experienc. The water is so cool.the meggi point it also a wonderfull place to rest for. While and eat n meggi.
Thrill to do ,It is full of thrill and fun you can do this both solo n with friends too doing rafting in rishikesh is a very grate experience
Thrill...Thrill...memorable,Must do river rafting....Take 18 km plan..don't go for 27kmGreat fun...full of excitement....Its experience of life time
A must to do in Rishikesh,I f you visit Rishikesh then do not forget to do rafting in ganga river. This is very adventurous .There are more than 100 offices on Ram jhoola- laxman jhoola road for rafting and the rates are almost similar. Due to holidays on sat and sunday the prices are higher compared to working days.From their booking office to about 12 kilometers towards himalay they will take in their vehicle and then you can raft  in the ganga. More than 200 rafting boats are put in the river. Per person cost is around 250-400 rupees depending upon rush. But this is very enjoyable in rishikesh and total 2-3 hours time.
Must do while in Rishikesh,I visited in June 2016 and it started raining so i opt for the 12 Kms rafting. They charged 400 Rs. for it. We do not know how to swim and it is safe to us too. It was super fun specially when we got a chance to leave boat in the middle of river(with safety jacket on). Next time i will go for the >25Kms river rafting. Best time is in April-May.
Amazing experience. Must in a lifetime,"The best rapids of the country are there. To top it up, doing the white water rafting during the winter season adds to the thrill multiple fold, since its a double whammy of both the dangerously mind blowing rapid and the chilling water. I had last done the rafting during the chilling Jan month in rishikesh and then again in July when it was way much warmer and not as enjoyable. Way to go is the spirit before you go and attempt rafting in the amazing yet treacherous waters of maa ganga.."
A enjoyable thriller !,It was a great thriller to do river rafting on river ganga in rishikesh and it was very enjoyable everyone among us enjoyed this moment this was my first time and a lot of fun it is a must do thing in rishikesh the ups and downs in this rafting session were amazing
River rafting in Rishikesh,"River rafting here is much better then in Kullu/ Manali (Vyas River). you are really involve in the activity. I did it first with ""Wet and Wild"" and found they follow safety measures seriously and their trainers are well qualified. others were little cheaper but the treatment and knowledge was very limited. River rafting from shivpuri to lakshman jhoola. its a 16 km in length with total 8 rapids with 3 really great ones. kids of less than 14 years can join you from Brahmapuri.its a must do adventure together with Jumpin heights."
Rishikesh Visit,It was a very nice and wonderful experience to raft in the ganga river. we enjoyed a lot. As we all were wearing live jacket we didn't have any tension.Its a life time experience. All most 12 Km river rafting was very adventurous.
Must do...do not miss !!,"We went to Rishikesh in the last week of May 2016 and stayed in a hotel close to the Shivpuri bridge. We enjoyed our rafting experience so much that we went for it twice during our 3 day stay. It was the first experience for most of us in our family and we were pretty apprehensive as barring a couple of us, all of us didn't know swimming. But having experienced it now, I can say that it's very safe and very exciting. Our first day stretch was starting from Marine Drive and ending at Shivpuri. This one is more thrilling as you come across 5-6 Rapids and takes about two hours. Just ensure that you chose an experienced, licensed, adventure Co./operator. The second day we started from Brahmpuri and ended at Laxman Jhula. This stretch is definitely more placid and only has two rapids. There are hordes of adventure companies all across Rishikesh so compare the prices and make the most of your trip."
one of the best river rafting I have ever done,Adding a new experience to your travel life this is a nice place you should visit. 18 Km river rafting which was very adventurous to me.
Adventure on Ganges,This is a must for all visitors of Rishikesh.All kind of travelers can enjoy this as per different options available.One would definitely be consumed by great Ganges
Rafting Adventure,It was one of the best experience i had in rishikesh. There are rapids that will get u on ur toe for preventing ur raft from getting inverted. Also do cliff jumping if ur doing rafting. It is just like diving into swimming pool from a floor height but experience is little different.
Thrilling ...,"just came back from a recent weekend trip to Rishikesh, stayed at Atali resort and did 20 km rafting in the Ganges, amazing experience ..."
Thrill at its best......must do thing....,"Well after 2 years waiting i went for Rafting.... although I came  Rishikesh to many times but were not able to do this.One Bad news.... that River side camps are now closed because of National Green Tribunal order till next orders..Which is actually good coz People were making Ganga a Drain. Second its a matter of safety also.Tip:Go for the Rafting from Marine Drive to Ramjhula  ....... it worth2. One can stay at camps also in Shivpuri but as i said that river side camps arw close now so they have made some camps at a small stream just left of shivpuri bridge. Plenty of camps are there with 1000 to 2500 per person including Rafting+1 breakfast+1 lunch,1 snacks,1 dinner. Locations of camps are ok only not so good.We stayed at Cradel holidays..1800 p/p.. the care taker Nitin is So good.. he is so helping and soo polite boy.tip-2 Avoid going on Sat and Sunday..to much rush,,, however it does not make any problem to anyone as the options for Rafting are too many there.Make sure that you do the rafting from Marine drive to Ram jhula...... it worth...."
Life time experience!,"We were a group of 11 people who opted for the 26 km long white water river rafting and had made our booking in advance with The Red Chilli Adventures. The journey started from Marine Drive. We were asked to assemble here post lunch where we were first given all the required safety instructions and provided with rafting gear (helmet, life jacket and paddle). We were given two rafts, with one guide each. Six of us boarded one raft and five in the other. The rafting took 3.5 to 4 hours approximately and was a life time experience! We were taken through several rapids of varying intensity. Unlike our prior rafting experience in Kullu where you are not required to paddle, in Rishikesh, every member on a raft is required to paddle as per the instructions given by the guide in the raft. The rafts were being accompanied by an additional safety kayak. Besides the fun of the rafting, the scenic beauty of the surroundings was also breathtaking. During the rafting one is also given the chance to dive in the water and the experience is unique. Towards the end of the journey, we were given a break and the guides served us cold drinks and snacks. All in all, it is a highly recommended adventure sports in Rishikesh and with Red Chilli Adventures we never felt a dearth of safety."
Best of the rishikesh,In summer u not do rafting means you do nothing. Its the most populer advanture at this time in rishikesh...
Rafting,It was me with 4 of my friends .This was my first time to rishikesh and for the rafting .one of my friend was hesitating for go for rafting but the person who was there he told us that .....dont worry its safe. ......u would really enjoy that.....We went for it ......and really it was amazing . .. We r thinking to go for this again ......Really an awesome trip...
Best ever river rafting done,I would suggest take a 26 km package. There is no such thrill in the smaller rides.The guides are really helpful and experienced.
Lifetime Experience,I was not very sure about doing it initially but experience was ultimate.Going below Lakshman/Ram Jhula floating in water was once in life experience.The whole stretch of river rafting was full of fun and pleasure.In between getting in the water added to it.A must do activity.
Adrenaline Rush in Ganga,"Did 16 km River rafting @Rishikesh.A life time experience to live with. Thrill of water rapids and chills of cold Ganga water is something worth your time and money.It took me approx 4 hours to raft, but dont worry maggi point will quench your thirst and fill your tummy to be rejuvenated again for some more rafting."
Adventurous ! Affordable !! Altimate !!!,"Do not look for the cheapest operator Go for the best. It is already very cheap here from IR 400 to 1000/- per head, for the same rafting. The prices differs depends on the brand's name ... their stuff  quality of life jackets their trained staff & most required ...Their behavior. Book from where you stay or agents. It will be lesser if get  direct from Their office all are open in markets n roads.we did  @ Rs 600/-  each with NORTHERN RIVER ADVENTURE but later we came to know to Preffer Green chilli. They provide an extra guard n good training.Their are 5 grades of raftings diff length.Mainly two length are considered here for new beginers1 for swimmers 16 kmsShivpuri to Rishikesh >16 kms 9 tides 2 hr2 for non swimmers 9 kmsBhrampuri-Rishikesh > 9 kms 4 tides. 3 hrBut the price diffrence is not much between both, hardly IR 100 - 200/-DO NOT CARRY much valuable things like big cameras golden  ornaments etc. A Mobile n little cash in a small personal pouch is enough the guide have a DRY BAG to keep all that into, till the session.Noting to fear but get to know their is not much medical or personal assistance in case of any mishappening. GOOD LUCK"
A must experience attraction - thrilling,"We paid Rs500 per person. To my mind that is quite a reasonable a price for what you get. We were picked up free from near our hotel in Tapovan. The Jeep first took us to someone's godown to load the rafting boat on top of the Jeep then took off for the start point of rafting. Overall, it took about half hour from our hotel to reach the start point on the Badrinath highway. At the point from where the rafters have to go down the slop to reach the bank of the river Ganga. At this point, they hand over a Chappu each to each of the rafters. Some of us were as old as 70 years. Its good that we did not opt for the 'longer' rafting (we learnt later). The adventure is safe and guides are well trained. I did leave the boat once for a dip into quite cold water. At the start point,  we paid Rs300/- to a person who noted down my email ID and said that our video would be shot while we are rafting and the same can be downloaded after 2-3 days ( after paying Rs1000/- online) from the link that will be sent on the email. I did get what was promised. Really worth. Don't miss this opportunity of getting a video for Rs 1300/-. Pl remember that you don't have access to your camera or the mobile while you are rafting. Overall, a fantastic experience, not to be missed. Our rafting was booked by our hotel Vedas Tapovan."
Thrilling Experience,"It was my first rafting experience and I really enjoyed it in Rishikesh, it was fun passing through the rapids during the 18Km rafting. Must go for adventure lovers."
Adventurous rapids,"River rafting in the pristine waters of Ganges had been on my bucket list for a long time! I ditched the opportunity of rafting in River Beas in Kullu in 2015 , and am glad that I did so as i enjoyed hell lot rafting in the Ganges.I also got to know that the rapids in river beas are not as good as the one here.Did the 16 km strech from Shivpuri to Ram Jhoola with 5-6 rapids with the best one being the Roller coaster and Golf Course.It easily takes 2-3 hours to cover the whole strech which leaves you exhausted and tired.Even jumped in the river and had a nice time swimming and flowing along with the flow.Definitely one of the best experiences and this has inspired me to do rafting in other places such as Zanskar and Brahmaputra as well."
Excellent Exprience,"if you love advencher little bite than this is perfect thing, we had enjoy it very much, total new experience for us and it is total safe for every age group person."
Experience!,"A must do for everyone. Water lovers or not, swimmers or not. What an experience to do rafting and let the waters sway you away! Fabulous experience. Had a great experience with Aquaterra here. Would highly recommend going with them."
the best entertaining ever,"it's very cool experience and adventure. absolutely safe) it united our couple and gifted us only positive emotions) you can take camera or phone - at first they'll put all your staff into a waterproof bag but later having passed all the ""steps"" you can take pictures. I recommend to take a sun cream and put on comfortable clothes (not jeans, not sneakers)"
Excellent experience,Absolutely awesome experience..They provide life jackets and helmets and the guide gives instructions at boarding and during rafting..Negotiating the rapids was wonderful and jumping in the ganga was amazing. Loved the experience
Terrible Experience!!,"They have no respect my be they never went to school. They treat us very rudely. Camping was also awful as there are 2 tent for 7 people. Camp area is too small n dirty, no proper drinking water, no equipment for cricket/ Badminton earlier they promise for the same. People involve in this package like Ajay Sharma Should be black listed for this business."
Awesum experience,Even if you are afraid of water you should try it.It seems scary when guides tell you what all can happen but its for your own good.Guides are very well trained so you are secured.Clean water of ganga and its tides..a must to do thing in rishikesh.I have done river rafting in coorg and trust me its far better here.A must to do in rishikesh.
awesome experience.. amust for all,"Great experience with rishkesh rafting .Their crew of camp and raft were very helping .Rafting is a must if you are going to rishikesh, few point to be kept in mind.-if you are booking online then no issue but you are not ,try to bargain  as prices are much flexible (in April price was Rs 500 for 26km rafting)- book camp instead of hotel as it will give you much privacy and you will definitely enjoy a lot. right now NGT has banned river camping(white sand camping banned) so camp are located near small water streams.  (price for camp with rafting varies from 1200 to 2500)-in rafting try to get front seats of raft as their you will get more thrill and fun."
A very exciting experience,I didn't beleive it would be so nice and exciting  until i did it. The hotel(the great Ganga) managed it for us.the guys  took us from the hotel and left us in a place to be waiting for the boat.when they came and took us (in their last station according to  our own demand )then we had a lifevest and a helmet . some people who wished to row did this under the supervision of a guy whose job was that and he was so experienced that knew how advice them to row rightfully and when they must pause.again continued and talked to us to be aware of great waves.it lasted one hour and i never forget it.thank you guys for such great job.
Best Place to go rafting,Been to river rafting more than once and will say that its of of the best places in India to go rafting..And if you fall.... that's add to more adventure in your trip.... would also recommend to go for cliff jump as well.
Life time experience River Rafting at Rishikesh,"this is the very interesting and risky dare in life to enjoying rafting at open in Holly ganga. this is over 18 years persons . there are 3-4 types of rafting 5km, 12 km , 17 and 21 kmwe had 17 km rafting , all persons should have strong heart . there are some turning points where big rocks and very depth of water founds.life jackets is must and should follows instructions given by guide.not safe for children and old age persons"
Great experience: must do,We were a family of eight with kids so choose the basic river rafting experience. It was great: we were picked and dropped at our hotel. The guides were nice and experienced. River rafting was a wonderful experience for everyone. Jumping in the Ganga to swim after crossing a rapid was our favourite bit. Loved it enough to do it again the next day.
River Rafting,It was a great experience in between valley of Himalayas and in lap of The Ganga. The rafting was a experience that would never forget. In rafting the first slap of cold water was amazing which jounce us very much. There were several times when we thought that our raft will hit the cliffs or will turn upside down but nothing happen. It was a awesome thing to do.
Rishikesh Ganga River Rafting,"Awesome experience, rafting experience was amazing, cliff jumping was horrible but good experience. Two thumbs up"
Surprise and Good start,Great begining for my daughter and fear buster also for her against rafting. Was indeed pleasant experience and sport.
A must do in Rishikesh.,"White water river rafting is a must to do in Rishikesh, very safe and extremely exciting, even kids can do from the lower base and very economical Rs.400 to Rs.300, depends upon the boarding point. Not to be missed at any cost for anyone from 7yrs to 60 yrs."
Unforgettable river rafting experience,"We did this adventurous action in March 2016.  We stayed overnight in Lifemission camp at Shivpuri.  We paid 1500 rupees per person that included river rafting, one breakfast, lunch and dinner and overnight stay at the camp.  River rafting was also included in the package.  The rafting was very exciting and adventurous.  One should follow the orders of the instructor and finally its a team work. One should definitely try this to have lifetime experience."
Never before experience,It was really never before experience. Great adventure in the river ganga. U should wear life guard before u enter in ganga here. For ur safety only. Water was chilled like anything and it really thrilled everyone when u go through zig zig ways sometimes here. Must do river rafting once u r in rishikesh.
Must do when in rishikesh ,I paid 450rps for about 3 hours of rafting. I think we did 18 rapids. It was the highlight of my trip. So much fun for a small amount of money.
Ultimate thrilling experience,"River rafting in Ganga river is the most adventurous and thrilling part of Rishikesh trip. We friends enjoyed a lot in rafting, dip in water and lots of fun.But you need to be careful and follow proper instructions and safety while doing rafting otherwise it may be dangerous.Overall ultimate experience."
Fun and fear with Ganges Rapids,"If you want to experience Ganges in the best possible way, add rafting in your to do list while in Rishikesh. Be prepared to jump into the Ganges with your life jacket but be aware, the rapids may be dangerous to try this. We were a group of six people, four among them, the first time rafters. We had a lot of fun but a few of the crew members feared to death while equally dared to jump into the Ganges from the raft and yell out. Cliff jumping will be an attraction you will want to try."
Wanna do this again,The best time to do rafting is in April. As the level of water is high so the rapids are more adventurous. We did 26km rafting which as about 17 Rapids.Awesome experience.
"full thrilling,fun,racing and jumping into river","i visited this place in 4th of  march 2015 and i enjoyed a lot that i never had before.now i am telling you why river rafting is best in rishikesh.1. flow of ganga river is very fast and it have many rapids that fills thrilling during rafting and fear sometime.2. racing with other rafting teams3. more you choose the long track more rapids you will clear and more you enjoy.this place is for thrilling and adventurous people and also for those who want to excite their life moments.we all know very well that when we go to outing or travelling with friends we enjoys a lot.but you can go with family also but please don't rafting if you are of very old age(heart patient).visit this place with colleagues, friends and relatives.i am sure you will enjoy that you will never have the experience like this.well when i visited and choose to rafting with my friends then price was:350 per personfor 13kmmore the long distance(more rapids)more you have to pay.i don't know the current price but you can bargaining."
Rafting with colleagues,"This is a must Visit place when in Rishikesh. Whether you are going for Adventure, rafting, Camping, Bungee or just a spiritual or Relaxed trip you must visit The place has a different aura to itself. It has a a lot of Open area and if you want to spend some time reading a book this is a perfect place."
Fun,Its a grade 4 rafting .. It's fun .. U also do a high jump into the river .. Suggestion go for 16kms n above if u wanna hve fun
an amazing MUST DO,"so we were warned that the safety measures on many of the indian adventure trips will be below par. not so. whie they didnt have all the bells and whistles of the west, we had a fun filled rafting trip down the ganges river or GANGA as the indians call it. there were 8 of us. we were given the life vests and the trip was a bit turbulent as the boat overturned 2 times, but we all got back in, drenched by the COLD river, but exhilarated as well.there was a bit of a hiccup in the pick up points they had assigned us, but besides that a great trip"
River rafting capital of india,Amazing rapids and great views.no doubt it is called the river rafting capital of india.Must try  cliff jumping I did the 27 km stretch and it was exhilarating.The roller coaster rapid is my favourite.Gets you addicted to adrenaline
River Rafting in Rishikesh,"It was my first rafting experience and i must say, it was a hell of an experience. we did a 16 Km Raft from Shivpuri to Rishikesh and it was such a thrilling one. The weather was pleasant, it was drizzling a bit , the waves were strong. It was a life time experience and and everyone must try it atleast once."
rafting in paradise,"if going towards Haridwar, Rishikesh or even otherwise, this is one activity which one must not miss.river in the area is not very unfriendly and rafting is pleasure in the cold and prestine waters of Holi Ganges."
A Deep Blue Road,"Rishikesh has other attractions too, but if you ask me, river rafting in Ganga tops the list. For many, it is THE reason to go to Rishikesh.You have to make a lot of choices before you can actually raft. Choices like the agency where you book, the price(you can also haggle), the rafting distance, the number of people in your raft, if you want a private raft etc. Make sure you choose what you want and don't compromise because this is going to be one hellava trip down a bumpy blue road.If you are a first timer seeking a decent amount of thrill, go for the 16km rafting. You can also  choose he 20km one. But wait for the second time to do the 32km route."
My first rafting experience,"Among the top 3 rafting locations in India. A typical package involves transit from hotel or trip office to a river bank site in the evening, followed by a bon fire for your group and dinner. Raft classes and rafting begins early morning. I went for a 17 km rafting track which had multiple rapids"
20/10 Must must try!,"There are only few Rafting sights in India out of which Rishikesh Rafting Ranked no. 1 and it is.We did 18 kms river rafting from Shiv puri.It was definatley the most memorable experience of my life,thrills of rapids in water,cliff jumping in between the rafting was so much fun that i did it 4 times.River rafting of 18kms lasts for around 70-90 minutes.There are many operators which offers River rafting,cost varies from time to time,averge 400 INR per person(18kms rafting) on weekend.If you are going in weekends there may be a chance that yoy have to wait for hours for your turn to do rafting."
Fantastic,Red chilly organised the rafting. Very good equipment and staff. Ganga ji was fantastic. Holy river rejuvenated our being.
The most exciting and adventures thing holy ganga can give us,"I visited Rishikesh in june. River Rafting came out as a most adventures thing I have been through. I visited with my friends, and spend the night by hiring camp. The rafting was also included. they charged 1800 rupees for two people and provided us bone fire, meal, treking and river rafting. they provide you a trainer that gives you instructions for the safety. when he gave a idea that what things we will go through, it gaves us goosebumps. but when we did it, we find it most amazing activity. Its a must do activity once."
an exciting activity,rafting in Ganga river is a very exciting activity not for the weakhearted.you are well protected and enjoy the thrill.
"Exhilarating experience, very safe","We did river rafting from Shivpuri in Feb 2015 when the Ganges is below its peak level. Unlike what pics or videos may suggest, I found the activity to be highly safe. Even when a rapid approaches, there is very slim chances of falling down if we follow the instructions. The ride lasted for approximately 2 hours and we stopped in between for about 30 minutes to have snacks. Do not forget to jump from the cliff (about 10 m) there. It is quite an exciting activity for those who like to experience the adrenaline rush. This activity will test your strength as it can be tiring to keep rowing for 2 hours. Pros: 1. Quite an exciting activity, will test your strength2. Jumping from the cliff (see above)3. Well trained guide (at least for us)4. Can carry mobile phones in a water proof bags to take photographsCons:1. Can be physically taxing for some (not too much if you are even moderately fit)This activity should be on your list, irrespective of your age or purpose of visit, when you are visiting this region."
Best hai bhai,It is a must for every visit to rishikesh. Don't miss doing the cliff jump.  That is the cherry on the river.....
Superb experience,"For a city slicker like me, this was literally a breath of fresh air. They have stopped overnight camps in the area and the river is really clean."
A Fun Filled adventure which will give boost to the adrenaline within you.,Go For a 24 Km  River rafting. Enter the rapid and then you will realise the energy level and adrenaline within you. Do go for cliff jumping too because without that your trip is incomplete.
Amazing Experience,A must do for everyone. It is an experience of a lifetime and keeps occupied with fun. A great exercise to teach team work and patience.
Thrilling experience,"We had no idea what to expect as we had not done this before. Amazing experience with well trained guide. In the middle the guide/captain encourages you to get into the water (with all the safety jackets, you are fine even if you cannot swim) and thats an unbelievable experience. Also there is ""jump of the cliff"" (not really a cliff, may be 5 mts) spot near the end and that again gets your adrenaline going. Great experience."
read this if you thing you might die in the rapids of ganga.,"there are 2-3 options that the companies will provide you depending on kilometers of the rafting trip.honestly, we were told that the 16 km one was scary and the raft could even flip over, in which case the people on boat will have to turn the raft back to normal while they are obviously trying to swim their own bodies. yes we were scared . but after showing a lot of courage and writing our will's we went for the 16 km one. and believe me. its nothing. there are only 5-6 rapids in the way and that too really easy and rest is all calm water. during the rapids the only thing that could happen to is the water that comes with a splash in the boats. so do not wear layers of clothes if you are travelling in winters as obviously you will get wet.also, there is a small cliff at the maggi point where they stop the raft for tea and snacks.  there also do not hesitate in jumping of the cliff. its easy and fun and if you do not do it there, you might regret. also you may be asked to jump into the river for body floating. you'll have your life jackets on, so no need to worry.happy journey :)"
Hurrah,Great experience we did 26 kms rafring with red chillies was an awsome experience really enjoyed it i strongly recomend red chillies for the rafting tor in rishikesh
trilling and chilling....clean ganga,"it was thrilling to go through the rapids, lot of bargaining in the price per person for the rafting. they teach about 5 mins how to raft. the water is very clean n chills as it melts from the glaciers above to reach rishikesh"

River rafting in rishkesh,I went to rishikesh on the month of October 2015. I had no idea where and how to go anywhere. I was with my cousin brother and reached rishikesh at morning 4 am. We asked a rikshaw walla about hotels for stay for a few hours as we wanted to move ahead with our journey in the afternoon. That guy was very helpful and honest. Next we went for river rafting at about 9 am. It was a very good experience. The river had speed at places and the water was cold. We were taught how to row n everything was well managed by our guide on the raft. We got into the water n enjoyed the dip. Must do once if you are planning to go to uttarakhand.
Safest Rafting every,Rishikesh Ganga River Rafting is best and safest ever been done by me. Moreover the team was weel experienced and expert and they took us to all the Rapids (without by passing them). Best rafting experienced ever. Kudos
White river rafting ,Fun activity for friends and family. There are multiple companies to choose from . Better pay a little more and go with experienced rafters. They provide you with helmets and life vests . Waivers have to be signed . Certain areas in the river Ganges are safe to jump into and swim . Overall a great experience!
"Must do, safe adventurous activity","Never miss this if you happen to be in Rishikesh. Good for family and children too. There are 2 circuits - 12 kms Brahmapuri stretch and 16 kms Shivpuri stretch. Not too expensive - Rs.400. There are plenty of organizers in town who arrange pick up from several points and drop too. Better to take help from the hotel where you are staying. Both circuits offer breathtaking Ganga and valley views but Shivpuri circuit offers higher number of rapids (7-8). Take a plunge into Ganga and also do not miss the ""Cliff jumping"" (15-20 ft high)"
Faadu .. Love this place,"Wana feel the adrenaline rush, Just do water rafting, bungee jumping, Scuba diving.what a awesome place. Must go if u live in delhi or nearby. During rainy season waterrafting not possible."
One of the best ripples of my life!,"Chilling water, fun of floating in water without knowing to swim, hot springs, hot maggi being served, cliff jumping and those breathtaking moments of rafting.Rishikesh, amazing place to visit and the rafting a lifetime experience. I and my friends started for Rishikesh from Haridwar at about 10 AM in the morning and i don't remember exact time taken but it took probably 2 hours to reach the final place where a lot of water sports and adventure agents keep roaming. We were total 10 people so we wanted two rafts. Bargaining is a must at places like this and we did follow the tradition and got a decent deal for Rs. 450 per member for a 18 km long stretch. They took us to the base camp where we were shown the basic techniques to row and what to do in case of an emergency. Finally we started with a ""jai maa gange"" chorus. Total ten people were on a raft, eight from our group and two instructors. I was sitting in the front row, i don't know how to swim and fully relying on the life jacket i was ready of the adventure; this was the first time i was on this kind of boat. Floating on chilled water was like fun until the place we arrived at where the raft was literally about to topple. there were many such spots and the instructors had names for them. The first one frightened me, the next one gave me the experience and rest of them, i was like ""come on baby"". After a long rowing we stopped at a place as we were wet with chilled water. The place we stopped was good for cliff jumping, although the instructor forbade but I did jump, in the picture you can see that spot. Sadly its the only picture we could take. At this point hot water springs were coming from mountain and meeting the chilled water of river. Amazing place it was! Finally our experience came to an end with crossing just below the famous Laxman jhoola.Overall it was thrilling whenever those raft toppling points came, almost ten to twelve, though i don't remember exactly. By 2:30 afternoon we left again for Haridwar to catch train for Jammu."
Amazing experience!,Last month I was in Rishikesh with my family and one of my friends. We went for river rafting with our children and we all enjoyed it very much. It's an amazing experience and our children also enjoyed it. I have been to Rishikesh before and have done river rafting earlier. Whenever I plan a trip to Rishikesh I never miss the rafting experience. It's Adventurous and thrilling. Everyone visiting Rishikesh should experience it at least once.
Adventure at its best,Rafting in river ganga with clean water and fast current gives you an excellent experience. one must experience this while travelling rishikesh
Rishikesh Ganga river rafting,This was the first time I was going for rafting . So was feeling excited and nervous . It was fun as we were all friends and had our jackets .
Awesome place to go!!!,"No words to say about Dev Bhoomi. Its very nice place to visit. There are so many things to do. like River Raffting, Bungee Jumping, Jungle Safari, Giant Swing, Dirt Biking."
Thrill,"We visited Rishikesh during September 2015 especially for River Rafting. We booked our accommodation one day on advance over phone. We stayed river side in one of the tents set by them. There is no electricity and no running water available there and toilets are make-shift arrangement. All the meals are provided by them to the travelers as there is no restaurant nearby. The package included 16 Km River rafting, One Cliff Jump, stay in the tent overnight and a breakfast, lunch and dinner. This cost us Rs. 3200/- after a little bargaining over phone. River Rafting is the real thrill and do not miss it when in Rishikesh. Off late, there is a rumor that all the tent arrangements have been dismantled under Clean Ganga Mission. It is recommended that you confirm this before visiting. Enjoy!"
Ultimate experience,Nice adventure.white water river rafting. Marvelous sceneries all around. Unforgottable ultimate experience. You can feel yourself here.
good experience,one of the few good adventure sports in India. Must go once. There are other adventure sports alongside too.
Rafting & Camping Trip with Family,"We were travelling with our son & another family & their kids. We stayed in one of the riverside camps WILDEX. The meals & tea- etc were included in the stay & it was great, home cooked food. The rafting was great fun. It's a must if you have not experienced it anywhere else.The rapids were amazing, thrilling, exciting, scary at moments but overall an overwhelming experience.We took the stretch from Shivpuri which I believe is 17kms or so. The kids were only allowed to do the rafting from Brahmpuri which is appx 9 kms. The life-jackets were quite helpful to simmer down your fears. But I would seriously recommend that you listen to the instructor before & during the rafting session.Overall, it was a great fun trip!"
The ultimate thrill experience,A must to do sport.. highly recommended.. long(16km) and short trips(9km) are two versions.. not recommended for person with any medical illness and for elderly.. it's a real life time experience as most of the time d boat overturns making it a bit unsafe but nobody gets drowned..I may sound riskier but that much risk comes with this sport..only for youths..n a must try one
Nothing to be scared of!!,"Being a non swimmer, I am deadly afraid of rivers. But this activity has separate levels depending on your ability and past experience. Choose easier rapids if you please, but do try it. The experience humbles yet encourages you towards the force of nature. Do bargain for prices and ask around for other options  too."
Breathtaking!,"We somehow managed to include this in the plan and travelled from Haridwar to Rishikesh on Feb early chilly morning. And that was the best moment of the trip! 3 hours of rafting in chilled water... when the boat hits the 1st rapid the experience is breathtaking and the whole journey is awesome with clear white water, amazing views and nice climate. I think it is the best place for river rafting in India!"
AMAZING!,"Spent a night for camping and the next morning did the rafting. Amazing view in the morning, clear river and the food was awesome!"
You enter a whole new world of adventure,"This was my second trip to Rishikesh and I had made firm plans not to miss river rafting experience at any cost. I was travelling with my friends and we took the 16 kms long rafting. Well to enjoy the real thrill of this place you must travel the place with adventure loving friends and as you swing and slide through those waves you are sure to forget that you have a world waiting for you outside the river. The velocity of the waves vary from time of the year to time of the day. It is advisable to take the raft early in the morning or towards the evening so that you are not encounter any difficulty of the bright sun. Well the must try things are getting down in the water as you have the life jackets and trust me people who have any fear nothing will go wrong but the memories of floating in Ganga will be with you for lifetime. The other thing which I attempted when I was there last time was the cliff jump (but i believe its not recommended now given there has been accidents as the water level keeps on changing), so its not recommended unless you get full assurance that safety is 100%. But overall the best experience is when a strong wave pulls you out of the boat and into the water. That's a memory I will not forget for a long time in my life. Must visit place for all adventure lovers."
"An adrenaline  rush experience,","Yes. Indeed. You can feel an adrenaline  rush .The rapids from the distance disappoint you, only to the time when you are inside the rapids. The rapids are thrilling and suggested for once in a lifetime activity for sure."
Rishikesh-White water Rafting,"Rishikesh is perhaps the most popular destination to enjoy this water sport.Rafting in Rishikesh is the most adventurous ride through Ganga .To check your adrenaline rush go for 16 Kms crazy rafting with many rapids .It‚Äôs truly a fun, challenging and daring to undergo this sport in shimmering Ganga River in Rishikesh.The banks of river is lined up with oak pine and fir tress which provides a beautiful view to explore the place.The adventure, the thrill and the high‚Ä¶ river rafting is indeed the perfect jaunt for those who believe in going ‚Äúagainst the flow."
Adventure sport,This is a beautiful place in Uttrakhand which is famous for its river rafting. I wanted to visit this place from a long time. Finally got the chance to go there with B school friends. It was an amaziiiinnnggggg experience which definitely each one of us should have.
"Adventure, but not extreme","I went river rafting with great expectations. Sadly, it was't as thrilling as the hype created around it. Most of the rapids are quite average and only manage to shake you off your raft. Id rather recommend bungee jump for extreme adventure fans"
Best adventure !!,Best & must thing to do in Rishikesh. Ganga water is so cold & clear you will love jumping in it. Don't forget to jump from cliff during the rafting break.
Great Adventure place,"Its a great place for adventure and the water of the ganges is very refeshing. perfect place to ""chill""!!"
Fun and Adventurous.,"This is a must if you are an adventure junkie. No previous knowledge of rafting or even swimming needed, although its beneficial if you know how to swim. We visited in July, but the water was still cold enough to give us shivers. Carry an extra set of clothes as you will almost certainly get completely wet, even if you don't jump into the river. Carry minimal cameras/mobiles to prevent them from getting wet."
Very thirilling adventure,if you are heart patient then don't go. Amazing sport for young boys girls with full of adventure & trhill.
"""Best Thing Ever Happened With Me""",I would Love to Thank all my friends who forced me into this and i have got a golden opportunity to be at this beautiful place. Touched the holy water ganga and feel its rage while rafting. I don't know how to swim but this is an unforgetable experence i could ever had.
what an refreshing bath,although the water was flooded with mud but then also the kept me refreshed me for about 4 days..............
Main purpose of visit,Now a days river rafting has become main purpose of visiting Rishikesh. People from different cities come to Rishikesh to enjoy Rafting.But its closed in rainy season from mid June to mid August depending upon rains. Their are many rafting companies you can book with. You are also provided with life jackets and if you follow their instructions its safe.
Dar ke aage jeet hai!!,"I dont know how to swim and was scared for this trip but soon sitting in that raft. OMG it was life changing, jumping in the waves, waves splashing on you,so chilled water of the Ganges. It really refresh you up"
Most adventurous thing to do in INDIA,Waooooo is the only word which can tell you what is the feeling of doing rafting.If you are a adventure loving person then you must do it.you should also do camping best thing to do cliff jumping awesome experience
Rafting !!,"believe me its fun ! Chilled water , some horrifying rapids , mud beaches around & a superb flow of water with both side covered by dense forest.  Amazing experience!"
first time rafting be a man and experiance it once you rule te life beautiful place,"We went to our rafting site and met our rafting instructor Mr Chander Veer. He told us that we are going to raft for 4 hrs as the distance is 26 Kms. he told us not to shout so that we can hear his instructions. he started with a bit slow rafting and then asked us to just out of the raft holding the lifeline, which we all did. the we came across several rapids like Good Morning, Three Blind Mice, Cross Fire, Roller-Coaster,T of Golf, Golf Course and Club House and we had a body surfing rapid also in which we were allowed to jump out side the raft in the rapid. We also did the cliff jump which was amazing. My favorite part in rafting was three blind mice, roler coster, body surfing and cliff jumping. There were several times when we thought that our raft will hit the cliffs or will turn upside down but nothing happened as we followed the instructions carefully.  and then returned to delhi via same route. Our Organiser Mr Amit was really very helpful.You must have found the rafting part was not described properly to which I will reply ‚ÄúBE A MAN AND EXPERIENCE IT YOURSELF‚Äù."
Adventure Lovers - Do visit once,"Its a perfect weekend spot for people in Delhi! Anyone who love adventure sports and nature should plan a 2-3 days trip to this place. You can enjoy night camps with bonfire, river rafting, kayaking, rock climbing and trekking.  Very relaxing and refreshing ambience. Friends and young couple will enjoy it very much!"
Rafting in Ganges,Rafting is a must do activity. Do it from Shivpuri to Ramjhula. However with Kids do the shorter version 9km. Must take a dip in the Ganga while rafting. Its fun.
must visit in your lifetime,"Rafting in RISHIKESH is a must visit in your lifetime, it is done on Ganga river, lot of fun and lot of adventure, i really enjoyed the rafting and it was amazing. white water of river and white sand in middle of large waves wow!!!"
Adventurous,Rafting from Brahpuri to Ramjhula is safe and best with family but as a couple or with friends go for shivpuri to Ramjhoola as 16 km rafting route is more adventurous and thrilling.
Zip Lining and thrilling white water rafting at fun filled Snow Leopard Adventures Beach and Resorts,"Out of the world experience at the white beach side of the white waters of river Ganges. The yellow sky when the sun rises, the sound of fireflies at night and out of all the rippling of water will make you feel at heaven. A must visit for all those who love camping and rafting. If you really want to enjoy rafting make sure you select 22-26 kms stretch that starts at shivpuri. P.S. dont forget to try kayaking."
Amazing trip,it really  owsome to do Rafting / clif diving/ rock cimbing/body surfing/camping in Rishikesh.. you can actually feel relax & rejuvenating.. after this trip... it is tollaly a different world for relaxing...initially i feel lil scare while doing rafting for 16 Km   later on i have enjoyed it... my fear of water has gone now ... infact m planning to go again for the same ..  Additionally the other activities like cliff diving n rock climbing make our trip full of adventure . place is reallly nice .. n happening..!!!
Wonderful Experience,It's better to book ma tent nearby (available easily).They will help you get a deal for river rafting.Do not forget to miss the opportunities and camera moments during rafting.Being a non-swimmer too you can try a bit of body surfing and cliff jumping.Only rafting will cost you around 500 INR for 16 KMsand Accommodation and rafting (1 day package) should cost you around 1400 INR.have fun.
Awesome experience - 2nd time of rafting.,It was our second trip to Rishikesh for Camping & Rafting. Previous rafting was for 16 KM. this one we selected 26KM rafting. Lovely & Wonderful experience.
Heaven for water sport lovers,"Without doubt it is the best place for river rafting in India.With two stretches, one of 14 kms and other of 29 kms, it will offer enough fun and challenging rapids to blow your mind. The scenic beauty is awe inspiring."
Truly a prominent Experience,"I went to Risikesh to do the Bungee jump, as I was so obsessed about it once my best friend tried it during his recent Europe visit. On my way to Jumping heights to the top of the hill the valleys were continue to threaten me with their rapid waves and I wondered how people would prefer to do rafting in this deadly stream. To my surprise few hours later I was one among the rafters who was holding the paddle and sat at front to support my instructor over his Rafting commands. Yes once I completed my bungee, I had around 8 hours for my return train journey to Delhi and I had no clue of what to do. I gave my guts out to try the rafting and went on to check with one of the rafting office just opposite to the Jumping heights office at Tapovan. They agreed to include me in some of the other groups who was already prepared to board the truck to Shivpuri. (place where the raft begins usually) It‚Äôs around 16 to 18 kms Raft along the waves of Ganges. You got to be fortunate to be among the good group of members as I did, where we had enough fun. Avoid carrying your electronic gadgets, though they would have a secure water proof bag to protect it, I feel there is no need for it. If you need good pictures or videos, you can try the Camoncliff rafting agents who shoots your rafting videos. I would recommend to try this at least once your life time, because it‚Äôs truly a prominent experience."
Adrenaline rush!,"An awesome and thrilling experience to raft across the rapids. You can choose from options of 9, 16 or 22 kms. It took me about 4 hours for the 22 kms rafting. The cost is somewhere between 500 to 700 per person for the 22 kms ride. Make sure that the raft is not overloaded."
Rishikesh River Rafting ‚Äì UK (Uttarkhand),"Rishikesh is known for its sages and the river Ganga. It‚Äôs one of the sacred places for Hindus. People prefer to visit Rishikesh for pilgrim reasons; my preferences differ a little here. No it‚Äôs not the ashram or the 5 star building built by Baba Ram Dev that calls me here, it‚Äôs the area Shivpuri that keeps calling me. Shiv puri is one of the best places in India for white water river rafting. Ganges flows with aggression here, making sure that the revelers enjoy every bit of thrill they have thought of while planning their trip. You can be prepared to experience rapids of level 3, 4 and/or of levels higher. Every rapid makes your raft jump like it was determined to throw you off into the cold water below. Rafting is relatively safe as you have safety jackets and helmets on. Relatively is the word used on purpose as there has been times that Ganga has thrown participants on the rocks that are really the reason for very creation of rapids. Rafting and other such activities are carried out almost throughout the year, thanks to the ever green river Ganga. You can raft in summers or winters or even in monsoon. The water is cold even during summers as melting glaciers are the source of water during the summers. Winters are very cold and the monsoon is breezy. One needs to avoid summer as it gets too sunny and humid on the raft.The course that your raft will take is beyond beautiful, you are surrounded by green mountains, you can see various bird fly alongside of the mountain, waterfalls if you have opted to raft in monsoon; in between there are a number of beaches, these are small to very small, these look like private beaches where foreigners can be spotted sun bathing wearing almost nothing other than a tattoo. These are tourist that have been living here since years and have refused to return to their land as if they have been indebted to the natural beauty that has mesmerized and enslaved them like for a life time. The raft instructors provide you with a series of commands that you need to follow in order to complete the 14kms stretch. One of the commands that they give is to jump into the chilling water. You have an option to sit in the raft and not jump; but if you take this as an option it will be your biggest loss. Make sure you jump out to enjoy the water and its flow. At one point your raft will halt and be parked so you can walk, climb the cliff till you reach to a height of a 4 storied building and then jump into the river. The most difficult part here is making the first jump and the second difficult task now becomes stopping you from jumping. This is known as cliff-jumping. You get Maggi to eat here and an opportunity to send your story to Amitabh Bachchan (current brand ambassador) who keeps asking for stories to publish on the m Maggi wrapper. From here you continue to curtail rafting session. The river becomes lazy from here so you can float till you reach the end point. From the end point you need to lift the raft and assist the organizers to load it on the jeeps standing there to take the raft at their starting point. You feel you want to repeat the entire session again and yet again, you urge to repeat never ends. By this time you get to know what you did was something meant for beginners and that there is another rafting course waiting for you. This is an even dangerous and rougher course. Rapid named the wall makes even the brave shiver and sleepless nights.  This raft starts from Kaudiyala to Rishikesh and has a distance of 39 kms. It has many rapids of grade 4+ including ‚ÄúTHE WALL‚Äù.  This course takes almost the entire day i.e. 6 to 8 hours to complete, leaving you tired and thanking the almighty for making you select and opt for this course.  It is not suggested to go for this route if you have low or no hands on experience on rafting; they need you to have good physical strength, stamina to qualify for it. During the entire rafting session you will curse yourself for not being able to click pictures and hence it is advisable to have a water proof camera with you. My suggestion is hire a person for clicking pictures, these photographers charge pretty steep but will present you with pictures that will be worth a fortune to you. They get down in river waiting for you to reach and click pictures of you and your raft in action. The outcome is something that you will cherish for lifetime. There are organizers available in hundreds in Shivpuri. You getting there to book the session gives you some bargaining power. They charge anywhere from Rs. 300 to Rs. 1500 for a rafting session that starts from Shivpuri. They will give you options of staying in tents on the banks of river Ganga surrounded by lush greenery and nature. They mention of having good sanitary vans to answer any natures call and electricity with the help of generators. My experience says do not trust them. Book things from someone you know. Most times they end up saying ‚Äì sorry diesel/ fuel got over hence no electricity or the cleaner did not come so the sanitary wans aint clean. Your cell phones will be out of network coverage area the entire time you are in your tents.Rafting session has ended, now it time for some rest‚Ä¶. NO NOT REALLY !!! It is time not for rest but it‚Äôs time for another experience that will make you fall in love with the very word thrill. It is time you head towards Shiv Puri one more time this time it‚Äôs for your Bungee jumping session. Even if you have Bungee jumped elsewhere this is one experience you want to take. Bungee jump here is 83 meter or 275feet (approx) jump. After the Jump, the Jumpers are lowered down to a drop zone in the river which has only 2 ft of water. Jumpers can now walk up to the cafeteria and enjoy watching your photographs & video of the jump. Organizers also provide with a Jump Certificate. The age requirement is over 12yrs and you should weigh lower than 110 kgs to take this jump.Rishikesh has countless treks opportunities. These treks are for beginner to advance trekkers. Most of them are for professional trekkers so please be sure that you mention about your level before you fix any trek. A lot many places and endless adventure is promised to you by rishikesh. Posts getting your dose of adventure you are free to visit the temples and other holy shrines if you so wish.I say I have experienced god, seen him closely in all my adventure activities where I holler-ed GOD SAVE ME !!!"
Memorable experience,"I had an awesome experience of thrill n adventure with my siblings by river rafting.. as we had to leave Rishikesh by 11am, we had requested a raft at 7am.. n the rafting ppl came on time for pickup from the hotel.. Guide with us on the raft was friendly n explained us many things.. they let us feel the cold water by jumping in the river.. they stop the raft at a spot for photo session.. u can take cameras etc which can be stored in waterproof bag.. It was all in all the best experience in the trip.."
amazing,it was an amazing experience to raft in those rapids.though remember to carry all your belongings in water tight covers..the guide was also quite helpful
The Must trip for a weekend from Delhi in Budget,"Rafting in Rishikesh-shivpuri is the amazing experience which everyone MUST have...The thrill in the water is superb. The camps are also good & offer good services with food, volleyball ad bonfire etc. It fits in the Budget for everybody.."
Amazing,I have been there in the month of March. it was little cold there but we enjoyed a lot. we enjoyed doing river rafting. We stay near river side camp the service was very good and food was so yummy and in evening we enjoyed bonfire. i totally enjoyed with my family.....if i get chance i will definitely go again.............
Adrenaline rush in rapids,"In the middle of white water rapids, the raft is at times under water or in the air and the huge waves keep forming in front of your eyes and lashing on to your raft, you find a perfectly trilling adventure vacation."
People near Delhi must go for this lovely weekender,"Tired of daily boring busy life then rishikesh is the place where you got to do River rafting. A thrilling experience, that refreshes you to the core and make you feel alive. Live in a river side camp, there are a plenty of them. Most of them provide in house food, you get to stay in a camp, get to enjoy bonfire by the River."
Adventure at its ultimate,"In the calm serene setting, set out to a thrilling adventure ride in the rapids of Ganges. Also the area around, set up for camping is the ultimate place to hang out with friends or cousins."
Rafting trip,"Its a very good place to spend a weekend in a camp on the bank of river Ganga. Lust green forest, clear blue water, white sand and cool breeze.bungee jumping, flying fox, Rafting are some of the many things you can do over there.We reached there by 11 went to our pre booked tour provider, and straight away they arranged for 16km rafting, Its really wonderful but one must be very cautious as the drifts can be nasty. we treated our self with body surfing, a lazy swim. after that we were provided with food and camp  we spent the whole evening in the lap of mother nature. In the evening we treated our self with music and bonfire. The next morning was completely dedicated to other land related activities.All I can say The trip was really wonderful !!"
The Most Fun You Can Have On A Weekend In a Budget,"Rafting @ Ganga river and staying at the beautiful camps on the beach or in the forest , bonfires and light trekking along with scenic views makes rishikesh an ideal weekend getaway with friends. You can get a camp stay easily for 1800 bucks that includes 26km of rafting ,cliff jumping, a trek and 3 meals , Bungee jumping is also available but is not included in the package. Cheaper packages include 10km/16Km rafting and with a little extra money you get 35 Km rafting and Rock climbing as well.  The Hill station is well connected by rail and roads to other major cities like delhi via ambala. We reached Rishikesh for around 150 bucks per person by rail. If u plan to visit with family that includes small children or elders you can also visit the numerous temples. The total budget for the trip is around 2000 - 2400 rupees with pretty lavish spendings and requires no more than 2 days in total making it ideal for a weekend Getaway."
Rafting from Jahnvi Travels near Ram jhula,"Its good, one should always opt for 24 kms rafting- that is the longest one. Also, you can bargain with the prices. For 10 kms, you should ask for Rs.350, for 18 kms,its Rs.400 and further its 450."
Super Awesome!! Must experience it,"First of all, this review is not for a particular Rafting service provider as I am writing this in general for the rafting experience only.The river rafting in rishikesh is so wonderful experience.Its very adventurous, energetic and it connects you to the calmness and beauty of Ganges and the valley.The Ganga water is so holy and so pure, you wud love to spend a whole day just lying on it.Also, try camping and staying in tents alongside Ganga in Shivpuri, that will make your day much betterOverall, a must do thing in your life. Rafting and camping.Dont Miss It !!!"
Must Try : Great Expericence,"This is second visit to Rishikesh and first turn for Rafting. Had mixed feedbacks from other guys had rafting experience. Very Much Excited. It was great fun , we visited in month on April-15. Great weather , we had choosen 18Km rafting from shivpuri.

Best adventure sport ever!,"Third trip to rishikeshAnd it keeps getting better.did 26 kms rafting and two days of camping.Economical, convenient, adventurous!"
Frequent Traveller to Rishikesh,"Though you need really good negotiation skills, the rafting community is yet to get license for conducting the event.But it is one thing to be on ur ""Must do list"" .Go for Marine drive rafting atleast anything less then that is just not good enough, carry your own alcohol to Rishikesh and stay in camps, If you a peace lover don't take camps at Shivpuri.Food is decent, breakfast at German bakery and pasta/pizza and like is just amazing all over Rishikesh's Laxman Jhula location.All the best"
Amazing Adventure,It was superb experience of rafting in river Ganga. There are really some good rapids which are breath stopping. I started rafting from Dev Prayag and continued till Rishikesh. It was really  amazing n superb experience of rafting in Uttarakhand. Must do for adventure lovers. HURRAY
Awesome place,"This is a awesome place to visit. Enjoy the white water rafting, trekking. Body surfing is also enjoyable. Really a must visit place."
A stunning experience in every way!,"We flew into Dehradun for work & then headed to Rishikesh. The river rafting starting point was a short drive away & after donning our wet suits, we were split into two groups of 6. Each group had a raft to themselves with a boatman. It was freezing cold but that didn't stop anyone from jumping into the Ganga at every given opportunity! We went through 5-6 rapids which were rough enough to give an adrenaline surge but not so rough that we were ever in any real danger. As an icing on the cake, the end of the rafting sojourn was right next to the famous Lakshman Jhula bridge."
rafting was the best activity in rishikesh instead of yooga,it was the first time that i do this work. at first i afraid but it was so easy and joinfull we went in the water and some times the boat driver shout jummpp and we jumped in the river and take the handle of bout . and we went on the big and high rock and jump in the deep water  its a lot of places in Rishikesh that have rafting + camping behind the ganga river and tracking and yoga together with all of your food meals and facilities
Clean your sins with fun! Riverrafting at rishikesh,If you think haridwar rishikesh all are for oldies.. Then let me tell you.You gotta see river rafting and bungee jumping there. If you are visiting haridwar rishikesh to wash your sins then this is a crazy way of doing it. Ganga river is beautiful and river rafting in ganga is a memorable experience. it takes 2 hours approximately. From rishikesh you ll get many options for the river rafting. Charges depends on your negotiation skills. :Pyou can also enjoy the cliff jumping there. I would end with this - Some of the best moments of trip are not to be captured via camera but captured in your mind and soul.
River rafting in Ganga z a great experience.  ,Pl negotiate in advance about the rates in total length to be covered hv a look at the raft and security equipments. pl be alert to security instructions &strictly follow becoz it z Mighty Ganga. small children are not allowed. Enjoy it &u will never forget this experience.
Relish your adventure in calm and sacred Ganges river,"Wow, what a day to started with!!! My recent trip to Rishikesh along with my friends really meant. It was like a day as we were in heaven  and came more close to nature:) :) When you just put your hands in sacred Ganges river, it seems the spirituality enters inside you. In addition, we started our rafting with full zeal. It is always recommended that you leave your belonging to hotel, camp to save them drowning in water. Although all rafting organizers have a water proof bag where you can put your small belonging (camera, mobile, watches) that doesn't drown. There are total about 8 -9 Rapids. The first 5 rapids are more adventurous than the last ones. When you sit in front of rafting boat, make sure you sit properly and fix your leg in the grips. There are two types of distances. For more breathtaking experience you must choose a 16 kms option which starts from Shivpuri. This may cost you around Rs. 300 - 350 per person."
great  rafting in winter,"we were apprehensive going for rafting in the winter ; and thought the water would be too cold. we almost cancelled it in the morning since the weather was cloudy, but for my son, who was very keen. So, anyway, we finally went and by the time we reached it was nice and sunny upstream. we used a company called ""red chilli""; the really great thing was they had these body suits, which kept us warm; and once we changed back into our regular clothes, we were totally dry. The initial safety briefing was very professional and nicely delivered too. We took the shorter one hour trip, and had about 8-9 level 2 and 3 rapids. one of them ""roller coaster"" was very enjoyable. there were two boats from this company, with two canoes alongside for safety."
One for the braveheart - freezing Ganga,"It was one day trip - driving from Delhi around 250 kms one way.Reached 9am in the morning - looked for couple of river rafting shops, found one for Rs 400 - 18 kms raft from shivpuri.It was my 3rd time. But the challenge was to battle the cold ice freezing water of river ganga.There were around 9-10 river rapids.Few were pretty massive and can give you a thrill and set your heart racing and even a pull the raft upside down..But thanks to the raft guide - who was experienced enough to smoothen the journey..Maggi point comes in between to enjoy the small waterfall and cliff jumping if the sea level is adequate which wasn't right in December.It was a fun ride.To be fair - rapids are strong in the summers when the ice melts after the winter.After the tragic events - 2013 massive flood in uttarakhand.Things are normal and safe to go for a vacation and river rafting.Lunch can be done at chhoti restaurant near the ram jhula bridge.Thanks Raghav Aggarwal"
Awe-inspiring experience :),"Rafting, camping and Bonn-fire. Hot tea and maggi while drenched in cold water is a treat to the soul. Amazing experience."
Laughter & Fun,"Wow! This was super fun! Lots of laughter, screaming, splashing & freshness! Nice & cleansing & spiritual & adventure all rolled into one!I would highly recommend this to everyone of all ages."
Crazy experience,"The 26 Km white water rafting is a must-do for everyone looking for some adventure. I went with my cousins and we all were a little worried initially. However, the red chilli adventures staff was very cooperative and ensure that we all had a great time."
Wonderful experience,"We travelled to shivpuri,rishijesh during first week of October .it was long weekend so huge traffic problem reaching our destination .the rafting experience was worth all the trouble we had .the rafting is managed by well experienced guides ie one for each raft .we were bit apprehensive in the beginning but guide managed it quote well .they have different rafting courses depending on rapid grades .we took course which had grade 3 rapids and it was exciting experience.definately coming back for some more ."
Great Experience,"Rafting in Ganga was fun. But you need to select the right guide. We were new to the place and after checking with some 2-3 random adventure guides, we have decided to go with 'Double Triple Adventures'. We were 4 of us, and the person suggested us 9 kms as we are family and there were girls. Later, after boarding the van to Shivpuri (place where the rafting starts), we realised we need to wait for other people who would take the same boat (not sure what its called) but the ride was 22kms for them. We had to wait 1 hr, 30 mins at the point where the 9km ride starts. So be specific about the waiting and number of kms ride offered. The boat already had 11 guys, but these people managed to let in 2 extra people. At last the guide who helped us told that there are 2 extra people so we need to be careful. Always ask for the waiting time, number of people on the boat before booking."
great experience,"i ove rafting in rishikesh. this time I choose 18 km shivpuri point.2 persons and 2 guides only.. it cost us around 2000 INR. I  enjoyed a lot and got the confidence to handle boat with just four people. when you are around rishikesh, river rafting should be must . persons can never know the real beauty of ganga maiya if they have not experienced rishikesh."
Experience the power of water,"Rishikesh is approximately less than 300 kms from Delhi, you can either take a taxi to Rishikesh or take a night train to Haridwar and take a taxi which will take around 2 hrs.There are almost 120 + Camps there but we took Questrails run by Mr. Mani Shankar Ghosh.The camp of Questrail is at Tapowan and the location is awesome, surrounded by mountains, the beach is beautiful, golden sand and the Ganges flowing down with its grandeur.We did around 36 kms in 2 days first day we did around 18 kms and the next day another 18 kms meeting almost 10 rapids of which some were very violent. The rapids are named as per their characterstics, 3 mice, roller coaster and good bye rapid.Mr Mani Shankar and his team were well versed in the trade of rafting and hospitality, The motto being safety first, we were trained to use the raft, the commands, what precaution to take and how to rescue if any of our team members was thrown overboard by accident.We enjoyed the waters and a rapid by jumping into water and swimming in the waters.(we wore life jackets at all time while rafting and while in water)We stayed at the camp and enjoyed the wilds, We also spotted Barking dear and monkeys but the place is devoid of birds.There were scorpions too around our camp but not poisonous a little precaution can avoid the problem.The food provided at our camp was delicious and hospitality was WOW.We were there in the end of the September, weather was around 13 deg Celsius in the early morning and went up a little higher, Ganges water was chilling but bearable.We also enjoyed clear sky and watched stars by getting up at 5 in the morning and moonlight at night.over all it was a life time experience."
Amazing time having fun..,The rafting in Ganga is very unique experience. Rapids are scary but fun. Water is too cold but jumping in the river is also fun. Cliff diving on the way is amazing. Hardly few people dare to jump of the cliff. The raft operators are well trained and most of them speak and understand English. The safety is always their first concern. The Rafting in Ganga is one of the best in the world.
"Adventure, a must !!!","1. Best thing in Rishikesh :     Rafting, an exciting experience    which will be reasonable, in Budget (INR 300-INR 500, depending on the KM we opt)     **Even Kids can perform, but from a lesser distance2. We opted for 18 KMS.    where we meet 7/8 Rapids,      out of which 3 rapids were more violent and roaring :)3. Rafting Operators,     will have a bag called DRY BAG, where you can keep all your valuables safely    (Wallets, Camera)4. You will have a nice Scenic view, can take Photos/Videos5. After few KM's, say Half-way there is stop-over     where you can have MAGGI, Tea, Drinks, etc    Also one can enjoy the near-by Waterfall"
Awesome experience,Rafting experience was awesome. We did the 18 km track rafting. We were picked from the hotel and dropped at the starting point of rafting in shivpuri. Rafting is a must to do activity if u visit Rishikesh. We were charged Rs.350/ person for 18 km route. In between there is a Maggi point where one can stop and have tea and Maggi. One can also jump from the cliff which is around 25 ft.
"Splash of water,rushing adrenaline-rafting.",We started from Shivpuri after a short description of things to do while paddling.Rapids were beautiful and sometimes scary.we loved to be there and remember the rapids.Strongly recommended for everyone who love gushing adrenaline.
A superb experience,It was a thrill for the family. The water was cold and doing the rapids was total fun. My kid just had a ball jumping into the ganga from the raft (she's a very good swimmer) and from the cliff. A real thrilling experience
Worth the time and money,"Phew what an experience!!!! we paid Rs 450/- each to Ibex Adventures and were taken to Shivpuri, from where the rafting was to start. We were taken inside the raft after a brief safety instructions. The rapids were mind blowing with one of grade 3. We had amazing trip, after crossing garud chatti bridge, our operator told us to jump in water. The water was so inviting and without any inhibition we all jumped in. Wow to jump right in middle of the Ganga river, our sins surely have evaporated. There was also one guide in canoe for rescue, who kept us entertaining with stunts in rapid and also spraying us with water frequently...Worth every single paise..."
Awesome Adventurously experience..,"My first adventurous trip with my childhood buddies. It is always a nice experience to be at the end sides of Ganges doing the camping and then going for crystal clear water rafting. Our rafting part was of 26 km distance with 3 major rapids and small rapids which was lifetime experience. Also the trekking and waterfall view of nature was the cherry on the cake.I prefer not writing about camping part, I wish something could be done to improve the wash room facilities in the camps and with good mannered staffs."
A must in Rishikesh!,Finished 500hr yoga training with Rishikesh Yog Peeth TTC so amazing!!Every sunday there would be an outing for all students... this was the best outing! River was rough enough to throw the raft upside down and in some parts calm enough to jump in and swim... very safe and totally a must!
Rafting at Rishikesh,"For every reason i love rishikesh, especially river-rafting and camping. For camping you can go for marine drive camps surrounding by mountains and you can enjoy the view and even you can go into water without any danger. You need to bargain for rafting. Avoid rainy season."
Advanture in lap of Dev Bhoomi,The best part was that it is in the uttarakhand and no one can expect more than that you are in the one of the largest river in the india for rafting.This is one of the best thing which is every one would want to be in his life.This is the best thing and most important is in budget.
A must do for all adrenaline junkies,"After a nice meditation session near the banks of the Ganes, feeling soothed and calmed, I set out for an adventurous rafting session at the Ganges.And what a thrill it was.While meditating, the river exuded serenity, and while rafting it showed it's full strength and power.With a helmet over the head, and oars in our hands,we set out for a tedious but extremely enjoyable task of facing the many rapids that the river offered.If you are fond of roller coasters, I bet you will come back to experience rafting again and again.The river beckons you, teases you and if you take the bait, for once the experience will be even more enjoyable.Don't be scared of falling in the water, there will be be enough safety equipment to ensure that you do not drown even if you want to! But be scared of not entering the mighty Ganges, let me warn you, you are missing out on a lot of fun.The highlight for me was the Maggi point.The hot Maggi after dipping in the cold water was absolutely sumptuous.There were mini-waterfalls near the Maggi point, another super fun point.All in all a superb experience suitable for all age groups (yes we had an old couple in the raft with us and they had a great time)"
Humbled by the sheer power of nature,"The beauty of the location, the serenity, the impeccable greenery all around, and to top it all the roaring power of the mighty Ganges. If you are in Rishikesh, all these are there for you 24X7 barring the last. You can experience the roaring power of Ganges only when you come to Shivpuri, in upper Rishikesh and hop on to one of those colourful rubber rafts. These rafts initially gives you a false sense of security when you hop in to it for the first time. But the moment it leaves the solid ground, reality strikes and you realise how insignificant your raft or for that matter you are in front of the Holiest river of India fresh out of mountains. But with your paddle as the tool and your pumped up adrenalin as the fuel, this experience is something one would carry to his last day. Specially the first experience. I have been to this place many time after, but the first experience is something you cant forget. I still do, as if I went there yesterday for the first time."
"Adventurous,exciting,must visit for all..........","We had stayed in Mercury himalayan beach camp,they have their own private beach,which is the best thing about their camp,we had 2 rafting sessions,jungle walk,games etc,and the food was good too.....We stayed there for 2 nights and had the best time of our lives....."
superb..awesome..adrenaline rush,"Snow Leopard Adventures is the company you want to go with if its for rafting..tents are good, right on the river bed..food is excellent...great bunch of ppl..they have a resort up the road with a swimming pool..the safety issue was taken care of by the very experienced trainers..bungee jumping is another super experience you can have in here...overall a great adventure trip.."
Rafting,"it was one of the most thrilling adventurous moment , we  enjoyed there food was not nice although the experience about the rafting was good  as starting from marine drive  about 25 KM of rafting and the rapids like rollercoaster and the golf course were full of adrenaline, (dont know about the names of the rapids have they put that or not but they guys called it that )"
My Most Adventourous,Had a wonderful time in rishikesh.Had stayed in tent.enjoyed gazing stars in the night.Loved playing in white sand.Rustic food.Went rafting.Loved all the rapids and trek back.
Must Try Adventure Sports for All,"1st Tried about 7 years back and enjoyed it a lot. Would recommend to all heading towards rishikesh. Already experienced thrice.  The major highlight of the trip is not just rafting and getting in the water as and when the instructor instructs you, but also the cliff jumping. It needs guts first to climb there and then to jump. Its worth the trip.Enjoy !"
"exciting, adventurous excellent","Be prepared to feel and soak in the adventure tourism on offer. Choose the right place and operator otherwise most people are fly by night operators. Dont look at costs because in adventure n wild life tourism the costs  are little high because of various factors. In this case the costs are for rafts the season being hardly 7 month and the staff expensive. We did the kaudiyala to shivpuri strech , it was a 3.5 hours of thrill and effort. Please note each  person on the raft has to ROW  and it is strenuous.  Do not go if you are looking for leisure, it is hard work. You have to be physically fit and active. Tents offer basic facility. Ensure you are fully covered and apply sun screen on face, if hands and legs are not covered be prepared for heavy sun tan or actually sun baked."
Adventurous!!!,It is always a nice experience to be at the sides of Ganges doing the camping and then going for white water rafting. I wish something could be done to improve the wash room facilities in the camps. I would not like to prefer hotels over camps because that will steal all the fun.
Amazing Place - In your god's lap,"Rishikesh river rafting is one of the experiences in India which one should not miss.. The ideal way is to reach rishikesh and experience a day in tents next to river Ganga and feel the nature...serene and peace..On day two get set go....for the river rafting and please opt for the option of 25 kms river rafting.....I would suggest staying in tents at a place called ""byasi"" in tents set by sand piper group, which is 35kms from rishikesh..though it is far from rishikesh it is recommended coz the place has a big white sand beach, rocks and ofcourse ganga flowing next to you....I could not locate such a place in the entire stretch of 35 kms frm rishikesh..Further, I would suggest taking your own/rented car instead of going by train or bus from Delhi because you will not find transport from rishikesh to the the place where you have hired tents....having a driver is advisable coz you raft from a place called ""marine drive"" to almost ""laxman jhulla"" and in the absence of driver you wil have to travel back(25 kms) to marine drive for your vehicle..."
Amazing,"Scenic,clam and exciting all at the same time. Safe (from shivpuri) for a family and not necessary to know swimming. A dip in the icy waters are a must after a rapid. The water rejuvenates you wiping off all the tiredness of rafting."
Amazing and Exhilarating,We had taken a 12 Km rafting and it was an amazing experience. Anybody visiting Uttarakhand must go for rafting without which the tour is incomplete
Very Adventurous!,"Liked the boat and we got a really nice guide. He spent some 15 minutes teaching us how to use the paddles and explaining the different commands he would give during the course of the rafting.We did the 14 km boat trip and this included 1 grade 4 rapid, 2 grade 3 rapids and quite a few grade 1 and 2 rapids.. and the grade 3 and 4 ones are pretty rough and scary.. but if you paddle properly and hold on to the raft, you probably will stay onboard :)We went during the off season so it cost us less than half the usual price and was totally worth it!"
Amazing,"One night two days adventures trip. Till now the best and adventures experience I have is rafting on hands of Maa Ganga. Many times during my visit to hometown, I saw this adventures sport from window of bus. But when I get a chance to be a part of this sport with my colleagues, I feel alive. It was an amazing and awesome play which I can't explain in words. We had 24 Km rafting with many rapids. It was very joyful and full of excitement experience when our raft crossing the rapid. The camping were too good and food was awesome. It was a memorable trip which I can‚Äôt forget. Uttarakhand have many places where we can feel joy and happiness and explore the nature.!! Jai Dev Bhoomi !! Jai Uttarakhand !!"
Great Experience,It was Amazing ......... The best ever experience I have had for any adventure sport. All security measures are up to the Mark and our guide was very much active. I have done river rafting on River Vyas also but this is something beyond our imagination. Rapids were too violent. The best experience we have ever had. I recommend Himalayan Highlander as a service provider in that Particular area. Our TOUR Managers Manil and Madan Badoni were excellent. Any one can contact him for camping and team building programs . his contact number is    09412047198.
Must Do,"Ganges river rafting at Rishikesh,India can be done through 10 miles. Good adventure for adults and below 50. Suitable for cold water lovers. I enjoyed like anything. Must do."
A must,"We had heard about the rafting in Rishikesh but were not sure we would do it as we stayed only one full day in Rishikesh. We are really glad we decided to take the time for it. It was great fun.Prices are more than reasonable. We paid 450pp at the hotel lobby for the middle trip (16 kms it was  claimed) which is much cheaper than the rafting we once did from Shimla (European prices they charged us there). Not much point in asking around everywhere to maybe save a few pennies. We insisted that there be not more than 8 people in a boat (we had seen fuller boats) and that was respected.We were three friends and 4 unknown Indian tourists and it surprised me that none of the others could even swim. Wow, I would not even think of doing that then. We had to jump out of the boat now and then and hang on the ropes and these people actually joined, saved of course by their safety jackets, but still. All three of us could row, the others had never done that before which is quite a discrepancy but it was fun. Still, I think they might organise that a bit better since there are enough customers to select groups according to abilities.The best part for us was when we were flowing in the river, going faster than the boat if they did not row.The plastic bags to contain your valuables are quite small and there is only one for the whole boat. Everything you have in the boat will most definitely get wet.Halfway there is stopover and you can have a snack, tea of drinks.I would certainly not take the shortest tour which is about 11kms because you will get the people in your boat who have no idea of what they are up to. I therefore (and also for the fun) would take the longest trip of 24kms but we were short of time.The drive to the starting spot is quite scenic with nice views on the river. If you go in your own car, you might take the opportunity of also visiting the cave which is nearby, we did not know that.Do not hesitate, do it when you are there in the right season."
Amazing Experience - Better than expectation ,"Went to rishikesh with frnds with white water rafting agenda. Just to mention that we are neither rafting fan in particular and nor a very adventurous group of people but the rafting experience was amazing. Various booking agents are there at laxman jhoola from where u can book the raft, as it is India there is always room for negotiation so bargain away. We paid 400 pp for 16 km rafting which also includes transportation from laxman jhoola to shivpuri which is where rafting starts . Raft generally has a capacity for 10 people if ur group is less they will add other random tourist, luckily the ones that were added to ours were also nice people. The journey towards the shivpuri was the only bad part as the cars are generally very old and w/o Ac and it was really hot .Once at Shivpuri the trainer gives standard instructions about rowing and safety .The instructor we had was very experience and really good at his work and also not too cribby  which such people tend to get due to repetitive trips routines . The 16 km one has decent rapids one of 3.5 grade (4 being the worst). Rowing was fun, even though since all the people were first time rafters every1 was doing it wrong but it was fun.You are allowed to jump in water now and then and enjoy .There is also cliff jumping wherein the raft is banked at a place where there is a protruding cliff around 50 ft high and u can jump in the water .It is great fun if u do it right. There is lot of drama at cliff with people going to edge and coming back.The total time for 16 km was 2.5 hr including 45 mins for cliff jumping thing . The overall experience was great and I plan to make another trip soon and will do the 26 km one ."
Out of the World Experience,"This was one of the most rollicking experiences ever with a complete family or friends or tourists bonanza. The white water rafting is almost a four month extravaganza starting February every year. The hike to the start of the rafting point is about 20 miles up and down slope and must preferably be done by a bicycle, which will warm you up for the event. Next on the agenda is a short learning drill with the guide and wearing the safety jackets/ helmets. And then, off we go in a dinghy down the hill negotiating the most dangerous and sometimes easier rocky water obstacles. There are spots in between where you just jump into the water for a swim in almost stationary water tied up with the dinghies with safety ropes. After negotiating the tough waters you reach the finish point at Rishikesh in the midst of the most spiritual spirits around you with hymns and incantations reverberating from temples. An amazing experience of trekking and rafting and a must visit on any tour lover. And when you are not rafting, join in for some soul soothing yoga and meditation at your place of stay - we stayed at ""Rishikesh Sadan"", accompanied by a healthy diet and massage. This should make your stay the most relaxing ever and my recommendation is, please stay for a week at least. Have a great time."
"Aloha Beach Resort, Beach No.1","This was recommended by Sanjay Saini, Escapade Adventures. It was a huge disappointment, as the camp was sub-standard. There was barbecue included in the package, but we were offered only peanuts and papad. The toilets were FILTHY, stinking and unusable. The food was just average. The overall experience was SAD!!!! The good parts, however, was the staff was courteous and rafting was fun!"
Do the 26KM rafting,"Amazing! Awesome!!! Words just can't describe the experience... One piece of advice is to do the 26 KM rafting rather than the 18 KM one. Please note; if you are a couple or a small group 2-3 people then please book the raft a day before and ensure that you are not a part of a larger group (like 6-8 people), otherwise you may not get to row the raft which is an experience in itself."
Adrenaline Rush,"River Rafting in Rishikesh is an amazing experience, especially for beginners. It accelerates adrenaline rush and offers a phenomenal experience."
good for starters,it was sheer fun and must do if you have not tried it.it is there for everybody with budged to suit all the pockets.but dipping in the flowing ganga with chilled water and hot day is exhilarating to say the least.we did with aquaterra team from shivpuri and down for 24 kms.there is another option to do from higher up at kaudiyal to shivpuri. must do for all.
Our Stay at Atali,The River rafting was great! Also the hikes and the warm air temperature made it very pleasant. the Food was just amazing we all ate much more than we thought and enjoyed the amazing nature all around us.
adrenaline pumping...,"When in rishikesh, be sure to do the ganga river rafting. This is 23 km stretch full of adrenaline and heart pounding fun. This can be best experienced first hand rather reading through a review."
23 kms of exhilaration,"cool!!!!would have liked to remember the names of the various rapids along the way..but whatever..we had tonnes of fun on our little raft!our leader once fell down splat on water,but he managed to hold on to dear life!had it been one of us,it could have been dangerous....but it was fun nevertheless!"
Rafting and Fun,"Rishikesh is one of the best place to have fun with your family, friends and loved once, the water of rishikesh is quite chilled out which boost up our energy, and boating"
RAFTING THRILLS,"The guided rafting in ganges was great fun. Only thing, we need to ensure is not to venture at first instance, rafting from shivpuri starting point. The family with little grownup kids shall enjoy rafting well, which is six km distances with 6 -7 rapids.one must not forget that, need to hire experienced guide, as the rapids are sometimes threatening.however, the teen aged kids and adults in a raft , we have really enjoyed. it was great fun"
really happening,it is really good place to visit and loved a lot with my friends we stayed in camp and really loved that place
