Visit during rainy season only,This place is situated on the way to Lion point. To enjoy the beauty of this place you must visit only during rainy season. Bhusi dam overflows during rains and forms sort of water fall. You need to park your vehicle on roadside and walk through narrow lane of road side dhabas and small souvenirs shop through uneven stones. Be careful while walking . 10-15 walk through water and mud will take you to Bhusi dam. Sit for some time with your feet dipped in water and enjoy. you may like to carry extra clothes in case you get wet. Avoid visit to this place other then rainy season else you will not be able to appreciate  this place. It is l;located just on the road. During heavy rains water overflows and people from all nearby places visit this place making it huge crowd.
Bhushi Lonavala dam,Bhushi dam is located in Lonavala. To reach bhushi dam you can easily get taxis or autorickshaw from Lonavala station. Best time to go to bhushi dam is monsoon season.
Bhusi Dam,The best time to visit in Monsoon season you will love the rains.When we visited the dam was not full of water otherwise very pleasant. you can spend 1-2 hours
Must visit beauty in Monsoons,"The Bhushi Dam, way towards it was not less than a trek – full of water logging, mud and uneven stones. But then, after such trek what comes before eyes is so worth it, defines it’s beauty in its own way. Bhushi Dam overflows in the monsoon season and it forms a waterfall, in which crowd of people enjoy themselves. The view was awesome, water was crystal clear and it looked like an open water park for tourists. This beauty was not even in my any of the thoughts but with the view, it completely intoxicated me with cheerfulness and joy. Your mind rejuvenates and it’s hard to believe that a place so close to nature exists so near to Mumbai."
Not the right time to visit in Jan,It’s closed. There is water in the lake but cannot go in.. its dirty.. Avoid and probably come in rainy season.
Dam without water,The time of our visit was during warm weather. The background view of the mountains could be seen in layers. The sight was very beautiful!
Should be visited in Rainy season,"Visit is useful if visited in Rainy season, parking charges are too high Rs. 100 for four wheelers. This place is over hyped"
Just a dam,I can imagine this would be quite a site in monsoon season with flowing water racing down the rock face (brings a crowd) but in dry season it was nothing special.
overcrowded,"overcrowded place .. most crowd in rainy season , you cant enjoy with your family as there are so many drunken groups of ppl aslo hectic traffic on saturday sundays"
It was nys experience ,Good place to visit ...........it's best picnic spot or we can say this place must visited by couple s.....tnku
Monsoon Paradise In Lonavala. Most Crowed Puller Spot Of Lonavala.,"I had visited this in 2002 in Monsoon season during a peak time. Tooooo crowded.Now I visited on 9th Nov 2019. Negligible crowd. You can see from the photos attached. Same photo if seen in monsoon will make one feel OMG. It is a very average place but it is a paradise for monsoon season lovers especially families with little kids.Those who love to get wet in rain, under water fall, as well as overflowing water from dam, this is the place that provides it all. That's why during monsoon this is the place in Lonavala that attracts enormous crowd. This spot is open through out the day time with free entry. Paid parking is available. Cars are also parked on the sides of the road. We parked on one side of road. Road is narrow.This place is most famous in Lonavala & located at 6 km from Kumar Resort junction in Lonavala on old Pune Mumbai road. It is on the road to Tiger Point another famous & crowd puller spot of Lonavala.Restaurants & food snacks center are available in plenty. Change rooms are there free as well as paid.This place only to be visited during monsoon season with towels & extra clothing."
"Small, congested place.  Dirty. Please don't go there",It's a small. Congested place.  Dirty.  Don't go. Parking is costly.  Food and water costly. No local transportation available.
Outing,Wonderful place where you can enjoy the water flow through the steps and enjoy a corn and deep fried food....
Over Rated,"Bhushi Dam is worth going only if it is raining heavily, else there is nothing much to do,it is on the way to Tiger point"
Nice place to hangout with friends,"From Mumbai, the place is almost an hour drive away.. the view of the journey was so beautiful that we knew we were heading towards a nice place. Bhushi dam is near to lonavala which is one of the famous tourist spots of Mumbai"
August Visit,"Bhushi Dam is Busy, I have been to Bhushi Dam on 17th August this year with my friends and their family, we hired a Tempo Traveller from Pune. The parking cost of Tempo Traveller near Bhushi Dam is Rs. 500, It is the expensive dude.The Bhushi dam was filled with people, there is no place to set foot, it was so crowdy that day. It was Saturday so I thought its crowdy.The water was full, so we guys enjoyed a lot, we had clicked too many pics, which are awesome. Love to be there again"
Only visit in rainy season,Worth going only in rainy season. Be careful with the water flow. Many places to eat around and park vehicle. Can visit during rainy season.
Nice,It's good place to visit in rainy season. There is not proper way for climbing till the destination. View from the apex can't be expressed in words. The passionate nature lover will like this place for sure!
A must visit place in Lonavla,"Had been to this masonry dam in Lonavla a long back ago. This dam is located on the Indrayani river.This dam is a popular tourist attraction. It attracts a lot of tourists during the monsoon season. This dam has some shops and eateries on it's sides. There are stone steps were tourists can sit and enjoy the water flow. Had enjoyed the cool water flow falling on my back as a child. This dam is an ideal place for families, couples as well as friends. It is a must visit and should not be missed while in Lonavla."
Don’t miss Bhushi Dam if you are in Lonavala,Relaxing and refreshing water flow which will make your day . You can spend quality time and will have some memorable moments
One of the major attractions of Lonavala,People usually come here to take shower. You will find many restaurants over there and almost all of them provide changing rooms(Charges extra approx. INR 20) where you can keep your belongings.
Worth Visiting ,Bhushi Dam is worth visiting simply because of the natural surroundings. Any tourist in Lonavala should consider visiting same.
More fuss nothing much,This place is hugely overrated. Always crowded in monsoon season. Surrounding is nit clean and it will be difficult to get vehicles parking. Have limited parking place and road side parking cause always a huge jams. When the dam overflows it will be a huge crowd gathers there so it will be total mash and surrounded with many make shifts stalls and hawkersWe even didn’t get down from car and moved ahead to some less crowded place towards lions point
Worth a visit.,"We enjoyed it. You will have to pass through knee deep water to reach there. There you can view dam , and sit on steps where water flows gently. Get ready to drench in water , and so  dress appropriately. Better to wear slippers and have umbrella in rainy season. Corn/Hot Vadapanv were delicious. Area is bit slippery. Overall, worth a visit."
A Natural water park,The dam water flowing down in steps giving it a Natural Water park look. Since it is free there are numerous people. The way towards the dam is through 2 or 3 muddy puddles.
Interesting activity ,This is a fun activity involving some climbing and some more water fun. They have made few steps on which the dam water overflows especially during monsoons. It is highly recommended for every Lonavala visitor . Be careful as water can be dangerous if not respected. On Fridays and weekends it will become heavily crowded like the day I visited (you can observe in photos.Be careful and all the best
Bhushi Dam in Lonavala,"Had ridden my Royal Enfield ""Bullet Standard 350"" motorcycle  all the way from Mumbai to Lonavala  a distance of 90 Kms .Bhushi Dam is a must visit locale in Lonavala during the monsoon season as also the hill station of Lonavala.This Dam was  built in the late 1860's on the Indrayani river  by the British  for the purpose of water supply to the steam engines of the ""Great Indian Peninsular railway"".The lake formed by this dam overflows over a series of steps during peak monsoon  and is a major tourist attraction .The lake created by Bhushi Dam is also used for power generation by the ""Tata Power Co Ltd"".There is a parking area near the food stalls in walking distance from the steps of the Dam."
"Overcrowded, avoid going on weekend",I have seen many hill stations but I have never seen hill station like this one. It was overcrowded hill station. Avoid going to this place on weekend. Infact I am not sure about weekdays also. For reaching there you would have to cross traffic jam and even after reaching there you will get no place to move properly. We were pushed by crowd so many times that we decided to return back from half way. We didn’t even reached the end point where the actual dam was located. There are shops on starting where you can have quick bite. Some small shops are also there from where we bought raincoat.
Bhushan dam,"It's a fantastic experience getting wet in the rains at the flowing waters of bhushi dam,the atmosphere is awesome .....the best time to visit is July and mid August when it's raining"
Enjoyed the view!,First attraction in season of monsoons. Nice view with safety maintained by local police. Even you will find chywala within watery area.
Worst place to visit,Overcrowded..the path to dam is slippery and all wet. You should go lion's and tigers point instead. They are too beautiful.I dont know why this bhushi dam place is so popular but its definitely below expectation.
Chill out,A very nice place to enjoy with friends and Family especially in monsoon. This place is good for relaxation. If u want to be fresh and came out from ur daliy life just hav some days in lonavla
Visit to Lonavala Bhushi Dam,A very famous spot in Lonavala is Bhushi dam. During rainy season the dam is full of water and people just enjoy it. But when we visited we were less fortunate as it was just the start of rainy season and there was hardly any water in the dam. The perfect season to visit this place would be a few weeks after the start of rainy season. There are enough food stalls around the place and also parking space. However the parking is paid parking. There is no entry fees for this place. If there are elderly people with you then it is advisable for them to stay back as there is lot of ground to cover to reach the top.
Nice views of the water in Rains,This is a place with nice views of the lake & adjoining landscape during the monsoon time.There was very little water when we visited this time and hence not much to speak about. July to Sept will be a good time to make a visit
Worth visiting in monsoon only,This was bit of a letdown as there wasn’t much of water when weVisited.The place usually comes alive during the monsoon rainy season when there is lush green vegetation and plenty of water. Will return during the rains only
Bhushi Dam,Hardly any water Trash all over the place Very unhygienic food stalls Terrible experience will not go there again
No more worthy to visit,Its not worth visiting because many people sit there and drink . Not advisable to visit with family and friends
Beautiful in monsoons ,So this place had been frequented by me during my college days. Bhushi Dam is a very popular tourist spot and is flooded with ppl during monsoon when it is the best time to visit. However since last few years I've stopped going here due to the unwanted crowd. But if u like sitting in waters and having fun definitely a place worth visiting on weekdays to avoid crowds.
Overcrowded People ,"Best time to visit is Rainy season but not a good place to enjoy as there are to many crowds. Its good place to go with family with small kids. But, if you are adults, on your way to lions point  there are hidden water falls that's amazing place to be."
Excellent Dam but visit in rainy season,"This dam, and its view is amazing, a must place to visit in Lonavala but only in rains. During rains you will see water overflowing from dam and coming to the steps, which looks great. Kids will have fun here."
Simple dam,A simple dam to visit.Water was less when we visited.Slight hike of about 40 steps to reach the dam.Nice place for photography.
Nice dam ,"Not really much to do here except for drive up to the dam during monsoons, park your card at the side of the road and enjoy street food and the gushing water"
its good only in monsoon season,visit lonavla only in monsoon when its raining almost everyday.Never visit the city in any other season as it is a waste of time and money.
A place only for monsoon,"Place for monsoon only. This place offers lots in monsoon, but i visited it in wrong month. Located in lonavala, it is a place surrounded by nature and offers a small lake that gets over filled in monsoon and offers a place of fund and excitement."
Bhushi dam,"Though visited in the wrong month of the year, yet this place is a mustvisit.Do visit in monsoons, it looks awesm"
Best Monsoon Fun,"Hey guys, this dam is the best to visit during monsoon and winter season. The driveway from Mumbai to Lonavala during rainy season gets very foggy, beautiful and then visiting Bhushi Dam makes it a complete package of fun. Do remember to carry extra pair of clothes..."
We visited in the wrong season ,"Since we went in the winter, there was barely any water let apart the waterfalls. The area is large and becomes very beautiful when the strong falls flow in the rainy season, or at least that’s what we were told by localites there. But we found nothing."
Ok,"There’s is no goos ,walkable approach to reach the dam. There was no water when we visited. It was like a splash. It should look very nice when fully filled up,especially in monsoon. I would not recommend for visit in dry season."
Good place to visit only in Rainy season,The place is good when it is visited in rainy season otherwise the place is too hot and nothing special to see in other seasons
Not at all GOOD in Winters & Summer,"I visited in Jan and all the greenery was gone, waterfalls dried, temperatures was not at all cool like it is in hill stations. To be frank, it felt like March in Jan. All the best pictures available on internet is from mansoon season"
Bhushi Dam,Visit only during mansoon season the parking is quite expensive other time the place is just ok to be visited
Nice place to sit and relax,Nice place to sit and relax. Bit overrated.People shall maintain cleanliness as there are many broken bottles in and around
Okay ,"It is a huge waterbody Near Lonavala, it offers a good opportunity for photography. It is about 5 minutes trek from parking. One would expect better facilities and maintenance. The trek is very rough with no maintenance or cleanliness. If you have time do visit but not a must visit site. There is private parking only and they charge ₹ 100 per vehicle."
Best Experience,"I was visited lonavala,bushi dam with my entire family.There are many points near bushi Dam but i love Bushi Dam. I went to lonavala in rainy season.There are coffee,tea,maggie one of my fav is available or many things to eat. I was on this trip for 4 days and that days are unforgettable. We enjoyed alot after going there."
"Nice place to enjoy Dam Site, take bath & eat","Nice place to enjoy Dam Site, take bath & eat Most famous in Lonavala - easily reachable... but too crowded in season specially in monsoon. But these days lots of young crowd comes in here and do all kind of naughty activity & drink..!!"
Great Place to visit during Monsoons !!,"Very beautiful in rainy season and must go place. However, it is not recommended to go beyond permissible point!!"
Not much to see there,"Its famous, but not much to see on the Dam, and its just a stroll for a change, so visit only if you have lot of spare time only"
Not good experience,Too crowded unruly too. No changing facilities. Stalls around the site make parking difficult and locals rip you off
Good but in monsoon only..,Bhushi dam is average activity. It’s a real treat to go there in monsoons as the atmosphere at this time is fantastic
Average Place,Bhushi Dam is very celebrated place in Lonavala. Its a small dam which overflows in Rainy season. Its a good visit on any Odd Day but heavily crowded on weekends. Plan your visit accordingly.
Must Visit in Mansoon,This is must visit in Mansoon when water falls. People enjoy sitting in water flow for hours. Please avoid if you are having kids with you.
"Dry, nothing much","This place is in Lonavala. A small 100 mts walk from the road, and then a lake , few steps. We visited in November, place had not much water, it was off season. Not recommended to visit post September, since nothing significant to see. It might be fun during monsoon."
Life,Enjoy the real view and feel the over flowing of a Dam which is not their for all other Dams with a cup of coffee or tea and in other hand a sweet 🌽 corn.
Not as expected,"I have read a lot of about bhushi dam and how it is famous for huge college groups during raining season. Even my parents are a huge fan. However, I did not have a good experience. The crowd was not that great."
Amazing place in Lonavala,Please visit this place only in monsoon. The dam is totally based on rain water on the Indrayani river. Thousands of people visit this place to get wet on the stairs where the water overflows thus providing good experience.
Visit only in monsoons,"This place is worht visit only during monsoons. Otherwise, there is not much to see and do at this place."
Monsoon treat,"This Dam is based on rain water on the Indrayani River. It is one place in Lonavala which is bound to cheer you up during the monsoons which is the ideal time to visit the attraction.The overflowing water over the steps of Bhushi Dam and then through the rocky terrain make this place attractive among the people of nearby areas who throng in large numbers on weekends during monsoons. It tends to get so crowded that many individuals find it hard even to get a decent standing spot. Even though swimming is prohibited in the dam due to the inconsistent flow of the water, one can always enjoy on the steps."
Very Crowded,The dam is crowded by people from Mumbai/Pune. Cleanliness is required. Better to avoid during weekends. Eateries are available in the surroundings.
Mesmerizing experience.,Here we go to chilling flowing waters.. Awesome place to relax your legs. Chilled water flowing to good speed will refresh your day. Suggest one who is fond of eating and enjoy scenic view must go here.. natural beauty. worth money to spend.
trek and sight seeing,This place provides sight seeing and trekking.It has a nice dam with water almost every time of year.You can take photographs too.
Bhusi Dam,"We visited Bhusi Dam on the 6th October.Although the Dam was full of water, all the water falls had almost dried up.Every one there said we had come the wrong time.The place is far more beautiful and very heavily crowded during the monsoons.We visited the place the wrong time."
Boring in the non rainy season,You need to hike a bit to reach it. In the non rainy season there is nothing much to do or see.  Street food stalls and unruly visitors litter the area. Perhaps an over flowing dam in the rains would be more fun.
Not good,Not worth visiting. Poorly maintained. No proper path to reach the dam. Was completely different from what was shown in net.
Best in Rainy season,This dam is best to visit during rainy season. It is crowded during rainy season.But the maintenance is not good.
Most Disappointing ! Don't get cheated .,"It is a big fraud , showing pictures of Bhushi Dam with water where people can enjoy themselves . Tourists are unaware and anticipate by seeing photographs . Went today 30/9/2018 . there is no water and u just waste your time. Whoever is managing the place should inform the public that there is nothing to see and do there is no water as well.Drop this from your itinerary and better spend time in hotel if nothing else to do."
Enjoy,"very much enjoy in the rainy season, especially when heavy rains, water flow is great, Snacks are also available."
Just a lake and a dam is built there to stop water,"It is just a small lake with steps to from where over flow of water gushes but that happens only when there is rainfall otherwise there is no point in going to this place. Moreover, the route to this place is small unpaved road which makes reachability for kids or old people difficult. Nothing more to view here. One can spend just 30 mins at this place."
Better Place To Visit in Rainy Season,Visited place on 15 Sep18. It was raining last night so got able to see dam overflow otherwise it would have another scenario.Place was dirty as people us to throw rubbish over there.Dam view was awesome.Trail backside of dam area to see waterfall.Over all good place to visit.Recommended to visit in rainy season only.
Dirty place,The place attracts tourists but the maintenance is poor. so many dirty water pools in the way to dam. The premises is not maintained and is with foul smell. The dam water was oozing out slowly since there was no rains when we went. Recommend not to spend more than 15min. Water fall much better can be felt in Mahabaleshwar trip.
Bhushi Dam: The Tourist Nightmare,"The narrow pathway that leads to bushi dam is having water filled ponds and , dirt and lettering all around. The tourist cheating shops are all over the place. A filthy toilet charges Rs 10 and shops selling rain coats and exorbitant in its prices with poor quality. The food vending restaurants are selling low quality food. Horrible place to visit."
Very famous dam,This dam is very famous and people from Mumbai and surrounding come to this dam during Monsoon just to take the pleasure of nature.. refreshing and nice place..
Place minus the crowd is excellent,"I visited Lonavala with my wife on a public holiday (Wednesday, 15th august 2018). It was a one day trip. We took a train from Mumbai and that was a really good decision as you avoid the traffic and reach in half the time. It was a rainy day. We hired a cab from Lonavala station for the whole day.The best place we visited in the whole day was Bushi dam. Lovely place to spend 2-3 hours sitting on the dam stairs with flowing water. The only issue was, crowd. We had to wait for more than 30 mins to find a spot to stand. If you could minus the crowd from the spot, it would really be amazing. Finding a parking spot was also a bit difficult because it was so crowded. So if you really want to enjoy the place, my suggestion would be visit this place on a weekday."
Excellent place but enjoyable only in monsoon,"Good dam & place in lonavla but no other facilities ( parking, Food etc ). Can enjoy only in monsoon, only when the water flaws down"
Bhushi Dam - Must Visit,"This is a must visit place in lonavala. The climate is good and the nature is at its best. Where ever you see, you see greeneries and water flowing through the foot steps, smiles from tourists everywhere, this is one of the most nice place that we can visit in India."
Amazing Place to Visit in Rainy Season,Had to walk through knee deep waters across sort of 2 mini lakes with rocky bed which get formed during the rainy season. The water flow across the steps of the dam was quite forceful and it was difficult to keep standing amidst the flow.The dam reservoir was full to the brim because of heavy rains and it was a pleasant view at the top of the dam.
Too much Crowd on Holidays,"Only people around... nothing else.. few are eating, few are drunk, some dance, some seat around watching others bathing.. haha.."
What an amazing place for monsoon,"Enjoyed a lot with family during August monsoon season. You should go with shorts , slippers , rain jackets with extra dress to visit as you need to walk in knee length water to reach the main dam place which is filled with crowd and good currant water. lovely place to enjoy with family."
best time to go?,rainy soon is the best time to go. july to september. from mumbai its 2:30 hours and from pune its 1:30
Beautiful place,"We visited here last week , as it was rainy season so this place was beautiful , one can easily spend 3-4 hours at this place , there are small shops with reasonable price that offers Maggie , sweet corn etc, must visit."
Nice but Crowdy place,This is Nice Great View and Water fall force was huge very crowdy place if Crowd reaching too much than cop will be ask to leave now ...place is superb... basically this is Dam but water is spreading everywhere so enjoyable place
BEST IN LONAVALA,"I will rate this place as the best in Lonavala during monsoon season. Its the most demanding and crowdious place I found here. One have to walk about a kilometre from the porking place to reach here. The flow of water from the overflowing Bhushi Dam is the main attraction as it makes a sort of river running through rocks and people sitting all around. There are n number of stalls by local people selling the bhajia, vadapao, maggi, corn, corn chaat, tea etc. I feel it is there main source of earning during peak season.Sometimes there is so much crowd that the local adminstration have to close the roads to this point to manage the over crowding."
Enjoy in rains,"Usually, it gets crowded on weekends, so we visited on weekday and it was still manageable crowd.Changing rooms arent available."
Good place but crowded and avoid during monsoons,Always crowded on weekends. Avoid during monsoons because it becomes slippery and you lose the fun of the scenic beauty and the charm of taking bath in summers. Lots of eating joints and paid parking is availabile.
"Water fun, but safety First..!!","This place is a Unique spot located at the backdrop of bhushi dam wall. Quite popular during monsoons as excess water floods over the dam wall and makes a fun location with water flowing over the steps and giving an amazing experience. But it is not being maintained properly, so its risky compromising safety concerns during heavy rainfalls. Being in limits and not acting oversmart is key to happy & safe enjoyment.Parking might be a bit problem and costly but thats one tough thing to manage here. Also food you will find bit overpriced but thats the only source and season of income for locals and place being such remote one can understand. But its worth to have a hot plate of bhajjiya's/ vadapav with Tea/Coffee or hot bowl of Maggi. Even you can try some local stuff like corn, boiled shenga.Imp TIPS : Try not to go too much in middle, do not forget to carry mobile or wallets/money coverd in plastic and also wear comfortable and tight footwear(As it might get washed away in strong current)"
Awesome but tricky!,"Awesome but tricky place to visit with your friends and family, but only if you get a few things right! Here are a few suggestions from me:Tips:1. Obvious one first - Visit during rainy season when the dam is full and the water overflows through the gates on the stairs2. Be cautious to not visit during heavy rains as the water force is dangerously high and the entry to dam is closed3. Don't visit on a weekend/public holiday as it gets really really crowded and hence not worth the visit4. Visit as early as you can to avoid the crowds even on a weekday5.If visiting with family, be cautious as you would always find irritating drunkards around. Hence, visit early on a weekday!6. Four wheeler parking a few meters away from the dam would cost you Rs 50. Near the dam its Rs 100 per car7. Be ready to ignore the irritating photographers and hawkers who would try selling you stuff even when you don't need them8. Wear a footwear with good grip as the area gets slippery"
Good place,The Bhushi Dam in Lonavala is a nice place to come and spend some quality time with family and friends.
Must visit during monsoons,I loved eating corn while we were in the water. Just be careful about your wallet and mobile because it may get wet. When we visited this place we had to walk some distance in knee deep water. It is definitely a place for people who really enjoy getting wet. There are steps on which you can sit and water just flows around you. Its an amazing place. Of course a bit crowded on weekends. Parking is difficult
Good in monsoon,Hugely visited and one of the most popular tourist spot in monsoon. Beware of revellers and avoid visiting the place on weekends during monnsoon as you may find a huge traffic jam and big chaos near the spot
amazing place to visit in rainy season,if you are looking to rainy picnic this is the place near mumbai n pune. its dam. with hills surrounded by.  you can enjoy the rain plus was coming from dam  by sitting on the steps near the dam. so many people to to enjoy rainy season.
Nt worth it with family,I remember going to this place 20 yrs back when it was less crowded .I don't think it's worth it now especially with family as u get a lot of miscreants & trouble makers thereInstead check out tamhani ghat especially when it's pouring
"Too much Crowd, Shopkeepers Looting People","Bhushi Dam is located in Lonavala is one of the busiest place to visit in Rainy Season, People from Pune and Mumbai usually come here to spend there weekends, I visited here last week, it was cars and bike all over the place, too much crowd, people are here there.Shopkeepers are looting in the name of parking, a simple tea will cost you Rs. 20, Maggie around Rs. 100.Water bottle are also very expensive, no public transport properly so we faced a lot.The place is not very well maintained, it's a beautiful place if maintained can give government a lot."
Not maintained & dirty,This place is flogged by visitors and is ill maintained. There is literring all around and this place is dirty & crowded. On a weekday the experience could be better but avoid weekends.
Water at its best!!,a great place to visit dusring monsoon season. one can enjoy great fall of water great wather and hot maggie. during heavy rains flow of water is very tremondous so be careful about it.
One guy drowned in front of my eyes,"I would request people not to visit and even if you visit...please don't sit on the stairs...people go crazy...and it is officially allowed on the back side of the bushi dam where there is a narrow path to reach a waterfalls from where the water flows into the dam...there are many tea stalls, eateries on the way to the falls also. But there are no signboards, no warning symbols and blockages there...on the way to the waterfalls people need to cross the water flow...there a guy got drowned in front of my eyes...I was so lucky I just crossed...even the locals there who are selling eatables didn't warn us and they were minding their business...Security measures are simply zero...so pls avoid and even if you visit pls don't enter into the water."
A wet experience,"This place seems very popular with Indians. I can to some extent understand why. The place becomes flooded during rain season and people gather to have fun and get wet. Very wet. Sadly like any other tourist spot this place is overwhelmed by small shops that tries to profit and that kind of ruins the experience of a beautiful place and make it look more like some sort of amusement park. And also there are a lot of people, really really a lot of people."
Very much crowded and dirty place,The place is very much crowded and dirty. Further there is nothing special at the place and should be avoided.
Highly exaggerated and commercialized place,"Bhushi dam is located on the way towards Lion's Point (Lonavala). Place is okayish; you can spend max 20 min at this place (that too if you love to get wet on stairs or for few selfies/gp photos). Parking charges are around 100; washrooms and changing rooms are available at 10 Rs and 20 Rs charges. This place mainly attracts Pune and Mumbai crowd ; so naturally you can expect humongous crowd on Saturdays, Sundays and on vacations.Suggestions- First cover Lion's Pt and while returning pay visit to this place. If you are truly looking for amazing place, visit Rajmachi pt and fort."
Overrated place and highly commercialized,We found this place very overrated. Also this place is surrounded by local shops which will charge handsome amount for parking even that is not properly organized. The place itself if very crowdy and dirty.So during monsoon you can visit it once while visiting lonavala as it is one of the famous place.
a day picnic spot,"Must visit place during the monsoon, a day picnic with family and friends can be planned to enjoy this place."
Rainy day delight ,"Parking is Rs. 100/-, Washroom use even for peeing Rs. 10, cloth changing room Rs. 20/- each are additional costs. Place is crowded & has difficult access. You need additional clothes to change & waterproof footwear. It’s also available on rent.Highlight beyond getting wet in flowing water by sitting on steps or below water flowing from little height is hot corn, boiled peanuts & Vada Pav, a Maharashtrian delicacy.The GREAT FUN was in having TANDOORI CHAI, at tea vendor outside who serve tea boiled in metal drum filled with coal & blowing coal with air blower, putting tea to freely flow in hot clay pot, then serving in a plastic cup. China pottery & porcelain cups, pots, mugs etc. are available for sale & are beautiful, reasonably priced stuff. Overall a great experience.DAM CLOSES FOR VISITORS BY 6 pm so plan accordingly."
Nice place to enjoy,One of the best tourist spot of Lonavala. Best time to visit is August to September since the waterfall can be enjoyed more.
Extremely crowded and dirty,"The place was extremely crowded with so many people coming and parking their cars  on the sides of the road and just crowding the place. Some of them were also littering garbage and there was no security to stop them either. Though the water was clean, but all this crowd and litter really put me off from coming back again."
Wonderful Spot in the Heart of Mountains,One of the best spot of Lonavala. It's surrounded by mountain. One of the very old dam.its a picnic spot.
Exhorbitant Peking fees,Worthless place to visit! They charge 50-100 rupees for parking a 4 wheeler car and that’s all in the pockets of locals! Overcharged for a bottle of mineral water. Commercialised to extents! Avoid at any cost. Also saw huge fat uncles removing their clothes and dancing in open! Not recommended for families.
Avoidable,"The area was dry and it was a tough climb to the dam walls, nothing worth seeing and give it a skip if possible."
Not worth ,It's totally insecure..not worth to go with young children and family..specially in evening hours..Drunkards roam around creating ruckus..no one to control them..though this time around it was not the case..May be it was May..and that might b the reason..!!!
Awesome Place to relax,Most amazing and delightful place to visit and relax. It is near to lonavala may ask for the directions from any localite.
Nice Tourist spot,Not a tourist spot which I would recommend during any other season other than monsoon. It's totally an unattractive place in other seasons .
Nothing more than a dustbin,This once upon a time beautiful place has been reduced to nothing more than a trash bin - thanks to the civic sense of people who visit the place as well as lack of steps on part of administration. There is litter all around and the entire area is encroached by shops. Unless you haven't seen anything better in you life you wouldn't want to waste your time and energy for this piece of crap.
What an experience!,Ended up getting wet with my two sons Yash and Shiv under the flow of the water at Bushi Dam during the monsoon season last year. We got some professional pictures taken and have Amazing memories of our summer vacation in India. Can't wait to visit Lonavala again!
Not so great.,"It is a waste of time to visit this place in the month of Feb. The best time is in the monsoons, when you can enjoy the water gushing down the stairs."
Water Dam of Lonavala,Water dam of Lanavala but not properly maintained for tourist visit having no proper path to reach and need to walk through broken roads.
Only good in monsoon,"In Jan or during summer, it's absolutely fine if you give a miss to this place. It's totally dry, there are some food joints in the beginning, but it's no fun to be here. During monsoon, this place is full of ppl - sitting on te steps & enjoying the water flow. At that time also I wont prefer to visit it because of too much crowd. However ppl do enjoy it at that time & it's almost on everyone's list then. So in monsoon & may be a few months after that you can visit it. No point in visiting it during winter or summer"
Just ok-go only in monsoon,"We travelled in jan-that about sets the tone, i guess since this is a monsson-only destination..hence we were v much disappointed..we parked the car at the designated spot (fee- rs 100-there are a few parking spots and i think all cost the same)..from there u just walk along to the rock through a narrow rocky path with v less signage..we ended up asking everyone along the way if we are on the right track..once you reach, there are a few stone steps that lead up to a barricaded high-step from where u can see the water in the dam..in monsoon these steps have water flowing through them for which the place acquires its fame..there are some eateries here mostly selling tea, corn, maggi etc. (didnt sample them so cant say about it)..place was mostly clean with less people but might get crowded in season..my parents (70+) and son (3 yr) could walk to the place so not much rough (though my son did complain of leg pain in the night)"
Ok,Visited during wrong season. It is a seasonal place. It's like a adventure to reach the spot. Nice spot.
Not outstanding ,To get to the place the walk is not very pleasant. The path has lots of stones and steps. Area is not very clean and walk back is not pleasant.
Seasonal - average place when there is no much water,"Visited this during December and understand from the rainy day pic that the place is totally different. We could walk up the the stairs (through which normally water gushes down), go to the other side, sit on the banks of the water body etc. It was relaxing and green all around. Probably need to be visited when you have enough water to have fun in water."
Family Trip !,"Beautiful dam located close to Lonavala, its a short trekt to reach the dam. The surroundings are lush green and the place is quaint. It would have been fun to do boating over there."
Must visit place during Monsoon,Most amazing experience when I visited this place in rainy season. Nobody should miss this experience in their lifetime. Natural treat. Nice place
Good - if you love crowd,"In monsoon, when lake goes to its overflow limit, it creates a very beautiful scene. But same time, it remains very crowed. - so much, that hard to see water falling. You can see only people standing or seating on the steps."
Average,We went here and it was super crowded. We saw more people than water. otherwise this plac should be fun with friends.
One of the Places of Tourist interest,Bhushi Dam is a masonry dam (masonry – mainly stone and brick;  At times joined with mortar) on the Indrayani River. It is Ideal to visit this Dam during Monsoon. The steps to this dam are slippery and hence advisable to wear footwear with good gripping. We have to walk at least 500 metres away from road side to reach this Dam.We have to be very careful while walking on the steps The surrounding places of this dam not kept clean.Elderly people should be very much careful and should go with Company.
Awesome dam,Bhushi dam is very good dam in lonavala and near city clean and cold water. And superb dam and main road to 200 meter distance
Nothing exciting non-rainy season,Heard lot about lonavala and bhushi dam...though scenic place has nothing except memories of great rainy season. Little tough for elderly to trek.
Short refreshing trip,Must visit once Not too great but once visit is not BadDam is very small so dont compare it with anything
Superb,What an amazing weather I n the month of December.nestled in lonavla this place is a must visit.had a group of 10 and we sure had a blast.for all nature lovers this place is magnet.
Not worth a visit,"Its not worth to visit it. There is nothing there, even the water which usually flows on stairs was closed. You have to go through a rocky and slippery path and what you witness is a lake after a wired fence which you can only see after climbing a rock."
Place good only during Rainy Seasons,"This place is strictly advisible to be visited during rainy season only. There is absolutely no water in odd seasons. Another thing the parking fees are too high in this place, people change 100 bucks just for parking and from there the dam is about a KM away. Anyways there are parking places nearby to the entrance of dam too."
Over-hyped if visiting in off season,You need to visit the place in season (July) when the water flows down from the dam onto stairs. Otherwise there is not much to see here. I went in the month of November and its just a water body with some people fishing in it.Parking is available on paid basis (Rs. 50 - 100 for a car) based on supply and demand.There are a few shops for games and eating but the place is pretty much empty and nothing much to do if you are not going in monsoon season.
A Place of Relaxing,"The roads are full of fog, so be careful while driving, beware of monkeys, you get good snacks like corn, vada pav etc The dam was clean since we visited in Nov the crowd was less."
Arduous Trek,"its an arduous trek  more like an obstacle race to get to the dam.Rocky terrain, small puddles of water . a fairly steep gradient, path littered with refuse. not for city tourist wearing city shoes. Hard effort worth only in the rainy season when the waters are vibrant and full of life. In November the scene was sombre and placid. you can only imagine.Difficult and ill advised for ladies. however if you do complete the uphill trek you can have a good view. wide expanse though quite placid, You need to visit during the rains to see the gushing and the vibrant waters. Good view definitely a tourist attraction if only the local authorities wake up to the idea and make the trek more do able."
Loved the concept,Visit during rainy season. It's great if you love playing in water... Try and reach the dam early around 930am. The crowd is less during early hours which would allow uninterrupted fun.There is a waterfall as well for which you have to climb the dam stairs to the top and then follow the track beyond. The path which goes from the parking ground is not advisable. This is because there is a lot of glass litter there and sharp fragments. If you are wearing footwear with thin sole then it can easily penetrate the  material. Rest the choice is yours.There's Sunil's wax museum nearby and it's worth visiting.
Superb view,Need to walk a bit to reach this place. There's a kind of check dam for overflow which is quite unique.
Place to visit near lonavala,"Its a wooden dam constructed on a Bhushi lake. The dam views are pleasant to watch out for. Reaching to the dam gives you feel of little bit tracking. But after reaching at destination its worthy. The stepped spillway is the attraction of the dam. I have visited just after monsoon and still it was humid and sometimes rainy at lonavala. So the atmosphere was pleasant for the visit. Rather than other lakes at Lonavala, visiting  this lake is worthy."
Fun with Nature,Crowded place in the monsoon and dirty also. enjoy a lot in waterfalls. Nice place to visit. Extremely crowded with so many people coming and parking their cars on the sides of the road and just crowding the place.
Extremely crowded and dirty,"The place was extremely crowded with so many people coming and parking their cars on the sides of the road and just crowding the place. Some of them were also littering garbage and there was no security to stop them either. Though the water was a good respite from the heat, but all this crown and litter really put me off from coming back again."
BEST ONLY IN MANSOON,Good mansoon activity due to flowing waterfalls.But can be seen in winter.require good physical activity.Overcrowed area.take care from skidding.
For fun,There I had visited 6 to 7 months ago with my friends. There we had enjoyed a lot in waterfalls. We clicked many pictures. Nice place to visit. Thank you
Full of Water in Aug,Visited in October but there is no water overflow so not enjoyed much. Best time to visit Bushi dam is in Aug-Sep.
Lonavala and khandala,"Hi everyone. This blog is my attempt to review the most famous twin hill station on western India, i.e lonavala and khandala . Mahabaleshwar and panchgani are other famous hill station however lonavala and khandala due to it's proximity to Pune and Mumbai is a favourite weekend getaway for people from these cities.Personally if I want to just unwind on a weekend with not so tiring trip, I prefer going to lonavala and khandala as it's just an hour ride from Pune (But I always look for a suitable weather before heading to this twin hill station). Any summer weekend is a tough time to visit them as it's quite hot and dry. Moreover this place is known for clouds and greenery and waterfalls. So best time to visit them is between July and September. Oct and November are also pleasant, however waterfalls start getting dried up and you start feeling the Oct heat.Roads are brilliant , thanks to expressway and you have plenty of eateries on both side.I prefer wada pav (local Maharashtrian snack) and tea on a regular monsoon weekend, however you will find almost everything in the food joints.To visit there are many options according to ones interest. However wax museum, bushi dam, tigers and lions point are not to miss. You will kiss the clouds untill you reach tigers point and the cool breeze will win your heart.Quite good restaurants have come up recently in Lonavla which serve both food and alcohol.To make your weekend even better, one can opt to stay for a night. There are numerous options fitting everyone's budget in twin hills. You can find hotels from 1500-10000 INR per night.Tips: Always choose best weather to visit the twin hills, possibly during monsoon. Never plan during peak summer , unless there is no better option.One day trip is enough to see the twin hill station, though there are good stay options. So one day extra will add up to the fun."
Preffered by Youngsters,"The dam is preferred picnic spot among youngsters. It is very crowded, especially on weekends. Parking space and eating joints are available."
Too crowded,The dam is very famous in the surrounding areas of Mumbai and Pune. It is ideal for water lovers. Ease of access with cheap eating joints makes it preferred picnic spot.
Good tourist spot,"This is situated 6 km away from Lonavala. On holidays and week-ends, there is a huge rush of tourists creating traffic jams."
Wonderful Waterfall,Must visit place in monsoon there. Waterfall view is very amazing and should be careful. Many photographers are there to click good pictures for you. If rain is not much more you should go waterfall behind the Dam.
Difficult to reach tihs place.,Purposely a path was made by locals to lure visitors to use their plastic slipper business. and I didnt find this place interesting or worthy of visit.
"Sprinkles, Stones & Stairs!","Well...friends...we visited Bhushi dam in the month of Sep 2017. The entrance of the dam was nasty! A stagnant water body that was very murky and stinking invited us...:)) Nevertheless, a small walk over those submerged pebbles was fun. It would be difficult for senior citizens to reach the dam. The steps are quite slippery but not dangerous. Friends & family can have amazing fun! Once we climb the steps the dam looks massive & serene. Bracketed by hills & vales, Bhushi dam looks magnificent."
Excellent place,One must visit this place it’s different than u might seen other dam better if u carry cloth to change if u go this place .
Natural water park,My kid just loved this place. ideal to go when it is not very crowded else you will not be able to enjoy fully.
Bushi dam,We need to walk for about 1km and climb few steps to view the bushi dam but it is worth going for it. The water level is till the top and there is a good flow of water. Nice place to visit.
Too much crowdy,"Bhushi dam is full of crowd around. Even though it was heavy raining, people were all around the dam and enjoying. Had a great time with family"
Bhushi Dam,GreaT place to visit... However don't go with any type of formal shoes/boots.. rather travel with a pair of flip flops as you have to wade through ankle level water at times....Very nice location btw slippers are available for rent at the location had a nice time.. water flowing down the stairs is a beautiful sight....
A Definite MIss!,"Heard about Bushy dam for years and when i finally went there it was terrible. Its dirty, crowded, noisy, shops all over, garbage strewn everywhere, picnic-ers yelling and dirtying the place further. What mustve been a beautiful spot once now ruined. Instead see the Pavna or Tungarli lake. Relatively cleaner and less crowded"
Go when it rains heavily.,"The beauty of the bushi dam, is only when it rains heavily. Go in groups and a shower. Most interesting is that you get a free fish massage here."
WATERFALL FOR NATURE LOVERS,DURING rainy season its best to visit. huge waterfall. best location and hilly area. cheap foods and cheap transportation.
Waterfall ,You can enjoy the beauty of nature but its very much crowded with lot of noise and dirt .. Theres nothing extraordinary to see water falling from stairs over the leftover corn.
Dries up after september,"Damm has water only in monsoon . crowd wil b too much in monsoon, with crazy people and open jeeps running for alcohol.Liked the place but crowd was too bothering"
Refreshing and Crowded,"bhushi dam is actually a small waterfall created due to overflowing of a Lake. But its a fun getaway place.Its damn crowded on weekends,Vehicles are not allowed after 2 pm on weekends.Weekends are damn crowded,but weekdays are less crowded.There are many Food Stalls round it where you can savour  Corn,Bhajiyas,Vada Pav, Maggi, Tea.Parking space is available but gets charged upto 100 Rs. at some places and on weekends.Try bargaining on weekdays."
Absolutely crowded-even on weekdays!,"The attraction about this place is that the overflowing water from the Dam is converted into a waterfall sort of a thing for people to enjoy.Hugely popular, this place is always crowded,even when we went on a weekday.Crossing 2 knee deep pathways, we arrive at the dam.Lots of small stalls surround the dam where you can eat and have hot beverages.But i would really suggest to walk beyond the dam.Its surrounded by beautiful mountains and waterfalls and not crowded either!.Have a hot cup of tea and enjoy the views or trek further to reach other waterfalls!"
Excellent getaway ,This place is quite fun in monsoons but do check because sometimes due to heavy rain its closed.but the best thing about it is the surrounding has many waterfalls you can explore.
crazy crowded-not for kids,"This was a neat place to drive by and is very popular with Indians during monsoon.  They sit under the water spilling over the steps on the side of the dam.  But people fall every year and get hurt/killed, so be very careful."
hangout in rainy season,place is good on rainy season as dam is full of water that time and we can enjoy. also there are lots of vendors who serves there food.
Very Good place in Monsoon,"Its a perfect getaway near Pune. During rain its heaven with amazing and spectacular Views. I have visited this place twice during my Trip to Pune. The worst thing of this place is Cleanness of this place. People throw their garbage, plastic, plates etc anywhere without thinking and no body cares.."
What an experience!!,"Ideal time to visit this place is during the monsoon. You reach this place after crossing 2 small knee-deep water patches.  The site is breath-taking!! Keep a change of clothes in hand or nearby.  You will definitely need it when you sit in the water flowing through the steps, coming from the Dam.  The noise of the water is always above the noise of the people enjoying around!  From the top of the steps, you can see the majestic dam. A definite inclusion in the trip to Khandala/Lonavala!!"
Unique set up of dam.... nice place,"This place is nice and we will enjoy. Visit once as this kind of water flow set up is rare. But people turned it into a food junction. Lots of food stalls near this water flow and people are throwing all the stuff there itself making water ugly. All vendors are selling corn, vada pav there itself. Photographers are there who will take an instant photo for 50rs. Nice place but need a lot of maintenance and restrictions should be implemented to maintain the hygiene."
Visit if you have time,"Visit this place only if you have extra time to space. The place is not very clean, lots of plastic packets and other garbage scattered on the way to the dam."
"A small, stepped water fall.","A small, stepped water fall.The Bhushi dam is a small dam with water flowing down a series of steps as seen in the steps.There maybe around 15-20 steps.It does get crowded and people throw plastics and other things in the water stream.It is a nice experience. Please do visit once.And, definitely, get wetAlso, do not litter."
Bhushi Dam outing made my day!,"This place was awesome.. I don't have any words to express the beauty of this place...Its like people were sitting in between the waterfall..water is also so clean and cold...In between speedy water local people are selling sweet corn & chana..That is so funny actually....Overall this was the best place to hangout with your friends...So refreshing it is, will relax your mind.."
Water bath in different way,Very good place to get wet...steps.slops and plain terrain to get wet..to eat hot snacks in that environment is a bonus..
"Okay but very overrated, crowded and bit dirty","Okay but very overrated, crowded and bit dirty. It's like water falls off from dam via staircase. People have to settle at stairs to enjoy water. During rainy days it's highly crowded. Olderly people will feel it's not worth the fun or enjoyment"
Very gd place,Must watch place in lonavla . Water comes in high speed from a lake which is in high speed and gives a lot of fun. I
Captures your heart with the beauty,"It was a heavy rainy day. We were all soked in rain water on our way to Lonavala. But, upon reaching the destination, we had an amazing feeling. The picturesque beauty of water there was a treat to the eyes."
Mesmerizing waters,To reach the mesmerizing outlet of the Bhushi Dam one has to cross three water points where one has to remove ones costly shoes and chapels.The happy thing is one can get used grippe plastic chapels for Rs20/- A lot of people take bath in that overflowing water as if in a fall. The difference is here you have to lie flat on the flowing water. overall one gets a hilarious experience.
Nice picnic spot,advisable to come during monsoon time.No boating or water sports carried outake with step waterfall I have ever seen
Best place to unwind in Lonavla,"You will believe only once you reach there.  Approaching the main spot is disheartening but once you are there, you forget everything.  Be sure it has been raining prior to you reach there, so that the lake overflows."
a bad place,we can't barely stand on the flowing water.Too risky to go.Also one of the travelers got injured badly on the lip got a cut.Police was standing there on the top.A disgusting place.
Must visit place,"Can get a close view of the dam.  When water overflow through the check dam/steps, you can bath too.  As Lonavala is closer to Mumbai, at weekends and holidays there will be huge crowd.  Please avoid during weekends and holidays if you want to enjoy a quiet tour.Otherwise, the spirit of Mumbai is very much visible in this place .Despite so many young girls and women visit this place for a bath, no one really bothers them or passing any comments.  They just enjoy themselves with the surrounding.  A quality other tourist places in India should learn.However, it is sad to see this place is littered with plastics and plates from the nearby shop.Do not indulge in steamed corn as the shopkeepers use the same water running where people walk on it, which I have seen during my visit.Go with bathing gear and enjoy the pure rain water."
Must visit place in Lonavala - different experience of a dam,This is a must see place in Lonavala. Best time is monsoon Jun-Aug.It is 5 kms from the center of the city.A 10 minute walk would take you to the steps of the dam.Sitting on the steps of the dam and enjoying the chillness of the water running through your back is an enjoyable and different experience of a dam.It is slippery though need to tread carefully.Parking place is very difficult. They charge Rs.100 for a car.
"A whole day enjoyment, suitable for family.","We had planned a 24 hrs trip to lonavala and hence we had many plans on the cards to be accomplished in a very short period. It was Sunday when we visited the dam. A localite suggested to visit the dam early morning to enjoy at the fullest. We reached there by 10 am and by the time the area was full. We managed to get a place near a stall and enjoyed there for around 2 hrs. Had we been to the dam, we could had enjoyed more.Note: if you are planning a Sunday trip, beware that the road to bhushi dam closes after 11 am due to traffic congestion."
Dam with full water,This was the one of places where you can find nature at best the lake or dam..was between mountains.... really amazing to see this place ...
Awesome place to visit in the rainy season,We were a group of 20 + people visiting Bhushi Dam. We visited Bhushi Dam during the start of the rainy season. It was awesome during the rains. Need to very careful also. It is very slippery
Highly risky when its raining heavily,"Yes this place is really very scenic, peaceful and beautiful in monsoon. I too visited here in monsoon. But, I would suggest people to check before they visit this place. It is full of traffic on the way to this dam. It takes 60-90 minutes to drive to this location because of heavy traffic. Plus it is closed when it rains heavily. Visit in weekdays and then you can surely enjoy the peaceful climate there."
Nice place & Very near to town,Bhushi dam is not very far from lonavala town.there is the wide & open space coming out from the town and good view also.
Thrilling experience,It is a beautiful place in monsoon and a very thrilling one too.make sure to carry your change of clothes as u will get very wet.avoid carrying mobiles and cash there .lockers are available through vsome operators to keep stuff.washroom facility only in hotel opposite the bhushi dam.food in that hotel expensive but the soup we ordered was too delicious.a beer shop nearby for Bacchus lovers
Common place to wnjpy,"When we went there, it was raining badly, the path was trodden and had water spillage through the dam. It is highly overcrowded which is quite disappointing. All the refreshment areas remained overfilled with people and there was no control over the population except at the Highest point where flow was quite high."
Very crowded ,"Very crowded and very commercialised. Not clean. Not recommended, if you need a calm place to relax this is not the right choice"
Nice place to visit,bhushi dam is one of the attraction in Lonavala .it is good to see in rainy season only . if you are going in damin rainy season you should carry umbrella and rain coat .also go with chaapals easy to walk in water .one neagtive thing in bhushi dam is there is no near by toilets so problemalso parking fees is very high and nearly 100 rupees per car or 4 Wheeler .Govt should improve the basic conditions of dam spacially in toilets and roads condition
Excellent when water over flows,"Must visit to visitors during monsoon period especially in Late July, August and September. Flowing water over the steps is the real beauty of the dam. Never miss an opportunity to visit."
Best experience of life,One of the best place to visit in rainy days.I had an best experience last year on the same day and the trip was awesome....Go on top not the bhushi dam where you can find the falls....Be careful when moving to the top as the water movement is steep...Personal belongings are to be taken care....Be careful while moving to the top as the safety is very much important.
Fun in water and Masti of Lonavala,"Bhushi dam is one of the most favorable place to visit and it's the place where everyone goes if he comes to lonavala. The best time to visit Bhushi dam is in monsoon. If you are waterfall lover, you must visit this place."
Great place poorly managed ,My boyfriend suggested to go to this place as he had visited this in his last trip. Obviously since it was a long weekend it was too crowded.Thanks to Indians like us the place was full of plastic bags.. leftover food packs etcAlso the food items etc sold over there were overpricedGood place but very poorly managed
Awesome Experience with friendz..,Near by lonavala about 6 km..Can reach by Bus or Rickshaw..Don't miss natural waterfall beside Bhushidam..
"Water, fall & view ...","During monsoon, enjoy the water flow from the dam. U may walk till the water fall in the jungle. Romantic place to be with your spouce / loved ones."
"Crowded, not so good",Place is good But in monsoon it become overcrowded with visitors. There are so many places for parking so you get easily but Traffic jam will spoil your trip..Many of groups drunk. So if you are planning to go with family you will feel uncomfortable there. It's very dirty also because people through all there garbage there only. Even changing rooms also not clean.
Awesome,"When water overflows from the Dam then its all Fun. Sit on stairs and enjoy the water flow. Try to hike the dam, its fun"
Go only in rains when dam is full,This place is not for senior citizen as you have to walk through rough patch for 5-10 mins.. I went in May hence the dam was almost dry.. Not worth a visit therefore
"TOURIST EXTORTION, HARASSMENT.","First of all we parked on the road for just 10 mins near bhushi dam and that also not to go to the dam but to buy artistic utensils.The road was far away from the parking area. When we came back two people asked us for money. We told them we will pay ₹100 but we need the receipt that we paid. First the concerned person started telling us ""abi Ye parking just 2 days pehle start hua h"" and then we told him we need the receipt we won't pay otherwise. Then he started shouting at us. So I started recording the episode because obviously if any police case happens then we need the evidence on how we were treated. He got so offended that I started recording and he got hyper then.He started foul mouthing and unnecessary creating a scene but we were very adamant that unless we a get a receipt we won't pay.Then from somewhere he went and brought a receipt. I think it was from bhushi dam receipt . Now the concern here is if a tourist is paying 20,000 to go to Lonavala for just 1 day... then paying ₹100 is not a big deal.Locals like these are responsible for spoiling tourism and 20,000 may seem a very less amount. Right now but imagine how many 20 thousands they are losing by their reckless talking. Please do not pay unless you get the receipt. And yes they don't have any name tags or any identity cards. They taking any amount for parking from the tourists because some one said it's ₹50 and then another man came and told us ₹100. Also he had no manners at all. I have the video and I will make sure I upload it on YouTube."
Natural beauty but commercialized ,It took us 3hrs to reach here as we forgot it was d long weekend for eid. The roads leading to d dam were packed in every manner and not even a millimeter of space to walk. Finally tho when we reached here dam was overflowing and what a view it was. Dangerous no lifeguard go at your own risk. Avoid buy food n beverages as they're thrice d rate you would pay at an average udipi. Avoid going on weekends/ public holidays as you would end up seeing entire Pune n Mumbai here :P
Bhusi dam,Bhusi dam is very exiting place in lonavala.dam is like overflow during rain. We have spent nearabout one hourinthis place.
Awesome experience ,"When its monsoon, we all want to get wet in the rains. But what is much more better than that is to get soaking wet at Bushi Dam.Bushi Dam is a must visit, if you are in mumbai or in or anywhere near lonavala during monsoons.When the dam fills up, it starts overflowing from the steps that lead up to the dam. Its almost like a waterfall, but the exciting part is that you can enjoy while you sit on the stairs there, eating the freshly roasted 🌽 For group members who are not intending on getting wet, there are food stalls with sheds besides the dam as well, where they can have a seat and get jealous while looking at you enjoy 😊 If you don't have appropriate footwears, at the entry point, there are counters where you can safely keep your costly footwear and get (used) slippers on rent for just ₹30 !I went there with my whole family and had as much fun as I would have had in a waterpark, but this fun was absolutely free. Yes, there are no tickets or any charges for you to enjoy the place. You just need to pay for parking."
Not so good place to visit,"Too much crowded and unhygenic place, not safer for families, location is good, easy access to the place, good for weekend picnic."
Don't go,"The trek to this place is painful with kids - the tourism department has not even created some kind of paved walkway to the dam - there are jutting stones all over the path that will hurt your feet.The actual steps from where the water flows down are not very large so on holidays , it is so crowded and badly managed that it is impossible to make your way through the crowd to the steps.We could not locate any government authorised parking and locals are busy fleecing the tourists through overpriced parking.There is trash all over as well. Not worth the pain going to this place - avoid."
Nothing to see,We a group of 3 families visited this spot in the Mid June 2017. The kids with us were very excited to visit here but after passing on foot a long and rocky passage of about 1 km we found that the water in the swimming pool of the hotel was much more than that in the River/Dam. Although the locals told us that this is beginning of the rainy season and thus the water level is extremely low and by the mid July it raises very high. But i was disappointed by my visit there.
right place to visit,"it is biggest attraction point for visiting lonavala.real thrill,joy ,real nature ,it is just awsome."
Overcrowded place,Place is really nice..But in monsoon it become overcrowded with visitors..  parking problem. Traffic jam..Many of groups drunk. As someone with family May feel uncomfortable..If ur with family try different location may be 10 km.ahead than bhushi dam..
Awesome place,Its a place where one can truly enjoy.Best time to visit is in the rainy season .We thoroughly enjoyed the tattoo session . The tattoo guys were enthusiastic and sporty with great skills .It was One of our most memorable visits .
Good place,Its good place but its was very hot during march and even water was at very low level. We couldn't be able to see real view.
Never plan to go in summers,"Its a fun place to go in monsoon. Everybody enjoy flowing water with makkas as I learned in my last visit but this time when We went in month of May, Nothing was there. All dried up, so no point going there before rains."
Dry in May,With relatives from outside.20 rupees for car parking.As it was hot around 11.00 my relative walked up through the rough walk up to the dam with very little water.We sat in the shack restaurant.He came back soon disappointed.The fact is it is good only during or for some time after the rains in July-August .
Dry Dam😢,Not a perfect place to visit in summer.Can be enjoyed during raining season only.Better to skip this place 😊
Nice hang out place,its one of the attraction point where nobody you miss going here as the weather gets cozy when you are with your better half or GF try going inside water and have fun n while coming back try stopping by the dominos and have nice lunch or dinner as it is in a complex kind of a place where you will find several other options too.
When you want to get wet,"When you want to get wet come to Bhushi Dam. This place is near to lonawala and on the way to aambay valley road, There you can park your vehicle very easily many paid parking place are there many shops and restaurants also there any time you can visit but the rainy season is the best time for Bhushi Dam."
No Water,"We dont know that there is no water in this dam, but while you are going some lake at least a minimum water will be available, and nothins was there , waste of time for us."
No water,Went on wrong time nonwatwr atvall.on thabdamWaste of money for the carOk to visitin rainy season only
Only winter visits are recomeneded,Winter is only season water is available in the lake. In the summers there won't be water at this Dam so not recomeneded for a visit in the summer.
Seasonal.. Good place during monsoon only,"This place will definitely cheer you up during monsoon.While enjoying the rainfall, you can find some space on the steps to sit and enjoy.These steps are meant to get your drenched as the dam water flows downwards from the 1st step which is actually very enjoyable. But during off season, you won't find anything to do at this place. Dry, Boring and Hot is what you would feel there at any time without monsoon"
Good place to enjoy in lonwala,Water is flowing from steps. You can sit on steps it is very enjoyful. If you go there plese bring sandals. This is one of most beautiful places in lonwala. If you want to capture instant photograph you can get it. There are some people capturing pictures and they give us instant photographs for 60 rupee.
A very good place,A very good place in rainy season. Its not so far from pune we can go by bus train or own car. A very good nature and climate.
An average one during off-monsoon periods.....,"Nothing big to say. During our visit all we could see was the dry dam. The passage leading to the dam also was not good. The guide took us through some interior areas where locals were residing. The place was stinking with garbage thrown every where. We were really disappointed when we reached the dam as there was little water left and you cannot see the flowing water as seen in pics. Those are taken during monsoon times and if you plan to visit, plan it during monsoon else it's  not even worth a visit."
Good place but only when its raining,Place seems excellent but we went in February month so it was mostly hot. Water was cold and you feel great when you just sit there and talk to your friends. It's a must visit place in rainy season
nice place,nice place in rainy season. in rainy season dam water overflows and looks like waterfall.very good place to see in lonavala.
Nice place in rains..,Enjoy rainy seasons with nice weather amid nature. Boon for nature lovers from Pune & Mumbai..on weekends..
"Bushi dam is located about 5km from Lonavala. During the monsoon season the dam overflows, creating a waterfall.","Always over crowded.Its a amazing during rainy days. Very beautiful dam must visit this dam.Rain and pleasant weather increase the excitement.One need to be cautious because of the sharp edgy stones...We went in Mid of august. But the water level was not upto the mark but yes we enjoyed the local foods, enjoyed the view of the dam. People over there were also enjoying a lot."
Not worthy,"It is average dam, if you go up then view is ok.  Lake is polluted by shop owners and public. you will food and eatable items over here."
Bhushi dam visit,It's good to see few places in lonavala and bhushi dam is one such but for that one should go in rainy season alsoIt looks like a heavenly feeling with hot spicy corn pakodas if u can get from a small tea shop on the way nothing like thatA must goThanks
Not so great in Jan,Had heard good things about this dam but don't think it is much of a sight in the dry season...it's probably much better in the monsoon season during the rains
"Bhushi Dam, Lonavala","Bhushi Dam is one of the best tourist attraction in lonavala and easily accessible via Private Auto, this Dam is a best visit in Rainy season as the dam overflows, avoid visiting on week offs and holidays as its over crowded and lots of traffic jam on the way"
effortless,"One has to cross bushi dam to go through the ghats for tungi. its a nice stop to have some tea/ coffee. Also there are vendors who sell clay ware..not too cheap, but you will have to haggle to save some."
Wastage of time if visited in non monsoon season,"The damn was in extremely poor state, was attracted to be here by looking at the pics of water flowing on the steps. But the pics were of monsoon season. The place was almost stinking with garbage everywhere! Don't throw garbage next time to enable others to at least follow the same!"
Really good,"Great place to visit during monsoon. If you're in Lonavala, this is the must place to have a look at."
Fun place in Monsoon,This is fun place if you visit in monsoon and Dam is full with water. very good spot take photographs.
Waste of time,"Nice to see in picture, nothing to see actually. Only a part of the lake is visible with hill at background. Approach is shabby with no proper pathway or any other infrastructure. No reason to call it a tourist place & nothing to loose if one skip this place."
Stunning views ,This place offers stunning views. Great place to visit during monsoon. This is crowded throughout the year.
Dam,It's a very famous and known place in Lonavala. There isn't anything exciting about the place. It's upto an individual to visit or not. they won't be loosing anything by not visiting this place.
small dam,I went there in january-17 and its nothing there. Water has been dried upAll was good Cost of food was high... Very nice for rainy season..
Can be skipped!,We were very excited to visit bhushi dam before. But when we went there it was a big disappointment. There is nothing to do there. Unsafe for children. High parking charges Rs.100/-.
Good,All was nice The peacock is the attraction near entranceAll was goodCost of food was high... Very nice for rainy season..
Not so great !,I went there in December and its nothing there. Water has been dried up and you see garbage here and there. Must be worth going in monsoon.
Bhushi Dam,"While travelling from Pune to Navi Mumbai on 05 January 2017, I had a stop over at Lonavala, basically to buy some Chikki from Maganlal Chikki wala. But my driver did not take me to the original Maganlal Chikkiwala. Still I bought some products of Maganlal from that shop. The quality of products was excellent. We asked the shopkeeper if he knew the Bigg Boss House so that we can visit there, but he informed that the approach to Bigg Boss House is closed 2 km before. So we went to Bhushi Dam and enjoyed the dam without water. We were told that this place should be visited only during or after rainy season."
Not worth visiting,"Went there in Dec 2016. There is nothing to see. The water appeared to have been dried up and garbage could be seen littered all around, maybe the place looks different in the rainy season."
Most fun and enjoying place in rains,This is the most visited place during rainy season in lonavala... The most fun and enjoying place ... The people gi there to take a bath outside the dam.. the overflow of water goes via stairs outside.. this gives a beutifull waterflow... Enjoying place....
Good for rainy season only ,E went in December. There was nothing. A wall with a three water on the other side. We were told that during the rainy season the water is let our and we can Play in it.
Dry Lake,"We went in winter totally wrong time, the lake was dry and nothing to see. Best is to go in rains, there is water over flowing from dam and people take bath."
A nice and calm place,This place is very calm and good for couples.But this place needs urgent maintenance.No proper management.The view of the water reservoir lake is amazing.Most times couples came here to spent some private moments.But couples be careful.
People come to lonavala for this,People of Maharashtra have craze for this place. And millions of them visit this place during rainy season...This place is getting dirty year after year the lonavala municipal corporation has done nothing to keep this place in good condition.. if maintained can be a very great place for tourist....
Nice dam,"Dam is bice, but the way to the dam and place nearby is stinky. U can see the dam from its main wall which is fenced, while there are places on its side where fence is broken, so u can go to water. Beware it may be steep so watch ur steps."
can avoid,do not go if there is no water flowing - not in winter or summer.. the path leading to this place was very dirty - garbage everywhere.....
Not worth visiting at all,"There was no water at all. We stopped enroute to Lonavala from Lions Point, All shops around the place were closed. It is not worth visiting at all. Overall Lonavala is quite disappointing place to visit in non-monsoon season"
Not so good.,"It is not so good place to visit, normal place , we not found water in Dame, it was wast of time, if you have limited time then don't go, instead of visit other place"
Water frenzy,Its a dam close to the city of Mumbai. Quite crowded mostly and not very scenic to be honest. Worth just one visit if you are in lonavla
No way,"Bakwas place to visit. Heavily crowded with tapori's. You cannot even think about going with family.There is no proper way to take your vehicle or even park them nearby.Local people charge Rs. 20 to drive on that road. Only waterfall is there which you will find anywhere in Khopoli, Panvel, Kolshet etc."
No good,I dont know why everybody ask to go to Bhushi Dam. There is nothing that can attract you. Lack of facility. Very dirty during monsoon and that is the only time to go there.
Monsoon Wonder,The location is good for visit only during rainfalls. Avoid visiting it during dry season as its quite dirty and smells a lot during dry times.
damn dam,if u r on way from lions point good to stop and have look but the area is very dirty and should be taken care by the administrative and also visitors
Wow,"It was just an amazing trip with my friends at Bhushi Dam, Lonavala. The place is very beautiful and attractive."
Nice place,It is nice place to visit. But we have visited in wrong time. It is good place visit in Rainy season. You can find peaceful nature.
Good Place in Moonson,"This is picnic place, you can enjoy in moon soon, but it's crowdie place so you are not going to get peace, surrounding area are very dirty, local civic authority has to take care as this is a picnic place, not advisable to eat food which is available surrounding this place as this is not hygienic foods."
Stairs of Bushi Dam,"This place is very funny. There are some 9-10 steps where Dam water was flowing down and people with sitting, dancing, jumping and playing on those step. so you can enjoy hot pav in cold water and get some nice clicks. :)"
nice place but crowdy,our visit was a real fun. we went with family and enjoyed the time. but be careful. do not show off. do not take risks.
Excellant place,"Must visit place, we enjoyed....Slight drizzle added to our joy....We need to walk around 5-10 min to reach dam...."
small dam but enough to enjoy water flow,"This is 5 min inside from road to INS shivaji from lonavla. Best to visit when it is overflowing, as there are steps where one can sit and enjoy gush of water. People even sell vada pav and chai on steps."
nice place...but very dirty,"our public has made this beautiful place a big garbage by throwing disposable bowls, spoons and bottles...everywhere these things were spread and was the worst sight"
CHAI CHAPA CHAI CHAPAKE CHAI CHAI,Nice waterfall to feel good we enjoyed alot we sat on fall and took bath there only we had great time in rainy season
Nice place. Worth a visit.,"Visited this place early morning. So as expected less tourists,less chaos. :)going from the road to the dam itself is very happy feeling.we crossed 2-3 small streams of chilled water with small fishes.on reaching the dam, the surrounding was majestic, u can only hear the water flow.Some nice snaps followed by. to sum up the best place in lonavala to visit with family."
Great,I recommend this you feel nice with water touching your feet .don't forget to take rubber slippers with you.
"Worth a visit during heavy rainy season, else not",The water from the adjacent dam rises to come across and flow through the stairs. People sit on the stairs and take bath. I would suggest to take a quick look of this and ask for a nearby waterfall from the local vendors. It is not a part of any tour guide. Only locals can show you the way. It is safe and also magnificent where three streams meet at one place. One need to walk for 20 minutes from Bhusi dam to reach to this place. No car goes there. You can skip Bhusi dam but not this. Food is very expensive there.
Chap chapachap,Happy with the place but little long must walk to visit and very slippy area be caution and visit please take care of child baki overall 100% to visit
Always fun to visit,"Bushi Dam is a must visit if you're visiting Lonavala. It's almost always filled with water and in monsoons it's the best. It's at the foot of the ghats towards lion's point and ambey valley. Weather you go with your special one, with family, kids, or friends.. bushi dam is fun for all."
Good Location but Extremely Filthy,"Location is good, water flowing from the dam onto huge steps makes one hell of a man made waterfall experience but its sad I would never visit it again, one because its a long, dirty & filthy track all along the way from parking (exorbitantly priced by locals)  till the dam and at the dam same filthiness is glaringly evident marring the whole experience. It could be a great place to have fun with friends & family but as of now its a big no."
amazing to visit in monsoon,don't just sit near the steps but trek further and you can experience the waterfalls.Never go barefoot because there is moss which makes the stones slippery and also there are pieces of glass everywhere from the broken bottles thrown by drunkards . Not recommended for seniors as they may find it tiring.
Monsoon Fun,The attraction of Bhushi Dam is in monsoon when dam overflows and one could enjoy in the water.Need to be cautious while walking as it is slippery.
One day trip from pune.,It is a small dam. Only around 55 km far from Pune. Good place for one day trip and hangout with friends
Nice fun place to visit in monsoon,There is slightly higher than ankle length deep water to tread to reach the spot.  Suggest to leave shoes in car. There are vendors in front who provide slippers on rent for 20 to 40Rs. They can store your shoes if you don't have a car to keep. Enjoy hot vada pav and tea while there. Lots of parking space available nearby. Carry mobile phone in a plastic pouch or best leave it and come as there are photographers there who can click your pics and print instantly. Be careful while walking closer to the spot as there is green moss making the place slippery! Note people are not allowed to enter or swim in the dam water itself. Hope this helps!
A small crowded lake on the outskirts of Lonavla,"Over rated tourist point. Only attraction is during monsoon, the lake overflows and spills over its ""steps"" and people ""enjoy"" that !!!"
enjoyed the day like anything,we loved the water flowing on steps and get wet. it was very nice experience to have. there is Bhushi dam above and water flows from it on steps. take bath and get wet. be careful of slippery stones.
Must visit place in Rainy Season,It is ultimate location to enjoy the water fall of Bushy dam in rainy season. Family will really enjoy sitting in gushing water. Take care while going through deep water & slippery rocks. Enjoy Bhutta.
Good but sleepery,"We visited dam after few days of heavy rain so water was flowing on steps which was beautiful scene but people made place very dirty by thrown carry bags, papers, other garbage. People need to walk in water, so little risky as I have seen one man fell down and had injury."
Ultimate location,Bhushi dam steps are ultimate. Overflow water coming down from steps are so amazing. Just ensure to visit the place in monsoon. Keep shoes in ur vehicle before going there. better to take slippers of ur own & a plastic cover for keeping mobile although u take slippers on rent.
Very Good,It is a good place to visit. We had visited in heavy rains and the dam was in near overflow level. Parking is a big hassle close to the dam and have to pay private parking lots to park the vehicle
Amazing feeling ,"I tell you, you are gonna love this place when the dam is overflowing. The water pouring on the steps look amazing. You will just love it. The only problem is its approach as if it has rained heavily in past then you have to pass through the water and your half legs will be in water when you to reach this. All type of people love this atmosphere. Keep a notice, the beat time to visit will be in monsoons."
Good only when overflowing,"Nice place to visit in rainy season when Dam is overflowing, to experience completely new joy of rain."
Must visit after a few days of heavy rains,Excellent place if one visits it after a few days of heavy rains...Overflowing water would flow through the steps. One can actually bathe in the flowing water. Kids would love it.
Always crowded,This is a very popular place for hanging out amongst the young generation. The ideal time is when the dam gets full and you see the firzt flow of overflowing water. It is dangerous to tread near it thereafter until well after the rainy season. A good place to visit.
Fun place,Its a nice place to be in Lonavala. The only drawback I can see is that its too crowded and not very clean.
Superb place just unwind,"Nice place, water Overflowing from Dam and flowing over the steps of stone create beautiful atmosphere, walk in water or bathe in the same. Enjoy hot corns and vadapav. Slightly downward the steps, small pools of water are there you can have fun or bathe there. Do get yourself clicked, nice photos."
Beautiful place for FRIENDS,"Lovely staircase waterfall, most enjoyable place in lonavla but crowed area. Mostly people visit on Monsoon."
Beautiful view from the top,"Beautiful place, lovely waterfall in the monsoon, but spoilt by the rowdy crowds, dumping beer bottles and trash all around."
Beautiful place; but too crowded,"This is a beautiful place during the monsoon. But when the dam overflows, too many people crowd ti enjoy the water that flows down the steps...and it can get just too crowded at time...best to go there in june/early july...and on a weekday..."
Nice place,It is nice place to go for newly married and family with young and teenage children's. Kindly note to go there wear waterproof slippers(antiskid) as to reach there with small walk is in water till knees.
Good place to enjoy rains,We went there around 15th August. Busy place. people just go there to enjoy rain and overflowing water of dam. Behind the dam people go there and there is a waterfall. Most of the adventurer go there and enjoy this waterfall. We also went there and enjoyed it. Simply good place to enjoy rains.
With cousins,"When i went there it was peak season and extended weekend (13 to 15 Aug). At the top i could not see water as people were sitting there. Literally at that time it was not looking like a dam but greenery was good. When we went 4-5 k.m ahead of Bushi Dam, It was foggy weather. We were feeling like heaven. Visibility was less than 10 mtrs,"
