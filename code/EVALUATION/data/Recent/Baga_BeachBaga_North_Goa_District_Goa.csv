Best Beach in North goa,Baga beach in one the best beach in north goaWe spent a memorable moments on beach with me nd my friendsEnjoyed a lot on the beach and night life was awesome
Average heavily crowded,Heavily crowded in March but not very good crowd here. Average quality of public. Not much time to relax as people walk and run around in large numbers. Lots of water activity going on here. There are lots of options to have food from the restaurant on the beach. Lots of music and many dance clubs on the beach. An average beach of Goa for peole just to dance and run around and enjoy haywire.
Baga Beach,"One of the most popular beaches in North Goa, not the best though ... I personally like beaches which are less crowded. Lot of tourists, lot of options of boat rides, dolphin cruise, adventure sports etc available here .. be ready to bargain to get the best bet :)we took a boat ride to the see the Dolphin's, Fort Aguada etc and it was a good experience. would I go back .... not sure as there are enough n more better options in Goa"
Vibrant,"Baga Beach is one of the most popular breaches in Goa, be it day time or night, it is always crowded. The long beach with numerous numbers of shacks at beach, makes it most frequented beach. Spotted several tourists enjoying sea bath. One can hire a reclining chair with umbrella and enjoy the sea view and food. The night scene was very noisy due to loud DJ music being played by the shacks for guests to drink and dance. Spotted numerous empty bottles thrown on the beach, a big eyesore, and that made the beach dirty too. While enjoying night view, we had our evening snacks with chicken chill dry and chicken steak at one of the Shacks. To summarize, most frequented and noisy beach"
"Visit to BAGA Beach,North Goa","Baga Beach is undoubtedly among the best beaches in India.The long stretch of sandy beach is amazing...you can rent a reclining chair with umbrella for a price of 200 INR.There are lot of Restaurants adjoining this beach where a variety of sea food is available.you can also use a Shack if you order food or beverages from one of these restaurants.This beach is famous for watersports.....All my trips to Goa have included a visit to this wonderful beach.....where you are at ease with nature.Nightlife is amazing here....with the famous TITO'S Nightclub nearby this beach...Inspite of so much crowds here,the beach is well maintained and neat....Do not forget to buy souvenirs near this beach."
Party scene,"Not our scene at all.  Too many people, too much noise and not very clean.We walked down from town, had a quick look and hastened back the way we came."
Party,"Gr8 for partyyyyyy.Late nite music, romantic dinner...Sand, sea shore......Wow...Must visit place in North goa...."
good beach,"this beach is the epicenter of Goa > it is the most frequented beach and most of the tourist do visit this place at least once during their stay > it has lot of restaurants, Pubs , cafe etc. it has places to chill out late in the night party places it has all > we were there in the night for a very short stay only concern i could see bottles lying on the beach and the dustbin not even 5 mtrs away > people are careless"
Tourist Baga Beach,Baga Beach is a nice area of Goa. The beach itself is beautiful. You can rent a bed and umbrella for the day for 200 rupees ( about $4.00 Cnd) a fellow watches over your bed to make sure your items are safe or adjust your umbrella if need be.The beach is sandy with a light surf. There are no rocks or seaweed or shells.... just sand. The water of the Indian Ocean is incredibly warm. You are able to order food and drinks from one of the nearby restaurants. Local women come by with fresh fruit to sell. We usually stayed right in front of Brittos restaurant. Enjoy!
Not impressed ,This beach is way to overcrowded and the water sports people are basically thieves they overcharge you and they dont even take you out on the water for that long  I'm very disappointed in how baga has become the shacks are still nice but the beach itself is discustin so much litter and rubbish everywhere it needs a big clean up
Decent beach ,Beach is good to spent time with family and friends.  You can spent time with your group or partner here.  Foot fall is high unlikely other beaches of goa other than calaungate beach.
Coco Joe's beachshack.,"Been coming to coco Joe's for a few years now.its a favourite.staff are all friendly and cant do enough for you.nice and relaxed ,and awesome food."
Best baga shack,"Lovely beach very clean we prefer the stretch in between baga and calangute as it‚Äôs quiet. Our favourite beach shack is there Indian summer, easy to find from the bottom of CSM Road just follow the signs for the shack, superb service and foo, cleanest toilets by far. Absolutely fantastic."
Baga Beach Goa India,"Just along from Calangute beach/town you‚Äôve got Baga beach, a much quieter beach than Calangute in the day! On our visit we stayed the evening, having an evening meal and drinks on the beach and watching the sunsetüåû beautifulüëçüèº This beach is definitely worth a visit and like Calangute it also really comes alive after sundown!!"
Clean and fun beach,"The beach is laced with Shacks that turn into night party places with Moroccan style canopies, candle lights, cheap booze, music, massage and all sorts of cuisines to choose from. Some of them also have Hookahs. It's commendable how they keep their beach so clean even after such heavy footfall. The beach is irresistible. Wear Chappals or Beach footwear only, or you may choose to walk barefoot. Do carry towels and a change of clothes whether or not you know swimming. The water is so clean and inviting that you will jump in for sure. The shacks allow you to use their chairs and washing areas if you order food or beverages from them. You'll have a lot of fun here."
the true  beach,"best beach of north goa, bit costly but good for fun and sports. the shacks are good . the best feature of this beach is its night life , magnificent beauty in the night."
Baga Beach ,Bagh beach is famous for night life.The best place to go near baga is Tito‚Äôs.It‚Äôs bit costly but worth of every penny you spent there.Bagh with family not recommended at all.
Wonderful beach with a party vibe,"Surprisingly, I didn't come to Goa to party. I actually didn't party the whole trip however this beach was fantastic! I sat by the ocean at night with music pumping in the bars and clubs that line the beach. The heart lights made for great photos and it was really great to have the option to party, to be on the edge of the party, but still get to sit and watch the ocean waves."
Crowded and not clean,It is just a party center in North Goa. Beach is very crowded and not clean. Over hyped because many resorts and discotheques around it that organize party till late night.
Full of Desi Crowd.,Super crowded place. Punjabi music in most of the shacks. The place has it‚Äôs own parking. The party animals will love to hang out this place among all the beaches. Neon lights and loud music can turn off your mood.
Desi crowds,Decent beach. Full Desi crowds. Punjabi music in most shacks. Good food at St.Anthony's and Brittos. Haven't tried other shacks cos the bad choice of music put me off.
Busy busy busy,We stayed in Arpora so this was our 1st beach to try. Much cleaner than calangute but just as busy. Would reccommend the starlight shack.
Crowded beach,Certainly need to see it ones. Super crowded super busy just a looooot of people all over the place and at night time hundreds of small beach lounges.
Splendid- O Baga r!,This beach is ideal place for spending the evening/ night. The place has it‚Äôs own parking. The party animals will love to hang out this place among all the beaches. Neon lights and loud music gives it a heavenly vibe. Dance bars add another level of satisfaction along with mouth watering foods in the beach facing restaurants.
Baga Beach Goa - Paradise for sea lover,"This is in North Goa . Large shore line . Golden sand beach . Lots of water sports facilities available. Parking is available . too many beach side restaurants provides tasty sea food bit costly though.  However too much crowded.  Lots of reclining chair with large umbrella . one can seat and enjoy . cost is 100 INR per hour .   change room / place might be there , I did not find any . Beach patrolling is there . Dolphin cruise boat also leaves from here."
Most Happening beach,Even when you visit there at midnight 4 Am it will be with the huge public. Want to enjoy till midnight you can visit this place and have some fun
not worthed,"full of people who use to leave trash every where and doesnt care about environment and people around them, nut the location is good you will be able to find ATMs FOOD, Bars and nice night life as well"
Restful,Had a great time on Baga beach at Boscoe‚Äôs beach shack.  Friendly service great staff. Excellent food. Seafood second to none
Average ,It's like local Beach its located on the centre of the city so most of the people are visited there so its so much crowded in day and also in night but at night party location are nice
Too crowded ,Baga beach is nice but it's too crowded and lot of dogs which one must be very careful as they come to bite.
A beach in South of Goa,"This is one of the good beaches located in South of Goa. It has facilities for water sports, public bath and toilets and multiple shacks along the coastline.  Few of the happening bars are located in this area. Be careful of pickpocketers.  Nice place to unwind and roam around."
Place for Drinking Only,nice beach..popular for drink n dine.beach was noisy as all the restaurants were placing different music i full volume .also  water spoerts was available
BEAUTIFUL BUT TOO CROWDED,"Baga beach is really Beautiful.but I have to say it's too crowded with people,Dogs,Cows and beach sellers harassing people."
Beach,"Baga beach short walk from where we  were staying , very busy , lots of places to sit or lounge and eat and drink . Surprisingly clean .water activities and life guards on duty."
Just an average crowdy beach,I visited last week before going there I heard various good things about this beach but after my visit I realized that its Just an average crowdy beach. Soil & Water quality of this beach was little dark. Other than you will find some good water sports that was good part of this beach.
What's Happened to Baga?,I went to Baga with great expectations and my memories of 2014 visit to this place. In 2014 this place was awesome despite being very commercial. It had a great deal of charm. If I had rated Baga after my 2014 visit then I would have given it a good 5 stars full.Alas my last visit here in March 2019 was a terrible experience. People from all parts of the world had gathered. It was bad. The crowd had some really rowdy folks who think they are cool if they are in a big group. Lot of eve teasing and terrible behavior by some people.Food joints are overpriced and so are the water sports activities. There are limitations to how deep you can enter the water and a lot of littering of plastic and bottles and other stuff. I seriously felt like I should have never visited the beach and should have just cherished the memories of the previous visit all life.Big time that visitors understand the importance of keeping the beach and its vicinity clean. I think government should charge people for entering the beach and imply heavy fines on littering. Let everyone understand the value of these tourist-friendly places as soon as possible.
GREAT FOOD IN THE SHACKS,"Many shack in which to eat,,, good food, and not  expensive,, We sat at Boscos, but thats due to where i used to sit 2 yrs agio, when i was last there"
Baga Beach Goa - lovely beach with the best sunsets and beachside cafes ,"Baga Beach is one of the most famous beaches of goa, It has some of the best shacks on the beach along with the famous Britto‚Äôs, The beach also has the famous Baga Beach signboard and makes a picturesque sight with the church on top of a cliff as the starting point of the beach, The beach is relatively much less crowded as compared to Calangute but has a better sense of beachside glory that u have to be there to experience, The backdrop of Parasailing on the skyline and the sunsets are an amazing sight, It‚Äôs a must visit when in Goa."
happening place,"if you like party crowd and happening place this is the plcae to be you cn do watersports, enjoy the sun, chill and have some beer, in short a very lively place"
Happening beach,"If you love crowd, food and fun, this is the right place, otherwise go to Colva beach.  We were there at the sun rise time and sun set time both on last weekend.  Amazing atmosphere."
Lively beach,"Baga Beach is pretty lively and filled with actionsports.One picks a Schack where they provide sunbeds wich are free,  however one should eat and drink at their place and the food is in general very good.The beach is constantly cleaned and filled with friendly dogs, sometimes even cows."
Lovely,"Very nice but do get hassled a lot buy the girls selling the same stuff every day ,just wanted to relax with no hassle"
Busy but good experience ,We went to this beach as it was local. Ate food on there which was nice. There were a lot of locals and very friendly. A little busy if you are looking for quiet this is not that. Had a massage on the beach which was lovely. A real good experience.
Mrs Vaneshree patel,Very nice Bags beach .It is very easy excessable .Near the Nazri resort .Very busy .Have lots of shops near the seafront .Very comfortable with sitting areas .Near by it has got clubs .shops .restaurants Very lively place safe to walk around
Testy food by the Sea ,"Testy food , live music, beautiful ambience .You can have chiken sandwich, tuna sandwich or egg and veggie sandwiches breakfast  all are equally good .You can spend beautiful evening by the sea with beautiful live Karaoke..sing and dance along with your near and dear ones and enjoy number of tasty dishes ."
Typical Goan beach,"Looks like this is the most happening beach in Goa. Its lined with shacks, pubs and restaurants. Go early if you want a beach bed for your self. However the beach closes almost soon after sunset due to security reasons but one can spend time in the shacks"
Awesome beach,"I my opinion is going for Baga Beach located at North Goa in the state of Goa. There are several beaches in Goa, most of them are over crowded and with hard sand, except Baga which is my favorite one.Nightlife is hard and rock, found musical programs, dj‚Äôs night around the beach and up to late night and the cool breezes, which will definitely make you freaky"
Bagga beach,Lovely beach and excellant shacks Great staff members and lots of friendly staff members Nice place for a massage and lots of shops
Good,Crowded but nice beach. The shacks are good here for a nice relaxed time. Be there for sunset. Lot of water sports facility but remember to bargain.
"Paradise for food, music and sports loving persons!!!","When you will first visit the Baga beach you may find it very crowded, but when you will start to explore it, you will find that there are many things to do and experience. ""During the morning time, it's the time to do all the sports activities and enjoy a bottle of beer and eat different sea foods"". During the noon you might want to just lay a bit and rest and enjoy the sunset. In the Night you can have candle light dinner with your loved ones and enjoy some dance till 10 o'clock, as there is no loud music allowed after that. During that time you can do different activities in the market like fish spa, have a fake tattoo for the night etc.                                                                          'This is my honest review'"
Nothing to see,Very crowded and dirty beach. Only filled with commercial tourist activities. Not suitable at all for taking bath. Can be skipped
Good place for water sports,"Baga beach is crowded but a good place for water sports. The night life seems good too, with beach shacks playing a lot of good music and the ambience being suitable for a party. I'd visit again for a party."
Baga Beach - Excellent night life along with shacks,"On 22nd Dec'19 evening, myself with my hubby got to visit Baga Beach. It is one of the most popular beaches in North Goa.Baga is the perfect destination for those who wish to witness the excellent nightlife of Goa as signature places such as Britto's, Tito's and Mambos have made their mark in their hearts of party-goers. The shacks also come to life in the late evening with some pumping music and mouthwatering food. It is one of the most visited beaches in North and we had spent a memorable evening over there."
OK beach,Beach is very close to the resort and one important things we like from the beach is that there are very good sacks which we like is Britto . we also enjoyed the sunset from the Baga Beach.
One of the best places in goa,Best time to spent in goa with friends.make sure that you don't spoil dust on the beach.One of the best best place of goa to spent with friends.almost all the room are booked online through different online sites
Chilli out at the beach,we had a day at baga beach. we didn't paid for sun bed but the keep asking you if you wanted a drink and food as they wanted you to spend money there as goa wasn't busy they all trying to get you to spend money everywhere you went and this all comes down to Thomas cook this was the story everywhere you went in goa.
nice place to chill out,the best and most happening beach at goa. There are lots of shacks and restaurants at the beach to have a good time. My favourate time time is during sunsets
Overrated overcrowded dirty,"Totally avoidable place as it's overcrowded with shacks, people and dirt. Better to visit other beaches like anjuna"
Just sit and enjoy the breeze,"Just sit and enjoy the breeze, watch the children playing with the waves, the happy faces of all the people around‚Ä¶ far away only water and sky‚Ä¶everything together relax you.."
Baga beach,"Stay in a hotel near beach so that you can walk to beach anytime. Spend your time at beach or hire a scooty and travel nearby tourist spots. Roads are good and driving scooty there is love. Panjim is like any other capital of state with crowd, banks, traffic and all, so better stay by this side of goa and enjoy good food."
Baga beach,"Baga beach is great for relaxing in the day & partying at night. There are so many shacks to choose from. Only thing is, each one has loud speaks In evening so hard to decide which shack the music is coming from!"
Baga beach,Bags beach scenery is nice with a hill at the end corner.but it's too crowded with all tourists and dogs and cows.
Crowded beach,"One of the most crowded beach in North Goa, but have really great restaurants, amazing vibe but if you're among those who doesn't like so much crowd then better avoid it."
"Too much men, less women","My girlfriend and me decided to go to celebrate new years eve with 2 friends of us at Baga Beach. When we arrived, there was a mass of male Indians.. Fully drunk and ""ready for everything"". They were starring at my girlfriend like she is an animal.. So my whole evening was stressful and I could not really enjoy the party. Less police, too much drunk idiots. Hint: Never go there when you are with your girlfriend - especially when you are from Europe. Catastrophe."
Beautiful beach ruined by loud blaring music & too many shacks,"I have been visiting this beach for many years now and i have seen this beach go down the toilet gradually over the years. The problem as with many things is lack of governance - there are too many shacks next to each other and they play music so loud that the ambience of the beach is completely ruined. Add to that, bachelors drinking beer & chugging the bottles on the beach, you have a mix of dirty beach with loud blaring music which probably can only be enjoyed by very few. This is definitely no longer a destination for younger couples or families anymore. Save your time & visit one of the more nothern goa bbeaches"
Lovely Beach,"This is a Beautiful Beach, beside the Baga River, We love to stroll along it. stopping off at Beach Shacks for a cooling dring.."
Good place for day time! But big NO for the night dinner or beach visit.,"I visited baga twice once in 2013 & now in 2019. There have been lot of changes...If you want to enjoy the beach in day-time with swimming and water sports this is a good beach, white sand and great shacks. Do not expect very decent crowd though. The beach is very crowded and so as the roads near by expect traffic on your vacation!!In 2013 when I visited ...I had a very beautiful dinner on the beach, but 2019 was a big disappointment for me, The entire beach has turned into some kind of marriage barat..so loud punjabi music that you can't even hear the person next to you forget about hearing the sea. This beach is now like a cheap bar where college students or bachelors go for drinking cheap liquor and dance like barati's"
Nice,Baga beach located in north goa side it's a such a lovely and huge and vlwa  beach I ever seen in goa such a calm and nice place ut was
Best place for fun and hangout,"Little crowded.Swimming is allowed. Lifeguards present on shore.Beach sacks/huts available for drinking and chilling.Beach sacks are open whole night.Water sports is amazing. Go with official booking counter and clarify things before booking.E.g. Para-Sailing:1) Self photography allowed? 2) How much is height and time frame? 3) How many dip will be given if you have paid for it?4) Is there any extra charges for dive in the sea.We booked Para-sailing for 1100 per person with dip. In which they provide 3-5 dips in the sea. Later they said if you want photographs and video then 200 will be extra, their guy will shoot video and send to us via WhatsApp.Later in middle of the sea they stopped the boat while taking us to sailing boat and asked if anyone want to jump into the sea for swimming. Here is the catch.. Don't jump too quickly, they asked 300 per person for jump. Here they caught us into situation in middle of sea. Then after negotiation, allowed two of us to jump for 300.My Experience: 1100 booking is worth. They give you 200 ft. height and 3-5 dips. It will take around 2 mins. If you take 800 booking then only 100 ft height and no dip. It will be finished before you can enjoy. Less than 1 minute I think.Better go for 1100 booking if you want to enjoy it. If you don't want dip just tell them and negotiate for some extra time instead.Jet-Ski:1) How much long the round will be?2) Is it self-drive or guard will drive?Jet-Ski is 500 per person, 100 mtr lap and guard will drive. If you want to self drive it then guard will ask for 300 extra and will give you 300 mtr lap. Negotiation is possible in case of self-drive. Go directly to the driver instead of booking counter.Overall I would suggest go to proper booking counter for water sports. We found some individuals who provide water sports activity. They were expensive. 900 for Para-Sailing w/o dip and 1500 with dip."
Beach,One of the most visiting place in Goa.. It's is also the most crowded place . There's a lot of fun things to do. Must visit place..
Mark hazelgrave,Excellent time in baga stayed at the nazzl Hotel big banana beach shack is good csm road is very good for bars and restaurants
worth spending a good evening here,"I loved this beach the most as this beach is huge and crowd was good. Here, you can enjoy the view of good sunset most. I loved every bit of it. I am in love with this beach. I will highly recommend to all to visit this beach atleast once."
Baga Beach,One of the best beach in Goa. Water sports facilities available here. There are many restaurants and shacks with Goan cuisine.
Sunny Day Out,"The most happening beach in Goa, actually North Goa. This place is the best place for guys who loves the pub culture. One can enjoy go to the Beach shacks or go to the near by pubs. Also all water sports are available here but it is very crowded place.3 weeks agoThe beach is lined up with vibrant tattoo parlors, astrology shops, beautiful decks, making a perfect Nightlife destination.Baga Beach is one of the crowded and popular beaches of Goa coastline brings one here which is not only loaded with national and foreign tourists but also cafes, shacks, and amazing music. A perfect destination to observe the sun setting down while having cool drinks and hop on to famous clubs."
Wonderful Beach,"Take a walk down the beach until you find Bongos, It has great food, cold cold beer, free sunbeds, free WiFi and great service. Lots of the locals bother you on the beach for selfies with a white person, and they do get bothersome but Bongos staff keep them away. The lifeguards will shout for everybody to come back to the beach if the water is up to your waist, You can ignore them it is just for the Indian people as most can't swim and there are drownings every year. The lifeguards are worried that the Indian people will follow you out and get in trouble."
Beautiful India ,"Arabian sea. The third Arabian sea i swam. First in Fort Kochi, then in South Goa. I loved the waves. The beach has very fine sand. Well maintained by locals. Plenty of beers at good rate. I sat there two evenings to enjoy sunsets. I was there in the morning also. There were plenty of choice for accommodation and food even though some closed for summer. Rent a scooter will help. Hot summer, good bargain. Not much crowd. Weather was hot but the mood was cool. Beautiful. Please don't write off summer of Goa."
Lovely beach,"I was on this beach in the morning time, 9-10AM alongwith my wife. Very good weather. I had a good walk along the beach with my wife. Just be cautious about reaching the beach, as the regular way was closed when we visited and hence we had to take alternate way. Just before this beach, we had visited Candolim beach which was more violent (I mean the waves were stronger and bigger) than Baga. Overall a good experience, I recommend this for the travellers visiting this side of Goa. Some of the pics clicked are as attached."
Baga beach,"Baga beach is good but only in the morning, once water sports starts it is crowded. Nice restaurant like Britto's and st. Anthony's. Nice beach for kids and family crowd...."
Ok beach,Ok beach compare other beaches in Goa . Good restaurants with good ambiance. Also good for kids and water sports....
Good ,The beach is good but needs to be improved with the system of water sportingGovt should fix the price of water sports there is a high bargain with water sports operators
Owsome beach for party lovers,"I visited twice goa, but only place where I can most enjoy is baga..clean beach..water rides..only visit if you party lover,crowded in this season.Where hot there now days keep umbrella or cap."
First time in Goa,showed up in Baga Beach for a few days.  Stayed at the Grand Holiday Hotel (trust me when I say it was nothing to write home about).  Quickly learned that the northern part of Goa is mostly locals who are on the beach and it's a very commercialized area.  there are plenty of bars on the beach and they are all jockeying for position by playing very loud distorted music.  The cost of booze and food is way over priced as expected.  For food you're better off eating anywhere other than on the beach.  Whole.in the beach the bars have their staff hounding you to sit in their area.  As for the beach its clean and the water was nice and warm.  I was baga beach from tuesday nov 19 to 22nd.   one thing I would definitely recommend is to rent the automatic scooters or approx Rs. 300-400/day so that your not stuck in one location as there is plenty see and do.
Happening place full of life,"Baga is a popular beach in Goa and it very lively with numerous restaurants, pubs, shopping and a great nightlife.If you are interested in getting inked, loads of tattoo places to choose from.Please note that this beach attracts hordes of tourists, so be careful with your belongings, as with any crowded place."
OK beach ,Good ambience but bit crowded lots of fun stuff on the beach but with kids (infants) it's Lil difficult..!
Most crowded beach...,Amazing location very nice and clean beach but it is very crowded beach. Beach shaks are there very close to the beach. You will enjoy your time with the music and relax your time with sun bed.
happening beach,the most happenig beach in goa party goes on whole night lots of cafe on the beach just chill out with a beer and watch the waves
Sandy Beach Preferrable for Water Sports During Season,"Baga beach is no more a secluded beach if one looks for peace and tranquility. Its a highly populated beach with shacks, restaurants, bars and clubs either on the beach or on the adjoining road paralleling the beach horizon.Its one of the most commercial beaches in Goa and even Calangute beach, an adjacent beach to Baga, is no bar to it in terms of the congestion. People who like watersports or like to enjoy playing with the waves, you can enjoy the atmosphere. Its good for all kinds of people except those who are looking for a serene and calm beach with less of crowd and wants the attention of nature to its fullest."
A very ordinary beach,"Baga beach is just an ordinary one, not having any appreciable beauty. Crowd is mostly Indian, and few, westerners. The entry lane to the beach is dotted with many bar & restorents, suitable for friends / groups. Not that comfortable for families.You can play in the beach, but it is not very flat."
Baga best beach,Baga beach very busy but full of options for eatery specially sea food and great place to enjoy some water sports activities . Sunset view too is very lovely and great restaurants all long
Very busy,"This isn‚Äôt the most scenic beach and is very busy, one half with Indians and the other half is mainly Russians.I wish I went to Palolem instead of Baga, but didn‚Äôt realise this until I made the trip up north from the airport.I am moving to Candolim beach next, as it‚Äôs supposed to be nicer"
Superb,"It's almost full all the times, lot of visitors and even the water seems not that much clear. it is located near the city and lot of shopping and restaurants available near to this beach."
A bit dirty,Found this beach to be fairly dirty. Mainly water sports done here. If you are looking for beach front restaurants make your way to Calangute beach as there is not much on Baga.
Desperately needs a clean ,This is a very busy beach and feels a typical beach resort with hundreds of sun beds along the way.Due to how busy it gets it does though suffer with quite a lot of rubbish with plastic bottles and glass bottles just thrown on the beach which is very sad
"Third class, dirty beach..Waste of time.","Baga is no longer a classy beach. It is dirty, full of third class crowd, too much noisy. Avoid it at any cost if you want a peaceful holiday."
Very lively beach,"Baga beach located on north goa, highly busy beach in Goa.. Lots of water activies.. Lots of shakes.. Bars.. Night clubs near by Baga beach.."
Best Beach of Gioa,"This is certainly the Best Beach of Goa.There are no rocks like those present at Vagator and other beaches.  I went there in August, 2019.The beach has a vast expanse , people were really enjoying and playing in the waves. The lifeguards were all the while instructing people to not go far off in the sea as their duty ended at 7 pm in the evening. Only negative thing was people had thrown broken bottles on the beach, which was very dangerous for the people enjoying at the beach bare feet."
Mental!,"Spent 2 nights on this beach - but only managed it with earplugs! Thumping basey music until 4am at least! Lots of bars and restaurants - clean in some parts not in others. This is India, nothing is very clean!"
Leisurely ,"Bubbling with life Baga is one of the beaches where you stay up all night! The entire lane is always lit up with life. The sound of the crashing waves and your favourite drink, typically can spend a whole night if planning to pull an all nighter."
Beach,One of the best beach in Goa. Watersports facilities available here. There are number of restaurants are here..
Best beach to enjoy in waves,"Best beach to enjoy in waves, flat beach , crowded and eventful with permanent restaurant till mid night. F"
Most Happening Beach,"One of the best and most happening beaches in India. Location & accessibility to the beach is very good. There is plenty of paid parking and well maintained bathrooms & toilets are available near the beach. Water sports like Jet ski, speed boat, banana ride, bumber ride and para sailing are available from Baga beach. Can spend good time along with kids. There are plenty of shops close by to buy beachwear. Baga also has good number of beach shacks where visitors can have hukah, drinks & food. This is one of the best beaches in north goa. Number of hotels & restaurants are available near to Baga beach."
Dirty,"Though quite popular, this beach is one of the most crowded and dirty beaches in Goa. Avoid if possible."
Nice Beach,"Nice Beach, clean sand, lovely cafes right on the sand.Enjoy a coffee or cocktail. Only a short stroll from the shopping strip and restaurants."
Sporty Beach,"Baga Beach is continuation of long Calangute Beach, but the atmosphere is different than Calangute. It is more Sporty beach. Beach Shacks are more and better. Evenings are better, Sunset is spectacular. It is better cleaned, the crowd is more peace loving. Must visit this beach in North Goa Distt Mapusa. Nearby Tito's Lane has many attractions."
"Ok by night, not a fan by day","Visited Baga a couple of times on our trip, once during the day and once at night. During the day we went for a lie down and swim at the beach, unfortunately we were left feeling a little uncomfortable with lots of requests for selfies etc, not very relaxing. Having said that the beach itself is clean and quite picturesque but just very crowded. By night there are lots and lots of restaurant choices and the couple of places we are at were pretty good!"
Very nice beach,We visited the beach in october. The climate was very good. Beach is very good for taking sea bath. Various water sports were available.

Nice place.,Baga beach is one of the famous beach in Goa. If you people are coming then must come to baga beach and you can have food in britos restaurant as well as you can try st. Anthony restaurant. You will get nice food and staffs are also very helpful. Inside the britos restaurant you can enjoy the beautiful location of baga beach.
Used to be amazing,This used to be one of the best places to hang out with family and friends. Lately lot of people without etiquette are seen roaming around the place ogling.For some reason the shacks have been removed. Only evening sitout are arranged outside the restaurants by the beach.
Best beach - Baga beach,"Best beach in north Goa, you can enjoy with family and friends, lot of low depth area, activities are awesome."
Awesome beach.,"Really mind blowing waves.Almost got my knee twisted..but still had fun.Best part it has pay and use bath and toilets, something which is lacking abysmally at most goan beaches."
Heaven in Goa,Probably the best place to visit in Goa. Got to meet new people and experience the ocean waves. Nice food all around. A must visit. Safe for family and couples. Will again visit in next Goa tour.
Baga ~ Delhi of Goa,"Over crowded looks more like Ganga ghat . Large group of rowdy boys , labourers & workers come here either to stare at tourists or get drunk .Suitable for large groups & families with oldies coming to Beach for first time.Want privacy & quiet time ditch this beach.Punjabi / Bollywood songs  start blaring sundown ....Imagine the scene"
Crowded beach,This is one of the crowded beaches of the Goa. People will enjoy the most here. Lots of shopping can also be there near beach.in rainy season watersports not there.
Worst beach I have ever been to,People constantly ask you for photos if you are white and stare at you. Beach is also full of litter and is a cheap party beach at night where the alcohol is watered down and they try and con you out of money at any opportunity.
Overcrowded!!!!,Pleasant beach surrounded by rocky mountains.Its crowded. There are variety of restaurants where you can dig in to your favourite sea foods.
Beautiful Beach,"We were staying at Double Tree by Hilton and Baga beach was 10 mins from our Hotel, we went there in the morning, the beach was clean and well maintained, the water temperature was pleasant and our kids thoroughly enjoyed playing there, a lot of restaurants dot this beach, overall one of the best beaches in North Goa and one must visit the same."
Romantic at sunset ,"One of the beautiful places in goa, spcially with your partners. Surrounding is soooooo romantic at time of sunset."
Should definitely check out!,Baga beach is one of the top tourists attraction of Goa. The beach has a numerous amount of shacks that you could sit back and enjoy the view. These also some of shops nearby that you must check out if you want to take some of the souvenir back home. The beach also has some reserved spots near the water so you can kick back and relax while in the sun. Overall it's a very nice experience and a must try!
Baga awesome beach,"Love this place, the place looks so happening near to the shore. You get many bar and restaurants and the place look really cool. The best part is the night people will come all over the world to visit this beach and enjoy the view.highly recommend"
Nice but dirty,Beach was nice....but dirty.... nice restaurant.... good food.... and good for kids .... govt needs to take care of beach
Book,Goa is beautiful beach in India.Also you can stay on hotel and enjoy with your family and friends.So you can visit the all places.
Awful Dump,It's such a shame- poor planning. At least they have widened the road.This is such a busy tourist destination- used to be for foreigners but now they avoid because it's so dirty & run down but the poor Indian tourists have to put up with this rubbish; decrepit roads & buildings.Come on Goan Government? People are making the effort to come here so you make some effort too. Lazy.
Baga Beach in rainy season,"I visited Baga beach in August, it was the off season due to rain but we enjoyed a lot except No water sports all other things were in favour. Good weather, almost cloudy, good temperatures, less crowd, peace, high sea waive."
"Infamous beach with lots of people, head to vagator , candolim or sinquerim beach if you like calmer beaches","Very famous beach filled with beach shacks and pubs ,Britto's shack is must visit .lots of shops offer you tattoos, massages and daily wear, over all a nice place with so many people around ."
Awesome & Beautiful Beach,It is one of most popular beaches in Goa. You will find Restaurant serving with Food's & Drinks although you will find these Restaurant a bit expensive but when you travel you must enjoy the beautiful beaches with Cool Beers walking on the beach . Very Good Experience and must visit place in Goa.
Nice place had a fun!!! ,"One of the most popular beach üèù in Goa.Superb place enjoyed a lot. In day time beach looks awesome. It gives good feeling, and in night it more beautiful. Evening time is good to enjoy music and food. You can enjoy water sports also where many activities are available. Good quality of seafood- its amazing and very delicious food and mocktails. This place is for seafood lovers. There are many fresh fishes which you can choose from and they cook it as you say, in front of you.The sunset was awesome. Had a lot of memories here.It is good for families and couples. Must visit üëçüèª"
Awesome Experience,It is one of the most popular beaches in North Goa. There are some good pubs and market near the beach.
One of the beautiful beaches of goa,"This is one of the attractive best beaches of goa that was famous among the locals and the tourists. the maintenance can be improved. must carry umbrella, cap, sunglasses, water and camera."
Baga beach and britto's,"Visited Baga beach and had brand @brittos. It was an wonderful experience.We had sex on the beach, stuffed crab, masala papad, chicken lollypop and few more things, it was amazing. And the beach was so beautiful. Specially the river."
Baga beach,"During monsoon as there is no water sports staying and enjoying beach is only option. This beach is not crowded,clean and safe beach."
Nice shacks,This place is know for it's shacks and happening crowd. It's fun to be here but now this place seems too crowded than before
Rough weather,I visited at baga beach recently. We stayed at hotel baga prime which is locayed cllse to baga beach. It rained heavily and the water was very rough at the beach. Life guards provided good service
Different Experience in Monsoon,The beach was one of the most active beaches in Goa while other beaches were a bit secluded due to monsoon. The time we spent in Goa we hardly saw the sun.....however the view of the cloudy sky getting reflected in water was stunning. The time it was not raining we enjoyed sitting outside the shacks sipping our drinks. However due to the monsoons the lifeguards were not allowing anyone to get into the water and also the sea appeared so rough that it looked a bit difficult to handle for even a proper swimmer like me. Also when the rains broke in the lifeguards forced everyone inside the shacks. We could only spend some brief time on the sands and rest of the time we had to spend inside the shacks. But the little moments of peace we had in the beach were constantly broken by people trying to sell us trinklets or offering us massages.
Waves by Baga ,Beach was clean being monsoon. Waves were very striping and the life guards didn‚Äôt allow anybody to be in the sea. We could just play st the shore but not inside the sea. Once it started to rain the life guards moved everyone away from the ocean with giant strong waves   Missed being by the ocean but had a fun time walking in the sandy beach.
Dirty,"Very dirty beach. Only there for alcohol tourism. People come and want to sell you something.Beach shacks are mostly dirty, some good places are there though."
Happening Place,"This was a very happening beach as compared to other beaches in Goa. We visited in early Aug, hence had monsoon season, but we still enjoyed our best in here. You‚Äôll find many people enjoying and having fun near the beach. The evening time is best as you can enjoy the music and services in the Shacks. We tried ‚ÄúHarbour Pub‚Äù and it was one of the pub that got filled in with people so fast. Nice music, good food and drinks, sea facing and what else you need. We chose Cabana sitting and it added more quality to our experience. Price‚ÄîFood in this pub was not that expensive though, we had golden roasted prawn (400‚Çπ), mocktail (230‚Çπ), a beer (150‚Çπ) and peanut masala (150‚Çπ). Service was also good. Parking‚ÄîYou can park your vehicle in the Baga Beach parking. This area offers paid neat and clean washrooms as well that has bathing area and lockers too. Tip‚Äî- do not miss to hangout in Titto‚Äôs lane which covers many night clubs and other shops. If you are visiting in monsoon season, do keep umbrellas, raincoats always with you as it may rain anytime. Goa in this season is Lush green ‚ù§Ô∏è"
Great beach,Baga beach is the most happening beach in goa . I visted there in monsoon so water sports was closed else one can enjoy lot of water activities there. From restaurants to street shopping baga beach offers everything .
Place to get lost and find yourself,"If you want to get lost and find your inner self then this is the place for you, This is the place to feel the fragrance of sand. Take a long walk in the early morning and make your walk a memorable memory"
Nice beach ,It‚Äôs a nice beach area in the middle of a busy district. Lots and loads of shacks and night life around. However My personal opinion is that the beach is not that clean or tranquility is not there the way some other beaches are in north goa.
Softest sand you can ever find,The sands on this beach are the softest you can find ... the beach is relatively flat allowing you to wade in ankle high water even during high tide. Lost of activities around the place and of course great food.
Not just a beach,A pleasant and hot location. A place where u can chill out without boundaries. Baga beach is the real reflection of Goa. Missing it particularly on weekend nights is missing Goa in real sense.
Litter everywhere - quite dirty,"THE BEACH I don't know what it is with the Indian peoples but they seem,  as a collective whole, to be oblivious to the concept of carrying home their litter and waste. If you like walking amongst litter and filth,  then I'd recommend baga. They've completely ruined what could be a veritable paradise with their attitude that the beach/street is a rubbish tip for their trash, and a public urinal to be used at their convenience. Beer bottles,  plastic wrappers,  used nappies,  dog poop  etc etc. You cannot walk freely without carefully navigating each step in front of you. NIGHTLIFEI can't comment on the nightlife because i was there only during the day. BEING A WOMANIf you're a young women, esp. of European ancestry and are starved of male attention, then baga is the perfect place for you.  Men stare at you openly here, and that might make you uncomfortable. WEEDDon't get caught with weed - the police are shamelessly corrupt and will extort you with as much as they think they can get from you AND keep the weed as well.Those things aside, it's a great place."
baga beach ,"As everyone knows about baga beach, Baga beach is the most crowded beach in North goa. if you will come to baga beach then do not forget to have your food at The Famous rastaurant Brittos. from the baga beach end point you can enjoy the sun set very well and definitely you will enjoy at baga beach."
Baga Beach - One of the best beach in the world.,"Undoubtedly Baga is not only one of the best beach in India, Infact it would be amongst top 100 in the world. It's very peaceful with clean water. Although, many new construction, restaurant and shops have come up recently on the beach side, but it still is worth spending time there.Good place for family outing also."
Beautiful & peaceful beach,Another beautiful beach in North goa. Baga beach is very clean and big one.  is having water activity and i try speed boat there. They take you just 100meter but i really enjoyed this activity. Outside the beach a small market is there for tourists.
"Baga Beach Baga 403516, India",The Baga Beach was so dirty. Spaces was good in beach but no facilities for changing cloths for ladies specially .
Baga beach ,One of the most crowded beach found in Goa ...but if you are not the one to visit this beach than you aren't a good visitors....nice scenic beauty...but too crowded...
go here to just see....,if you are a party animal then definately you will love to come here.here the party on in the evening and goes on upto 3 am.many bar restaurants dj's here and you can enjoy whole night.u will see night life of goa here
Nice Beach,"Baga beach is famous beach of North Goa, It is near Calangute beach. This is almost similar as Calangute. Beautiful clean beach.must to visit"
Clean  beach,Nice beach in North Goa and famous for water sports with many options. There are many shacks and famous one is brittos....
Crowded Beach,Baga Beach is always crowded but still you go everytime whenever in Goa.Best Food is also here at Brittos right on Baga Beach.
Nice beach,Best for watersports.... Many options.... Nice restaurants... Good for families... Clean water ..... Amazing veiw .....
awesome place,awesome place to hangout and one of the famous beach. they provide alcohol and hookah on the beach. Don't miss the nights in beaches and street of Goa.
Good and heart of Goa,This place is for nightlife lovers and full of daytime activities too. This place is heart of Goa alive round the year
Goa in wheelchair,"Hello Fellas,Being an Indian its always a wish and must visit place Goa. So this time I decided to travel to north Goa in spite of all the negative reviews i got for visitors on wheelchair.Well at the outset I didn't get disappointed but there is lot more that needs to be done in terms of accessibility .I'm completely wheelchair bound and traveled from bangalore to goa and stayed in 'Estrela Do Mar Beach Resort'.Try to book a hotel/resort that are near to beaches or has pathways to beaches so thats its easier to go near the beach in wheelchair.; but if you want to enter the water either you have to reverse your wheelchair or needs to be carried as there is no complete accessibility.You can enjoy the sunset at shacks, few water activity(depending on your disability) like sitting in the ocean water, dolphin cruise and jet skiing etc.The sea food here is awesome; so dont miss it for anything; we went to Britto's and the experience was amazing with sunset view(ask staff to help you or someone attending the bed will be able to help you by giving some money).And finally the churches; nearly all churches are wheelchair accessible, so visiting them should not be an issue.The one thing i missed to experience is getting onto Cruise, but to rest of the places you can somehow go there and enjoy.I would definitely recommend people in wheelchair to explore goa and enjoy the food and beaches and churches. Cheers!!Naveen Kumar"
A Beautiful beach with beautiful sunset view,My family visited the beach in the evening and were surprised with the crowd. It was packed with people. The White sand and cleanliness was well maintained. We felt so peaceful and relaxed that we ended up spending entire evening till night on the beach sipping chilled beer. The DJ music from the beach restaurants will keep you moody and going.
Very crowded but lively !!,We came to the beach in the evening thinking that being off season it would be empty but were surprised to find it over crowded like in the month of December/ January. Most of the shacks and restaurants were open and doing roaring business.
Enjoyment,Clean beach to have fun with the family or friends.Good spot for all the water sports. have shacks to relax at the beach.
Beach to chill üèñ ,This beach was great!! Crowded but nothing else is amazing water sports n whole lot of Fun !!!Best place to hangout with friends and Family Bago to baga!! üòÜüòÜ
"Huge beach, big crowd","This is probably the largest of Goan beaches. Lot of shacks and water sports but is not as clean as the South Goa beaches. If you are a fan of rustling and bustling crowd and lot of activities , then this place is good."
Horrified - Broken Glass Everywhere,"Moved from South Goa to North Goa - different worlds. Not just litter everywhere but Baga Beach was littered with broken glass and broken glass bottles. We were horrified, without exaggeration we picked broken glass/bottles up every 100m and dropped them off at the next lifeguard station.  No bins to be seen. I would not visit this beach especially with children. If you have had any similar experiences please contact  the Department of Tourism, Government of Goa who welcome feedback on any aspect of tourism in Goa. You can send your suggestions, complaints, requests, queries etc by email to dir-tour.goa@nic.in"
Not for couples,Not clean...not good for couples.... crowded.....but good for water sports...and ...good shacks....with good parking facilities...
'Everything' in this beach!,The most famous and crowded among all the beaches of Goa. Guess you will get anything and everything here!
Clean and Pleasant,"Being from Mumbai, I was amazed to see the cleanliness on the beach. It was an amazing experience to finally dip ur feet in the ocean without plastic bags getting at your feet. The ambience was lively. A lot of places to chill on the beach. The place has a market near to it but a little costly unless u can bargain for a fair price."
good but crowded,Good for get-togethers. if you like crowd than this is your place. its always packed up till 2-3 am. there are loads of shacks one after another and some of the most popular nightclubs like titos
"Baga Beach is ""Happening"" beach","Cleanliness is next to Godliness. Yes, that's what Baba beach stands for. Natural ambience, amazing Music, good food and drinks what else you want in life..."
Good beach ,Excellent beach to visit with family... Wonderful view and you can enjoy with familyMust visit in Goa
Couple Trip,The trip was awesome and the baga beach was very relaxing as it was very neat and clean.Will visit this place again in future.
Dirty mess!,"Iv been to Goa and India several times since 1995, but now this is so severe what's happening in Goa and India. It's becoming a filthy place like a dumpster. There's rubbish all over the place. In sea, at the beach and streets. So terrible. Indians should be ashamed! What will you live of and for when the tourists never get back and the nature and sea life are dying out? This is a criminal offence to the people of this planet and to our next generation of children growing up."
Baga Beach Goa,"Hi,Goa, This is one of best place to enjoy with no worries in india, Goa is famous for Beaches, Goan food, Night Paties etcFrom Nipani (My native place) we started our journey at morning 9.00 am with my friends via Ajara,Amboli ghat sawantwadi and directly reached to calingute beach at 12.30pm, After reaching beach first we have parked our car in paid parking of rs 100/-rs for 12 hr, and we went to beach and enjoyed rides n taken lunch at HOTEL MARATHA for Rs 100/- fish thali, Lunch was good, and after playig on beach upto 6.00 pm we went BAGA Beach by car which is very near about 2 km and also famous for night parties,In baga beach night parties are going on upto night 2.00 to 3.00 am, baga beach is very nice for night party"
Water sport ,The water sport in bata beach are many but they charge in different way ..first u have to buy tickets from vendor for jet ski rs 900 and than when u will reach there for the sport the driver will tell u to give 2000 ...ooooo..more for double ride...as this will be useless 1 min..even while going the tickets the vendor will tell u give money to the driver for the ride...my question  why are u charging 900 than u can charge 2900 only ..they are cheating customer there....government there please look into it...or all your tourist  will be harassed.  ....
Very dirty,Beach is very dirty and overcrowded. It could be cleaned and well developed. If developed it could become the best beach of goa
Used to be Paradise,Over comercialisation & under-regulation means it is dirty & overcrowded.All the good restaurants now cater for mass tourism.Keep well away unless you are one.
Good for sports,Good for sports activity - visitors were doing para sailing and the motor boats were available -  large number of tourists
Busy and bustling beach,We visited at a 'supposed' off season but found the beach extremely busy. All usual available water sports though we didn‚Äôt participate. Best thing to do is rent a beach chair (100 rs/hour) and enjoy the view.
Beautiful Beach,"Going to Baga beach was a nice experience. The soothing breeze at the beach made it an experience to remember. Enjoyed the water sports. The shacks prepared very delicious dishes. As the night set in, the area became very happening. One negative though, the menace of stray dogs has to be curbed."
Baga beach ,Great beach i never been such good beach very clean and maintsined by beach authority. You get shacks for people don't want to njoy the beach its Rs. 100 / per hour if you bargain then you might get for 1 1/2 hrs.  Pls visit good fun for kids n all. Baga beach at night too good pls visit but only adults as children will be bored.
Baga beach,Good place and the atmosphere is also good rides are also there and shacks provide great food ...best when visited at night
Most enjoyable beach in goa,"visited few other beaches - anjum , vagator , calangute . But none of them as lively as Baga. dont miss titos lane and bargains"
The beach is clean ,We had visited baga beach in the month of April and we had an amazing experience over here. Want to enjoy positive vibes then do sit over here and enjoy the view with soothing breeze and sunlight kissed.
Dogs on the beach,When you get  to the beach and you find the shack  you want to relax most of the time you'll have a dog underneath your lounger I didn't mind that so much but it's when they get up Go poo everywhere and there is nobody  there to clean it all up and at times there is a lot of rubbish around as they only come and clean once a day on the beach and watch out in the sharks when you're thinking of having chicken it's a lot of rabbit so be careful
A safe and fun beach,"The beach was pretty neat, I could see the government cleaning staff work hard everyday.But people need to be a little more responsible, broken liquor bottles wash up the shore and I fortunately saw one and didn't step on it."
excellent beach with great night life,most happening beach of the north Goa i believe specially Tito's lane.One can enjoy best seafood with drinks on the beach shaks
One of the best beach in India,This is another crowded beach but its beautiful and you would feel like to spend more time here than Calangute beach.Best beach for water activities in Goa and it has some the best food shacks in Goa and its more fascinating in night as it more beautiful in night
Had Fun,"Although it was hot, we had fun at this beach near the Calangute beach. It is named after the Baga creek.We enjoyed water sports, had tasty food at the shacks and ended the day partying at Disco."
Not the beat,"This beach was OK, but it was a little crowded compared to other beaches in Goa. It was also a little bit polluted with people leaving their trash everywhere."
Best beach of Goa!,Baga beach is undoubtedly best sea beach in Goa. Sacks along the sea shore prepares delicious dishes. We liked grilled shark from a shack . Disco theque lovers must visit Tito's .
Go to this beach if you want to see the rush and less management.,What would a person do on a beach where there are thousands of people roaming around. I spent 600 rupees for a return journey in an auto which I am thinking was a waste. I would have hardly spent 5 mins over there.
Happening place,"this is must visit place in Goa, specially at night. Nights are very very happening and lively at Baga beach. One can have drink at beach shacks or can just simply sit at the beach and enjoy the drink. This is absolutely safe at night.Though it is a bit over crowed but still you will enjoy the ambiance."
Best Beach,"This beach is a must visit when in calangute or at baga,lots of beach sports at this beach,beach is secured"
There are lot of things to do but a lot of people as well.,"It is over crowded almost all the time.Yes there a lot to things to do in the proximity, like there are the best night clubs around there are a lot of water sports activities offered.The place has limited space to park vehicles and is a narrow lane so you may encounter traffic jams sometimes.There are many shacks around, so food and rinks wont be a problem.There are life guards on the beach which adds to your safety."
Buckingham beach shack,Highly recommend this shack on the beach we were looked after very very well by Vicky Denzil Rio ( Ricky ) & the rest of the staff until the next time Cheers. üëç
Most happening beach in North Goa,Baga has become the most happening beach on North Goa. One can spend good time whether it is during the day or late in the evening. The place remains quite lively till late in the night.
North Goa,Baga beach is one of the most popular beach of Goa. It is between Baga river in north and calangute beach in south. It is one of the longest sandy shore. We have enjoyed lots here in morning time.
lovely beach,"this is a nice beach with loads of shacks and restaurants to eat at, love the vibe of this place - will definitely visit again."
Stray dogs and Liquor bottles strewn around spoil the beautiful beach experience,"In addition to stray dogs and ""literate litterers"", the uncontrolled hawkers pestering you very minute queers the pitch for the beautiful beach. Spent an evening with the family and dined in one of the numerous beach shacks."
"Bags beach,Hoa","Beautiful white sandy beach,plenty of eating places,service excellent,people so kind,sea fabulous,all round supper place,will definitely visit again"
nIce beach,found baga beach to be lovely however same problem wit litter in surrounds. Also tends to get crowded with locals which one would expect being so close to a large town
Cool beach bit mental at times. ,"Overall nice beach,  can get very busy,  the shacks are quite nice to chill at and sunbathe.  The water is quite rough,  and the sunset is nice to enjoy with a beer.  Depending on what you want,  this is probably the busiest beach in North goa we've been to,  nice vibe and you don't get hassled as much as other places.  South goa is far far more chilled."
Baga main public beach - horrendous,"Went on a sunday, absolutely packed with loads of visitors from Northern India just standing in groups, drinking too much, throwing their beer bottles and rubbish on the sand. Really noisy and really busy. A shame as there is no need to litter the beaches. dirty nappies, beer bottles, water bottles etc everywhere.  A lot of drunken people in the sea, the life guards had a mammoth task trying to get them to stay close to the beach as the majority were not swimmersCouldnt wait to leave and wont be going back. Sad state of affairs"
Best beach for night life!,"This is probably the most famous beach of Goa and most crowded as well. Though the beach feels great during daytime, however , during night the beach is more happening. There are lots of shacks playing music with great level of illumination and seems fascinating. Water sports can be tried here as well during daytime."
Watersports ,"Good for watersports with locker facility for your valuable stuffs on rental base. Evening time are the best for watersports. The bad thing in Baga beach is if you go direct to the watersports counter the response is bit low, if you go through a agency the response is good and you can finish your activities faster."
Bags beach a mixed bag,Nice enough beach however be aware of sun lounger prices some are free but you will be badgered every half an hour to buy food or a drink .Others are not free and be careful when enquiring as you will be told 100 rupees however you are nit told this is per hour and again you will be consistently asked if you wanted food or drinks aswell as some guy tapping his watch at you reminding you how long you have left [which actualy made us give up and leave}Also we witnessed two guys being hauled up the beach due to badly cutting their feet on broken bottles which you cannot see while swimming or paddling in the sea.Infact we were told the injuries happen to around 10 people a day.Overall it‚Äôs a mixed bag nice enough beach although around the fringes of the beach it was very dirty and rubbish is dumped in any available free area.
Very well maintained and happening place,Good place to have a partying. Always crowded and bubbling with people.Clean beach and has water sports. Must visit.
Baga beach in North Goa,It's a crowded place. night life in this area is good. Tito's is near to this place. Lots of food options are also available here. You can also enjoy candle night dinner. Water sports are also available here.
Awesome watersports,"Its one the most famous party beach of Goa...Night parties are famous here....Calancutte beach is just attached to it...Market area around it is good for shopping clothes,making tatoos,crafts pieces ..I did parasailing and jet skite rides which were awesome..Do not take scuba diving here as it is not value for money and they keep you for few minutes under water charging huge amount....Andaman nicobar islands are best for scuba diving...Local hair braiding and temporary tatto maker are also good and you can try...You have good roof rest places here with good bars for refreshing drink .......The best ride here is parasailing which is value for money...The place is crowdy yet happening...You can get boat house party from here for four hours in a day...check pics"
Restrict the beach sellers,We have visited Goa before but have never encountered so many people on the beach trying to sell you various items. The hunt in packs and are very persistent do take no for and answer.    Other visits once you said no they tended to leave you alone. The ones we encountered just keep coming back it has now come to the point that we spend more time by the hotel pool. The beach  Shaks are losing trade as a result of the beach sellers    It would be a shame if we did not return due to the beach sellers but they need to be controlled somehow.
Beach,"Busy beach, plenty of choices for food and drink, relaxing during the day , party atmosphere at night..."
Best evening chill,It‚Äôs goa best place to chill your self and calm place.. there have lots of good restaurants and pubs just you can have fun .. if you are tourist to goa must visit Baga Beach its awesome Thanks
Dirty and terrible crowd on new years eve,This place is not safe for women on new years eve. Its too crowded with terrible crowd trying to grope women...its not fun on other times also because its dirty with no proper toilets
Busy baga,The happening beach of Goa is calangute and Baga as far as north Goa is considered.Lot of good shacks and eateries with shops for local shopping present here .Water sports can also be done here..It's a bit more crowded and a lil dirty here as compared to other beaches can't compalin much as it has the maximum tourists.
Most happening beach in Goa,"This is undoubtedly the most happening beach in Goa. you will find a lot of space in the open air to sit back and relax, lot of shack around. you will get some dance floors in the evening."
Awful,"The Blackpool of India. We went down to baga beach for the evening and quickly turned around and left. It was the noisiest, busiest, brightest, most garish place and not at all a pleasurable experience. Litter everywhere and all of the bars competing for the loudest music. Not the relaxed beach atmosphere we were hoping for."
Very busy. Sea rough,"Lots of beach shacks line the shore. Many have WiFi and sun beds free to use so long as you buy your drinks or food. Sellers come along frequently selling clothes, jewellery, pedicure, threading, massage etc.  The sea is generally quite rough so not for weak swimmers. Good sand beach."
Average beach üèñ. Goa has better beaches,I travelled to Baga beach last weekend with a couple of my friends. It didn‚Äôt meet my expectations at all. Pros:_____Night life and lot of shacksView is good Cons:______Very dirty( glass pieces fallen here and there)Zero Maintenance Changing rooms were darkAn Overpriced and overhyped placeNOTE: Better to go for other beaches in Goa ( South Goa ) or Arambol/ Morjim.
MOST HAPPENING PLACE,Always busy but full of activities good choice of shacks for meals and drinks facing the sea.A must visit while in Goa
Baga Beach,"Better Than Calangute due to less crowds, more Music and better Services. Has a Nice Glow Sign for Selfies. The Usual Budget Friendly Beach Front Resto-Bar-Cafe's Galore."
Good beach heavily crowded,It is well organised beach. There are many water activities which can be explored here. There are many beach shacks here.In October I did not came sense any sea breeze here. It was very hot and humid.
Sky lark,Excellent food and service always so good.Clean beds excellent service and lively staffA good meeting place excellent toilet facilities and plenty of room at the tables
Must visit place for the first timer,"This place is a must visit if you are visiting north Goa for the first time. It offers scenic view and water sports. As this place is a bit crowdy, I personally don't prefer that much."
Crowds upon crowds. Beach is definitely for people peepers ,"I can never see what people are seeing, I know we all have different form of opinions but I found this beach probably the busiest beach. Full of tourists and just way to overcrowded there was not a patch of water that you could take a photo of. (I tried desperately) People everywhere, overcrowded with sun beds, kids, beach balls. I had a driver take me to all many of beaches in Goa to see the best ones around and this one was by far was craziest and busiest. I‚Äôve seen lots of reviews saying the (ignorant) Russians are taken over the beaches but I will in fact agree. There was a lot of Russians on this beach and in the bars. While on sun loungers just thrown out orders for more drinks. You‚Äôll always notice them they‚Äôre the ones that like to be noticed. The loud ones. But I definitely didn‚Äôt like this beach. Tho I will say I liked the fact they‚Äôd a little cloth pathway down to the beach so you weren‚Äôt struggling to walk on the sand. The shops around this area are really reasonable and most shops are willing to negotiate on prices. The water sports prices here are really good also."
"Crowded beach, food for sport activitiea","We generally prefer beach side property, so paying a visit to Baga beach is only because of Brittos. One gets a nice view while having their food and drinks. This beach is also known for it's late night parties.. so visit if you are with friends during evening!"
The Beautiful Baga!!,"Baga Beach is one of the very popular beaches of Goa .It is clean, serene and I found it more beautiful at night."
Baga beach,"Nice place to visit ' lots of activities are there . Kneeboarding,  jet skiing, Banana Tube  Boat  Ride, White water rafting, Scuba Diving, wind Surfing, wakeboarding,"
To be honest.,"Baga beach is the busiest of one long sandy beach that stretches from Baga south for several miles. It‚Äôs a broad stretch of sand fronted by beach shacks where sun beds are free and the shack boys will keep you in cold beer and snacks all day for a few dollars. Various non aggressive vendors will offer to cut your nails, massage your shoulders, pluck your eye brows or clean out your ears for a couple of bucks. There are stray dogs and the odd cow. Take beach shoes because the trek to the sea is like walking on hot coals. There are breakers on the shoreline that can get a bit dodgy so be careful with young kids or if you have walking difficulties. Most Indians can‚Äôt swim and they like to frolic in the waves in their underpants or fully clothed. At night it can be quite magical with hundreds of candlelit tables set out in front of the shacks. Here the Indians will hit the alcohol, shine their lasers at passing aircraft, smoke hookahs and go beserk on the makeshift dance floors to insane Bollywood music. There are a few Europeans but the nouveau rich from Mumbai on three day party breaks come by the thousand. Thankfully Russian tourism has dropped to a trickle but their arrogance has been replaced by Russian drug mafia who have started bringing in Russian prostitutes. So Baga is no longer a hippie haven. It‚Äôs a Marmite town. You love it to bits or you hate the place. It‚Äôs brash, dirty and noisy. It‚Äôs the Blackpool of Mumbai. Personally, I love the place."
"Great beach, shame it's filled with Russians ","A nice beach vibe only tempered by drunk Russians who only seem to like to mix with other drunk Russians, if you like drunk Russians or are a drunk Russian yourself then it's the place to be but for an English tourist the experience was kind of ruined"
noisy and littered,"a great long beachwater choppy so lifeguards stop you going in too deep... safety great but constant whistle blowing stops peace as does all the bars competing with their load musicparking charges about 30rupeewatersports avaialble loungers avaialble with purchases from the owning bar dogs and cows roaming around, they dont bother you unless you call them overlitter thrown everywhere and no attempt seen to be cleaned up.... but also little in the way of bins so not suprising so mich litterbe careful of thr fishermen, they just walk out into the sea, walk around you, wrap their net around you and then shout at you..... and if you are fairskinned be aware of the paparazzi taking your photo and video of you all the time... they arwbt even discreet"
Popular Beach Of North Goa.,"Baga Beach seems to be an extension of Calangute Beach. As you walk north of Calangute Beach you will see a huge signboard on the hillside indicating the northern end of Baga Beach. There is no clear demarcating line between Baga and Calangute.There are a lot of water sports activities taking place here. If you come during the daylight hours you will observe people enjoying parasailing, water skiing, banana boat riding and swimming in the sea. The beach is always crowded in the holiday season.We were sitting at one of the beach restaurants, ‚ÄòBritto‚Äôs‚Äô and observing the frenzied activities taking place on the lovely sands. It is a crowded beach and not one where one can relax with a book to read, though there are many sundecks which the Europeans hire from the local vendors, to give themselves a deep tan.The Anjuna Flea Market and the Arpora Saturday Night Bazaar are quite close to Baga Beach."
First Time Goa Experience on Feb 2019,I happened to visit Goa with my Family on the 2nd week of February and the Climate was almost good enough. We reached on Saturday night and as you all know there is no OLA or Uber in GOA. And the Taxi charges are very high. After getting down at Goa Airport we went to book the taxi at Airport Prepaid Taxi counter and got our 4km ride booked for 250rs.( which is quite pricey but you ain't got a choice there). We got our Hotel booked at Hotel La-Paz Gardens which was good and we stayed that night safe and had a great buffet breakfast. We got our prepaid cars booked with Zain cars which was walkable distance from the hotel. The Car was neat and in good condition. However we took pictures and vedios of the car before taking it. A deposit of 5000rs  and per day 1400 rent for the car. Fuel was less (took a pic of it) and we went to our hotel to checkout as we had our Main hotel Acasa Vagator in Vagator on North Goa. It was a 45kms drive and it was awesome. There were many awesome and great cafe's on the way. We checked in at Acasa vagator and it was simply superb and worth of money. Had a great meal at Cafe Cotinga and then we headed to Baga beach. Next day we went to EVA cafe for our breakfast ( one of the best foods with sea view - GREAT ) and then Atlantis Watersports center and got our water  sports booked at an affordable rates than to the ones when we checked at the Beach. Then we headed for street side shopping ( don't forget to bargain- if 300 is said by the seller ask for 120rs -150rs max). Went to Baga Beach to enjoy the Water sports and thought someone as a co-ordinator would assist us to the waterports but as a shock found no one to help us. At the Beach Watersport counter we gave our Booking ticket and those local guys gave us 1 slip for one ride ( it is like after everyride we have to come and collect the next coupon for the next ride) and they would also charge 200 per person to take photo or vedio just for the Parasailing sport. No bills will be given for it. The locals will lure you to pay extra money for all the sports. Go for Jet-ski first where one by one will be taken for a small round and you could take pics on your mobile phone. Then Parasailing - where you can take your phones. After that it was the Banana boat ride ( one of the best)  for which you cant take the phones or wear glasses. You can then keep your phone in locker with the Beach Watersport counter guys for another 200rs.later on went to the shacks had great food and enjoyed. Next day went to the island boat ride trip (also from Atlantis )and during the boat ride through Sea you could see Fort Aguada and Dolphins swimming near by after which they will take the boat and anchor it some it near an island and shall do Snorkelling (only those who breath through mouth well) and fishing. After that they will take us to a beach and provide Lunch and after sometime they will take us back to the pickup point. Went to party and shopping and next day took a complete day rest at the hotel and enjoyed at the pool. We checked out at the evening and went to return our car. The Zain car travel guys dropped us to the Airport for just an extra 200rs.Note: Please dont take liquor bottles on your backpack or carry-in bags instead please put it inside the Luggage with clothes wrapped nicely to it. If you forget to do it and after the boarding pass is got then we head for the security check for bag scanning. If they catch it there then then will ask you to throw away the bottles you have on their dustbins. Found many throwing it as they didnt have much time.It was a great and budget friendly Holiday experience. Thanks & Sorry for such a brief experience shared.
best beach in Goa,not just the blue waters but the beauty and serenity of baga beach is at par in Goa and its away from the crowded hustlw of other regular beaches...
"Nice beach , however a little over Crowded","one of the must visit beaches as it offers water sports , shacks & nightclubs , however you might find it a little overcrowded at times."
Very clean beach ,Have lounges at 100 rupees a hour. Offers drinks food and massages. Only down side is that there are kids around yet hukka are served next to them. Non smokers would not be happy to be at any lounges.
Spend Every Day:Wont to miss it,Spend every night 2-3 hrs before going to bed. Good Beach to spend with Family. Have more fun by doing bath and dance. Have lots of the Beach Shark Restaurant
Awesome,Amazing beach couplr friendly and make sure not to waste money there bargainbeach n every water sports
crowded but enjoyable!,"I think so most crowded beach of Goa. Lots of shacks there henceforth provide good option for food, snacks and drinks. Beach is neat and clean with good sea waves. Many water sports are available here though quite expensive in comparison to other beach of Goa. Always crowded but worth visiting especially at night....fantastic night life!"
Wonderful Place to Visit,Baga beach is one of the best beach in North Goa. It has neat and clean beach. The restaurants near the beach were excellent. One can enjoy the beauty of nature here.
Great beach,A few miles of sandy clean beach !One one side of the beach : warm clean water ! on the othe side of the beach : an endless number of beach shacks serving delicious food and good drinks !
Cheap Crowd and Noisy Beach,Full of dust .. Most worst Beach of goa.. Crowd is very cheap. If you want to relax then this is not for you. Very Dirty water
Terrible filled with cheap drunk crowd,"There are a lot of nice beaches in Goa. Don't waste your time at Baga beach. Its loud hindi music blaring from every shack, Loads of drunk people. Terrible place for foreigners and any and all women."
The Kuta of India,"I liken this beach to Kuta in Bali, Indonesia.  If you want to be where the action is go here.  If you want to relax and have some peace and quiet go to another beach."
Great beach area,"Another great beach with lots of lounge chairs and umbrellas; beachfront restaurant.  Clean area, nice tan-color sand, with gentle whitecaps; good for wadding or swimming.  Lots of locals with families there when I went. Nice place to relax with cool fruit drink."
Crowded,"This beach is fully crowded & have no fun on visiting in daylight. But in night, this beach is heaven. It would be a bit more crowdy but you have triple the fun in compare to daylight.The place is fully lit up. Shacks are decorated with lights and they run loud music. But they are permit to run music in open till 12. So remember to be there before 9 so you could have enough time to enjoy."
One of the best beaches,"Though a little crowded but the ambience, the excitement you feel here is mesmerising.Water sports here are good and do try fish fingers at pyramid restaurant on the beach super delicious!!To all the first timers, buy water sports package as a whole do not so it separatelyEnjoy your beach timeüòâ"
Good and famous Goa beach,The beach is quiet famous. It is crowded most of the time. You can enjoy good water sports at a decent price. Try bargaining a bit. Overall there are so many good shacks for food and relaxing. Beach side oil massage can be taken. The crowd is okay sorts. Overcrowded beach.
Baga beach,"Another famous beach of Goa, this beach is always filled with lot of people. Foreigners here are comparatively less. There are numerous shacks all throughout the beach."
Paradise remains,"This would be our 15th visit to Baga Beach and we have already started planning our next one. It still remains one of the hottest destinations in Goa and in India as well, ie if you love relaxing on the beaches. We were staying in South Goa for 3 nights and then moved to Baga for 1 night and the difference was so apparent. There was a buzz of life all around, the shacks were great, the service was better, food was better and so was the environment. Its clearly a happening place. one can walk on the Baga Calangute road and kill time doing window shopping and walking into any restaurant on the road itself.Though its become very crowded the feeling is quite different. Waiting for my next trip.."
Busy Beach But Lots of Tents,"This very popular beach at Baga has lots of tented areas and is very busy. Lots of young people parading about. There are many water sports going on- wind surfing, jet skiing, canoeing, and swimming too if that is what you enjoy. Quite windy when we were there."
Best beach for celebration.,It is Best beach for celebration. never sleeping beach of goa. one can enjoy his time here 24 seven.All the felicities are available here. Food Drink Massages etc.
Baga Beach,Awesome beach. Anyone can enjoy a lot in the beach. Very clean beach with lots of drinks available all round. People can be fully relaxed in the beach without any doubt. Beach full of hottest girls from allround the world
Amazing Experience ,"It's an amazing beach, one of the best beaches you can find in India.Major attraction of Goa,its always crowded with tourists.Here you can try many water sports,  or just be there on the shacks and watch the tides.Can be visited anytime during day or night."
To much crowded and hyped,"I along with my school friends visited this place on 27th Jan.  Why this beach is loved by many people is because of lot of Colors (?) ,Shacks, night life. Too much crowded."
The Beach for Night Life,Amazing beach for night life !Food was excellent. Music was too good. A must visit beach in Goa. Tourist friendly.
Lots of noise ,Visited Baga beach for the first time. On the facade all seems well Clean and tidy until you venture to the rear then the usual Indian mess and rubbish appears Very sad a out that.Beach has life guards who whistle a lot but in the main are on their mobile phones most of rhe time.Tourist Police are about which is reassuring until you observe they are also on their mobiles!
Best in Goa,This beach is one of most amazing beaches in Goa with lots of pubs and restaurants. You get to see crowd all the time 24 X 7
Love the evening ambience,Evenings are very happening in BAGA with tents and candle light dinners. Best time to visit is  Oct-Feb
Nice Beach,"This was a great beach with lots of shacks serving tasty food as per your taste buds,lots of water sports is there on the beach,a must visit."
Most happening beach of india,"Baga beach gives everything what has been expected from a beach whether full day sun bath at beach sack with delicious sea food and drink , Best night life.One must visit for fun and enjoyment with family."
"Overhyped, loud & dirty",Baga is the must visit place in Goa for tourists due to the large beach & attraction of famous night clubs. Unfortunately the beach has completely degenerated into a restaurant strip where each place plays loud music leading to a cacophony which turns one off completely. Other beaches further ahead like Anjuna or Vagator are better options now compared to Baga.You should only go here if you like being in a carnival the entire time.
Too crowded !!!,Just another beach which is totally commercialized with too many shacks mushroomed up playing blasting loud music competing with each other in the night . All sorts of drunken goons moving around eve teasing and ogling single females. Daytime could bit be better sans the unruly crowds and loud shacks.
Heart of Goa,"This place is certainly why people visit Goa. Water sports , beach fun , shacks , sunset Pubs , Bars and then night life. Everything you want is here. Night life can be enjoyed till 3 in the morning. The place is mostly crowdy and lively."
Enjoyable!,We visited this beach in night.. it was lively with all the valentine decor and music... just out side the beach there is market area were u can purchase all kind of stuff! There were lot of cows resting around the beach and dint bother about the people! parking area is reasonable and you have to find right one! There are other private parking area who charge hefty amount from visiters.. In and outside of the beaches there are cafes and restaurants who provide u good food and very good musical ambience! People were playing( not swimming) in water even at night! Good beach!
Lovely n Happening Beach ...,This is the most happening beach of North Baga .. Most of the happening places of North Goa are in and around this Beach .. Lots of Water Sports .. A fun place to be ...
Nice Beach,"I stayed in Baga with my friend and our hotel offered a free shuttle to Baga Beach everyday - we spent most of our ""beach days"" here for the convenience. It is a very busy beach, but there are plenty of beach shacks and sun beds which set you back slightly from the crowds. I would say if you want it a bit quieter, perhaps walk down a bit further.There are lots of domestic tourists as well as British and Russian tourists. There are lifeguards on the beach, so make sure if you want to go swimming you look at the flags, because the tide/current is very strong.Lots of stray dogs and some litter - not the cleanest beach, but definitely worth a visit.At night the sun beds are stacked up and you can enjoy dinner and cocktails by candlelight, which is lovely!"
A very busy but fun beach,Baga beach is incredibly busy during the day and night. In my opinion it‚Äôs like the Blackpool of Goa. That‚Äôs not to say that‚Äôs a bad thing as plenty of people love Blackpool too it just is what it is. It‚Äôs busy with domestic tourists during the day and light up like the golden mile at night.It‚Äôs fun just very very busy.
Supeb beach,I went to go as I was attending marriage of my friend. Next day evening I visited this beach along with calungute beach as it is adjacent to this beach. City bus available from panaji to here. Beach is clean and attractive. One can enjoy this beach with family and friends .
Busiest Beach,Baga is one of the best beach in Goa. It's a most busiest beach and full of activity in the seasons. I highly recommend this beach to visit by everyone. And also the beach sack restaurants are serving very tasty foods.
"Nice, clean but crowded beach.","Baga Beach is situated on the north of North Goa. It is a long , clean beach with golden sand. Because of its popularity though at week ends it can get really crowded. Para sailing, motorboat riding and a lot of water based activities are provided at the beach apart from the usual messages and vendors of jewellary."
Beaches of North Goa,The most popular beach...Very crowdedLoud musicBut beach is good but not exoticFamily and friends fun Beach
Busy Beach,Even though Baga is one of the busiest beaches in North Goa. It has a great choice of beach shacks and beach bars along the beach. Will definitely return.
One of the worst beaches in North Goa,"This is most unclean and crowded beach in north goa. Avoid it if you want some peaceful time. But you can get cheaper water sports here,"
Complete in itself.,"So this place is like , u go once u will want to visit more here. The beach is like any other beach with water sports but the nightlife at this place is best. I mean the restaurants have music playing till 12 . And ppl dancing like having fun. The food in those restaurants is average and also costly but I recommend for dancing partying. After 12 u can go to clubs So this one beach I found really amazing. The nightlife specifically is amazing for young crowds looking to party all night. There is music playing near beach restaurants till 12am, playing some of the awesome dance numbers and fun loving crowd.Go in big friend groups I would suggest. After 12 am u can go to any club in Tito's Lane nearby. I would like to make special mention of Mambo's club. Here ladies entry is free but the place is just beyond any words to describe. The dj was super awesome and crowd too was mix of sophisticated and fun loving. The dance floor is underground so the loud music can't be heard from outside. It's a must visit kind of club."
Dirty beach dirty water,No no noWhy do you do this to your place?People through rubbish from the beach clubs anywhere on the beach during the night and this beach is really dirty I don't like it at all

Nice,Baga beach is awesome..... baga beach is part of twins beach. Near this beach food facilities available.
great goa beach,"baga beach is one place where everyone wants to go while in goa... name a thing and its there ... water sports, shacks, spas... god kt closeby... ofcourse titos pub etc... beach is generaly full specially on weekends but the water is calm and beach is nice"
Busy beach at times,Lovely beach with plenty of shacksCan be very busy at weekends but it is still possible to find quiet areas on the beach
Authorities! Ban glass! Clean up the beach!,"Went here yesterday as a change from calangute. From afar it is a must more visually satisfying place but walking around is such a letdown when you see all the rubbish and broken glass bottles thrown everywhere. If you have kids be especially careful, I cut my foot open on a glass shard buried in the sand."
Nice beach,It's a nice beach with lot of sports activities to enjoy. Lot of food shacks are there which offers good food. Coast guards are always on duty and guide tourists.
Go goa go Baga,Must visit nice place party hub nice food familiar people night is very charming must visit maza aa jayega
Average beach,Frequented by many Domestic Indian Tourists who leave rubbish all over the beach. Always busy and there are better beaches further afield
Annoying Cows,Goa tries its best to be clean but thats never gonna happen with free ranging cows at beaches & roads. Watch ur step.
Great,this place is simply awesome if you are on a vacation and I would like to personally recommended to each and everyone
Good beach but too crowded,Thus beach was also like calangute but slightly less crowded.Likes the sea facing restaurant  three. Anyways we enjoined theb trip
Nice beach !!,"Great place to be when in Goa. Beach is kept clean and safe with ample presence of cleanliness volunteers and Cops to assist and take care of the tourists and prevent any mischief. Lots of beach shacks and restaurants all along the length of the beach and clean and ample beach beds to relax. Water sports like para sailing, boating and other water rides are also available. All around the beach you will get scenic view and greenery.If you are using bikes that are available on hire and suddenly find yourself running short on fuel, worry not for there are lots of places where you will find locals selling petrol in bottles that will help you reach the nearest petrol station to fill up.Barely 5 kms from the famous Calangute Beach one can visit both in a day."
loud and flashy.,"Just very crowded, noisy and even dirty. If you are visiting Goa for beautiful and clean beaches, good authentic food or just to chill you can avoid this beach."
Loved It.,"I just loved Baga beach....Awesome view, Sea, beach and good food.Perfect place to enjoy your holidays.‚ù§Ô∏è"
Baga Beach Goa,"Baga beach is the one of the most famous and beautiful beach of goa which is situated near panjim.Best time to visit goa is Oct to FebPlease watch My video to have the detailed knowledge of Goa Bagha beach.If you want to view my Goa videos search my channel name :- 'Shivanshu jaiswal' in youtube you can get all the information about all the beaches, famous places of goa"
Needs a little discipline. Sound pollution,"While the beach it‚Äôs self for the most part was clean, water good . Life guards very good . But for such a nice beach , it should be spotless, cleaners do clean , but not as well as they should . The beach is open for the most part till midnight, swimming till 5.  The dirty beach side cafes blasting music for about 5 ish with far to much base .It‚Äôs nothing more than sound pollution. The cafes themselves are plenty . They dirty and stinky . They need to be more closely regulated . It is primarily a local tourist location. That‚Äôs not to say the standard should be so low . I enjoyed it for the most part . It was the loud music till late that dampened it ."
"This beach is dirty, noisy, overcrowded, the Tourist Iinfo Centre closed, generally only set foot on it once never again","The whole area around Baga Beach is unattractive, although there are some nice cafes and restaurants to which you can escape.  Our resort there was fine, but the whole environment is noisy, dirty, alcoholic, overcrowded and very unappealing to anyone but hippies or youngsters wanting to drink and sing or gamble the nights away."
A laid back beach in day and happening party at night!!,"Baga beach is a famous beach in Goa. A laid-back beach by the day with people enjoying sea and sun with drinks and foods from shacks, it metamorphoses to a big party in the night with shacks dressed in bright and vibrant lights playing loud music. The place has a good energetic vibe. The crowd stays there till late in the night. In morning, you have options for water sports too. The shacks serve good food. One can enjoy for hours here."
Great beach with a lot of fun activities,Fun and enable place to spend the whole day and even night. Lots of shack for food and beverages along with nice seating with seaview
Baga beach visit early morning,"While staying at Resort Rio, we went to Baga beach early in the morning. The beach was practically empty, but littered with trash from previous night's activities. We got to see some incoming fishing boats bringing in the morning catch. Would have expected a tranquil, serene morning atmosphere, but was disappointed it was not so."
"Great If you like huge gangs of blokes, constant sellers, tatooed westerners and sand full of rubbish -otherwise avoid","Dirty sand full of bottle tops, cigarette ends and spit, never-ending selling from the bar boys to the hawkers, over-priced shack food, rows and rows of beds with red-faced westerners and hundreds of gangs of Indian men in their baggy underwear running in and out of the sea screeching like children or openly ogling or filming the afore mentioned western women.  On a positive note the road and parking situation is improved since last year and the are public toilets negating the need for the charming 'no peeing/pooping' signs (with stick man illustrations to eliminate doubt).  Despite this the amount of men openly urinating in the open right next to the toilets is quite incredibleWith so many other lovely beaches on offer it defies belief as to why anyone would choose to visit here."
"Beautiful Beaches, Must Visit","Its a land of Beaches & old churches. Goa is a popular destination in India, Its a tinny little state having its own beauty.  Awesome place to plan your vocation if anyone planning for 2 to 5 days. Best season to visit this place between Dec. to Jan. especially during New Year but only thing is cost will be very high during this period. So Feb will be best then... Local bus facilities & frequency is very good it's connected almost all the part of Goa. Baga and Calangute beaches are the best beaches of Goa in terms of location and night life. Roads are small and narrow, Expenssive..."
Baga at Night,We visited Baga in Jan 2019. Night Life at Baga beach is something which someone should experience once.
Not what it used to be,"Been going to his for last 8 yrs in a row, from house music to nowadays sapna choudhary playing in the shacks near Titos/ mambos we've come a long way. Not being judgemental here but the crowds have become more loud n liberal I would say so strict no for small children . Rest the food remains the same .Well i went in Jan avoid it cause  when you enter the water for swim you'd end up finding a lot of kingfishers ( especially strong)."
