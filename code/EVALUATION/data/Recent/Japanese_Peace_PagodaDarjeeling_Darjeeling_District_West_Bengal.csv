Beautiful Buddhist Monastery and Stupa.,"The beautiful Buddhist monastery and Peace Pagoda is located near the top of the Jalapahar Hill, about 2 km from the Darjeeling Clock Tower. As we entered the gates we first visited a small Japanese temple with a prayer hall on the first floor. It was built by Japanese monk Fujii who was a close associate of Mahatma Gandhi. Unfortunately it was closed due to onset of the virus pandemic when we visited. Normally it is open to the public for prayers from 4.30 to 6am in the morning, and from 4.30 to 6.30pm in the evening.We walked a little further to the beautifully sculptured stupa, also known as the Japanese Peace Pagoda. The pagoda had beautiful gold plated sculptures of the Buddha in various postures and murals depicting some of the events in his life.The surroundings were very serene and peaceful, with tall pine trees and rhododendron bushes just beginning to flower, and with the majestic Kanchenjunga mountains as the backdrop."
Japanese temple,It was a good decision to go there as I love pagodas. The atmosphere was serene and peaceful and had positive vibes. The lady beating the drum and chanting was very pleasent .Surroundings had beautiful Rhododendron trees . I have never seen such vibrant colours
Serene & sacred,"This place is situated at the fringe of the town on a hilltop amidst of nature & free from hustle-bustle of city life. A two storied temple of lord Buddha, which is also dedicated to world peace and a large white stupa at beside displaying the life & incarnation of lord Buddha are together what apparently meant the place. But among the local Buddhist people, who are in plenty there, this is one of the important religious place and for other people, this place provides a taste of Buddhist heritage, culture & rituals.Entire place is nicely maintained. Inside ambience is sober & calm and total silence is preferred. Interested people can seat in front of deity and participate in the prayer or just feel the tranquility & calmness of the place. We had a memorable experience of listening melodious chant with rhythmic drumming when monks & devotees offering their worship to lord Buddha marching in the courtyard just before dusk.Beside serenity & sacredness, this place also provides an excellent unobstructed view of the entire mountain range. All together, this is one of the main attraction for tourists during Darjeeling trip."
Place to reflect ,As expected peaceful relaxing site. Best of all the religious temple's we visited in Darjeeling The one i will remember.
Peaceful place,The name says the everything!! This is really a peaceful place! A very good ambience with a spectacular mountain view.
Serene!,"It's a brilliant work of art in white. One can have a stunning view of Mt. Kanchenjunga from the place. One has to remove shoes before climbing the stairs leading up to the pagoda. Freezing cold floor, view of Kanchenjunga, stupas adorning the place and warm sun rays would make the view perfect. However there's usually traffic leading to the pagoda hence one might have to walk which is pretty tedious as the road is quite steep."
Normal not so surprising or interesting,Good location nice view of kanchannjunga but generally such view is available from all places in darjeeling
serenity,"A slice of serenity in the chaos that is Darjeeling. The pagoda is stunning in it's elegance and grace sitting on the hill. The white stupa has 4 statues adorning it. You do need to remove your shoes to walk around which wasn't pleasant on a freezing cold and wet morning. Really peaceful, calm place- and a lovely contrast to the untidy Hindu temples."
Beautiful setting,"So peaceful and serene, loved the setting, highly recommended. Good to spend half an hour and soak in the atmosphere."
A small place,max 10 mins visit for this place; such a small japanese temple nothing much; you can take some pictures
Good ,"Good, calm and Serene atmosphere, have to climb a lot as parking is well outside this area, and most of the vehicles will come straight after tiger hill visit and it will always be over crowded"
Spiritually healing experience,"This is a very peaceful and serene place in the midst of Darjeeling. Founded by Japanese Buddhists, it has a prayer hall, a monastery and a pagoda on top of the hill. I participated in the prayer, which was a great experience."
Peaceful Abode,A very beautiful place for peace lovers. The Pagoda was built by a Japanese Monk. Nearby PeacePagoda there also lies a Japanese Temple. Its a must visit place for people seeking peace. The place is also full of nature.
Very peaceful,Its very peaceful place to visit... must visit on your darjelling trip... beautiful place... peace all around
A landmark to check...,"A classic landmark to check, with some view, besides the Japanese temple which is nice too, and simple, especially with the drumming going on..."
Beautiful,"This is a very beautiful place to check out and the structure is very unique especially compared to your usual Indian architecture. If you're into video games, this place looks like it's right out of an Uncharted game."
peace indeed,beautiful serene place a must visit.  On a good day you get a view of the kanchanjunga.....very picturisque
buddist stupa,"Perched on a hillside 2km south of the town centre, the gleaming white, 28m-high Peace Pagoda is one of more than 70 pagodas built around the world by the Japanese Buddhist Nipponzan Myohoji organisation. During the drumming puja (prayers) sessions in the neighbouring temple, visitors are offered a hand drum and encouraged to join in the rituals. Getting here involves a pleasant walk along Gandhi and AJC Bose Rds, past the curiosity-inspiring Institute for Astroparticle Physics and Space Science."
Holy Buddhist site ,This is a wonderful holy Buddhist site in Darjeeling peace pagoda built in Japanese pagoda style . One must visit this place for peace of mind
Great view ,"It’s a beautiful place, very quiet with big trees around. The view from the top is beautiful. Highly recommended."
Totally special.................,"This is a very special place.  For a start, the huge stupa is awesome, beautiful and imposing in equal part, made all the more so when you know it is part of an international project to erect Peace Pagodas all over the world to promote global peace. What is equally impressive is the stone carving round the stupa which is beautiful and made to look like a lovely patinered wood.What really enhances this place, and adds joy, is in the upper prayer hall of the nearby temple building.  If you are lucky your visit will coincide with the chanting of prayers, and drumming.Visitors are offered cushions, drums, and sticks, and can join in the rhythmical drumming.  It is well worth doing because it is an amazing experience."
Serene location ,Worth visiting with a Japanese temple at the entrance and the peace Pagoda has Budha story in carvings. Plenty of steps to climb and hence not recommended for senior citizens with mobility issues.
Top sight and so peaceful,This is really worth a visit with its simple tranquility. There is a small Buddist Temple but the Pagoda is just a place to visiy and admire so no pressure
Serene and lots of flowers,Nice monastery and lots of background information. Worth a visit but not if you have already seen others
Golden Buddha !,"Nice and huge place, there's a huge Golden Buddha open temple kind of structure, which is a nice change to look at. This place requires lot of walking and people can face breathing problems as well slightly, depending on the weather conditions. We went when it was rainy and foggy hence the breathing issue."
Peace and view,This place is so tranquil we walked there from our hotel it was beautiful the pagoda itself is well maintained and feels peaceful the view of Kanchenjunga with background of lord Buddha is pinnacle of happiness
Ok place,Good place...after tiger hill batsia loop point and darjeeling railway..its come 4th number to visit this place...
Peace Pagoda,Nice place to visit. It's a Japanese temple. The view from the temple is awesome and the temple is located in top of a my so there is less crowded. Once you enter the temple you will feel inner peace.
Peace Pagoda,"very serene palace , calm , quiet . place offers good view  of mount Kanchenjunga . nice place to spent some quiet hours."
A peace abode,"The moment you enter you will feel a inner satisfaction and total peace engulfs you.The drum and sticks are given to all during the meditation and you can be one of them,the bang of the drums is like a heartbeat in itself and raises your blood flow.A place not to be missed"
Nice place to be and hike.,We stayed at around Dali station and we walk to the temple. It was already nice to be there on foot and temple was also nice to see.
Peaceful,"Only peaceful spot in darjeeling, view was breathtaking with pinetrees around and view of the valley.it also has japanese temple and we were able to reach in evening when drum beating ceremony was going on"
Refreshing,Not for hectic visit you have to spend time there. Sitting amidst green cover of trees this place is for relaxation and reuniting with oneself. Very clean and natural. Food basically tea coffee and Maggie are available just outside the institution. A good place to relax.
Must visit place around Darjileeng,Peaceful japanese temple and pagoda. It has a scenic view of city from here. Area is well kept. Might get crowded with vehicles as entry/exit gate is small. Have a decent parking place and one more under construction.
Peace pagoda,"I got a chance to chant holy hymn at prayer hall and play the instrument... It's calm, it's peaceful..."
Mesmerizing!!!!,"The Peace Pagoda here showcases four avatars of Buddha. This is the tallest free standing structure in Darjeeling. It's height is 28.5 meters and diameter is 23 meters. As you climb up the stairs in the Pagoda, you will see two concrete models of lions on two sides at a lower level. The avatars of Buddha are all large statues carved in the walls and polished in gold color. The Peace Pagoda was designed by Dr. M Ohka of Japan and took three years to construct."
Nice,"The only Japanese Pagoda in the north east, I believe. Neatly maintained. Worth going in a leisure trip."
Calm and quite ,This is mostly outdoor activity. Darjeeling weather is unpredictable. So be prepared. You don’t need more than 30 mins to see the place unless you cannot find parking at the location.
Peaceful,Quite and peaceful place with beautiful Japanese temple.Scintillating view from the top.Maximum spending time is 1 hr.Have fun.
EXCELLENT,One of the Tourist spots in Darjeeling. It is located just 10 minutes drive from Darjeeling town. Good for bringing family & specially children. A nice spiritual place. View from this Temple is beautiful. Just located nearby is Japanese Temple. I found the visit very relaxing & soothing.
