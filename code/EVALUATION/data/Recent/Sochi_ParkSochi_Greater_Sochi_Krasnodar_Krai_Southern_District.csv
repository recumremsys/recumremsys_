Entertaining,"Busy, colourful, noisy, fun and most differently Russia’s version of a theme park. They do it well. Try it with an open mind and I’m sure you will enjoy. P"
Nice and interesting,"We took aguided tour, the guy was knowledgeable and service oriented.Amazing to see the huge investment to build a fool park for the Olympics I just 5 years.We got there afternoon and in the winter after a long day on other attractions so it was too much for us and we were exhausted.I would guess in summer you have much more time to spend there."
Great park! you can spend few days just visiting the park...,"We visited the park with kids at the range of 3 to 16 and all enjoyed it so much! Every age has attractions to do and  you just cant get enough! So fun! it is very new, so many fun rides and even a small petting zoo. You do need to take into consideration that many of the instructions are in Russian and only few staff members know English. Be prepared to use google translate and hand gestures :) or take a Russian speaking family member with you"
Nice park for the kids,"Nice park, visited with the kids 3 times during our 8 days vacation.The main problems are:* if you are not Russian - language problem (google translate saved me)* the restaurants are not so good.Nice place to spent a day or two"
Beautiful park but not if you're not Russian,"It's a beautiful park with lots of rides and activities. They advertise it as an international attraction. Unfortunately all is ONLY MENTIONED in Russian, the staff is 99% only native Russian speaking. For a park promoted and as beautiful as it is just a shame because at certain rides you need a safety instruction which they cannot give, so you cannot do the ride."
Good Park,Good Park but can be very crowded in Summer. However we will come back! Spasibo for the nice day with a lot if emotions
Nice,"Very good park! Not expensive but really good and we enjoyed our time here, We can recommend the Park!"
Great park with relatively short queues ,Very nice park with good attractions for both young and teens. We especially liked the absence of endless queues usually present in these kind of parks. Longest time we needed to wait was about 15 mins (for the orange roller coaster). Also a very nice dolphin show is available in the park.
For kids only,"In our US or European parks , you would be invaded by shops selling souvenirs and sweets but here, it s all about amusement .Kids would find it attractive and youngsters would love the super roller coaster.They have delicious ice cream stands that you should not miss for sure!!With 4 flavors only? But great ones.The place is easy to access and wheelchairs will find it easy, as there aren't long queues to get in either."
Good amusement park ,Cannot be compared with e.g. PortAventura in Spain but both roller-coasters here are very impressive.
Fun filled day,"Visited the park in the long weekend to go on the roller coasters. Wasn’t disappointed, it was a fantastic day. Not very long queues in the morning. Afternoon was a short wait. Purchased an all day pass including the ferries wheel. Most things are in English and staff very accommodating and helpful.  Ate lunch at the roller coaster restaurant."
Good park in Sochi region,"The park is a good attraction for kids and teenagers in the region of Sochi. The moderate price for the entrance includes all main attractions. They are not exceptional but good and the fun factor is high. Depending on the numbers of visitors and waiting time, a family can spend one day in the park. The restaurants provide the expected quality level, however, the waiting time was quite long (even there were few customers) and the personal was not quick or very attentive. This leads to our lower rating for the overall impression."
Good for adults and children,"It is a must while in Sochi. Shows are good. Dolphins - unforgettable to swim with (and not super expensive), kids loved it.!"
Excellent!!!!!!,"Many attractions for all ages, some for braver visitors and some for not so brave ;-)It is best to visit in September, when still good weather, but not too crowded, we didn't have to wait at all, so the time was used very effectively.It is like Disney land with Russian interpretation. Very good park, but a bit expensive considering other things to do in Sochi."
So much fun!,"I wasnt expecting a Disney-ish themed park at all, but I had so much fun regardless. The place is very affordable, the decor is very dramatic but not tacky at all. Try it, you will love it."
Fun Fun Fun,"Loved it, a lot of fun. Innovative rides, good stalls to buy from an amazing atmosphere. Stroll for hours soaking up the atmosphere, worth a visit. The staff are ultra friendly, I loved it."
Great Park + Dolphin Show,"The entrance ticket is little cheaper if you buy in your hotel. Ours were 1550rub per adult and 1250rub per kid. They have timing 10:00 to 14:00, 14:00 to 23:00 and full day. Afternoon is when we went, best time. Once you're in, all rides are free. Plus there are some shows available. We were lucky to go to a Dolphin Show. It's very well done. All in Russian, but good entertainment. Kids loved it, they couldn't look away!Rides we've tried most. Lines were few and took little of waiting.There are places to eat, and rest. There are small shops that offer master classes on different things (candy making, glass sculptures and more) at some 500rub or so.In the end of the day there's a closing show for kids. It was beautiful. Kids want to go back. Parents too."
For the extreme-lovers,"We walked around and just enjoyed watching people scrimming getting up and down and upside-down! I guess they were happy and had a lot of fun. Seems that this park is not very large but it is only such park in Adler city area. So, have fun!"
Sochi Park,"A great park in a great location.  Near the sea, vendors, and the new stadium.  Lots to do in and around the park.  Dolce is a great cafe just outside the park."
Great place to have fun,It is a good place to spend good time having fun in Sochi. I spent 3 hours with my friends as we were participants in the festival. You get a beautiful view of the city when you go on one the rides.
Good for children,It is a fun fair located by the Olympic Park.  Lots of children's rides and like a miniature Disneyland.  There is a huge hotel on the site that resembles a chateau.  Would be lots of fun for kids to visit.
Great place to spend half a day/day in Sochi,"It's a great place to spend the first half of the day with a good pump of adrenaline. It has some good restaurants too and the ""Dolphenarium"" offers 2-4 shows a day so you can get yourself in the que for that too. The Black sea is 3 minutes drive from the park so spending the sunset on the beach after the adrenaline rush and a cool dolphin show won't hurt ;)"
Best park in Russia but no comparison to other international parks,"By international standards, this is a small park with limited theming, by Russian standard, it is probably one of the best in the country. I felt the price of 1,750 was high bearing in mind this is not far off what other much larger parks charge, the number of rides is limited, with two coasters and lots of smaller rides, half of which are for young children. The park was not busy at all and there was zero waiting time for all the rides, we were told July and August are the busiest months so I assume that is when one has to queue for the rides. If you are in Sochi, and have the spare time and don't mind spending around. 30 dollars to go on a couple of rides, then a good place to visit, otherwise if you are well travelled, there are many better parks outside Russia for not a lot more money."
Great!,"We loved it - loved the security and the park itself - it has everything for every age, Restorant to eat, all sorts of entertainment for both my 3 year old son and my 29yo brother:)))"
Miracle Park - Sochi Park,"The most important miracle is that ALL is INCLUDED in the cost of a vhodnova ticket! Even the most gloomy adult hitting here immediately feels like a child in the country of DREAMS! I've been to many attractions, but I've never seen anything like that! Attractions for all ages, the Dolphinarium and ..."
Amazing Park,The park is very beautiful and many rides for children and adults. There is no good restaurant in the park. It is located in Adler and a little far from Sochi but close to Adler.
Great full day activity with kids,Amazing to visit on a nice sunny day. This park has 20 rides. Big and small. My daughter really loved the shows and puppet theatre. Park looks very beautiful in the dusk.
Russian theme park,Very good theme park. Everything is connected with Russian folklore and fairy tales. The only minus is absence of shadow or tall trees.
Its good!,"Its good place to have thrill,there is many activities for children and adults,staff was nice has good behavior at all.!!"
You can ride just a fraction of attractions,"Well, they tried.They tried to create a theme park ""A la Russe"", but they failed. One can recognize a very odd mixture of some Russian fairy tales, Soviet cartoons and self-invented creatures. It is like you will ix creatures from Cartoon Network, Disney and Pixar...The size of the park is large enough. The number of attractions if also big enough. BUT. One particular person with specific height, age and weight can ride only 30%-40% of them. If you are a child (no matter what age) the percentage of available attractions falls below 30%.One more thing is tickets windows. During Russian GP 2016 none of the ticket machines worked (see foto) on Saturday and Sunday (the busiest days) and there were huge entrance queues. You should buy the ticket in advance (via internet) to avoid this nightmare."
Could have more rides!,It was a great time but with only two roller coasters and a disappointing elevator I expected more from the park. Felt so sorry for the Dolphins and seal at the show. Good park for toddlers but not adults.
lots of fun,It`s a great place to have a half day fun. It costs 1750 rubles per person. It has a dolphin show. there are different kind of games for kids and adults.
best amusement park in sochi,with 1750 rubles can use all facilities frequently.the park environment is very good and admiring.dolphinarium was very good and exciting inside the park.totally I used just 3 of the games which was breathtaking
Not Disney Land ,"Yesterday we went to Sochi park. It's a little bit difficult to find the parking area by car. We parked (free) at another spot next to the Sochi museum (metallic cubes) and went to the park by feet. We payed 3000 ruble -15% discount from aquarium. 2 adults and one child under 5 years. We were allowed to take photos and videos everywhere in the park.  At the entrance we were informed which attractions didn't work. Don't expect to visit Sochi park and everything will work... We never had to wait long to take a ride or get something to eat. The entertainment for small children was really good. The rides were safe and cool. I really liked the ""science house"". My daughter liked, dancing and singing with the entertainers. Sochi park is ""expensive"" for Russian standard. But it's a nice trip."
I was in sochi it's osome place u spend holiday ,It world class city in europ it's osome place to spend holiday with family I have great experience in sochi I was spend almost 2 week great weather
A small but fun park in Sochi,"Not Disneyland but we had a great time. One of the rollercoasters was not running, but I wouldn't have gone anyway. Crowd was not bad and there was almost no wait on the rides. They have a small kiddy section and an eco section. Price 1500 rubles."
Nice park but better in summer ,"We want there by taxi entrance was 1100 ruble I remember , it gives also 15% discount in aquarium The park was not all working but it was funny time there with the competition"
