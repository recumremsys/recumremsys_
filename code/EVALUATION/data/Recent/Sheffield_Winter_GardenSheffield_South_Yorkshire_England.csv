Quiet Visit to Winter Gardens,Was surprised that the Winter Gardens were open when I visited to see the CRUCIBLE. So went in after asking the staff member on duty if it was OK. Spent about 30 minutes  inside looking at the various displays of palms and exotic trees. Surprised how tall they were. Unfortunately the eateries and cafes were all shut. Took a few photos  while there.
Break away,Stayed in mecure hotel next door what a lovely place even sitting having breakfast was a joy to see people walking through we loved the flowers and different plants a joy to go into the little gallery’s off stainless steel John Ruskin Chatsworth house arts we thoroughly enjoyed our visit somewhere lovely to go for a break from shopping and plenty of seats to sit on and admire the gardens
Mindfulness Journey,"Such a immaculate conception of how true nature can combine to become a beautiful hidden gem in a city landscape because it really makes you feel like like your truly able to forget your worries and concerns and put you at peace even of its just for a fleeting moment. Also, visited the millennium gallery off on the side of the winter gardens and would highly recommend this miniature museum as you can find some very interesting historical artefacts if you love to learn about history like me."
Nice building,Very nice building but there didn't seem to be enough seating to stay awhile and enjoy it.  We did enjoy it but would have loved to sit down and watch the plants grow!
a must see !!!,"what a delight........a wonderful location on the square near the Crucible Theatre and The LyceumA must place to visit ..........tranquil, beautiful, a place to reflect........the free galleries and exhibitions were quite fantastic........we spent the most time looking at the the story of Sheffields steel industry......sadly we didn't have time to look in the Ruskin room.....one for next timeSheffield should be on your list of places to explore....so much to see and do"
Peaceful,So nice specially on a awfull rainy day. Love this place anytime so peaceful and relaxing just to sit and admire the plants. Our favourite place for a coffee break and a snack.
Amazing,A beautiful place to sit and enjoy the plants.  There are cafes here if you want a coffee.  A lovely place just to relax.  Well worth a visit and free to visit.
"Nice, cozy and entertaining.",Greenhouse built in glass in the center of the city. It was inaugurated in 2003. It is located next to the town hall. From here you can access the Millenium Gallery. It also houses some shops.
Lovely spot for coffee,Ok when we went it was very quiet but peaceful and lovely palms and flowers to to admire. Nice little coffee shop selling snacks and drinks.
Marvellous ,An amazing Tropical oasis in the heart of Sheffield. Great to relax and unwind with fascinating tropical plants
Nice,I was pleasantly surprised by this. Its a great design and a great spot to enjoy a few minutes of peace and quiet with many plants to enjoy. Don't forget to see the galleries and craft items that are just of the main area. We'll worth a look.
Small but worth a visit,Pretty small but definitely worth a visit. The garden in the city center is sure to grab your attention. Cozy environment of modern space.
Peaceful setting,This is an excellent place to sit and pretend you are in the country.  Nice arrangement of greenery to walk round also.  A few unusual shops to browse though not many.  It would be perfect for you if on a lunch break and needed peace for an hour or less.
Worth a visit,A great escape from Sheffield. Good walk around and well worth a visit when you’re in the city...perhaps with a theatre production to be followed!
Nice place to sit for lunch.,"We were tourists and from the write up it sounded as though this was a huge greenhouse. To be fair you would walk through it in a few minutes, but it's worth a diversion as it's very close to the centre of the city. Beautiful palms and ferns with some orchids and cacti. A calm place to sit and eat your sandwiches which is what the locals seemed to be doing."
Unexpected art,The winter garden is quite small but pleasant. The surprise was how good the art museum in it. We easily spent an hour looking at some art with explanations of what they depicted and the history of Sheffield steel. I was in ad wheelchair and everything was accessible  and easy to manoeuvre  around.
Winter garden,"Plenty of different varieties of tropical plants & other plants/ trees too, there's also a small museum of Sheffield cutlery, scissors, ect, + small shops & café too, good for all to visit & small children love it too."
Lovely quiet place in the centre of the city,"I visit this place regularly, if I'm passing through or going to the connected Millennium Galleries..a green space in the city centre lovely to sit and read or visit the exhibitions."
Take a break from shopping ,I love Christmas shopping in Sheffield but it’s so nice to pop into the winter gardens and take time out. In December the gardens felt so warm and inviting. The tropical plants are so impressive and the smell of flowers is intensified under the fabulous glass roof. You must visit and take time to enjoy.
Worth a visit ,Popular indoor venue to visit and a nice place to relax.We enjoyed walking around and visiting some of the shops and the gallery.
"It’s ok, nuce","I took a walk while waiting to go into a local restaurant. It’s nice, peaceful when I was there. Worth the minor de-tour if you’re nearby."
Flying visit,A lovely place to visit when In the city that weather can’t spoil. Always go there when I can and this time took my partner
Small covered collection,"We were walking through Sheffield and had been told of the Winter Gardens. We found the Peace Gardens amongst some fabulous old stone buildings. The Winter Gardens was hidden down a side street behind a very modern glass facade. Inside we found paved paths through flower beds planted with tropical plants, trees and models of animals. It isn't large but it is covered and so on a wet cold day it offered some respite from the weather."
A real asset for Sheffield,"On Saturday night we walked through the Winter Garden to go to the lyceum. We were with some of our family, not from Sheffield, and they said how lovely it was. Our grandson staed with us for a couple of days after some shopping we had a picnic in the Winter Garden. Brilliant- a great asset for everyone."
Fantastic shopping centre,"Meadow hall is the best shopping centre in the north. Plenty of variance in the shops, loads of free parking.al ao has the oasis  which has  numerous wait g establishments,  cinemas  as well. A great way to shop , eat and relax. Highly recommend visiting its fantastic."
Pleasant area,"This was a lovely place to visit briefly, if somewhat smaller than expected. It seems to be well kept and with plenty of seating is quite a relaxing place. The museum and exhibition area attached to it is also very interesting."
Relaxing oasis,"What a gorgeous little oasis of calm and relaxation to find right in the city centre.Lush greenery, dotted about seating.Spotlessly clean.Lovely little cafe and craft stalls. Attached to an interesting space for culture, exhibition and museum.A great way to while away an hour or two.I try to visit every time I’m in Sheffield.Soul soothing respite away from the shopping masses."
Nature in the middle of the city centre,"A lovely, indoor spot. Not a full sized garden but a nice place to sit and watch the world go by while looking at some unusual plants. Connects the gallery to other parts of town so a nicer way to walk through and bonus is it’s free!"
Smaller than I imagined,"The Winter Gardens is a very pleasant covered space to relax and chill, eating from the snack bar or just gazing at the exotic plants. However, it was considerably smaller than I had expected so slightly disappointing in that respect."
Slightly disappointing,"I went on a trip to Sheffield with my mother, and this was one of the first places we decided to go and visit. The pictures make it look a lot larger and a lot more interesting than it actually was. We were both quite disappointed with what it was actually like"
Charming! ,"A wander through the Winter garden to the theatre. Time to stop and gaze on the lovely, colourful flowers and bamboo.See something different every time!"
Interesting place,"Different space in the city well worth a visit, quirky place wander through and grab a coffee and snack"
Well worth a visit,Pretty indoor garden with really interesting museums and gift shops etc. Cafe and toilets are also available.
Excellent place to roam in the middle of the city of Sheffield,"This  is a very pleasant place to wander, in the middle of the city centre of Sheffield. It is beautiful and tranquil with people of all ages enjoying the tranquil space. Well kept, quiet and respect."
Nice place to visit,I saw the place in winter with a dull cold and grey weather but seeing some kind of tropical forest inside this building brings you already in a hot country
Interesting,"Nicely laid out, seating, cafe museum and pop up shops. Interesting planting.  With a short visit if a stranger to the city."
Relaxing walkabout,This is a wonderful relaxing walk about with some wonderful interests and plants in here just attached to our hotel and a lovely place to relax
Winter garden ,Really nice and pretty only small impressive though Big palm trees nice warm Easy to walk through and admire in nice area of the city
Good place for a wander,"Nice bit of greenery in the city centre, nice range of nature plants.Good place for a rest & a cuppa.Couple of shops & exhibitions in there, but wasnt tempted by anything"
Lovely place to sit,"We were expecting maybe a bigger area but, having arrived there, we were impressed with what we saw. It has a nice ambiance and it's free. For lunch check out Mama's and Leonie's around the corner."
'Warm Winter Gardens',Lovely place. Great place to chill out with friends over coffee. People in Sheffield are so friendly and the cafe staff serve great value flavoursome food at affordable prices. There is even a bench at the Sheffield gardens where you can meet and chat to folk. I love Sheffield!Can't wait to go back to this friendly welcoming and charming place.
Four mph art,"The exhibitions are best visited at a minimum of 4 mph, so as not to waste time.  The venue is very good, with snacks and interesting shopping.  A good place to spend time away from the Yorkshire rain."
Delightful little place.,"Came to Sheffield specifically to find and visit this place. I knew where it was rougly located, but it still took a while to find it. Did not see a single signpost for it, or anything else either, for that matter. Nice, bright, clean and airy inside. Several exhibitions on at the moment and expressions of Sheffield life, past and present.It is small, but it's well maintained and clean throughout.I enjoyed my little visit.See photos."
Lovely place,Well laid out and housing some pleasant and interesting plants the winter garden was just right for a short interlude on new year's day. The information boards were interesting to read. A little oasis in the heart of the city
Amazing,"Good place to go with kids, something different in the middle of City. Always clean and good place to rest."
Paradise in the city,"A lovely covered garden right in the centre, if it's cold or wet it offers a great break from the weather."
Lovely place and good for family ,Really enjoyed the place. It’s literally outside my hotel and very easy to link thru the block and lead to the art gallery. The plant inside are nice and is a lovely please to gather and hang out as it warm in the winter and provide spaces for kid to run about. And you get to learn stuff out of it too. The roof is nice and created a landmark as well. It’s a free and great place to visit in Sheffield!
Oasis of peace,This is such a lovely well thought out space in the heart of busy Sheffield. We wandered around the indoor gardens and visited the lovely shops and galleries. You could in truth spend quite a long time here.  Well worth a visit.
Very festive,A really beautiful tranquil part of our lovely city. A very peaceful place to sit and relax specially on a cold miserable day. It's especially nice this time of year with all the lovely decorations and lights.
Lovely green space ,Lovely warm green space on a cold and wet day. Interesting art and craft shop with high quality artisan pieces.
An oasis in the City Centre,On a winter's day it provided a refreshing alternative to the cold outside.  Interesting exhibitions and cafe as well
Christmas,We went there to show the grandchildren what Christmas lights were like and they were definitely not dissapointed as it was lit up beautiful..
Lovely for families,Lovely we had a lovely couple of hours here very peaceful kids loved the gift shop deffo recommended will be returning .
Sidney Opera House,That was my first impressionWonderful building beautiful woodThe plants were really something and exhibitions really worth a look
Why not?,"I have traversed this route many times on my route into Sheffield centre from the train station, and it has never entered my head to think about what others may think!  This public area provides for a free area to sit and relax in the centre of Sheffield, with numerous stalls to buy local produce:  It also provides for a beautiful indoor experience from time to time, including operatic pop ups and more; give it a go !!!"
Peaceful and welcoming,This is just a lovely place to come. There are shops and cafes to browse or stop and eat in and to be surrounded by all the plants is very soothing
Bit of a surprise really.,We came to see the photo exhibition that is on at the moment and were very impressed by the Winter Garden.Great place to stop off and eat your lunch on a cold November day.
Evening in Winter Garden,An interesting modern 'glasshouse like' indoor garden with many exotic plants. Interesting design and construction
Warm!,"Went in to look around and have coffee, looking around was fine, fabric flowers a bit odd but didn’t stay as no seating for coffee."
Sheffield Winter Garden,We walked round the Winter garden last weekend.  There are a lot of plants in the there from all different countries.  Worth a walk round if your in the area.
Oasis of calm,Nice area for a chill out. Visited at lunchtime and it was obvious that it was used by people as a lunchtime break area. Nice
First visit,"Discovered this place whilst browsing on Google,a lovely place to visit,peaceful and relaxing,some lovely exhibitions to look at as well,recommended"
Winter gardens ,Lovely place very peaceful would recommend for couples. Would definitely go back. Enjoyed visit lots.
Very pleasant and refreshing amenity,"A very pleasant place to spend a few minutes, with the advantage that it is available in all weathers, and is free into the bargain!  A chance to see some exotic trees, shrubs and flowers, and a good place to sit for a cup of tea or coffee.  It leads naturally into the arty section based around the Ruskin gallery, also a pleasant place to be and free to enter!"
Enjoy the warmth of this tropical garden,There are lots of interesting things to do here as well as enjoying the tropical plants. During the World snooker championships you can meet the players. All year round there are good exhibitions and great cafes.
Modern art ,"Came here and viewed the modern art exhibition, and it was really great. The other long standing exhibitions were also good, especially the one about the steel works."
loved it,Loved the architecture and the lay out. Lovely place to relax and chill out - especially if it is raining as it was when we were there.
A HAVEN IN WHICH TO RELAX,"I literally stumbled upon this haven on leaving the Millennium Gallery. It was lunch time-ish, so I decided to grab a bite and sit at one of the cafe's tables. It was what I needed - to rest after standing. However, I wish that the fare at the cafe was more refined than transport 'caff' sandwiches with thick bread. Nevertheless, it was better than nothing."
"A green glazed oasis, must visit","I love walking through here, one of my favourite buildings, centrally located connected to the museums,theatre area & bars."
Nice sight,"Nice sight in Sheffield, located really close to the train station. It has access to Millenium Gallery and gift shops"
Beautiful ,Didn’t even know this existed until my recent visit. Beaut location even in the dark Lots of bars and restaurants around the area to enjoy the views Clean and tidy inside like stepping into the tropics. Lots of lovely plants and tress like going into a jungle
Something different,If you have time you must visit this place. Although not very big it houses a lot of plants and trees. Take time out and relax at the coffee shop. It’s warm in there too!
Beautiful haven of tranquility,"Nipped in before going to the theatre. What a beautiful and calm space, so important in busy cities. Plenty of seating to enjoy the atmosphere and great things for children to look at. A real sense of Sheffield pride is evident."
Nice,We were in the area and decided to have a look in here. There are lots of trees and plants for a more tropical country. It is nice to walk around and there is a small pond. There is seating inside to sit and chill for a little bit. It is all covered so doesn't matter about the weather outside. It seemed to be safe inside. It is worth visiting this place if you're in the area.
"Really interesting, calming space in a busy City",A lovely place to go and sit and enjoy the atmosphere. The Winter Garden is a rather magical place in a busy city - such a nice place to walk through to get from the Crucible through to the Millennium Galleries or out towards the restaurants. Lucky to have this in Sheffield!
What a delight,Found a pop up shop with gorgeous items to buy for cmas presents. Took some lovely photos and had a great coffee
Lovely atmosphere ,Beautiful areaPerfect if you just want to relax. Connects onto the millennium galleries. Few independent shops and cafes inside which are cute.
Respite from Stroll,"I was exploring this area of downtown on my own one afternoon in September.  There was a brisk wind and the temp was 63' that day. Coming from Florida, it felt very chilly and I appreciated the jacket I brought with me. The Winter Garden was a wonderful place to seek a reprieve and rest on a bench.  I enjoyed the mobile adjacent to my bench.  The greenery provided a restful pick me up.  I encountered a fat pigeon with a right foot amputation.  I marveled at nature's adaptation with the callous formation on his stump and how well he navigated with just a slight limp.  It didn't seem to slow him down at all. I imagined from his girth that lots of visitors gave him tasty morsels. I met a shopkeeper of a kiosk walk-in booth that was utterly charming. She introduced me to her elderly dad and we talked politics amicably for a good quarter hour.  The educational displays in the adjoining rooms were interesting.  Best part--it's FREE!"
Outside inside,A favourite place in Sheffield. Just a lovely space - always try to walk through it when in Sheffield. Sometimes has exhibitions and activities.
Amazing,"ABSOLUTELY LOVE this place, its gorgeous and lovely to just sit and talk and take everything in! Will be back at Christmas because it feels even more magical"
If you go to Sheffield - don't miss this Garden - we almost did,"After perusing the book ""111Thngs Not to Miss in Sheffield"" or something like that, we listed the Winter Garden as a place to see.  During our four days of walking around Sheffield and taking in the sites - like movie locations for The Full Monty and the Leopold Hotel where Joe Cocker was a student when the hotel was a technical school - we stumbled on the Winter Garden by accident to get in out of the rain.  We could have spent hours here, siping hot chocolate and coffee and reading a good book."
Peaceful,"A peaceful place to sit in the busy centre  of Sheffield , nice plants and a coffee shopwell worth a visit"
good for a wonder,nice greenhouse for tropical plants and access for a museum and shortcut for the train and the city. also good for contemporary architecture fans
Interesting plants ,I have been a few times now to Winter Gardens usually after eating at one of the nearby restaurants every time I have been it’s always been a relaxing occasion.
A tranquil relaxing space in central Sheffield,"The architecture is as astonishing as the planting. High sweeping beams cover the area between the Millennium gallery and the neighbouring hotel, creating a large light area that has been filled with plants that provide shape and interest tot he space. There are benches and many people use this as a tranquil area to sit and enjoy a break. There is also a cafe and popular shop and it is easy to get into the gallery form here."
Lots to see,Fascinating museum in 4-5 rooms. The one covering cutlery in Sheffield was so informative and it is all free. Plants good to see too.
Great garden area with an excellent museum,"The garden is interesting to walk thru however off from the garden is the Museum of Sheffield , the Millennium Gallery. There is outstanding collection of Sheffield make knives and silverware from the past to the present."
Indoor Garden Space,"Pretty garden in a huge glass house. I can see the appeal of the Winter Garden on a wet, miserable day. Not worth seeing if the weather is lovely, go to the real thing...botanical garden! The art gallery inside the glass house is worth viewing if you have time."
Free and worth a look for sure ,"While in the area we called in and did the tour, very clean and impressive. Well maintained and definitely worth a look if you're in the area.Unfortunately didn't have time to see it all but if we should return to the area we'll call back in for sure."
lovely space,"The first time you visit, it is a bit of a wow. People meeting for a drink and a chat or eating their packed lunch in a tropical atmosphere. I love the way folks just use this place in a casual day to day way."
Ok.,"Nice place to sit down and have your packed lunch. Can be very busy and there aren't enough benches to sit on. A bit tired and scruffy looking and some of the plants are a bit neglected,  brown and crispy! Floor stained and sticky. Parking is difficult if you are on a budget, the multi story car park nearby is expensive and limited on street parking. Some disabled car parking near the library but always full and not by badge holders! Sheffield is very poor for disabled parking and facilities."
Lovely oasis,A really nice place to sit and relax in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a city centre. Chill out snd watch the birds.
An interesting structure,We visited a lunch time and it was obviously a haven for locals looking for a quiet spot to eat. Loved the physical structure but felt that the planting was a bit tired in places.
Great indoor garden,Visited last week with some friends. Was really surprised to find this in the middle of town. A very nice setting.
Lovely area in the middle of Sheffield.,"This is a really pleasant area to wander in, spotting different species of vegetation and just enjoying the ambience which is just enjoyable in the busy city centre."
a very pleasant place,not a lot to it but a very pleasant place along with the adjacent galleries. perfect for a rainy day
Hot house,"Not much inside, hot with plants and cafe. Worth wandering through on your way somewhere else but nothing you’d misd"
Very nice,"Right in the heart of the city, this is a great place to stop for lunch etc ..The glass roof helps on a rainy day too. Nice sculptures to be found ( especially if you are an Arctic Monkey fan)"
Excellent Tropical Winter Gardens in the heart of Sheffield,"I've visited Sheffield's Winter Garden's before, but only when they've been being used used by the BBC for Snooker coverage, so it was nice to finally visit and see them in their entirety. Nice relaxing spot to enjoy the beauty of the plants and trees, away from the rain Up North!!!Well thought out.Lots of benches, places to eat and drink.Truely a highlight of any trip to Sheffield!"
Memorable Place,A very nice tranquil place to sit drink coffee and admire all the plant species. Two nice museums of Sheffield history. Would certainly recommend.
Nice place to relax,This is a real nice place to spend a few minutes. When you walk through its hard to believe your in the city centre. It's so nice to sit and relax it's so peaceful another credit to our great city.
Nice place,"We wandered through here during the Bricktropolis event.  Nice place to relax, with plan, big trees and cafes.  Would be a good area to sit in if it is raining.  Nearby Millenium galleries just off too.  We were also able to find a virtual geocache, themed around the elephant"
Lovely ,Always a great nice walk through the garden on the way to work. Very peaceful. Full of nice little cafes and gift shops.
Rainy day welcome distraction ,Next to peace gardens in city centre.  Attractive structure holds large indoor space with various large plants and trees ateas ro sit and relax. Cafes and info points leading into exhibits. Great place to escape rain havebphotos taken and sit and relax.
A peaceful spot,We wandered through the Winter Garden and enjoyed the interesting plants. I imagine this would be an especially nice spot on a cold or dreary day.
Lovely little garden,I like this place especially during the winter as you can warm up yourself and see nice plants and trees. It is usually plenty of people there and maybe difficult to find spare space on one of few benches. Nice small gallery is attached to this place
Good for a wet day,It had been raining most of the day so we were very gratful to get out of the rain. The builing itself looks great both from the outside and the inside. Great veriety of tropical plant. Also interesting shops. The Walking Tour of Sheffield leaves from the Surrey Street enterence which is well work doing as well
An oasis of calm,"Within a few minutes of walking from the train station we came upon the Winter Garden, perfect for a coffee and a sit down while we got our bearings.  Free entry to the Winter Garden is lovely, I expect it's very cosy on a cold day too.  We sat at the window and watched the world go by for a few minutes then wandered through the garden then back again to the Sheffield shop for a few purchases."
Impressive!,"What an impressive space, great looking inside and out. Very good information on the build, and stunning plants. What a lovely place to pass through or to sit and enjoy."
"Tropical plants and divers exhibitons, all free.  A relax","Just a short wander there and back, really nice and comfortable.  Tropical gardens with banana trees, coconut tres and all manner shrubbery."
Lovely space,"I love it here. It’s a great place to come on your own for a sit and think or to people watch. The Millenium gallery is next door and there are drinks outlets inside the Winter Gardens. It’s a lovely, unique space. Well done Sheffield!"
pleasant hour,it was nice to find somewhere pleasant to sit and the gallery was worth an investigation... some surprisingly good paintings and drawings to view
Beautiful food,Food here is beautiful and staff are very helpful and friendly. Very clean inside and lovely outdoor seating area.

Attractive indoor location in city centre.,Good shops for crafts and cafes. Museums and displays interesting. Close to winter gardens and theatres.
Winter garden,"Lovely idea great plants and green trees , no birds unfortunately.Only a quick walk around bot also used for weddings etc due to nice central location (Its prob near a regestry office as well)A couple of cafes at either end so you really cannot get bored .Well worth a quick walk through and in a great central location."
Small ,The place is small i wouldn’t travel here just to come to winter gardens but its lovely to walk round when coming to the city centre has a few little shops and a cafe
Tropical,"A great place to visit whilst in Sheffield. Many tropical and sub-tropical plants and trees. From here you can visit the Millenium Gallery along with several others. Food and drinks are available, a must see."
Topical plants and more,"The winter garden is housed in a lovely modern glass building. It’s not massive but it’s clear see a lot of effort has gone into the design. The building a lot houses a nice modern gallery, cafe, toilets and shop. Big plus, the garden and galleries are free. Walking out one side takes you the side of the town hall, a lovely area of fountains and water displays which was very popular with families and people just enjoying the afternoon sun. Plenty of restaurants surrounding the area."
Always beautiful ,"A beautiful add to any city, I wish all city’s considered such beautiful ideas & art entwined with nature"
Lovely surprise ,Came across the winter garden on a recent visit.Worth a look around the tropical plants and the free museum.Enjoyed it very much.
Good in had weather,"The 2 year old loves it in here, and it's great to pass an hour when the weather is bad. Certainly can't complain as it's free."

Garden in the city ,"What a lovely  place to visit , an oasis  in the middle of the city.. plenty of-seating with lovely small shops and beautiful plants, trees and flowers !"
Walk,It’s just a lovely walk around looking at beautiful plants. So nice considering it’s in the city centre.
Lovely ,"This little oasis in the middle of the town, is full of tropical plants, art and small outlets. Plenty of seats to sit and have a sandwich or just watch the world go by. The flower beds were beautiful and full of colour with art incorporated in them. After walking around the town, what seemed like hours, it was a great find, as we knew nothing about it and a welcome place to rest and get our breath back!"
Worth a wander through ,A nice green space mid city for all to enjoy free of charge. Pass a few mins walking through and reading about the various plants. Is close to some nice restaurants.
Great for a quick walk-through before the museum or Crucible,"The Winter Garden is a lovely oasis in the city, we walked in and out a few times over our few days there. Especially entertaining when the Snooker World Championship is on and you can try for a game of snooker! Also a lovely entryway to the museum."
Unique,Always an interesting place to go or just pass through. The art galleries are right next door too as is the gallery cafe.
Hidden escape,Winter gardens are a wonderful little escape from.the hustle and bustle of the city. One of the first places I visited when I first came to Sheffield. It's a wonderful place to spend an afternoon or jaut a quick escape on a lunch break. With cafes and eateries along with a wide range of exhibits and boutique shops it has something for everyone. A must see for any first time visitors to Sheffield
lovely,A lovely place to visit alongside the millenium gallery. Highly recommend popping down through the gallery to Ambulo cafe...amazing food there!
Peaceful,This place is a perfect place to relax and escape the crowds in the Sheffield city centre. Plenty of benches to relax and watch people pass by. Lovely plants in the winter gardens and a cafe if you need a drink or snacks. The winter gardens were being used for the snooker and you could read all the facts about years of snooker at the crucible.
Exotic Plants ,The Winter Garden is well worth a visit whatever the weather. There are some beautiful plants here very colourful. It’s not massive you can walk through in about 60 seconds but take the time to have a seat and enjoy the place.
Gorgeous city centre gardens,"We visited the gardens as they were next to our hotel and a restaurant we booked overlooked the gardens, which were beautiful. We chatted over lunch and decided to visit on our way to see the snooker at the Crucible opposite, when we saw a few snooker stars walking past and realised that this was the place the snooker stars were interviewed on the tv. We went in and saw cafe's and places to sit and lots of beautiful plants. It was busy but serene and a calming place. We had a walk round before watching the televised snooker interviews and star spotting, Tho this place is beautiful without the snooker hype. Looking forward to going again on our next visit to Sheffield."
"Amazing, calming place in town centre","I love coming to the Winter Garden when I visit Sheffield, just to relax and watch the world go by. Must mention the City Centre Ambassadors are so friendly and helpful."
Fabulous gardens to visit,This was quite a nice place to wander around and see plants and trees from Australia. It was a pleasant walk around and the plants were very colourful.
Beautiful,"Beautiful place to visit. Interesting gallery. Right in the heart of Sheffield. Escalator, lift, toilets & cafes onsite."
Lovely place,"We visit every year when the snooker championships are on.The BBC use it as their studio for a few weeks and have a snooker table for the public to try their hand on.There are cafes and shops, very clean covered area with seats, nice plants etc.Worth a visit any time of year."
Oasis in urban Sheffield,A good e ample of imaginative use of space to bring something different to a city centre.  Certainlcomplements the Sheffield Botanical Gardens.  A decent cafe within the gardens would make it even better and not allowing it to be used as a studio for world snooker would make it perfect.
A jewel in the City,Lovely plants and layout in a small space right in the heart of Sheffield. We went as the half marathon finished - lively.
Peacefull retreat ,"Whether one wants a break from husltle and bustle of The town or shelter from elemmets, this is perfekt. We had a picnic after visit to the galery, aNd as both are free, it makes the combination very cheap way to send afternoon with the familly. The trees and bushes are getting quite vild. Totally safe for the little ones to run around."
Quiet Wander,"As the other half said it’s warm in here, err yes it’s supposed to be. Nice chilled place to sit, spend a few moments break. Free entry."
Beautiful place,Have been here a few times lovely place to walk through or sit and watch the world go by...Plenty to see
Winter garden sheffield,"Went to the winter garden with my grandsons during the school holidays and we enjoyed our visit, the garden itself is fabulous and one of my grandchildren couldn't believe the plants were real, they had to touch them to see, the colours and care taken to look after them is great, we visited the museum and we loved the artist showroom with the different effects on the floor, good food and drink available, good place to sit and read, and warm. What's not to like"
Always love going here,"This is one of the best things to visit in Sheffield, a very unique thing to have. With an indoor garden and exotic plants what more do you want. Definitely worth a trip"
Well worth a visit.,Huge glass house in the middle of Sheffield. Amazing construction and most impressive.Many entrances off the streets or via the Millennium galleries.Lots of beautiful tall and exotic plants and some lovely dainty flowers.Plenty of interest for children to explore and for older people seats to take in the surroundings. Cafe and restaurant on site but didn’t partake.
Lovely oasis in the middle of the city,"Popped in to the gardens for a quiet 5 minutes whilst the Christmas ma4ket was on all around it. A lovely calm  space with access to little shops, cafes and a gallery. Lovely!"
Comfortable,"We visited on the 6th April even though it was a Saturday and the city centre was busy we were able to sit down and take a breath, we only stayed for a coffee but we are going back this weekend to stay longer. A lovely oasis on a busy day."
Missing home,"I popped in to escape the cold outside while waiting for someone. I live in the Caribbean, and was so happy to experience a bit of home. The orchids and bromeliads brought me so much joy!"
Peaceful ,"A lovely atmosphere to sit and chill. Spent abit of time on here after visiting the museum as the back entrance leads to it. Nice palm tres and plants. Very peaceful, near to bars and coffee shops."
Interesting ,Walked through on our way back to the hotel. The structure of this buildings is very interesting and the plants inside are lovely. Some of the shops/cafes around the edge looked a little ‘sad’ but I was interested in the plants and not the shopping. A very nice thing to have in the centre of a city
Well worth a visit,"The winter gardens, botanical gardens, Weston Park, Firth Park, millhouses Park and Rotherham valley country parks are all beautiful and interesting to visit. The new architecture of the winter gardens is stunning, versus the grand opulence of the botanical gardens which is a must see. Out of city parks such as millhouses have flowing paddling pools and Firth Park has a very busy bowling green. A short bus ride out of the city is the Peak District which continues beautiful countryside."
Lovely relaxing space even in the cold of winter,This is a lovely indoor garden with space to walk and sit.  Relaxing and enjoyable.  You can access the Mercure bar and restaurant and the layout is such that a meander is most enjoyable.
Chilled,I love a wonder through the winter gardens - especially when the snooker is on as you can guarantee you will see them filming the BBC coverage. Nice place to sit and take it all in - cafes and the museum next to it so plenty to see
Watch the world go by,"A great place to watch the world go by, grab a drink, read a book, or just to chill out. Great sculptures."
Outside inside,This is a marvelous space to visit - the tropical plant life is excellent and there are some wonderful small shops selling locally made products. There are a number of places you can grab a coffee and cake - so pop in sometime while in Sheffield - not to be missed.
Interesting place to sit as it goes dark,"I was quite surprised to find this as I hadn't known about it. I had a glance around the interpretation boards (of which there probably should have been more), and then sat and read for a bit as the sun set, which made it quite atmospheric. (The fans were quite noisy though.)"
Fabulous,"Palm trees in the middle of Sheffield, well in the winter gardens really.  Also found a museums and displays in the area."
Lamdmark,"Its not a large structure, but a very noticable part of town. Its put to various imaginative uses through out the year"
Indoor garden is a treat.,Sheffield seems to be a city on the rise.  Lots of interesting things to do -- especially the Museums Sheffield -- and the Winter Garden is a huge treat.  Nothing quite like seeing sumptuous green when the outside world is grey and brown.
What a lovely inner city oasis!,"It’s free, it’s warm, it’s beautiful, so what’s not to like? We wandered in off the street to fill a couple of hours before our train home. It was an unexpected gem and we popped through to the linked Millennium Gallery too, before having a coffee and browsing a couple of craft shops."
Visit to Leonado da Vinci Exabition,Stunning experience such an interesting well documented exhibition. The Winter Garden is a visit well worth doing. Lots to see there items for sale relating to the things seen . Good little cafe inside with very reasonable prices.
Sweet place,"Sweet little place giving sanity to the workers and shoppers in their lunch time. Only a small selection of tropical plants but the place offers local craft shops, cakes and coffee. It also has exhibitions on and events like choirs or yoga. So a well utilised little Amazon jungle welcome in the heart of the shopping district."
Lovely! Fantastic place! ,What a lovely place - especially in winter! And it’s free! I just wish it was bigger with more seating and perhaps some grass to sit on! All City’s should have them!
Nature feeling,"This is a beautiful place, located in the heart of the city. It provides the feeling of being in a forest, except many people being around and most times seats are taken."
Opportunity wasted,"Fabulous bit of architecture. A great idea. And could have been stunning. However, as with Fargate and other areas, it lets the opportunity of impressing visitors go to waste. The planting is getting tired, the place is scattered with cheap, nasty  stalks and cafe overspill and it s lost it s tranquility. Apart from getting out of the rain, I wouldn't bother."
Nice tranquil place in the City Centre ,Lovely quiet place to escape the bustle of the City Centre for a short time. Also shelter from any bad weather!Light and airy. Not overly big. The only thing that lets it down is some ridiculous large bright plastic ‘snakes’ in the plants! Why? If it’s ‘Art’ it doesn’t work!!
Always have a look,Me and my partner stay at the adjoining Mercure and always have a walk through its nice and peaceful and loved the fact that one of the elepgsnts remained
Delightful Indoor Gardens,This lovely indoor garden offers a nice break from the cold and rainy outside.  It is even lovely to go into on a nice sunny and warm day.  The plants inside are beautiful to look at and if you want to know more about them there is plenty of information on what you see.  We were there and there was a nice choir singing and it sounded wonderful inside.  It is a nice place just around the corner from the peace gardens and just adds to the feeling of the whole area.  Don't miss this gardens if you have anytime in Sheffield.
Full of beggars,"Beggars asking for money, children running riot and destroying plants, parents are skanks, full of lowlife wasters."
Pleasant,Very pleasant and relaxing but frankly not very exciting. It’s worth having a wander through or even a sit down for a relaxing time.
Excellent use of soace,The Winter Garden looks as if it used to be an empty gap between two buildings. If this is so it’s an excellent use of space. To roof it and fill it with plants. I was very impressed. Lovely space to sit and chill.
Very nice place,Some lovely plants within the garden and seems very peaceful if arrive early less people. Can become very busy the food bars within the garden can also attract people to eat and drink within the enclosed garden. Just like a massive greenhouse in the town centre. Very mini version of the edan project
Pleasant space,A very pleasant large airy space with interesting plants and a highly decorated brightly painted cow!
Very relaxing,"At first I thought it was a simple greenhouse garden, and not very pretty, but turn out there are exhibitions and coffee shop. I think it’s a really nice place for taking photos, to chill and relax."
Small but pleasant ,Pleasant and unusual place to sit and people watch on a cold day. Cafe at one end and a couple of craft shops but mainly people sitting watching the world.
Quite a unique city centre feature,"Visiting Sheffield for the day, I wandered through with friends and found the gardens to be peaceful and a total escape from the surrounding city. A really nice feature, and a place to stop and slow down. I wish my home city, Leicester, had something similar."
Winter Gardens & Gallery are a fabulous asset ,Lunch in the gallery cafe after a stroll around the exotic plants of the warm gardens. The architect is wonderful and it is a great place to relax and chat. The Leonardo de Vinci exhibition is a must see and was unsurprisingly busy. Your patience will be rewarded when you see these amazing masterpieces by this renaissance genius. Park at Q Park Charles Street and get a 50% discount from the gallery reception 😉
FABULOUS PLACE!,"Whenever you are in Sheffield you must visit The Winter Garden,a fabulous place with so much to see,I’m sure the place will amaze you!"
A nice place if it's raining,The Sheffield Winter Garden is a nice place to visit if you want to get out of the rain.It's all undercover thee are small shops and a cafe with places to sit and ponder.There are a lot of tropical trees and shrubs to look at.It is situated near the Town Hall and Peace Gardens with good access for wheelchairs.
Delightful Gardens,"It is always a pleasure to walk around the Winter Garden. An abundance of plants / bushes some tropical can be seen. The garden is well maintained and clean with several seating areas. Next door to the hotel the Mercure, St Paul's which has lovely views of the garden from it's restaurant."
Pocket garden!,Lovely planting on the way through to the millennium gallery.  A good place for eating sandwiches if it was raining
Beautiful,Wow what a stunning venue it's great to go in there relax with some lunch :) read a book well done Sheffield :)
Quiet place in a busy city,"The Sheffield Winter Gardens is a Sheffield oasis. In the middle of this very busy and developing city of Sheffield, the Winter is a quiet, peaceful place. You can get a meal or a snack, or just a coffee. Or maybe just a place to sit quietly and enjoy the plants and the atmosphere. There are little craft shops, and exhibitions that change periodically.You'll love it.P.W."
Europes Largest indoor greenhouse,"I've visited the Winter Gardens on a number of occasions, its an interesting place to visit to pass the time away, ideal in all whethers and right in the City Centre, there are regular art exhibitions, installations and a number of tropical plants you wouldn't expect to find in Sheffield.The Millenium Galleries ajoin the Winter Gardens, there is a da Vinci exhibition there are the moment which is great, but also many local artists and interesting local exhibitions there.I've also been lucky to go to a few music concerts there which were superb, also work a mention the Snooker studio is located there during the Snooker World Championships (late April / early May), so a must for any snooker fans looking to do a bit of celebrity spotting.With a few cafes also its definiately worth a visit if you have a couple of hours to pass in Sheffield, also VERY close to the train station."
Magical,We often come here but a visit with our granddaughter at Christmas was magical. She loved the fairy theme and we spent a long time looking at the different fairy houses and creatures.
Great place,Been a few times the gardens are brilliant all year round. It is becoming the place for wedding photography. Inside here are a few shops and access to the museum. Currently the shops are Sheffield makers which sells hand made goods made here in Sheffield cards badges prints magnets and other goods. There is a cafe next to with a seating area under the branches of the trees  and views across the square to the crucible. The gardens are used when the bbc arrive late March early April for the snooker with the presenters doing analysis from the gardens. The gardens are also used as a  starting point for a city centre walking tour.  Just one thing to note the gardens does not have parking of its own. On street disabled parking is just outside but do not use any of the nearby loading bays even with your blue badge you will get a ticket.
Oasis in the middle of the city,"I was quite impressed by the winter gardens.  Inside gardens with exotic plants. Seating all around. There is a café, gift shop and small individual art galleries inside. All free of charge."
Tranquil Space,"I watched the Winter Gardens being built almost 20 years ago (does anyone remember the Egg Box?). It's such a familiar building I'd almost stopped seeing it. Found myself waiting here yesterday evening and it really struck me what an amazing piece of architecture this is. There's a church-like feeling with that tall, vaulted ceiling and the way sound travels within the space. Somewhere peaceful to stop, pause and take a moment just for yourself right in the busy city centre of Sheffield."
Meeting friends,"It's a good place in town to meet up with friends, town us close by and also the galleries and theatres. Public transport links close too."
Just beautiful ,Just amazing to find such a tranquil place in the centre of the city. It's so peaceful to sit and admire the gorgeous trees and plants and best of all it's free. Even a place to get a drink and snack a credit to our city.
I am amazed,We go there for the amazing trees that have inside and the beautiful picture that you can capture in this place. Check them out below.
Winter gardens not for teens,"Although the winter gardens are interesting and host lots of tropical plans it’s realky not the place for teens. It’s a giant glasshouse with a few coffe shops sandwich bags and art shops , it’s a great place to take lunch , but please don’t take your teens they will moan your their heads off ."
Nice and warm!,Really nice to have somewhere green to visit even in the winter. It's not huge so there isn't an awful lot to see but it's a lovely place to have a little look round or relax on a cold day.
Nice,Was heavy rain and around 10am so decided to walk up here. Really nice place. Great plants/ trees on the other side theres a cafe. Bit expensive. But thats the money side. I just sad down on a free bench and relaxed and people watched. Nice place. But should bring back the hole in the road.
Bit of a damp squib ,"It was one of the wastes of money Sheffield Council spent on something meaningless for the turn of the Century. At best it’s a reasonable place to shelter when it’s raining outside, it has a few plants and trees which will hold your attention for a few nano seconds. There’s access to a few shops and the exterior is interesting again for a few seconds. If your passing worth a look once but nothing more."
Sunday morning circuit,"Staying at the adjacent Mercure it made sense to take in the winter gardens. Open, light and airy this is an attractive public space, enclosed from the elements. It contains some stunning species and attractive artworks. There is seating and a small café. Wish I'd had longer and a little more sun."
Escape the city,"A real gem in Sheffield, often walk past on my way into town from the station.  It's a cosy little wonderland,  always pretty quiet and tranquil a nice spot to escape the hustle and bustle, enjoy a coffee and read a good book."
Fantastic place,We walked through By accident and was very impressed the building is great and there are Lots to look at.
What a little Gem!,I stumbled upon this place completely by accident one evening and was so glad I did. The tranquility of this place was amazing. It’s a lovely place to wind down at the end of the day.
Museums ,"Great place to get out of the cold, take a break and a coffee, visit the museums which are interesting and give a good insite to the city.Always something to do and see, gift shop worth a look."
Get out of the cold,Great little visit with a little something for the kids and nice ice cream. Heart of the City and worth a walk by.
Love it,"Love it here, great place to go on a gloomy day and good variety of local gifts to pick up too. Galleries are interesting and the whole thing is free."
Nice area,Very nice area to relax in while shopping when you need a break. Located in the center of the town with coffee shops close-by
visit,Excellent enjoyed our visit with  no complaints. Relaxing clean and ltter free. Plenty of eating places catering for all diets. A  nice place to watch the world go by. Would recomend it for any one.
Nice place for cup of tea and Sandwich,Clean environment with range of choices to drink. Plants lovely and nice environmentThe children enjoyed it (under 6)
A peaceful place away from the city grind. A nice place to escape the weather.,"We often visit here to see any new exhibitions and chill out as it is very calm and peaceful. The facilities are good, there is a nice cafe and it really is somewhere you can escape the bad weather in winter. Every city should have a building like this.Wander through there are more bars and cafes out of the rear entrance."
Amazing,"Very romantic venue for couples, can’t wait to go back,Lovely tropical feel inside when it’s freezing out feels like you have been transported to a tropical island"
Pleasant way to spend 30 mind,We came during the day so didn't get the special effects of the lighting. Nice enough to look around and get out of the cold. Lots of little displays set up. Nicely done but not the sort of place you would make a special trip to.
A bit of relax ,"Every time I go back to Sheffy, I visit this place. You can find many different species of plants and trees , the temperature inside is a bit humid to allow the plants to grow, there are also some decorations around, some stores to visit and to buy a souvenir. There are some paths between the trees and the plant and where you can walk through and some small lakes. All the species have a label so it’s also a moment to know new plants. I like a lot this place, it’s very quiet. Some benches are placed in the gardens so you can also sit and have some relax."
Meeting Place,"What a lovely warm area to visit, meet people or just watch the world go by. It has now become a focus of the city since all the amenities have moved towards the Moor."
Unusual in a very nice way,"The Winter Garden is only a few minutes walk from the main train station and well-signposted too. Anyhow, be aware that it is only a small'ish ""garden"" though with some large trees up to its very well-designed wooden frame. Well worth popping your head into and a few minutes walk."
City oasis,Superb glazed laminated timber structure enclosing tropical plants with lots of space to wander around and sit in the warmth on a cold winter day. Connects with the Millennium gallery  which is well worth a visit.
All year round,"Sheffield have done a great job bringing nature into the town centre. It's right next to the crucible theatre. During the snooker weeks the BBC use the hall for interviews and practice tables. Inside there are trees , plants and flowers. The tunnel is an  arched glass dome. Being glass it creates it's own heat and in the summer it's boiling hot with doors wide open."
Susan oxley,Such a lovely little area .. a Mediterranean garden in the centre of Sheffield .. restaurants and cafes on either side and close to the 2 main theatres X
Lovely Place,This is a lovely area. If you can get a seat it's really nice. There's lots of really cool plants to look at. Also access to the galleries etc.
Winter gardens,Relaxing place with a great atmosphere in the heart of the steel city. Beautiful in every season :) :)
Stunning,"As someone revisiting the centre of Sheffield for the first time in 20 years, this is a very impressive addition to the city centre. Indoor plants and art gallery."
Definitely recommend ,"Brilliant architecture ,tropical plants and access to the art gallery. Clean space, will regular see cleaner around ect."
Lovely!,The sat nav took us to a florists along the street but once we found the gardens we were quite impressed! Indoor gardens under arches were worth a quick look and we liked the talking bench. The millennium gallery was the highlight. Well done.
Day in town ,Lovely place to go kids enjoyed it.Had some activity’s on for the kids provided by local uni students I think?Well worth a visit 👍👍
A lovely oasis of calm and a great picnic stop,This is eadily missed but it is a lovely place to stop and have a picnic.  It is of course always warm whatever the time of year.
Worth visiting,Not to be missed free to enter and go in the Museum see what was made in Sheffield years ago before the foreign firms got in the act
0n our way to the city centre,We travel by train to sheffield regularly and always go via the winter gardens to the city centre.Apart from being a beautiful structure there is alwayssomething of interest going on.  It is well worth a visit for this reason alone
Well worth a visit ,These gardens and the adjacent millennium square are well worth a visit if you are in Sheffield great architecture and use of metalwork. Look for the measurements set into the stone next to the town hall. Craft for sale and metalwork museums just off the gardens. Several cafes suitable for lunch.
Relaxation,This is a lovely spot in the centre of Sheffield to go especially on a nice summer day you can sit and relax and watch the world go by
Lovely in door oasis,Would not believe your in city centre this is a lovely place to wander around see crafts museum pieces lovely plants and nice cafe
Relaxing,Great place to go and relax from the busy city life around you. Nice and quiet and some really interesting plants. Nice and warm too.
An interesting and warm retreat on a cold winter’s day.,Exhibitions and trade stalls. All very interesting and a nice break from the usual city centre outlets.
Lovely area,"A lovely area to stop and take a seat, and have your packed lunch, after hitting the shops. Highly recommended."
A pleasant area to spend a short break in-between shopping/walking around the city,"The Winter Garden is an extremely pleasant, attractive, modern and clean zone where you can catch a few minutes relaxation from the hussle-bussle of shopping or just rest your feet for a while from city walking tour. Art galleries and craft shops, while not my thing really, where quite interesting and full of local interest."
Wish every city had one of these,Had a lovely walk around here and also the museum attached. What a peaceful place to sit and reflect and just take a break from the city
Super modern internal garden structure right in the city centre.,Next to the Crucible and Adelphi theatres. Perfect space to pause and take refreshments whilst shopping.
Just a nice look around,"A nicely laid out and well kept attraction. It offers the opportunity to visit some nice exhibitions. We were quite taken with the cutlery exhibits. A nice insight into Sheffield’s industry. Go, you’all not be disappointed"
Full of visitors!,"Our group walked through the winter gardens sbout 10.30 on a nippy Monday morning. There were several groups of young school children, very excited at their adventure. The planting is fabulous, giving a real sense of the exotic in this northern university city. It feels like a welcoming friendly place. Nice atmosphere and spacious enough for gatherings. We took several photos here and I understand many people come especially to see the elephant signed by........??? Look it up! It’s a real tourist attraction in its own right."
Lovely,Another area of Sheffield that has had money spent on it to make it fresh and modern. Always a nice place for a sit or a stroll and some lovely little shops to browse.
Awesome,Fantastic Place to go visit it's always a wonderful place to relax and have lunch and enjoy a bit if the tropical in the North.
Place of beauty and tranquility,"A wonderful place in it's own right, used by people for all sorts of different reasons, take a break, entrance to hotel, shops, museums and gallery spaces. The plants are magical, bringing a peaceful aura to the area. And just outside are the Peace Gardens, Theatres, cafe areas. Fantastic place"
lovely oasis of greenery and calm - why can't we have somewhere like this in Birmingham?,"Whilst in Sheffield a few months ago we decided to take a trek through the markets and the surrounding area and we came across this absolutely wonderful oasis of calm and greenery which we didn't even know existed.  A series of arches which bring to mind the Sydney Opera House containing effectively one giant urban greenhouse where all types of exotic plants and species of shrubbery and flowers are on display and allowed to flourish. The place is so perfect even songbirds were nestling in the branches above us, chirping away happily. There was even space for a series of temporary art exhibitions for the creative minded to admire. The closet to a city centre paradise there is.... (Backwood Birmingham Council please take note - you even took away our beloved Floozie in the Jacuzzi fountain in Victoria Square by the council house because of austerity cuts but chose to waste it on stupid bus lanes, fancy railings and the rest).Such a beautiful place where you could sit for a while, chill out and admire the lofty plants and take in the scenery. This place certainly helps cement the claim that Sheffield is one of the greenest cities in the UK - an aspiration to which our own city of Birmingham - for all its horrible inhuman sprawl and bland mediocre architecture - could do well to at least try and emulate."
Beautiful indoor garden,"Having lived in Sheffield for around 15 years, I usually make a point of visiting the Winter Gardens every time I'm in the city centre. It's a beautiful, peaceful indoor garden right in the heart of the city centre and is a great place to go for a moment's peace in the middle of a busy day or to eat lunch. I love looking at all the unusual plants there and the occasional art displays. There is also a cafe so it's a good place to meet friends for a coffee."
Beautiful indoor gardens ,"Happened to fall across this place on following goggle maps to a place we were going to eat and it was a lovely indoor garden place with shops,cafes, etc, seating to sit and eat your lunch, would be a great place to come relax and eat your lunch here if you worked near by."
Fantastic place to visit for free,Had a packed lunch here and enjoyed lovely surroundings. Interesting plants and sculpture. Nice break from the rain
Greenery in the city,"Passed through here on an overnight stay in the city, nice to have such a natural structure with wood and glass letting in the light from the outdoors with so much greenery in the heart of the city."
Lovely and quiet. Ideal to have your lunch or just read a book,Lovely little place. You go in and where the crucible theatre is and come out where the restaurants are. Ideal place to simple wined down and have a cuppa or read a book. Doesn't cost anything to enter.
Nice to chill,What a great place to sit and chill among the beautiful plants and shrubs. It's so relaxing and very peaceful a real nice place to chill. There is also a nice cafe to get refreshments. Another credit to the city of Sheffield.
Beautiful,This is a little green oasis in the centre of Sheffield. It has some stunning plants. It has small secluded seating areas. Immerse yourself in the countryside indoors.There are shops and restaurants surrounding the greenery. I loved it. So will you 💕
A nice place to sit,We visited and really enjoyed seeing all the plants and the little stalls inside are nice to visit too. A good place to pop into if the weather turns too!
Wow!! ,"Loved it! Lots of NZ native plants, made me smile as i was visiting from my new home ( NZ) . Really peaceful, loved the small galleries etc in there too.Well done sheffield!"
A brief  peacegul interlude in the middle of the city,"It's like a breath of fresh air in the city, what more do you need. It's a  garden in the city providing a little breathing  space"
Great for a break,"It’s quite warm in here, and very peaceful. There aren’t too many things to walk around and examine as such, maybe 10 minutes maximum, but the building and plants make for a pleasant place to sit and relax. It’s generally not particularly noisy in here, and it seems to be very well monitored by staff.I’d highly recommend coming here for a breather and some peace and quiet if spending the day shopping or on your feet in Sheffield. There are a fair number of benches to make use of, and I’ve always felt comfortable on my own in here."
Lovely place to relax,Would be a lovely place to stop and read for half an hour as it is free to enter. Food and drink is available but there is not a lot of seating.
Pleasant interlude,A good place to stop for a breather while visiting the various other venues in the vicinity. Have a sandwich and coffee before continuing your explorations.
Great place to spend some time.,Beautiful place to just pass the time of day. There's a cafe as well and access to the Millennium Gallery.Not to be missed if in Sheffield.
Nice,"Nice place, it's cool to take a little walk here and to look at the trees ! Think you can also get a coffee so it can be a relaxing place to go"
Oasis in the city,"Lovely oasis of calm in the city centre with interesting plants, a coffee shop and entrance to the Millennium Gallery. Great place just to sit and enjoy."
Fab place for good coffee,"Relax, drink coffee good to let the little ones have some freedom without traffic. Sheffield steel, always interesting to visit the museum."
So pretty,Myself and my husband stay at the mecure every year and as its attached to the winter gardens we always go into the gardens to have a drink and snack in the beautiful surroundings
Oasis in city centre,"What a fantastic place to visit. A calm oasis in the city centre. Lots of beautiful plants and interesting, thought provoking exhibits. A great place to spend an hour or more."
Nice surprise to discover this tropical oasis in the heart of a bustling city like Sheffield,"We came upon this by accident when looking for the art gallery and museum (which are across the road ).  Wonderful tropical plants and a nice calming atmosphere away from the hustle and bustle of the  nearby shops.  Includes an adjacent gallery of its own and of course the ubiquitous gift shop, but a nice spot to while away a few minutes, or even hours."
got married there,"Very nice escape from the British weather, nicely setup, very good location. safe for children. Recommended"
Kind of small and uneventful ,"From the pictures it seems a lot bigger, it is more a gallery to walk through. It has 2 coffee shops that look OK but not exceptional. Nice place to just sit a bit on a bench and relax, like an indoor park for when it rains.It is free to visit"
Afternoon meeting,"I have been in The Winter Gardens many times since its construction, to look at the wonderful botanical specimens, to rest awhile on one of the benches, to look at something being exhibited there, or perhaps to see an occasional performance, to purchase lunch, to meet someone or merely to use it as access from one place to another.However this was the first time that I have stayed there to have an afternoon meal with others. Although the number of tables and chairs is limited, there was sufficient space for all and the exotic flora provided a pleasant atmosphere for dining and convivial chat.There was a fair selection to choose from on the menu which was reasonably priced. It certainly made a very suitable venue for the afternoon.There are a couple of other shops selling mainly souvenir stationery and other mementos, and should these not suffice there is further available in the adjoining Millennium Galleries.The Winter Gardens are cool and well ventilated, but also have underfloor heating. There are steps at one entrance but also a relatively gentle access ramp. The opposite end opens out onto a flat pedestrian precinct for easy access.Although it can be a busy place at times, there is always a sense of space and openness, perhaps a few more plants might not go amiss. The plants are generally labelled but one or two occasionally lack such. The general information boards though cannot be faulted.However The Winter Gardens is a well designed, wonderfully constructed, Ideally sited gem that combines natural beauty with architectural skill. A place for a single visit, or more likely one to return to time and again."
Lovely walk through,"Great to walk through here. There was some art exhibitions on when went, which were very interesting. All free too!There are also some nice stalls selling gifts, which are worth a look. Plus, some little actual shops too"
Day out,Taking a trip around town you need to visit here. Lots of Tropical plants and places to Eat and drink.
Exploring Sheffield,"Great indoor garden, perfect for a coffee break and retail relaxation. Lovely and tidy and the garden is clearly well looked after!"
Nice place when it rains,It’s a nice and well mantained indoor garden. They should organise some event or entertainment more often though. The gallery with the shop is not the best. Too expensive to buy little things!
Wedding photos,"When we got married we originally wanted to have our pictures taken in the peace gardens but the Sheffield by the seaside event was on at the time, so we went in to the winter gardens and it is lovely inside, we got some beautiful photos.We've also been inside when it has different activities on in the school holidays.It has nice little coffee shop too."
Wonderdul little oasis,What a wonderful little oasis in the centre of a bustling city centre.We'll worth a visit - there were little stalls offering kids activities and there was a shop offering local art and crafts.As well as lots of wonderful plants Grab a coffee and enjoy the relaxing setting
A relaxing green haven,"Whether you want a walk through a green paradise or a quiet spot to relax, the Winter Gardens is well worth visiting. There is also a nice choice of little shops and eateries."
Lovely little space,"I love walking through the winter gardens with my young boy, he always enjoys looking at all the plants and displays. It's a clean and well kept little gem and it's great architecture."
Great space in the heart of the city.,"A lovely spot in the middle of the city, trees and benches, completely free to use. It's well used by locals who stop off to eat their sandwiches or just to sit. There's a little cafe, and a smarter one downstairs, also pop-up shops and exhibitions happening all the time."
Well Kept Gardens,We visited the Winter Gardens last week with our granddaughter as it was part of the Lego event which was being held around the town. It is a glass domed well kept garden in the centre of Sheffield. There are lots of different shrubs and plants which are all named. There are bench seats and there is also a cafe as well.
Lovely Oasis,"Went in here for a coffee. There’s a nice independent coffee place in there. It’s a stunning building and the plants are spectacular, creating a peaceful little oasis in the city centre. There’s access to the museum (worth a visit) and there’s a great independent shop next to the coffee place selling locally made products. A lovely glasshouse in the heart of the city. If you’re in Sheffield it’s worth popping in."
Great new attraction for city centre,"Very close to the famous crucible in the heart of the city, plants from all over the world on view growing here, free to walk through, craft shops within, close to all the new restaurants"
Good place to visit - especially if it is raining.,"This is a large glass building with tropical trees containing some little shops and pop-up shops and exhibition rooms.When we were there there was an exhibition of Sheffield Silver, its history and hand crafted show pieces. There was also an exhibition about the Peace Movement (anti-war).It felt a pleasant little haven where there was also a cafe."
Nice peaceful area,Restful area to walk through. We. Had a fantastic serenade from a young Opera company advertising a forth coming event.
Rainy day retreat,"After quick lunch, we retreated to the shelter of rain forest in the middle of town. Great for children to run around while grownups rest their feet. Don't miss the Gallery when ready to move on."
Pretty and peaceful,We enjoyed visiting this lovely wee garden in the city centre.  There are sweet little shops and a cafe as well as Lego sculptures and animal art to look at.  Relatively small but a nice place for a quick wander to look at the plants.
"Pretty, but small","Worth a quick walk-though if you're there, but nothing spectatular or unusual. A nice little green space with various plants."
Visited the Lego,The Winter Garden is small but nice to walk round. Nice places to sit and relax. We came into look at the Lego. Nice that Winter Garden was a part of that. We would visit again when in Sheffield.
Lovely gardens,"We were on a visit to Sheffield for the Lego event and went through the gardens, which are lovely, amazing plants and a very relaxing place with places you can buy coffee and linger a while."
Amazing plants,"Lovely experience, beautiful singing choir and enchanting violin players. Variety of interesting shops.."
Don’t be in a rush,"Plenty to look at, all the questions asked by the kids can be answered by reading the numbered sheets placed near the items, we’ve been several times and all of us have enjoyed it, usually prior to a meal at one of the local restaurants"
Nice for kids ,"My cousin loves to play in the winter gardens, it’s a great place to go for a play and drink nice Coffe."
Very small but so good!,"About an hour's walk around if you go slow, great attraction. Right next to the museum and has lots of little cafes inside. Beautiful plants and lots of seating. Excellent to visit on a lovely day but it is inside if raining."
One of the great places in Sheffield,"I went with my kids age 8, 6 and 2 they really enjoyed it as there was some activity for them also they loved the diversity of the plants there and kept reading each and every name"
Nice relaxing spot,The winter gardens are great full relaxing and having a bit of dinner. Perfect location next to St. Paul’s.
A gem in the city,We ran in here to escape the rain and what a surprise. A little tropical paradise in the middle of Sheffield.
"Winter Gardens, Sheffield","The Winter Gardens are situated right in the middle of Sheffield City Centre, so you would need to park in one of the City's Car Parks if you don't want to walk very far.  This building is predominantly made of composite, arched, wooden spars and rafters and of course glass!  It does get quite warm inside, even in the middle of Winter it is very warm; so much so they have tropical trees and plants growing inside.  The building is approimately 100 metres long and 20 metres wide, and has paths and walkways winding through it from one end tyo the other.  It is very wheelchair friendly as it's very flat inside, and the best thing is it's free entry!  When the World Snooker is on at the Crucible Theatre, they also have an exhibition snooker table inside the Winter Gardens, so it does get quite busy at that time.  if you are in Sheffield at any time, it is worth a look-in.  There is a small cafe inside at one end, with chairs and tables on the pathways which makes you feel as though you're among the plants and trees whilst having a cuppa!"
Nice,Nice littlepit stop outside of the busy town. Cool and calm with a lovely atmosphere. Nice little sit down and relax.
Lovely indoor tropical garden,"Came across this whilst walking through the city, lovely little free tropical garden under a roof. Well worth a visit or just a walk through. Very impressive."
Small but perfectly formed ,"Winter Gardens (sometimes called botanical gardens) is a lovely oasis in the middle of Sheffield. It's commercial (there's no charge to walk through the gardens but there are cafés), but greenspace is always welcome"
Great city space,"Beautiful building with some interesting plants, attached to attractive exhibition space. We whiled away an hour or so in the steel and photography exhibitions and wish our home town offered something similar."
Wonderful space,Very nice grounds. Plenty space to sit and take in nature sights. Small cafe also inside. Would definitely return.
Relaxing calm atmosphere,"A walk through the gardens is a very calming experience in the centre of a busy city.  It is so pleasant to walk round and the little shops are nice to look in.  When you walk in here you enter another world, definitely worth visiting.  The area outside the gardens is also pleasant, very clean, a lovely place to get away from it all."
A relaxing experience,Lovely exotic planting. Pleasant place to sit and people watch. Went on a Sunday so not overly busy. Good organic cafe was open with excellent food  and a nice craft pop up shop. A great modern high vaulted glasshouse. What a good idea in the he heart of a city. Clean and well maintained. A little warm but on a very hot summer’s day.
Coffee and a sit down ,Lovely place to relax and watch the world go by. Nice little bespoke shops with a couple of coffee / tea bars. Clean with lots of seats.
Lovely place,Really nice to sit and enjoy the pleasant smells and sights. Good in both winter and summer. Only problem can be teenagers hanging around.
