Unmissable and Bonkers,"I love this spectacular and dazzling pleasure palace built for the Prince Regent in 1815.  This extraordinary building is hard to describe to someone who has never seen it.  Outside the design is 'Indian' and inside the design is what the architects and artisans thought China was supposed to be like.  It's preposterous, quite outrageous and utterly extravagant.  Dragon sculptures and motifs, a huge chandelier with 15,000 crystals, serpents, peacocks, pagodas, amazing ceilings, carvings, fireplaces, furniture in a riot of colour.  The guides in each room are friendly and very knowledgeable.  I highly recommend it as one of the most unusual palaces in the world."
Royal Pavillion,"Beautiful interiors to an amazing building. Well worth a visit. I had visited Brighton several times before but had never been inside this fantastic place. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Staff were helpful and friendly, sanitiser was available and I felt safe with the social distancing in place."
Beautiful Historical Palace,"Haven't been for years so added to my staycation list of day trips. Easy to pre-book online and check in. I also downloaded the app in advance for the audio guide - please take headphones! In one room, I think I could hear 3 audio guides running plus my own which was quite distracting but I can always listen again at home later.Some stunning things on display in every room, not sure what it is about royal decor but it's so bright and cheerful. Definitely only works on a grand scale, not sure the colour schemes could work in a ""normal"" house 😂. The chandeliers alone are a sight to behold, do not get Del Boy to help clean these ones!I love history and even better this is on my doorstep, shame a few rooms were closed but understandable at the moment. The guidebook is well worth the £14 and is probably the most comprehensive guide book I've ever seen, took me a few evenings to read through it, full of information. The WW1 room looked great but it's also a bit of a bottleneck as a lot to read in there so distancing a bit of an issue in this room only.Maybe a return visit when fully reopened is on the cards. The tour through probably took me about 1.5hrs but a lot to see at every turn so no doubt another visit and I will spot new things.Also a discount on tickets if you live in Brighton, Hove or Portslade - shame I'm just over the border but still worth it."
Bizarre but wonderful,"First time at the Pavilion and it is still worth visiting with the masks etc. There is probably nothing like this in the country with the over abundant decoration of each and every room, it is like no other Royal Palace."
Amazing place.,Unfortunately a few rooms are currently closed. All the rest of the building is amazing. It is one of the few places that has truly amazed me.
stunning,"such a beautiful  place loved looking round, staff very friendly. Booking online was easy. Tickets were no problem picking up"
Fabulous Place!,My first visit to the Royal Pavilion and I thought it was absolutely amazing! So incredibly opulent and impressive.  I believe some of the artefacts are on loan from Buckingham Palace as one of the curators said it was a 'once in a lifeline chance' to see many of them.During this pandemic it was obviously an incredibly quiet time to visit and we often had whole rooms all to ourselves which is usually unheard of.  A very good time to go and visit and you have every reason to feel comfortable with the Covid precautions in place.
Magnificent but also very dilapidated ,Stumbled across this huge building. Decided not to go in however the outside seems grande. Quite an odd building as it doesn’t quite suit Brighton’s surroundings. I assume it must have quite a story as to why it is here.
It’s a must!,"You should visit, it’s such an interesting place, so opulent! What a character King George IV was!!!"
Such an unusual place,"Great place to visit, audio guide download by QR code also makes the most of it. Make sure you take headphones! They’ve worked hard to make it Covid safe. Also although I’ve been before I never used the loos. These are also worth visiting as they are a feature of bygone times, with beautiful tiles."
"Breathtakingly beautiful, one of the most amazing places i have ever been!!","All i can say is WOW!!What an amazing place, i was blown away so much so i almost cried!! Could not believe how beautiful this place was.We visited whilst on a trip to Brighton, my husband wasn't that keen on going but we went anyway and it is literally one of the most amazing places we have ever been.We went on a wednesday morning and there was hardly anyone else there, maybe 4 or 5 other people walking round. We both thoroughly enjoyed looking round and reading all of the information boards, the staff we so lovely and informative. Such great value at only £15 each to get in, so much cheaper than most other historical buildings.You must go!!!"
Breathtaking,"A must visit and put it on your bucket list, this exceeded my expectations, absolutely stunning and blew me away, cant say anymore except awesome!"
Opulence!,Finally got around to visiting this extraordinary place in the heart of Brighton.  Friendly staff and managing covid guidelines to keep staff and visitors safe. Extraordinary amount of dragons everywhere and the chandeliers were so extravagant!  Worth a visit if opulence is your thing! .
Seeing the sites,"Have been to Brighton many times, but have never been here. Was not disappointed. Wow!. Totally worth a visit."
Excellent place to visit in Brighton,Very interesting place to visit. Amazing interiors. You get an idea of how the Royals had a good time! Unfortunately there is some repair work taking place and the exterior is covered in scaffolding in most places. If you take East Street from the sea front that will take you to the building.
Interesting ,Return visit after many yearsInteresting to see the continued restoration and the objects on loan from Buckingham Palace
Saturday trip to the shore,The pavilion was beautiful but we weren't able to access the tour on our (American) phones...wouldn't load.  Wish there had been more placards with info.  Still beautiful and worth the visit.  Cute gift shop too.  Staff was all super friendly.
Must see ,"Nice place to visit, beautiful piece of architecture. Unfortunately at the visit time there was a scaffolding on the right side but inside everything was amazing"
A piece of history for Brighton,A beautiful piece of architecture now gladly seeing major refurbishment.A place you just must see if visiting Brighton.
Unique and extravagant!,"Like nothing else!Like me, you may have seen many remarkable castles and palaces across Europe. The Royal Pavilion is like no other and you will never forget your visit!The staff were amazingly friendly and knowledgeable and the Pavilion has been superbly restored since Queen Victoria stripped it bare in 1850 when she sold it to Brighton Council. She even took the wallpaper!"
Fantastic show..absolutely stunning,This was one of the best shows I have seen in the last 10 years..do make an effort to see these amazing items in such a surroundings..the staff go to so much trouble to explain their beautiful items..here is the collection of George 1V who really spent on his place
Beautiful ,"Just to walk around the grounds & admire the architecture, stunning.Here are some pics of our little walk around town!"
Can never tire of the Brighton Pavilion!,"One of many visits to the Royal Pavilion  -  can never go there too many times!   Bookable in advance.   Parts of the interior were closed, including the tea shop, due to covid (distancing being observed), but so much to see.   The Music Room is absolutely stunning, as is the dining room.   Wherever you turn there is the most incredible colour and exotic design.   It's like being transported to another world, and thankfully the guides are not intrusive.   Photography allowed for personal use, no flash or selfie sticks.   Will let the photos do the talking!"
"Very interesting ornate rooms, audio guide could be better","We went using an experience gift voucher from our family. Unfortunately the cream tea part of the experience wasn't possible because the tea room was closed due to the Covid situation, but we knew that in advance so we just went to see the rooms.There was plenty to see and it was very interesting though one slight disappointment was the audio guide solution they have introduced to get round not handing out headphones etc.It works by scanning a QR code and downloading the audio for each room over your phone. The signal was poor so it was very slow and it didn't seem to let you listen with the screen off so a potential battery drainer. We gave up after the second room.A better solution might be to put the guides for each room as a podcast on iTunes so they could be downloaded in advance over wifi and listened to as you go round."
Beautiful Building,Unfortunately at the time we visited there was scaffolding all around the building which obviously distracted from the beauty of the place. It really is a magnificent looking building and has to be seen to fully appreciate it. Don't miss if visiting Brighton
Royal History,"No visit to Brighton is complete without a visit to the Royal Pavillon.  It was my second visit in four years and I felt the old palace was looking a tad tired.  The great chandeliers could do with a good clean.  The rooms were still pretty to look at and for some of us, this is the closest we would get to Royalty My favourite room is the music room.  Sit on the green bench and gaze on the ceiling,  simply beautiful"
Beautiful place- well worth a visit,Having pre booked a time we arrived early and were welcomed in with no problem. We used the app to guide us around which was very informative with a fuller explanation if required. The pavilion is stunning and definitely worth a visit
Fantastic would recommend,Beautiful building. One way system.  Not too crowded.  Informative audio guide can be downloaded on mobile.  Helpful and friendly staff.   Really glad we visited.
Exotic Interiors,"We had booked in advance, and needed a carer ticket, these cannot be booked from the web site you to phone in, but it was no problem.  Very well organised flow through the venue.  The interior is well presented and highly ornate.  A great place to wander around."
What a shame,"Real shame, place looks derelict. Gardens unkempt, scaffolding everywhere. Thankfully it seems it’s being repaired and maintained but you have to ask why it was ever allowed to get into the state it has. Didn't take any photos as it looked so bad. .....lets hope the work brings it back to its rightful glory."
Well organised ,"Fantastic visit with my mother. Considering Covid, the venue was exceptionally well organised and we felt as safe as houses. I have absolutely no doubt I shall be back to visit from Manchester one day."
Beautiful on the inside,"Although the outside of the Royal Pavilion is looking shabby (and partly covered in scaffolding in efforts, I assume, to get rid of the shabbiness), the interior of the Pavilion is spectacular. There wasn't much information about the different rooms (there is an audio commentary as long as you bring a phone and headphones), however I was happy to look around and admire the place. The people working there had a great knowledge of the place and were happy to answer questions."
"Beautiful, Magical Palace or Place ","I've wanted to visit here for a number if years,  I was very pleased to be here.  We were some of the first guests in,  it was the day after bank holiday and it was lovely and quiet,  we could see everything and had a perfect view.  The digital tour is great.  The tour guides are very informative. Do not visit Brighton without coming here first."
"Nice visit, shame they did not offer headphones","We arrived without a booking and asked if there was availability.  They said you needed to access the commentary on our phones as they were not providing headsets due to Covid.  There were 3 of us, we put the sound on the phone as quietly as possible and all listened to it but were told off by staff.  We did advise them we did not have headphones before we booked the tickets and they said that was no problem, so made us feel uncomfortable.  Nice building, the staff seemed very knowledgeable."
Not enough information,We visited and understand that head sets are not available and they tell you you can download the tour on hour phone. But no wifi and I didnt have a very good signal on my phone to use my data. Maybe better info around the rooms. Alot seemed to be cut off so the visit took us less than an hour.
A really interesting visit,"What better place to start a first review since the lockdown started! Very well organised, pre-booked with a time slot and plenty of signage and supervision to ensure separation of visiting parties. The venue itself is fascinating with lots of explanations throughout and knowledgeable staff on hand in all rooms. Use the QR code to get the on-line tour guide - this works really well."
Nice place,Definitely worth a visit after COVID so take a look. The grounds are lovey and so is the view of the sea
Worth a visit ,At £15.50 per adult it is very expensive. However definitely worth a view. There are only really 3 or 4 rooms to look at. Probably takes around 45 mins. They don’t do a good job of describing the timeline. It’s hard to understand the history. They do a good job of describing how the pavilion was used. Also the app is good.
Nice place to visit,Nice palace. Definitely worthed to visit. We personally like the kitchen area of the palace. Tea room has good view of garden.
Lovely afternoon visit,To visit I booked online a couple days before I visited & the booking process is straightforward. I printed the tickets & showed them on arrival. Masks are required inside the Pavilion. The Pavilion was nice & quiet & speaking to staff it would normally be very busy. The exterior was disappointing as it is being refurbished so a lot is covered but obviously at some point the work would need to be done so it is understandable & I can visit again when the refurbishment is complete. Inside is very beautiful. There are numerous rooms to look round & please also look at the ceilings as they are so ornate & would be a shame to miss. There is a member of staff in each room & I found them all to be cheerful & informative. I believe that there is normally a cafe but this is currently closed however in the grounds there is a kiosk so if you are hungry there is that option. A pleasant afternoon. Thank you.
Fabulous,Absolutely fantastic architectural design great 👍🏼 building given by India 🇮🇳 to enhance this wonderful city. Sadly need to book online but didn’t have time 👍🏼🙏🏼😊👌🏼
Well worth a visit ,"What an amazing place to visit, staff are amazing. Don’t be put off by the scaffolding outside the inside is a place well worth wearing a mask for and social distancing."
Great way to spend an hour,Went for the tour of the pavillion on a wet day in Brighton. Beutiful interior and good commentary on the free digital app. Worth the entrace fee. Better during covid as limited numbers allowed in so more time to relax and take it in
Stunning artwork and lots of history,Bit pricey but very lovely. The architecture is good and the art work inside is very impressive. Staff inside are helpful and happy to explain anything.
Brighton Pavilion,Excellent knowledgeable staff who were keen to share their enthusiasm for their role with visitors. Their knowledge extends way beyond tour books. Rooms are being reinstated with their original furnishings as more items are returned  from other settings.
Beautiful,"Although the renovations going on it was great experience, beautif architecturw and every room we entered was realy breathtaking, definately on TO SEE list in UK.We have not bought tickets online, but have not waited long to buy them at the place, we have waited maybe about 5 to 20 minutes.Great experience"
Brighton's History,"Staff dotted around the where great .full of knowledge and added to the experience.  Thought it was very expensive for a tour considering the amount of time we where in there ,£30 for 2 adults, tour lasted about an hour. It was very interesting to see and learn the history."
Worth a visit,"Really enjoyed our visit at the royal Pavilion,  really interesting to look around, the dining area literally took my breath away the room is amazing! Definitely worth a visit when visiting Brighton."
Interesting and interested staff,"Have visited before but never tire of the splendor! The staff in each room are very good, giving detail that wasn't in even the detailed audio guide. They obviously love their job and take pride in what they do."
Interesting and beautiful ,A lovely way to spend a windy and wet day. Beautiful and geared to covid with app etc . Also residents have discounts
Amazing Place,"My wife and I never fail to be amazed by the unique grandeur of this property. We've visited numerous times and never been disappointed, even when simple picnicking in the grounds as we did on this occasion."
Must see!,"If you're in Brighton then you must take the time to visit the Royal Pavilion. This is one of the most breathtakingly beautiful buildings I have ever been in! Much of the interior has been recreated to restore it to its former glory, but this doesn't take away from the wow factor. There are currently renovations happening to the exterior but this didn't really affect our visit. Due to current COVID19 restrictions, you need to book your tickets and time slot online. There was plenty of same day availability when I booked our tickets. Masks are to be worn inside, but visitor numbers are restricted so you can effectively socially distance. I would have liked more information in each room we visited (I'm not a fan of audio guides) but there were helpful staff around able to answer my questions. Cute gift shop, too!"
Beautiful ,"Gorgeous little estate. Unfortunately a few areas of the pavilion are currently closed, but the parts that are open are opulent and splendid. They have an audio tour that you can listen to on your phone, giving details of the interior designs and furnishings, as well as the history of the building. Staff is also at hand to answer any questions and give more information.Beautiful place well worth a visit."
Stunning,Fantastic treasures in a beautiful building  with interesting knowledgable guides who were always on hand .
Amazing historical building ,"We visited the RP as it has great reviews on TA and weren't disappointed. If you enjoy viewing historical buildings,  museums etc you'll love this. Unusual architecture, well restored rooms, covid secure measures in place.You can book online (although booking system wouldn't work for me) or just turn up and see if you can go round at that point.There isn't anything interactive but the rooms were so interesting that our 7 year old loved it. We used the voice guide app to explain each room which was really good and worked well.We browsed and took a slow walk around and it took us just under 90mins to get round the house. You can also explore the gardens.Overall a must for history buffs, great on a rainy day too."
Brilliant ,I have visited Brighton numerous times but had never been inside the pavilion.  Visited this weekend and found it absolutely amazing. Each room you enter has a wow factor.  Covid measures in place made for a safe worry free visit.
A stunning piece of architecture!,"The pavilion is wonderful to look at and the surrounding gardens are a nice place to walk around. Unfortunately, in the heatwave, they could do with watering around as the gardens are going brown."
Wacky place!,"Staff all very happy to help, and good attention to current precautions.  Sadly some areas closed at the moment which made the visit shorter than expected, but still well worth the visit. Colourful, interesting and a fun twist on a stately home visit!"
shame NO CASH allowed,"Because it was SO VERY HOT, &  a 4hr stop in Brighton, we just popped into the shop. Wishing to only buy 2 post cards  @.95p each, my friend went to the checkout. The policy of the shop is NO CASH  card only.... my friend said she has the right money and would leave it on the counter. The girls said  they hve no way of opening the till. So, my friend asked to see a manager & explained that it would cost her to use her card - & y not just leave the money of the counter. The VERY NICE man - Security I think.... suggested that she leave the money in a collection box in the pavilion. Thank you Sir - you and your team are a credit to the pavilion  - not so the shop.  I think they need to re assess the NO CASH policy as many who vist the pavilion and shop are in no doubt wanting to use CASH."
Beautiful.,"A beautiful building, both inside and out, you cannot appreciate the magnitude and size until you take the tour. Stunning interiors and fascinating history, we spent around an hour visiting, you could get around in less time, or take longer, depending on how long you like to gaze at beautiful artifacts! We visited spontaneously and hadn't planned our trup, but it was well worth the visit. Social distancing measures are in place and well managed, but did not disrupt our experience at all."
Excellent,"Although having recently opened after lockdown the venue was very interesting. The addition of an app that gave a spoken tour was very useful. Staff could not have been more helpful and attentive, any questions were answered with good quality detail"
Stunning!,What an amazing place! Every room had a wow factor! A fascinating glimpse into our royal history. Definitely worth a visit.
A must see oriental vision,"We booked a week before going and when we arrived we were early but allowed in as visitor numbers are down. This is a shame because the Pavilion is an amazing, awesome palace. The Chinese and oriental decor is breathtaking, the colours brilliant. Was a little surreal going around with not many visitors but does give you a chance to fully take in the Palace without feeling hurried. Please visit Brighton Pavilion as these treasures need to be seen to be believed"
A must-see if you're in Brighton,"We went to the Royal Pavillion for an 11am entry after booking last week.I wasnt really sure what to expect as the exterior looks a little tired, so I was pleasantly surprised!The interior is amazing, particularly the Banqueting Room with its impressive chandeliers, dragon sculptures and gold trimmings.We spent about 45 minutes exploring the house and staff were happy to answer our questions as we went around.Definitely go if you're in Brighton!"
Underwhelming due to temporary works,It is closed for renovation at the moment. The outside is partly covered by scaffolding so that did take away a lot of the magic. Nice choice of planting in the surrounding gardens nonetheless
Under construction ,"Beautiful building but works being carried out at the moment to maintain it. Still worth a visit, just don’t stop for lunch in the surrounding gardens unless you want to be attacked by seagulls!"
A walk into a regency wonderland!,I had always wanted to visit the Royal Pavillion (like for 20 years) and finally got the chance. it was incredible! The dining room with the dragons left me speechless.
what a place,i went there a few months ago and it was amazing as soon as we went in i felt like a king. its such an amazingly designed building would definatly reccomend.
Beautiful,"You must visit the Royal Pavillion at Brighton. It is an amazing building and steeped in history. It can take you as long as you like to wander around but do wander, don't rush. There is so much to see, read and absorb. The cafe is nice and reasonably priced. It is free if you are a member of English Heritage."
"Absolutely fascinating, especially the kitchens.",Your tour guides are sexist - scolding the men with big cameras (who aren't even taking any photos) but ignoring the women who are taking flash photos all the time.
A trip to 18th century,"A very well preserved building, taking you back to the Victorian England and before! A unique element of the building is that the external look is Indian, while the internal is closer to Far East style!"
Stunning Late 18th Century Extravagance,"The Royal Pavillion is a Brighton icon, the seaside retreat largely constructed in the late 18th century for the later King George IV.  It is symbolic both of the city with its attractive location on the south coast and of the enduring folly of the 18th century part of the House of Hannover, emblematic of the reckless spending that marked the reign of George IV.The building is hard to miss, it stretches out behind its own gardens facing towards the Old Steine area of the city.  As much as the Palace Pier, the Pavilion is an enduring image of Brighton and one that is a reminder that this place has for a very long time been the playground of those with creativity and ambition.The design both without and within is not at all standard.  The outside has an orientalist visage.  The frontage at a push could be confused for a particularly grand mosque.  There is clearly an Ottoman influence with the minaret stylings and the domed curvatures.  There is little to suggest it is a British monarch's home.Despite having the features of the Near East as frontage, inside it is entirely different.  The interior is decadently designed with a representation of the aesthetic of the Far East.  The Chinese elements absolutely dominate most of the grand rooms and areas.  A curio both outside and in.The history of the building is fascinating and speaks to changing times in British culture.  The deep suspicion of George IV's father was clearly in the air when construction began given the future monarch was under investigation for financial extravagence.  Yet the absolutism of the Hannovers meant he felt it perfectly acceptable to construct yet another overly lavish and exaggerated home.Financial overstretch meant that the Pavilion was never completed.  The interior of the dome for instance never reached conclusion.  George IV just did not have enough money because spending could not be snapped out of thin air forever.  The purchase of this palace of a building by Brighton Council was a wise move because it allowed it to be renovated after the loss of its patron when Victoria took against the city.  Being in public hands meant it had a series of future lives including as a military hospital during WWI with the evidence of the patients and their signatures having been preserved in corners.Now as a tourist location, the Pavilion is restored to a majesty it probably rarely saw during its days under George IV.  There is a slight lack of authenticity about the fact much o what is on display is a replica.  It is hard to tell though as the original features and the new work so beautifully together.The interiors are unbelievable.  This is one of the most staggeringly beautiful stately locations in the UK from the inside.  In particular, the banqueting room is overpoweringly lavish.  The Chinese reds are everywhere.  They add a richness and a vibrancy rarely matched across the country.  The banqueting hall is suitably large with Chinese iconography everywhere, not least the dragons patrolling the roof.  The table setting itself is clearly majesterial.Other grand rooms include the large and small music rooms.  They are not as spectacular as the banqueting section but are nonetheless still beautiful.  The large music room maintains a space that surely was once thronging with revellers.  It is a bit of a shame the organ is somewhat inaccessible but the Chinese drapes, pagodas, and statuettes with the intricacy of the design they contain are just sumptuous.  The story of that room is barely believable.   Twice ravaged, once by fire in 1975, and even less believably damaged by a huge stone ball dislodged by the legendary storm of 1987.  The music room remains a wonder though and has been restored lovingly after those calamities.Other parts of the building are also nice just not as spectacular.  There is a pleasant view from what is now a cafe looking out over the gardens which themselves are amongst Brighton's busiest spots during periods of warm weather.Price is entirely reasonable.  Off-season is better value than peak and residents have a decent discount.Although the Pavilion is in many parts a restoration rather than completely original, the spectacular nature of the design which replicates the original and gives a really great insight into the life of the turn of the 19th century elite and those who worked for them.  It is stunning and well worth a visit."
Amazing,"Fantastic and breathtaking interior to this unusual former palace.We used the recorded commentary, which made the whole experience really interesting, however the staff were also very knowledgable.Highly recommended."
Well worth a visit,Amazing place!  A British King combines Indian architecture with Chinese decor.  You can tell he has not been to either as this is just a fantasy place.  Something very different and worth a visit.Takes about an hour.
Wonderful piece of architecture,"Well worth a visit, rain or no rain!  Very interesting history as well as the beautifully and elegantly decorated rooms."
Lovely gardens,"Pretty, well looked after gardens. Great for any ages. Lovely on a summers day, nice walk great anytime of the year really"
Interesting visit,"Very interesting to visit this pllce, it's been on our list for some time.  Mixed feelings about it.  Lots of history, extremely well restored.  Lots of gold and Oriental decor.   Lots to see.  But very OTT.  Interesting insight into George IV.Thought it a little expensive.  And something annoyed us in that, like some other places of interest, you have to ask if they offer concessions.  In our case as English Heritage Members.  If we hadn't asked we would have been charged anothe £12.  Not very nice!!!"
Worth a Visit,We  really enjoyed our visit to the Royal Pavilion so much to see . Amazing building and beautiful rooms .
Fabulously decadent!,Visited again in December 2019 and was delighted to find that the ban on interior photography had been lifted!  And what fabulousness to photograph and see!!!  It's opulent and decadent and just AMAZING to see!  Love the place!
Awesome opulence! ,An amazing palace. Worth a visit. 😊 We took advantage of the National Rail 2for1. It would be good if a few more areas were open to the public. However the rooms available to view are amazing. Go now while they still have exhibits on loan from Buckingham Palace. 😊
Lost in time,"This is a beautiful spectacular building, with many splendid paintings, chandeliers and furniture, which are much better in reality than in the photographs.  With lots of historical information. The guides are very knowledgable and helpful. Children would be fascinated I am sure."
OTT Chinoiserie!,"There is a word which seems to be coming back into fashion which, to my mind, sums up this place. It’s a bit bonkers!Don’t be put off by the somewhat dowdy exterior... the inside is anything but. Buy tickets online to save money."
A striking attraction,"Its not only a striking attraction but tells a great  story  about King George which adds a value to it. If you visit Brighton , you shouldn't miss this place."
Stand out architecture ,What a great building! It’s like a little piece of Asia in Brighton. The pavilion is seriously impressive. There is a small grounds area you can walk around and you can also take a tour inside the pavilion for a fee. It’s steps away from the lanes so easy to get to.
Well worth it,Staying in Brighton overnight and made a specific point of visiting for the first time. We were not disappointed. The interior is sumptuous particularly the dining & music room. We do not like audio guides but each room had very adequate written & photographic details. Allow 1-1-1/2hours.
Look after this,"Was shocked to see how exterior had deteriorated last few years, admission price very steep , but  a amazing piece of history everyone should vist"
Interesting,"A really good afternoon exploring, very interesting host, would return ..A lovely way to spend a winters afternoon ."
"Amazing place - hideous in places, but a fascinating insight of Royal life","Visited with the benefit of an Art Pass (free entry) - amazing insight into how Royalty lived - honestly hideous in parts, but also fascinating to see the kitchens and the more opulent rooms. Nice guided walk-through - only shame was curtains on all the windows so did not get to see the views, whatever they were. Worth a visit."
Great queue jumping for autism,I went with my son for the free annual open day. The staff were swift in allowing us to enter straight away due to his autism. I have been a few time but I never cease to be amazed by how utterly beautiful it is and it was great seeing it through my son's eyes. The historical film was interesting and a couple of hours can swiftly go
Saturday morning visit.,"We went on a Saturday morning, which worked out o.k. as we were able to see most of the exhibits and generally found it quite interesting. On the down side, i personaly found it a bit mean that after paying £12 each they still charged you £2 each for a hand held thingy to get audio description of each exhibit."
"Ornate, decadent and very Brighton!","Brighton is known for its decadence and so the palace provides the perfect historical backdrop to a vibrant city. Worth a visit? Yes. However, it isn't cheap and although the children enjoyed it, it is probably still geared towards adult visitors."
Wonderful place to visit ,"We have been several times over the years but never tire of the Pavilion.  The decor is just breathtaking in places. Very helpful staff and a nice tea room. Just one thing though, the exterior really needs some TLC. Well worth a visit"
"Amazing, but not cheap.","Definitely worth seeing, however not sure it was worth £15 each. Took us about 2 1/2 hours to get round without audio guides. Worth noting when we went it was quite cold inside. Stay wrapped up in winter!"
Why is this place looking so awful now?,"Walking through Pavilion Gardens to have a look at the usually beautiful pavilion and was dismayed to see it's got, what looks like brown mould, over a great area of the building outside at the back where the entrance is to go in.Why has nothing been done to sort this out?  It really looks bad - something needs doing ASAP.It's very sad to see the Pavilion in such a poor state."
oriental style on the inside,A beautiful palace that is very orientally styled on the inside and not what you expect from the outside . you can take your time walking through and an audio guide is available . There is a very reasonable cafe .
My 2nd visit and still in love,"This was my 2nd visit, a 3rd attempt during the Beast from the East (closed) I still love this pavilion and I get to notice more and more details. Look in every corner of the ceiling. Every lamp is so unique."
A wonderful site,We were really impressed with the pavilion it is a fantastic sight to view in Brighton. A close walk from the beach and pier and a really impressive building.
Amazing Opulence,"We were fortunate to visit the Royal Pavilion when new items had just arrived on loan from the Royal Collection.  The Chinese style artefacts were fascinating and colourful, although just about everything was a British idea of China rather than genuinely Chinese.The dining room and the music room were a riot of extravagance.  The dragon and peacocks chandeliers were a particular highlight.On a wet day it was a great way to spend a couple of hours."
Wonderful place to visit,"The decorative artefacts are amazing and well curated and restored. We particularly enjoyed the salons and the kitchen. There is an excellent audio guide and all the staff were polite, helpful and kind."
A stately pleasure dome in downtown Brighton,"Extravagant, slightly faded palace full of exotica.  Room after room of fantastical design and architecture.  Don’t like Moorish - you might be bored.  But fascinating, over-the-top bit of history that nearly bankrupted the Crown."
A Taste of The Far East In Brighton,"We went to the Royal Pavillion on a wet, miserable, windy Sunday afternoon in February. I enjoyed listening to the informative commentary via personal handset and feel that the £2 charge was very reasonable for this.The grounds are beautiful and it would be lovely to spend time walking around them on a better day. I wouldn't say I need to return again but am glad that we went inside whilst visiting Brighton."
"Steeped in history, with amazing beauty",Extensively restored and absolutely beautiful inside. Get the Audi on guide for an immersive experience. So worth the visit
Amazing building. ,Amazing building. Such a Shane the guides looked so bored and were very hard to engage. Such a contrast to the enthusiasm from the volunteers at national trust properties. Amanda in the music room could barley speak
A beautiful gem to visit ,We visited here on a rainy day in February and are so glad we did! It’s a bit pricey at £15 ish for an adult but it’s a truly stunning building!
"Stunning, the jewel in the crown of Brighton","Wow! Loved this place, stunning over the top elegance and well worth the admission price. Not too busy, we went around midday and spent an easy 2 hours in wonder!"
Enchanting,"Beautiful place to visit. The exterior looks Indian, the interior has a heavy Chinese influence and shows off George 1V’s extravagant lifestyle. Some stunning pieces of art, especially the chandeliers and other lighting in the dining room. There are also a number of drawings on display by political satirists of the time, making fun of George. The audio guides are a very reasonable £2 each and add value to the visit as there is not a huge amount of written commentary. Staff were all very friendly and the route around the displays is well signposted. We spent a great two hours in here avoiding storm Dennis and I’m glad we did. Maybe on our next visit we’ll enjoy more of the gardens in finer weather!"
loved it!!!!!,"i have always wanted to visit the pavillion and recently had the chance to do just that whilst on short break to brighton, i went mid morning, ticket with audio was £17, some might say that is steep but if you take the time to listen to the commentary for each room it is well worth the money, i spent almost 3 hours in the pavillion enjoying eery room, i was disappointed that the suite of rooms for queen victoria were not available due to restoration but this wouldnt deter me from visiting again, i had a light lunch in the tea room finding the staff friendly and the prices fitting for a southern facility"
AN ENCHANTING ARCHITECTURAL FANTASY,"It was a pleasure to visit the Royal Pavilion again this week. Another room has been carefully restored on the ground floor and furnishings have been added, lent by the present queen, whose ancestor, Queen Victoria, removed them. The palace was very well cared for and the information panels helpful. In addition, the friendly security guards were glad to offer information; one of them even answered my guest's questions in her native Italian."
Wonderful,So much to see here and remarkably tactile with stop off points for young children to be kept amused for a little while. Patient and knowledgeable staff and thoroughly good good day out.
Oh what a treasure,I have been going to Brighton since late 80s due to family there but never really had the chance to go and visit the Pavilion. So on a cold January Sunday during one of a short visits to the city we decided to head down to the Pavilion. And what a treat it was. Definitely a gem worth the visit.
Fascinating and beautiful building,"I visited the Pavilion with my mum when we were staying in Brighton - I've been to Brighton but never had the opportunity to check out the Pavilion, and I can't believe how long I've been missing out! We learnt so much and the building's decor/architecture  was stunning, unique and intriguing. Would definitely come back."
Stunning,"We had never heard of the Royal Pavilion before our trip, absolutely fascinating and beautiful. We found this very interesting, and very beautifully put back together after different disasters! Absolutely incredible rooms, especially considering when the rooms were decorated.Well worth having the audio guide for the additional information!(Exterior looks very pretty lit up at night)"
Amazing place to see how royalty lived!,"After visiting the Queens Gallery exhibit  ""George IV:  Art  & Spectacle,"" this was a wonderful follow-up on the life of George IV.  This pavilion was designed in a unique Indo-Islamic style on the outside and amazing Asian-influences inside.  This place that was the Prince Regent's getaway was redesigned between 1815 and 1822.  It is also the home where he placed many of the numerous art pieces that he collected over the years.  Just recently, many of the treasures from the Queen's Gallery & Buckingham Palace were loaned to the Royal Pavilion and you can see many of the items in their original setting until 2021.  The beauty of the place and its contents as well as the banquet served and entertainment provided was made to display the king's wealth and opulence.  Be sure not to miss the gallery of satire and cartoons on the top floor.  In his day, he was ridiculed and criticized because of his extravagance, excesses, and profligate life.  But the art items that he acquired are truly wonderful."
Interesting place.,We found the Royal Pavilion and it's fascinating history and architecture very interesting and enjoyed a little time away from the crowds and heat outside..
Interesting,Visited in December 2019 and found the history of the use of the pavilion and its architecture very interesting. There are original pieces returned from Buckingham palace to create how the rooms were used.
Amazing display of opulence - how the other half lived,Despite coming to Brighton for the best part of 3 decades I'd not been here until yesterday.  Reasonable entry cost £15 pp.   It's sort of hidden away in its own little garden and courtyard ...very serene just away from the bustle of the street.   The background story to how the house was built by George IV and who his regular visitors and guests were is interesting.  The manner of decoration is possibly ostentacious and perhaps not to everybody's taste but unique nontheless.   The kitchens and waiting staff quarters are possibly the most impressive I've seen in anything like this.   I would recommend the audio tour as the information on the exhibits is quite short.
A lot of dragons everywhere ,"We've visited the Royal Pavilion museum on three occasions, very interesting historical place. Friendly staff,  nice cafe and shop."
Gem of Brighton ,"This is a Royal Palace built by King George IV. It’s is a peculiar, exotic and historical building. It holds an amazing collection and it’s a must if you are coming to visit Brighton. It’s open daily with slightly changes in schedule depending if it’s summer or winter. There’s a tearoom upstairs and one next to the museum shop at the end of the visit. It’s accessible just in the ground floor for wheelchairs but there’s a buggy park. Audio guide is highly recommended."
"Wow, what a place!","It's 40+ years since our last visit. It is a stunning palace, and the Council have done a good job in renovating it and keeping it going."
Brighton's most important attraction,Don't leave Brighton without visiting this amazing venue. Be sure to take the audio handsets for some entertaining and informative commentary. Its like walking into a different world. Tea rooms are worth a visit. A must when you visit Brighton!
Wish it had been op-en during my visit,"All the locals were bragging on the recent restoration.  It was sadly closed the week I was there.  I will have to return.  Impressive from the exterior though, you can tell it is the main draw in town."
Amazing place,"Always wanted to visit the royal pavilion and so glad we did. The history and the sheer opulence was fascinating, from the outside it’s Indian style architecture is complimented  with incredible Chinese interior design and furnishings. This place really needs to be seen. Brilliant"
Must see!,Do not leave Brighton witout visiting this amazing building. Its so beautiful. Make sure to take the audio handsets for some entertaining and  infomative commentary. Its like walking into a different world. Lovely tea rooms too. All in all a must when you visit Brighton!
Beautiful,"A beautiful venue to visit as a couple, with friends or as a day out on your own.  Amazing what one man can build for his mistress."
A must see in Brighton,"Photogenic from the outside and a key building that epitomises Brighton & Hove. Ice skating rink in the winter months outside. Inside is a palace of wonders, inspired by King George’s love of Asia. On the day I visited it was free entry, this only happens once a year. However I donated the £15 entry fee as I felt it was worthwhile."
Beautiful building with amazing history ,Absolutely well worth the visit and the queue.  We went on Sunday and queued for a while but when we got to the entrance it was free to enter which was a welcome surprise.  The guide was brilliant and the rooms were amazing especially the dining and music rooms.
Return visit after 30 years,Forgot how amazing the pavilion is inside. Well worth the cost and we enjoyed seeing some of the items on loan from Buck House.Coffee by the gift shop was excellent as well
A place to visit,"Lovely place but two rooms were closed for restoration, disappointments as should have been notified when purchasing tickets. Spectacular rooms. Advise you pay for audio to understand what your looking at. Can get this on a two for one when traveling by train. Lovely place to visit shame two rooms closed"
Surreal building,Beautiful from the outside. A Taj Mahal of the UK. Stunning exterior architecture. Did not go inside but enjoyed the sunshine and the view in the park.
Well maintained and interesting ,Visited with wife in January. Very interesting with lots of information and history. Spent about 2 hours exploring the building which was beautifully maintained. Well worth a visit.
Superbly presented exhibit,"This visit surpassed expectations, and while the entrance fee might be a little more than people would choose to pay, the tour of the pavilion is superbly presented and well preserved, and can be enjoyed in 20 minutes or two hours. I would strongly recommend the audio guide, which provides so much more understanding and makes up for the lack of info boards (probably for the best), although I'd prefer the guides to have been included in the ticket price."
A Splendid Georgian Folly,"Despite visiting Brighton on numerous occasions this was the first time I had visited the Royal Pavilion. Having done so, I feel I've been remiss in not doing so sooner. Clearly this is a very impressive building, which has been restored excellently. The style is flamboyant and perhaps not to everyone’s liking, but one cannot deny the splendour. Interestingly, Queen Victoria dispensed of it fairly early in her reign as it lacked the privacy that monarchs expect. Perhaps the style was a bit too exuberant for her liking as well. Highly recommend on any trip to Brighton."
Tick it off,"I guess it's the most notable thing in Brighton. Looks interesting from the outside. On the inside the decor is gaudy and pretty tacky. Interesting almost for that reason alone. I got round the two floors in under an hour. Maybe because it is relatively young for a Royal residence, it doesn't have the history of some of the others. The colour scheme and whole atmosphere lacks a bit of class but it's something you really should see if you're in town so go for that reason alone. It's unique I suppose but not for the best of reasons."
Well worth a visit,Well worth a visit. The decor and decadence is amazing. One of the best stately homes/palaces we have visited
Amazing - it’s a must visit attraction,Pay the extra £2 for the audio guide - it’s worth it for the extra detail  and info that you just don’t get from walking round.
Perfect place!,"I’ve lived in Brighton for 8 years and this was my first visit! I dismissed it as the place tourists go, which it is, however I’m upset I never visited earlier!We get in for a reduced price living in the area.The Christmas decorations were great, it didn’t retake us long to get around but the history is great. Shame a lot of it is closed off. Cake and a coffee to round of the visit overlooking the gardens made the experience!"
You must step inside,"The Pavilion is quite extraordinary with a number of items on loan from the Royal Collection.  Take the guided / audio tour to make sure you do not miss anything. Take you time and absorb the extraordinary craftsmanship, both in original design and in restoration."
Something very different,We visited in December (when local residents can benefit from half price admission). It was not that crowded and the building was beautifully decorated for Christmas. There is always something interesting to see and learn and it is well worth a visit.
Amazing! ,Very different from all other palaces! A beautiful and interesting place to visit. The furnishings are amazingly different from what’s is expected. It’s Must go.
Beautiful brighton,If you want to see some history and beautiful rooms then go to the brighton pavilion. We went thursday morning it was very quite so that was great. It cost 17 pounds each to enter but that included the museum which was large and interesting. I love the pavilion it is my favourite building. I had not been for a while and they have opened up a few more rooms to when i was last there. The guides were very friendly. The tea room is great.
A Royal treat.,Visited in December and was stunned by the magnificent rooms and history. Really worth the money to say you have been.
A pre-Christmas Visit,"The Royal Pavilion has much to offer, and some of its decor is stunning, but the Christmas decorations were disappointing, too small for the space.   The one exception was the last room on the tour, which had a mock up of Queen Victoria's sleigh, and was surrounded by many white decorations.  The Pavilion would make a wonderful backdrop for a more extravagant display."
Excellent visit to a fascinating building,"From reception through to the end of the tour the staff here are friendly and knowledgable: interactions with them were enjoyable. The layout and contents were fascinating throughout with enough but not too much information although the download tour, which the staff are happy to help you with, gives a decent amount of info to enhance your visit. Well worth visiting, as long as you can avoid the coach parties and groups of students! An advance ticket will save you a bit of money as well."
Pavilion Pirouettes,"Always looks nice with Christmas lights, Christmas jingles and mulled wine (afterwards). Ice skating in front of beautiful architecture of pavilion was very atmospheric. Very well organised. Great food and drinks in tents afterwards."
Absolutely beautiful,We had a very nice afternoon here.  Fortunately we visited during the week and there weren't very many people in there.  They had also just put up their Christmas trees and they were stunning.  Been to Brighton a lot over the years and finally got to visit the Pavilion and it was breathtaking.
Return of artifacts from Buckingham Palace,"A brilliant few hours, spent looking at all the amazing rooms and exhibits.Tip.Rent a handset. Tip. Park your cat in Brighton Marina, free, and catch a bus into Brighton. Much cheaper than an NCP car park. Tip. There is a cafe/restaurant, moderately priced, in the pavillion."
Fantastic out-of-the-way Palace of George IV.  Most unusual palace of all.,"This is a very unique Palace built by George IV in the oriental style popular at the time.  Much of the decor removed by Queen Victoria has now been returned, so you see most of what the Palace and furnishings would have looked like in the 1820's.  Since the Royal Pavilion is owned by the city of Brighton, not the Royal Family, it is much more open to see than a typical English Palace.  A Must See!  Also, the Tea Room is very nice."
A Delight,A very interesting and informative tour with a pleasant cream tea.The building is well maintained and gives   a glimpse of bygone times I would recommend a tour if visiting Brighton The gardens are beautiful too.
Skates were blunt and water all over the ice rink,The ice rink looks lovely but is poorly maintained with blunt skates and water all over the surface.  Orgainisers are obviously trying to make as much money  as possile and don't expect people to care about the experience.
Unique Architecture,I came to the Royal Pavilion on a Saturday in September and overall the architecture is unique and interesting. I didn’t go inside of the building however I still enjoyed my visit and would recommend coming to see the pavilion.
Beautiful architecture,Beautiful architecture which is quite stunning to look at. Did not go in however as found the £15 quite hefty since I wasn't travelling alone. Either way worth seeing from the outside we well as enjoying the gardens outside.
Beautiful gem in the heart of Brighton,This is a definate 'must' to visit ! Absolutely amazing So much to see Staff very knowledgable and helpful Make sure the you pay a little extra and hire the audio guides
Fabulous at Christmas!,"The Royal Pavilion is wonderful at any time, but decorated for Christmas with real care (eg the large christmas tree in the kitchen has small copper pans hanging from it), it is an extra special joy"
If you've never visited this marvellous place - why not?,Went at end of November when the staff had been busy decorating nearly every room with Christmas trees etc. Special room set aside complete with dressing up clothes and a sleigh so you can use your mobile to take a photo. In awe of the dining room and music room.
Beautiful,"What a fantastic icon to have in Brighton, every room was filled with extravagant furnishings and history. Even the tea room served good coffee and tea and cakes. Good job Brighton."
Former Royal Palace ,This is a former royal palace.  The story that was told was that a prince wanted to get out of the watchful eyes of London and set it up.  The royals followed and the city grew from a fishing village to a fancy town. Very interesting.
Unmissable Contents,"We have been to visit the Royal Pavilion a number of times and it has always been worth it.  However, now that Buckingham Palace is being renovated, some of the  contents that were removed by Queen Victoria have been repatriated.  So it looks much closer to George IV's original concept.  It is amazing and shows the amount of time, money and effort that he was prepared to spend making it look how he wanted.  Since some of the contents were made specially, it is a unique opportunity to see them in their original context.  I recommend that, if you can, you take the time to visit."
A Right Royal Treat,"We weren't going to visit the Pavilion due to both the price and our own ignorance of what lay inside - it didn't look that impressive from outside. Fortunately, friends who are members got us in for free and gave us a brilliant tour and narrative of every exhibit. We were blown away by the OTT spendour of the Pavilion and it's treasures. Simply fantastic. What a great insight into the ways and excesses of the royals in UK. If you are in Brightom - make time to do the trip, it's a perfect way to while away a couple of hours and you cannot fail to be impressed, while simultaneously sad about George's wasteful life."
A wonderful slice of history,"Visited while on a day trip , weather bad so decided to visit the pavillion. £15.00 entrance fee plus £2.00 for hand held commentary. What a wonderful place, so much to see and take in. It is sumptuous and breathtakeing in places and awe inspiring in others. Apart from the commentary there is also a steward in each room to answer any questions and help you to appreciate the glory of the building. George 1V may have been a terribly selfish man to build such a opulent place for his pleasure when so many were living in abject poverty, but he was certainly a pioneer for using interior designers to perfect his ideas for decor. I was enthralled and with a 30 minute stop for tea and scones in the tea room we stayed three hours and only left because we had to catch our coach home."
Stunning,The Royal pavilion looks a little tired from the exterior but it is just incredible inside and must not be missed when visiting Brighton. We had the audio guide and found it a very useful addition to our visit with plenty of additional information available.
A very interesting tour,"I am by no means a royalist, but I found this tour very interesting self-guided tour. The audio guide is excellent and there's an opportunity to take a very nice afternoon tea or a cream tea along the way. All in all an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours while in Brighton."
Not what I expected,Very pleasantly surprised.  I was expecting a less flamboyant interior and something more municipal.  Definitely worth a visit.
A unique interior...,"Years since I last visited this place, George IV's favourite palace-playground and the timing was good, because of treasures on loan from the Queen.  The decor is wildly OTT, but works - a rich riot of jewel colours, silver and gold.  Indian-style domes on the outside,Chinese dragons everywhere on the inside... The Banqueting Hall is breathtaking, with a central chandelier that weighs a ton, suspended from the ceiling in the claws of a...dragon!The shop is large - bought a few Christmas gifts there.Had a concession ticket, but could only use it that afternoon - a policy that could be reviewed."
Worth a visit ,"We thought it was well worth a visit beautiful elegance with bags of history. You can actually feel what it must have been like working there all those years ago especially the kitchen its an insight into what below stairs life was like. Take your time read the information available, very informative."
pretty buildings,"we didnt go inside the pavillion but walked around the gardens and looked at the architecture, smaller than i thought but impresive"
Ice skating here is great,Really like the winter ice skating rink. Lots of space good cafe and bar. Worth a visit and I went around 2pm and only about 5-7 people on the whole rink. Small kids rink separate too for very little skaters!
Fabulous interiors ,"I took the opportunity to visit Brighton Pavilion to see the launch of the mini exhibition of objects loaned by HM the Queen from the Royal Collection Trust.I have visited many times before and the principal rooms are sumptuous and beautiful. The building itself could do with a ‘lick of paint’ and a spruce up. The carpets are a little worm and some smaller rooms are gloomy maybe due to lighting . It was truly difficult to work out which objects were part of this wonderful loan. The room interpretation was rather sparse and there was no audio guide element  for these new additions. The pagodas and clocks etc are sumptuous but some objects in the loan get lost. If you have never visited then you definitely should. If like me you Re going just to see the additions, then I would perhaps think twice. If you’ve got a Pass then o would definitely go!"
Amazing a must see,"Looks quite drab from the outside but is a big wow on the inside.  I've been to Brighton before and not bothered, so glad I did this time round.  Well worth the money."
A Must See and Do!! ,One will be mesmerized and bedazzled by the opulent this palace offers. Step into the outrages world of the Far East. You’ll need some time to digest and savor the many splendor found. Money Worth spending.
Birthday treat,"Decent place to visit but overpriced, not a lot to see for younger children, lovely grounds to view also."
Awe-inspiring!!,Everything about this is worth the entry price and taking the audio guide is a must.So interesting and over the top but a glimpse into history.There's a nice cafe for drinks and light snacks.Fascinating.
A winter break in November,"This is the most iconic building in the town. What a story of excess and partying.The rooms have been beautifully restored . The colours are immense , particularly when you learn of 2 sets of real damage.The room guides are friendly , but 1 audio set between 2 is a MUST. The kitchens and the dining room are immaculate.Good cafe for a break after about 1 hr"
Worth visiting,Fascinating to see the interior and all the treasures currently on loan from Buckingham Palace. Don’t miss them
A joy to see,"After navigating  the traffic  around  the pavilion  we found d an NCP carpark and walked down the hill of the main street,there were no signs but people were very helpful. The outside though amazing is a little  sad in need of renovation  the entrance  is a bit drab deliberately   as it  then opens up into a wonderful  building showing the amazing  style  of the prince who built it .The vist was enhanced  by the furniture  on  loan from Buckingham palace and the staff who were very helpful. The parking fee for 4 hours was £17 a bit high for a shabby  town ."
A must see in Brighton,"We visited the Royal Pavilion on our last morning in Brighton. What a delight. You can read a description on other pages, but my comment is that the RP is a must-see in Brighton, for adults. Children will not really appreciate the restoration and opulence of this place. From the outside, it looks like a gaudy Indian design, but on the inside - wow!   Plan to spend about 90-120 minutes and make sure to get the audio tour. It's akazing to me the number of people who do not buy the optional audio tours on visits to places like this. The explanations and commentary are well worth the extra 2 quid. (You have to actually ask for a headphone set. If not, you will have to use it like a phone, which is way less comfortable. Please don't use it as a speaker phone, which a group of three did right next to us!) Enough said, go see it.  Well worth the 15GBP entrance fee (no discount for seniors).  Please note, there is no photography allowed, which is a shame because it would be nice to have a collection of personal photos from here."
What a work went into restoration!,"Beautiful building, stunning interior. Worth the visit if only to admire the stunning restoration they did and still do here."
Genuinely Worth While,"Amazing place, with so much to see, and the dining room was fascinating, its worth stopping and asking for information, as although you have a recorded version on an app, there is much  more to be gleaned on talking to the guides. They have now received more of the furniture and Objet d'Art back on loan from our dear Queen, so worth another visit if you haven't viewed this since."
Very interesting and definitely worth a visit,"We went on a very wet, dark and windy day and the outside was more scruffy than I thought it would be. It needs a good coat of paint. However, the inside was unexpectedly opulent in places, well organised and well run.I would recommend the audio tour otherwise you will miss out on a lot of information and you would lose the value of the ticket as the place would be a lot less interesting. We bought our tickets online which were a bit cheaper.Recommended and perfect to do in the rain!"
Amazing Decor,We were not sure what to expect but were amazed by the colours and style. Art Fund Members pay no entrance fee.
Stunning throughout ,"Visited by train and took benefit of 2 for 1 day out offer. Audio guides are a small extra charge but well worth it. The building and rooms are stunning but it was made even better by attentive staff, well keep facilities and attention to detail throughout. Has a small tearoom within the pavilion and a gift shop that is not cheap but has some unusual quality products."
Amazing sumptuous buiding,"I visited once as a child but had completely forgotten just how elaborate and ornate the decor is in this amazing building.   Built as a summer palace for the Prince Regent (later King Geoge IV), it encompasses all the richness and oppulent extravagances  of the regency period in one building.   This is wonderfully displayed in the beautiful banqueting hall with its amazing dragon chandellier.   The taped guide commentary was easy to use and very informative.   Also had a cream tea in the tea room (very nice)."
A Royal Palace,"This is the most important building in the city  and is the only royal palace not in the ownership of the Royal Family.  Everything about it is beautiful - the wallpaper, the chandeliers, the furniture, the unique carpets. Now is especially a good time to visit, because while extensive building work is going on at Buckingham Palace, a good deal of furniture belonging to the Pavilion has been returned for two years, so the Pavilion looks very much as the Prince Regent planned it 200 years ago - the chance of a lifetime!"
Extravagant ,A very interesting place to have a look at and to see how the royal family of old lived and holidayed back in Victorian times  etc Very easy to find in the centre of Brighton my only disappointment was the fact no photography is allowed inside the building
Decadent not eccentric ,"This was mentioned to us just before a trip to Eastbourne. I love a stately home visit but this is like nothing we’ve seen before. The electronic tour guide is an extra charge at £2 but well worth it. I feel this place will offer something new on every visit. It is grand and a feast for the eyes. It oozes personality, if only walls could talk. You can imagine the goings on in the main rooms and downstairs in the kitchens and corridors behind the baize doors. It’s breathtaking, how I expect a royal palace to be. Areas of indulgent entertainment space and more subdued private areas. No pictures can be taken so we purchased the guide book"
As Expected,Lived in Brighton as a student and never visited here and finally after 40 years decided to make the effort. Very impressive but just not my cup of tea. I’m certain that if the peasants had known what money was being spent on such a place there would have been a justifiable revolution. My favourite bit was the kitchens and the list of dishes served up at a banquet- amazing.
Beautiful Palace,"Apparently right now is a great time to visit as the Queen has returned a lot of pieces whilst Buckingham Palace is being renovated over the next couple of years meaning it looks more like it did originally than it has for over 200 years. The state rooms are so richly decorated, my favourite being the ornate Music Room (which has been renovated twice after a fire and then after damage during the 'hurricane') but the servant areas were just as interesting. You unfortunately are not permitted to take photos, even without flash, in any of the rooms, but you can purchase a guide book at a reasonable price as a momento from the gift shop or when buying your ticket on arrival. There is a lovely tea room which is well worth a visit too."
A must see in Brighton ,"As two visitors who had seen the Royal Pavilion in an architectural history class decades ago, we were still stunned by the opulence and fantastical designs and details. It was disappointing that we weren’t able to photograph any of the interiors because the books and pamphlets that were for sale did not come close to representing these spaces. The extra expense of the audio guide was well worth the cost.  Knowledgeable staff were seated in each room if one had any additional questions. Definitely worth a visit!"
Beautiful Mogul Architecture ,"The Royal Pavilion is the architecture highlight in Brighton. The outside facade is designed and built in Indian Mogul style, the Interior in chinoiserie. The pavilion was built in the time between 1815 and 1822 for the Prince of Wales, who was later on Georg the IV. The architect John Nash has designed the pavilion like an Indian palace."
Expectations Exceeded,"That palace is full of really impressive stuff. As someone who visits historical sites for a combination of the impressive things and the cool stories, I would recommend this place."
Lots to see re its history.,The Pavilion is a very interesting building with distinctive Indian-looking outside and somewhat-Chinese inside (lots of dragons). Currently £15/adult but £13.50 online before 9:30 pm up until the night before (we just made it in time). The audio guide (an extra £2) is essential to explain the story and features (they could have had more written text) but one between two is okay.
Most go,What a most impressive building. The royal pavilion is Brighton. Very worthwhile to visit if you want to see beauty from within passionate. The dinner area is stunningly beautiful but the music room is absolutely crazy. You fall from one wonder to another. Very friendly and helpful employees with a good knowledge of the matter make it complete. How lucky that the building did not fall for project developers.
Uniquely different,"It is uniquely different from the surrounding buildings. However, the external walls do look shabby."
Stunning Unique building ,Just seeing the outside of the Royal Pavilion is worth the visit with its ornate turrets and spires. The outside views were slightly spoiled as construction of what we assumed would be the winter ice rink was taking place. Entry is £15 for adults the rooms are unique.
Disgustingly Opulent and totally amazing,What a opulent place - with the treaures from Buckingham Palace it is so worth a visit. Worth the entrance fee. Totally recommend
Jaw dropping interiors!,"Firstly, I wondered if the entrance fee + audio tour would be worth the money £15 + £2 (there is a discount online if booked in advance) - but once inside I was so glad I took the 'tour'.The audio description brings the whole place to life and, in my opinion, was worth the extra £2.  The interiors are like nothing I have ever seen before - I won't spoil it for you - but suffice to say The Banqueting Room with its Dragon Chandelier was literally jaw dropping as I walked into it - exquisite, beautiful, breathtaking, over-the-top - yes, all those things, and more!  They do not allow photos - and, actually, it would probably spoil the atmosphere if they did (and spoil the surprise).I think it would be true to say that no 2D image could capture this room.Other State Rooms are spectacular - its just that the Banqueting Room was my favourite.Don't miss out on this stunning palace if you are in Brighton - there is nothing like it (that I have seen) in this Country!  Oh, and pop into the Tea Room for one of their Cream Teas - yummy, and lovely staff."
Group visit with German guests,Our reception was “cool” and a bit rude!  Not a good start. However we once inside the Pavilion is fabulous and very well worth a visit. Not to be missed.
"Stunning Palace, well worth a visit","Although a bit shabby on the outside, the inside of this palace is absolutely stunning. There is so much detail in the decor that it is hard to take it all in. The rooms are not furnished in a stately home type of way but rather in a very flamboyant, themed way with exquisite decoration. Your neck will ache from looking up at the incredible ceilings.The audio guide is essential to get the most out of your visit and gives a wonderful insight into the Pavilion's royal history. Very good value entrance, well worth a visit. Photography inside the palace is not allowed but it's actually nice to walk around taking it all in without feeling the need to photograph everything."
Lovely place but really should offer a student discount ,"I had visited Brighton several times as a child and never actually been in the Pavilion. Loved the history but just expensive. My son had decided to go study at one of the Universities, so my husband, my over 18 daughter and I went to visit him and see some of Brighton. Brighton students get a resident discount, the online discount of 10% has to booked the day before which very much advanced booking not just an online discount. If you are visiting a resident why not offer a family discount to them too? Over £50 for two adults and two students when one lives there for a couple of hours on an autumn day a bit of a rip off. Nice place but really need to reconsider the pricing structure. Surely a place like this should be fundraising for restoration funds not just fleecing visitors. Such a shame. The family rate should include students as you have two universities, you really should be encouraging family visits. Just because your kids are over 18, does make than financially independent. No indoor photos as you can’t even do that!! Certainly wouldn’t come back and perhaps this is why my parents never took me as a child despite having relatives only living 5 minutes from the palace🙁😩"
Not to be missed when in Brighton,"Interesting history and fascinating insight into how Royalty lived two or three hundred years ago. Beautiful decor and although it was cleared of its removable objects by Queen Victoria, recent Royals have donated items back giving a more realistic idea of the feel of the times."
Unforgettable and exotic,"The audio guide in my opinion is an essential addition to the visit.  Informative and interesting and very well paced.  The guides / guards in each room were helpful and pleasant as well.  Prepare for opulence, extravagance, riotous colours and innovative design. What an amazing vision and very well executed.  Carefully thought out symbolism and metaphors.  Highly recommended. (agree with a previous comment over disappointment at photo ban)"
Surprisingly Wowed,"We bought a discount ticket from the i360 which included the Sealife Centre, i360 and the Royal Pavilion.Unexpectedly it was the Pavilion that was the stand out event of the three.The Banqueting Hall was spectacular but the knowledge imparted by the staff made the visit so much better. They were enthusiastic to answer all questions and knew so many interesting facts about the history of the Pavilion, George IV and events of the time. (The cakes in the Tea Room were very good)"
On Loan From Buckingham Palace...,"The Items on loan from Buckingham Palace certainly complete the Canvass of the Royal Pavillon. Being a resident I have not visited for over 30 years. Prepared to be underwhelmed it was the opposite impact. The loan items on view were astounding, particularly the young woman who was on duty in the Music Room had superb knowledge and was a sparkling host.A modern highlight for me was the replacement AXMINSTER Carpet in the Music Room made within the last 3 years. Brilliant in colour and original design - the skills and artistry second to none. Well done making a ultra high quality replica and allowing us to walk on it!! A truly magnificent project which is worthy of the artwork from Buckingham Palace.Transportation of the Pagodas by sailing ship from China undamaged is a wonder in itself.Tea Room simple with good service. For more complicated food in colourful surroundings. IVY, 3 Mins WalkThank YouCapn Rog"
Fascinating ,"One of those places that has always intrigued us and that we intended to visit. Finally got round to it. Not a cheap visit, but well worth it. The decor was sumputuos and the description provided by the audio guide hugely informative (highly recommended). What was particularly pleasing to find were toilets and cafe halfway round. Can't say that it's somewhere we'd go back to, once seen never forgotten, but it is definitely worth the trip to get there"
"A very interesting Georgian Royal ""Palace""",Brighton Corporation now run this place £15 adult entry - no seniors reductionsWell informed and friendly staff. Some parts need better lightingEnjoyed my visit
Interesting ,This is a historic palace filled with artefacts from a previous eraLots of items have come from royalty Toilets and a tea room Very interesting
Loved it. Wow what a place!,"Loved our trip round the Royal Pavilion, some of the rooms are absolutely mind blowing. Especially the banqueting hall and music room. Incredible.It’ll take you about an hour to and hour and a half to tour the rooms, there isn’t ‘that’ much to see, which is fine, as it’s a perfect interlude to a day trip or a weekend away. Only irritating thing was the ban on photos. I understand that flash photos can spoil paintings etc, but surely accepting no flash photos is fine. There are plenty of stewards to tell people off if they used a flash. No photos is the only reason it doesn’t get 5-stars - forces you to buy a guidebook if you want to look back on images!"
georges extravagance.,"the Royal impression of India and China in the 1700s with extravagant light fittings and artwork. all lovingly restored, some on loan from the royal collection. the guides in each room seem to have an understanding of the history of each room. As I have restricted walking I was unable to access the first floor but was told the best items were on the ground floor."
"Pricey to enter, but such good value.","It is highly doubtful there is anywhere in the UK that is as opulent as the Royal Pavilion.  We did not take the audio tour which was just as well otherwise the whole thing would have been an overload.  The rooms and decor are simply stunning.  Lovingly restored by master craftsmen, this place is an absolute must-visit on anyone's list."
Stunning!,So pleased to have finally visited this amazing place!Prepare to be blown away with the internal decor!
Royal Pavillion,"I love the royal pavilion! It's such a wonderful place to visit, Such opulent and fantastic rooms - Highly recommended"
Amazing,From the outside and all the way through it's wow after wow. It is truly amazing to see all the wonderful furnishings
A bit chaotic!,We visited during term time which may have been an oversight on our part. The school parties weren’t very well organised in terms of keeping people moving and we were firmly stuck a few times. More written information as you move around would be useful. Some rooms had no information to support their history and whilst we could have hired audio units at an additional cost I do feel that the fact we didn’t meant we were missing out on some of the history.
Stunning,Unbelievable building and decoration. A true Royal Palace.If you may think it is a bit expensive to go in - just do it. It is worth every penny for the experience.
Wowed by visit,Wasn’t sure what it would be like. First visit to Brighton for 40yrs. Fabulous restoration. Well worth the visit and need plenty of time to appreciate the details. Also great tea room for a sit down. Would love to come back for some of the functions in the future.
Day out at Brighton,"Highly recommend - headsets are a must. Expected to stay about an hour, but ended up listening to the whole of the audio tour - recommend having at least 3 hours to go around everything."
majestic,"Lovelly, grand old building very nice from the outside and amazing on the inside. at the time there were plenty of exibitions going on worth a look at."
Awesome,My favourite museum as it’s pure fantasy when you walk around and look at what was created. The lights alone are worth seeing.
Breathtaking!,"Visited here today. Entry fee is £15 but boy is it worth it!It is absolutely spectacular! The grandeur is off the scale and just recently many of the original pieces that decorated this wonderful building have been returned here from Buckingham Palace.It’s full of Chinese themed furniture, vases and lamps which are a wonder to behold. I found myself exclaiming holy moly to myself as I wandered through the awesome rooms. A royal palace it certainly is.Wait until you see the kitchen and King George’s rooms!"
An unexpected treasure!,"Unfortunately we didn't have a lot of time and had to rush through as it was close to closing time, but it was so unexpected and fascinating, we specifically have to come back and do it much more slowly and in depth!"
Wonderful experience,Pavilions are beautiful from the outside and every room inside takes your breath away! Well worth a visit.
Great experience,This is well worth the time and money to see such a beautiful royal palace - very different to any other I have seen. Good cafe too.
Tunnel Tour is Amazing,We were fortunate enough to have tickets for the Tunnel Tour given to us. This amazing tour of the network of underground tunnels used by serving staff and by the king to visit the stables and ladies of the town is a must. Our guides Terry Reece assisted by Derek Bradfield were incredible and bought history alive with their in depth knowledge of the Pavillion. Check this tour out it doesn't happen often.
Lovely love relaxing place to visit,"Another items on the bucket list during a few days stop over in Brighton , well what can I say if you love hisstory and have an eye for oriental Art this is the place to visit , the staff were most helpfull giving you chance to ask questions and they would do their best to answer with some extra interesting facts ,I suppose beings as we tend to visit these places out of the normal holiday season they tend not be over crowded 'Yes I would loved to beable to explore those hidden area like the basement cellars and up in the roof domes or the hidden passageway,( maybe a special trip?)Do visit the coffee shop (half way around your trip ) then at the end a lovely walk around the outside and gift shop"
"Excellent place to visit, infotmative audio and staff","Before visiting this attraction investigate parking as you can pay a lot in the main car parks if you are not careful. We ended up using on street parking with a blue badge. The pavilion itself is fantastic much more than we expected, the oriental aspect was really interesting. Although a tad expensive it is well worth the money and I would recommend the audio (£2 extra), we were there 3 hours and would have stayed longer if we chose to picnic in the gardens."
Never Made It Past the Front Door,"Exterior needed a paint in places. Hundreds of school kids on tour entered and then I encountered a horribly hard-nosed and off-putting woman at the cash who would not honour my Two Together rail discount coupon because I could not prove that I arrived by train. Technically she was correct because, as a foreign tourist, I did not realize that the train station machine would keep my rail ticket upon exiting. She won! And we walked without entering."
Interesting visit to a rare mental state.,"Very interesting visit ! If in Brighton it is must as it offers a rare opportunity to explore the mind of a king considered slightly odd.. Difficult to explain or put into words but do go and check it out. Seems George had a huge fascination with anything and all Chinese. It is very well restored after laying in a terrible state of disrepair for a long time. Do give the upstairs tea room a miss, one might be forgiven for thinking you're in Moscow when speaking to a waitress and looking out the window at the same time; the domes and the heavy Russian accent causes that weird sensation. Make sure you repeat your order at least three times, when ordering Earl Grey tea you might also end up with green tea...with an attitude to boot !! And remember to say nastorovia or whatever the heck they say for 'thank you' in Russian..."
Sad Story of an Indulgent King,"While this pavilion was very interesting, and held our interest as we moved from room to room with the audio tour, it really is a sad commentary on the life of a man who did not show self control in any area of his life. May we take pause to consider our own lives!   The audio tour gave interesting glimpses into his life, as well as history about the pavilion itself and the architecture that is very different: Indian in style on the outside and Asian inside. One fun note: enjoy the mirror in the last room, which was the Kings old bedroom.  Fun!"
"Must do if you have an interest in history, deign or architecture","It costs £15 for a full adult admission to Brighton Pavilion (and extra if you want the audio guide).  This might seem like a lot of money but this is a unique experience - a former royal palace which has one of the most astonishing fantasy oriental interiors you could see anywhere in the world.  It takes two hours to tour it fully.  It is even more impressive now that an additional large number of the original furnishings have been loaned back to the museum by the Queen. If you don't take the audio tour some of the information panels are a bit sparse in my view but most of the guides are well informed.  There are also good exhibitions on the history of the building, its architecture and restoration and its use as a hospital for Indian troops during the first world war"
Nice little tour which included a cream tea,"The audio tour is very interesting, and the decor inside was amazing and not what I expected the staff are very helpful"
Visit,"A lot of money for what it is, also you had to pay extra for headphones. It was interesting what we saw, I didn’t like the boxes in every room trying to get you to donate more money, you pay enough to to get in."
Architectually Amazing,"Exploring Brighton on a hot Summer's day and coming across this absolutely beautiful building had to be one of my highlights when visiting. It was completely unexpected and just simply stunning to walk around and I find myself lost for words trying to summarise its beauty here in my review.The Royal Pavillion is one of those few buildings that can be described as both quirky and beautiful and I must give credit to those in charge of caring for this work of art; the building in so well kept that I would struggle to imagine it being as old as it actually is. Whether you are a photographer or simply someone who adores being around beautiful city scapes, this is definitely a tourist must!"
Majestic and quirky ,"Walked by at night and decided to visit the next day. We got a discount voucher from our hotel that gave us a 20% discount. Entrance price is steep, but worth it. The interior of the palace is fantastic. The banquet room being one of the most interesting rooms we saw. I’d call it majestic and quirky at the same time. Unfortunately, as with all royal palaces, you’re not allowed to make pictures inside. Staff was really helpful: we brought our baby (2,5 months) in a pram. You’re not allowed on the upper floors, but you can park your pram in the buggy room and choose to carry your baby along the first floor as we did. Not as impressive as the ground floor, but still enough to see. When we came down, staff helped us find our way out. Escorting is back to the buggy room, lifting cords, the escorting us to the exit. Very friendly and helpful indeed."
stunning place,"abit of a palava to get into but well worth the visit in my opinion, will try and go on a sunny day as apparently that makes it all the more worth it."
Excessive Splendour,"Didn’t know what to expect, but was set up well to make your visit and journey round the Pavilion easier.Most of the areas were well over the top in decoration just showing the extravagance of the Monarchy and buildings that you would never consider homely.It’s been very well renovated and cared for, and is a credit to the teams on site."
Great value. Very interesting,Loved this place. Really beautiful. Great historical facts and knowledge shown by staff. A great experience
Amazing place,"The entrance fee was £15 but we had a booklet which gave us a 20% discount.This was just the most amazing place. We loved the decorations, ornate dragons, the furniture on loan from the Queen, the music room. The whole place was just stunning inside and out. It was worth every penny."
"Its real, and amazing","Ff your schedule allows, don't miss this wonderful find. We could see it from every direction when downtown."
Great attraction ,"Really enjoyed looking round the Pavilion, it’s stunning! One of the great things about not being allowed to take photos is not getting stuck behind people doing so, however we’d have loved to have bought postcards in lieu of this, but were disappointed by the selection; could do with getting some professional photos taken which do the interior justice."
A little piece of History,A great place for some history and a must visit when you’re in Brighton. The audio tour is a great way to take all the history in and the whole experience can be done in a hour easily so you don’t feel overwhelmed.
Waste of time and money,Months ago we booked rail tickets and paid for a hotel stay specifically to visit the royal pavilion for a birth day treat. Imagine our horror when we arrived to find it with boarded up Windows etc and a tiny piece of paper saying it was closed this week. The only reason we noticed the paper (as we had walking around trying to find the entrance) was because we saw & heard other upset visitors who had read it. There were loads of people who like ourselves had travelled a distance at a large cost. There was a man there from the pavilion who just commented come back on Saturday. Speaking for myself I had booked my last  two days holiday for this year  & paid for my train ticket and hotel stay for my birthday. Saying come back on Saturday was very insensitive and impossible to do. The closure should have been on the website months ago . Shopkeepers in the area were all unaware of the closure and a few commented why didn't the closure take place  in the early months of the year when there are no visitors. Some of the people there were visitors from abroad who booked there plane fares last year. Ridiculous lack of planning to close it this week. Other museums just close one department at a time not ruin the experience for everyone. I would love to hear from them but there doesn't appear to be an email address only twitter and Instagram which I don't use.
Stunning,"Well worth a visit, make sure you go inside. it is spectacular in some of the rooms & they also do a good cream tea in the cafe."
Stunning place,The decor and attention to details in the rooms is awe inspiring! It is well worth a visit if your in Brighton.
"WOW - The architecture, the history, just wow",It is a must to pay the extra 2 pounds for the audio guide. A complete must!!  What the eyes see without the guide and what you perceive when listening to the very exciting history as well are two totally different things. The palace is packed with history and interesting things to see. Every visitor to Brighton should go.
Brilliant in many ways,We spent a couple of happy hours here and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  It lived up to expectations.  The décor is sumptuous and luxurious.  If you like things plain and simple it may not be to your taste but apart from the beauty of the building there is the historical aspect which is interesting.  Queen Victoria found the place too much in the public eye and sold it.  There were plans to knock it down but fortunately it was saved for future generations.  It is a great asset to Brighton and worth a visit to Brighton just to visit The Royal Pavillion.  It is in sharp contrast to some of Brighton where rough sleepers have made their homes in the street and left their rubbish for others to clear up.The building is well cared for and the staff pleasant and informative.It would be a shame to visit Brighton and not to come here.  There is a good tea room if you need it but the lift was out of order which may have ruined the visit for some people.  If you need to use the lift check it is in operation before you visit.The ticket price represented good value for money.
Brighton’s Jewel from the Crown,A trip to Brighton is not complete without a visit to the Royal Pavilion. You can book discounted tickets online but it has to be 24 hrs in advance and when I tried the website kept crashing! But I’ll still give the experience 5 ⭐️
Surprisingly Successful Visit,"I wasn't sure about taking my 8 year old and 6 year old around the Pavillion, especially as it's expensive anyway (£39 for a family ticket) and we weren't sure if they'd like it.It was just as impressive on the inside as I'd remembered it (the outside does not match the inside), but the best part was giving in to my son and letting him have a child friendly audio guide. He loved it and was fascinated by it. No idea what was being said as we weren't allowed to listen, but he refused to move to the next room until he'd listened to the whole segment and then told us all about it. My daughter loved the banqueting room with it's dragon chandelier. I don't think I'd rush back, though."
Musty Smell but great visit!,"Called into Brighton today as i have never been and decided to visit, The building, although cream in colour (I always thought it was white) is well maintained and the gardens were in full use by the locals and visitors. The price was reasonable but disappointed to be charged extra for the audio guide. Not sure if its a charity but was not offered to sign up to gift aid, which i would have done. Most of the rooms were amazingly decorated, however the whole building had a musty smell (guess its the age of the furniture and fabric). Nice shop on exit. Well worth a visit."
Holiday visit to pavilion,"Great pavilion and grounds lovely decor in pavilion lots of dragons and elaborate features . Great audio guide extra £2 but well worth it lots of information it gives you that is very interesting . We loved the 9 minitue film it even had sign language and perfectly so accessible,to all .what a great feature to have and made it really enjoyable for  me . It’s make ps it inclusive to all watching so many films around museums do not have this feature and therefore you miss information out . Thankyou so much pavilion for having sign language on your film it really helps and is most appreacted by the deaf and hard of  hearing community . I hope more museums take a example from you . We enjoyed walking round the different rooms and my friend enjoyed the audio guide . We diddent use the cafe but looked lovely and there were plenty of toilets even if they were in need of refurbishment and a bit shabby . Lovely gift shop a bit pricy so we just browsed"
Eye popping treasure 😍,"What an amazing place to go the outside looks amazing enough but waaaw inside is just out of this world so much to look at in every room. We had a phone each which told us different things in different rooms which is highly recommended for only £2 each learn so much. Stopped half way through for a tea and coffee the staff were friendly, smiley and made great drinks and the cakes looked amazing but I was for and didn't have one. Will definitely return here in the future :)"
Over the top - in spades,"Gardens were great and full of people enjoying themselves, a lovely area.The pavilion was appalling, typical of the man, the prince regent, excessive.  The rooms he entertained people in were horrid, no taste unless a bad one.  The kitchens were great and informative, the bedrooms interesting and much more human. We had a great time criticising everything in the Chinese and Indian rooms, he had never visited either country and boy did it show. We both found the construction information interesting and the way everyone, since the initial construction, has tried to improve basic things like not being water proof.You can have a lot of money but without taste?  Nice to see the Royals are no different to the rest of us. Worth every penny of the entry fees.My husband took the cast tea pot from the young lady who served us tea on the terrace and remarked the teapot was the best thing he had seen since our entrance. Good gift shop."
A bit somber ,It was a rather quiet day despite the Brexit demonstrations. We had a walk around the park but were a bit underwhelmed. I’m not fully sure what gave the somber mood. It felt a little unkept.
Must see part of exploring Brighton,"Well worth the visit, kept us interested for around 3 hours, includng a good cafe lunch.We decided not to buy the audio tour at £2 each,a nd we found enough information on dsiplay to suit our preference, lthogh their are also options of sharing one between two, or using mobile phone app.We paid on the day, worth noting that advance on-line booking, the day before, saves 10%, whch would help pay for a cafe snack, etcRestoration is an ongoing process, and there are some stunning ceilings and furnishings in various locations, aiming for faithful re-productions of the early 19th century look"
Informative and interesting,I thoroughly recommend a visit to the Pavilion. A warm welcome from the front desk team got this visit off to a good start. With the audio guide narration this is great building to visit and learn something about the British monarchy and the lives lived here. The audio guide for the visually impaired includes additional narration to bring each room to life. The pace of the guides is good with additional podcasts that you can elect to listen to. The Pavilion tea room is well worth a stop too.
Brilliant,"Went to Brighton on a coach trip so didn't have but a couple of hours so spent it in the Pavilion. What a great place, fabulous architecture, full of history with some splendid room decorations. They are expecting an exhibition from Buckingham Palace to arrive soon which should be worth seeing. Not as splendid as Sandringham or Osborn House but worth a visit nevertheless. Staff were knowledgeable and very informative and very pleasant. Yes I agree the gift shop prices were quite steep. Had coffee and cake in the small cafe which was very nice."
"Unbelievably, stunningly impressive and beautiful.","We (a couple in their 60s) visited the Royal Pavilion in August 2019. We didn't really know what to expect, but we were blown away. The pavilion in its final form was finished almost 200 years ago. In the past it apparently became rather run-down and tattered, but in recent decades it has been repaired and restored, and today it's stunning - probably as good as it was was when finished in 1823. The design is wildly luxurious, both inside and out. It's extraordinarily impressive today, and I can't imagine the impact it would have had on people who saw it 200 years ago.All of it is beautiful, but I especially remember the banqueting room; the saloon (the most recently restored area), with an amazing new carpet and rich, red wall-coverings; and the music room, with extraordinary chandeliers and shades that almost look 'Art Deco'-ish, just 100 years early!No images, unfortunately - photography is not permitted inside the pavilion - but I've snick one in of the outside."
Beautiful Architecture ,"This beautiful palace look a like building is just set back from the sea front so it’s definitely worth a little walk to see it. The pavilion  is stunning, with the gardens and flowers all around the building, perfect to walk through on a hot day and maybe have a picnic on the grass.It costs £15 per person to go into the pavilion. We were on a bit of the budget so we decided not to go into the pavilion, but admiring the beauty of the building from the outside was more than enough for us."
Okay,It was okay but not amazing to be honest. Felt rather unfinished and quite empty. Gift shop was extortionate. We got an audio guide which became quite annoying as it rambled on and on...!Some rooms were better than others as they had lots of things in and more interesting. No photos allowed inside which was a shame.
Opulent,"At the risk of revealing that I'm not well traveled, this has to be the most opulently decorated palace I've ever seen. Every surface and every fitting is individually crafted for a monarch's summer holiday party palace."
Lavishly detailed presentation ,"I really enjoyed the tour - the guide Darren, gave us an insight into the historical setting, and brought the house back to life."
Fantastical,"Hoped that this would be good as waited a long time to visit, it did not disappoint! The pavilion surpassed my expectations it is beautiful and gloriously wonderful."
Built for royalty to show off.,"Interesting for its over the top ostentation, this was built for royalty to show off. The interior Chinese Style mixed with exterior Mughal Empire is unusual. This is an assault on the visual senses, a vulgar rather than elegant royal palace, but fascinating none the less. The kitchens are interesting giving an indication of the excessive dining habits of the aristocracy at the time.Entry at £15 seemed on the high side, but as National Trust members we have ceased to notice what is charged, I checked and this is similar to their charges."
Royal pavilion Brighton,WOW!!!!!what a wonderful building.... the gardens are beautiful.... and the inside is outstanding.... well worth a visit
Stunning,This place defiantly is a must visit when in Brighton. It is spectacular and does seem too make you feel intrigued. its worth a visit inside although there is not information inside about the palace so the audio guide is something you will have to get separately. The grounds are free to wonder and are nice on warm days for picnics. The place is beautiful and regal.
Royal Pavilion,"This stunning Royal Palace does not disappoint.  The decor and furnishings are both sumptuous and extraordinary.  The attention to detail by the conservation team undertaking the restoration and refurbishment is mind blowing.The displays explaining the restoration programme are tremendous and extremely informative.  However, whilst the audio guide seemed comprehensive and much enjoyed by many, the offer of using your own mobile phone for the guide, at no cost, did not work.  Disappointingly even the staff acknowledged that it did not link up!  Furthermore, the written descriptions of the rooms were few and far between.  Where written informations are offered they are in desperate need of updating to provide more detail.  Information should be displayed in positions that give the visitor maximum angle and light for reading.  Overall, well worth a visit!"
"Don't miss it.  Unbelievably ostentatious, amazing home - designed and decorated.","This was a great castle to start with - good history, good stories, good exhibits.  Then we went to the ""home"" - just a traditional family home - not at all! The living quarters were unbelievably ostentatious, impressive, and amazing - the guide was a hoot!  Had us all in stitches with his wit, AND he knows his stuff.  One of my favorite tours ever."
Majestic and throughly eniuyed,How picturesque- we enjoyed this whole area and the tea room is placed at exactly the most convenient location to take a welcome break from all the walking!
Family holiday,It was ok. There were some very pretty things inside. But I thought it was a little on the expensive side. For people that like that sort of thing they would enjoy it. We chose to not get the electronic tour. Which may have improved our experience. But that is extra ontop of your ticket.
Beautiful ,Spent a lovely couple of hours wandering round the Royal pavilion and gardens..Absolutely stunning...very opulent. A mixture of Indian architecture  witha huge chinese influence inside...authentically  reproduced/ restored.Highly recommended
Exquisite!!!,This stunningly beautiful gem never fails to amaze. The workmanship that has gone into it is out of this world. A visit to Brighton would not be complete without a step back in time to the Royal Pavilion. Don’t forget to visit the tearoom for the most delicious homemade cakes and tea on the terrace 🍰
Fabulous place!,Very interesting and looks lovely in the evening when lit up. Lovely park and cafe to chill especially in the warm weather.
Bank Holiday visit,"An iconic Brighton building - with its domes and minarets looking completely out of place in its surroundings of a seaside town. But somehow it works, and it is definitely worth a detour to pay it a visit."
Jazzlou63,"Beautiful place a must see, tea and cake yummy too. Gardens are lovely too for a picnic. Can be busy at times but we were lucky and wasnt too busy."
Beautiful Garden and Scenery,"The inner tour is somewhat expensive for what it is. It’s nice however you really need an audio guide which is an extra £2 as there aren’t many descriptions available to read in any of the rooms. Beautiful Chinese inspired decor inside and Indian/Mogul exterior with lovely gardens you can relax in and walk around for free.You can only access the tea rooms by doing the inner tour. The food/drink is expensive but good quality. The view/decor is really what you’re paying for. I would recommend booking tickets for the inner tour if you want to do it online as they are cheaper however you still have to queue for tickets on entry, even if you have pre-booked tickets which is a bit annoying."
Incredible place,Everything is so big in it. The Chinese decorations are beautiful. It’s expensive but it’s really worth seeing.
Helpful guides,"I haven't been for a while and decided to visit when a family member was staying with me.  We used the audio guide, which was great and lots of opportunities to learn more if you wished.It's a fantastically opulent palace with knowledgeable guides and a great place to visit.  We went in the afternoon on a Bank Holiday weekend and there was plenty of space and time to look around."
Lovely gardens and jazz band,Enjoyed the Pavilion Gardens during the August bank holiday weekend. The Pavilion is beautiful and a relaxing place to go on a crowded day. We were lucky enough to see a live jazz band playing who were very talented. Gave 3 stars rather than 5 as Brighton has a rundown feel to the place and generally needs a revamp so the park’s not as nice as those in London.
Really enjoyed this ,We went here early in the day (just as it opened) which is best to beat the crowds. Beautifully done. Gift shop was awesome too which I rarely enjoy.  It took about an hour and a half to go through. Really interesting decor.
Really pretty ,"Came here as last step of my day journey in Brighton, so I probably missed a few bits and pieces. The outside of the palace is amazing and looks so exotic.The inside is spectacular with those carpets, it doesn’t even look like a typical palace here. I wish I had taken more pictures!"
Not what I expected,"The building can’t quite help looking a little tatty on the outside, but the inside and the contents / exhibits have been maintained and restored extremely well to make your visit worthwhile. The audio guide is optional and costs extra...to be honest, I think it should be included in the admission fee, which isn’t cheap."
A 'must see' when in Brightion,"We ducked into the Royal Pavilion to avoid a rain shower, and so glad we did. We had never really understood the purpose of this elaborate building, other than it was built for George IV. We left 2 hours later with so much information about the Royals, the architects, the furnishings, and just the sheer scale of it all.An audio guide leads you through ground and 1st floor rooms, all furnished, and explains the rooms' functions. There is also a fascinating small exhibition from the time the Pavilion was used as a hospital for troops from the Indian Corps wounded on the Western Front during World War I. Paintings, archive photographs and film footage recall this time.In the care of Brighton Corporation (I think), it belongs to the people of Brighton – they should be very proud"
A great attraction to see and learn some British history,"My niece and I were in Brighton on a trip and decided to visit the Royal Pavilion.  We were not disappointed.  The Royal Pavilion has been extensively renovated and there are many interesting rooms to see.  There a number of well-done historical descriptions.  Plus, the cafeteria is nice - very good scones."
It's cool,Can't touch the walls though a man on a tannoy system shouts at you! Really interesting historical building
"Amazing palace, unlike others i have seen","We went to the Royal Pavilion, but did not really know what to expect.Was pleasently surprised by it.The audioguide is amazing! You learn so much about the king and the history of Brighton.The interior of the palace is just AMAZING. I have been to many palaces etc. but I have never seen anything like this. From the wallpapers and the dressors, to the chandeliers and the carpet.. Mind-blown!"
A must - even though expensive.,"I feel that any visitor to Brighton should visit the Royal Pavilion, while the opportunity arises.  The entrance fee is steep, but I am glad I went in.  There are phone-type guides on hire (£2), which I feel are a must in order to justify the high entrance fee and enjoy the visit to the full.  The guide book is relatively cheap, and I am enjoying reliving my visit through the book.  The cafe has a lovely veranda to eat on."
Great tour but buy the audio guide,An interesting tour of the Pavilion made better with the audio guide. It would not have been that interesting without it. The tea room in the Pavilion is worth a visit too.
Interesting architecture surrounded by lawns,While we did not go into the building itself it was interesting to walk around the gardens and enjoy the architecture (mix of Indian and Chinese influence).  The lawns provide visitors (and students) a great opportunity to meet and sit away from the bustle of Brighton whilst still within a stones throw of the action.
Awesome ,"It’s the best historic property we have visited for years, even our 13 year old enjoyed it. It’s reasonably priced but they charge a couple of pounds extra each for the audio tour which i would recommend, but I do think these should be included in the admission ticket price. It has a nice cafe within the property.And the gift shop has some quirky stuff too. Well worth a visit."
How can anyone not give this 5 stars??!!,"Absolutely spectacular place to visit and stroll around.  The Banqueting Hall in itself is stunning, the intricate detail in the chandelier worth the admission alone.  A mix of Indian styles outside, Chinese inside, it's a truly remarkable building.If you don't hire the audio guide you're going to miss out on a lot of interesting background to the history of the house and the people who occupied it.  Don't miss!"
Royal Pavilion visit,"We visited the Pavillion as part of a combined ticket for 2 adults and 1 child. We really enjoyed using the recorded guided tour and it was breath taking walking into some of the rooms.Great tea room with variety, seating in and out on a nice day. Great photo opportunities in the garden around the building."
SURPRISING VISIT,"The Royal Pavilion is not what we expected. We thought it would have an Indian theme by the look of the building but it was all Chinese decor inside. We have been travelling recently to amazing, beautiful building but, this is far the best. The main two rooms knocked me out by it's beauty and design."
Picture Opportunities,"An area in which, was great for those who wanted photo opportunities. With different areas in which you can express your inner skills."
Opulent reminder of the excesses of the elite,"It is hard to think that the British people could allow their de facto monarch to waste so much money on so frivolous a folly as the Brighton Pavilion and yet... We have been left something so sumptuous, a feast for the eyes and a showcase for some incredible artisans in fields of furnishing and so much more even if the “Chinoiserie” displays a knowledge of the Orient gained second or third hand at best. If I have a minor gripe it’s that there are very few labels on items, perhaps to sell more audio guides but in a way it’s nice to see and stops visitors causing bottlenecks as they slowly digest the blurbs. One point you should note is that no photography is allowed inside so you’re spared the ubiquitous selfie sticks! Yippee!"
Sheer opulence!,I've seen this place many times from the outside but never been in until now. What an amazing place! Not the stuffiness you would expect from a royal palace. Even the kids were awestruck. The cafe was nice too. Highly recommended.
Pretty pavilion ,"We paid for 2 tickets into the Pavilion which was a fair price. We were asked if we wanted audio guides but I said no but wasn't encouraged to change my mind. I didn't realise how few information boards were throughout the exhibition. I would therefore recommend an audio guide. However, the Pavilion is stunning with some fantastic history. Would highly recommend a visit."
Love the History,"We enjoyed our visit here. £15 for Adults & £9 for children to enter. Don’t pay extra for the audio tour, they offer the same service for free using you smartphone. Made a huge difference to know what we were looking at. Fascinating history. Didn’t stay for tea in the tea room but the food looked lovely. Highly recommend stopping here on your visit."
incredible building,Stunning building in a lovely park. The architecture is very interesting and unusual for a seaside town.  Looking forward to a tour inside sometime.
Truly stunning,"My friend and I visited this amazing building recently. She thought from.the outside it looked a little shabby but her reaction changed on getting inside. We paid £2 for a talking post guide and it was well worth it. The decor inside this amazing building is phenomenal it's lavish and glorious. I can honestly say I've never visited any historic palace, castle or country estate that is so stunning and beautiful. We spent ages in there and I would recommend a visit there. I'm so glad I went"
An interesting place to visit,While you are in Brighton visit Royal Pavilion. Interesting history behind the palace and brilliant cafe with various cakes and lovely coffee! Highly recommended
Love this place,"Just walking around this lovely building is a real treat, but the inside is just to die for, if you are in Brighton, don’t miss out on this attraction. After a nice tour you can have a great cup of tea in the tea rooms.Don’t miss out on this in Brighton"
Expensive but still worth seeing,"Admission was £15 and there was no reduction for seniors, so I refused the £2 audio guide. The displays were jaw dropping and quite awesome. The chandeliers were simply incredible."
