Beautiful city,"Old world charm, beautiful locales, lovely heritage and remarkable lakes, the city of Udaipur has something for everyone. It is romantic, mystic and historical."
Just a hype and overrated!!,"It is just a one time watch if you are visiting Udaipur for the first time.Nothing found such interesting.entry ticket is 350₹ per person. You can hire a e-car till the entrance gate of the palace for 50₹ per person,of-cause this place is large but there was nothing within the walls that shouted out that maharajas and maharanis used to live here."
Amazed!,Best place to visit in udaipur. Amazed to see such a huge creation and history related to it. A must visit place in udaipur

Cultural City Palace.,"City palace of Udaipur is a marvelous architecture. It showcases the culture of Rajasthan in every way. It make you imagine the lifestyle of the kings and queens. How they lived, what kind of clothes they wore, everything.You can find the vessels and tools used in the old era,…"
Lovely place to visit ,I’m in love with this place.. I really appreciate the detail in the history and meanings behind so many things in the palace. Often we visit these places
Nice Feeling ,Awesome palace Any word would be less to explain how beautiful this place is. It took 3 hours to cover this place. Due to the weekend there was a great rush.I was literally wondered by the beauty of this palace. It still shines like it is newly constructed. I highly appreciate the architecture and the skills of the people who built this palace.
"Udaipur, great place to decompress","A trip to Udaipur is a tryst with royalty, a dalliance with indulgences. Udaipur is a great place to decompress and enjoy life after traveling around India for a while. You can’t spend three days in Udaipur without visiting the City Palace. The City Palace is actually a number of separate palaces constructed over a span of 400 years. The entire complex is now a museum open to the public, except for Shiv Niwas Palace and the Fateh Prakash Palace which both have been converted into heritage hotels."
Beautiful palace and a must see in Udaipur.,"Our guide gave us a very instructive tour of the palace and the crystal gallery and although, because I find lots of stairs difficult, I was unable to visit some of the rooms the whole visit was extremely interesting."
A Palace,"An amazing state of art still existing. It was a proud moment to be there and call myself a Rajput. And after visiting the palace, I don’t think we live in the modern world- instead they were more machanised and modern as they could build that in the era where there was no technology. Open till 5:30pm, it’s a great visit during the day. There are several guides available to tell you more. It has a basic entry ticket of Rs 30 which is worth to pay for what you get. The palace also opens other part for Crystal Palace and vintage car collection which can also be visited at the same time after the visit to the palace (though at extra cost). The palace also has a shopping arcade where one can buy local products and also a restaurant and bar in case you feel like sitting and watching the palace while having a drink. It was an amazing experience."
City Palace Udaipur,Amazing architecture and decoration.The peacock archs and doors are handcrafted jewels. Worth to visit and spend sometime walking around.
Massive & extensive,"The City Palace is settled on the east bank of Lake Pichola. It is a huge complex that includes many gateways, palaces, halls and museum. The complex is very grand, meanwhile, looks awkward and disorganized due to a diverse assortment of architectural influences by several rulers of the Mewar dynasty over a period of nearly 400 years. Some of the rooms/halls are quite narrow and crowded with people which made it hard to walk around and to enjoy the place."
Beautiful Palace,A wonderful beautifully designed andbuilt palace with great views over the scenic lake. Very interesting history.
Exemplary! ,The sheer magnitude of the palace absorbs you. A must visit if you are going to Udaipur. It would take a good 4 hours to explore the place.
"very interesting! the palace is very big, impressive and well preserved!","it takes about 3-4 hours to tour the whole palace, especially if you are into the audio guide, which I recommend because it adds some extra information! bring along a student card if you have one, it gives a very nice discount!!"
Pathetic n Overrated,Not as good as AgraFort.It was waste of time.Only good thing was Terrace Sunset Restaurant in the palace where we enjoyed lunch n drinks with great view of LakePalace.
Great morning exploring,"A morning of exploring a palace? i’m in!   Really enjoyed discovering the views from, colours and history of the palace.   An amazimg collection  of crystal  makes it clear how lavish the lifestyles of the kings were. Mind blowing.   The palace itself sprawls across several…"
Big beautiful palace,"A must see place for everyone. Takes at least 3 hours .Blend of Rajput and Mughal architecture. Beautiful  pieces of civil , glass , marble ,wood crafts .Avoid the shops in palace - unreasonable prices."
Must visit,Loved it. Very rich heritage and lot of historic facts well preserved. Best to visit with guide or take audio tour. It will take 2-3 hrs. Not advisable for elderly with some limitations for walking and climbing stairs. 
Great,"Probably the most iconic of the sites in Udaipur and well worth a visit. Crammed full of amazing buildings, artwork and artefacts. Highly recommended."
Great views,"We visited the City Palace as part of a tour group so had a guide to tell us some of the history of the place which helped bring it alive.  There are some interesting areas within the complex but you have to seek them out sometimes to get the best from a visit.  That said, there…"
Group visit.,Very busy here and lovely grounds and views.Many historical things to see in the museum including crystal.Looked like there was lovely shops and an outdoor cafe but no time to investigate.Steep narrow stone staircases so not for the faint hearted.Lovely gardens and courtyards. Views over the lake were amazing.
Must see place in Udaipur,This place attracts visitors due to its beautiful architecture and the breath taking view that it offers from its top.City palace is no doubt an amazing and mindblowing palace.
MUST VISIT ,City palace is a palace complex situated in the city of udaipur. You will find alot of interesting  history. You will also get alot of picture  perfect  spots to click picture. If you are in udaipur  you should  definitely  invest  time.
The palace to beat all palaces,"I adore India - I love it's history, it's palaces, it's forts and it's temples - I never tire of visiting all these and find something different in every single one to enchant my senses.And the City Palace in Udaipur was no exception - actually it was an exception as it is by far the biggest and most ornate palaces of all those I have visited in India thus far.  The sheer scale was breathtaking - so much to see.  There are gorgeous ornate rooms, wonderful art, open spaces and winding corridors and gorgeous views over the lake.  Honestly - even if you think you are ""palaced out"" (as my husband gets) you need to visit here - even he enjoyed this one and actually spent a few hours enjoying all there was to see (usually he sits out after a little while and waits me to return).The only small issue we had was the very western-style cafe just outside the palace, but within the grounds.  We needed a cool drink and something to eat after our wanderings, managed to nab a table - and I get it is busy as it's the only place available right there - but then we were unable to attract anyone to actually offer us service - I even asked at one stage, if someone could please come to our table and still no luck.  Better off to head back out and find somewhere local and less ""touristy""."
Breathtaking ,This place is a must see and it’s worth taking a good few hours to go round it. I would go in the morning when there are less crowds.
Large but underwhelming,This Palace is large but there was nothing within the walls that shouted out that maharajas and maharanis used to live here. Except for the location and the size there was nothing about the property that stood out.
Udaipur City palace,It's a great sight seeing place. Best if accompanied by a guide. Boating is very expensive. Cheaper option is available at Fateh Sagar lake
A beautiful heritage,"A day trip to city palace will require two to three hours. Palace is huge and has to be covered on foot. There are battery operated vehicles available at entrance gate which takes you upto main building but after that one has to travel on foot, this comes with an extra charge. There is an eatery in the premises which offers food and drinks, its good but very expensive. Palace is well kept though at some places it requires maintenance. One has to carry plenty of water. Guides are available and will be helpful if one wants to understand history this place carried. Helping Staff and security staff is too rude. View from palace windows of Udaipur is beautiful along with lake Pichola on other side. Audio tour is also available. Over all a nice place and a good time can be spent there and after that boating in lake Pichola will be an added attraction."
One of the Best thing in Udaipur,City Palace is the one of the main attractions of Udaipur. Nicely maintained and total worth of time and money. Guides have fixed price and they are good too.
Nice for a look around. ,Palace was good for a short visit but not as impressive as others we had visited. It would also seem every attraction in Udaipur owned by the palace was very expensive and has gone up a lot over the last few years. The cafe in palace grounds charged 300 rupees for a coke for example and the crystal gallery 700 each for something that took about 20 minutes to see.
Awesome palace,"The palace is well maintained and clean, but the fee to visit is expensive and can be reduced. Overall takes around 3hours to visit completely."
What a beautiful setting !,"This palace which was built on a hill to overlook the city. The structure which is made of granite and marble was begun around 450 years ago and it is testament to the quality of the architects, artisans and workmen of those days that it still stands, perfectly gleaming white giving a full panoramic view of the Udaipur residents below.Made up of many quadrangles and corridors and interior courts it is well worth taking a couple of hours if time permits to take it all in."
Couldn't see anything,"Parking facility not available. The lanes are so congested and narrow, you won't be able to park car"
Astonishing ,One of the prettiest palaces I have visited.   Easy to navigate and I didn’t think I needed a guide as there was plenty to read.  Many photo shoots must get done here as the rooms seemed familiar.   Combine with the boat ride to the floating palace  for a day of palaces.
Loved City Palace,"City Palace was definately one of our favourite ""attractions"" whilst travelling Northern India. The arcitechture is pretty impressive and there are great panoramic views of Udaipur from the grounds and palace itself. The boat trips that leaves from the Palace is also great and would highly recommend."
Royal place,Must visit place.  Whole udaipur can be seen from here.. Beautiful interiors.. Tour guide is not so necessary as they are too expensive 😬
Memorable moment,The City Palace is a must-see in Udaipur. The architecture is stunning and offers many rooms connected by stairs and corridors. The decoration of the rooms is well preserved and all rooms are different offering a large avariety of styles. Stunning decorations like mirrors or mosaics make the visit very enjoyable and unforgettable.
Fascinating ,Excellently preserved palace right in the middle of town. Need a guide or an audio guide. We got a guide who was very good as it keeps a local employed.
Wedding,Such a gorgeous venue. It’s a beautiful island which you reach by boat . You are greeted by glittering lights that cast shadows into the lake. The Jag Mandir stands grandly .   Lush gardens and archways along the lake make for a fairytale setting .     We had musicians at our function who lend a magical air to the evening.
Beautiful,We visited here at 10 am.The big enterence fee for visitors n parking.From parking there is electric jeep you can take.That is another fee.we took.The palace was too beautiful.Each and every corner we liked.Mant shops were there.We lived the architecture of the palace.You must see this.In rajasthan every corner you will have fees.This palace is lake side n boating is available with 500 rs per person.we roamed there.
Experience the Royalty,"City Palace is an Amazing place, the Grandauer it has is unmatched.It takes half a day to see the palace and appreciate its beauty.  The marvel of articians and the taste of Kings & Queens are uncomparable. Appreciate every room tastefully decorated with different glass, tiles, semi precious stones,  colour combinations and the marble & granite used to bring out the best result.Location is also admirable.  Nothing but the best was available to the Royals. Rich History and Royal ambiance is something to treasure. A must visit place for all."
Most beautiful palace ,The best and beautiful palace among all the palaces I have ever seen. So many historical things in museum and in palace to see and enjoy. Must visit everyone.
Good for one time watch,If you have seen the fort of Jaipur than its not that great. But for architecture it's great. If you want to know the history and have a interest in it than its good to go. Its just one portion is open for public and royal family is residing in other part. It's not a govt. Heritage but a private property of royal family. View of city from the city palace is amazing from different areas so don't miss viewing that.Crystal gallery is only for those who are serious of crystal stuff but for the price ticket of RS. 700 I don't think it's worth the price. You can't take pictures of the crystal stuff as cameras are not allowed.For my take. Go see the city palace and skip the crystal gallery.
Crowded,"The City Palace is situated beautifully on the lake and it is easy to imagine oneself  at a Mediterranean resort. Very touristy with lots of cafes and shops, the surrounding streets were packed as it was a festival day for Shiva. The palace is impressive with beautifully decorated rooms and an interesting museum of armoury, but does not have the same jaw dropping wow factor as the Amber Fort in Jaipur.It was very crowded and you often had to queue in quite narrow passageways to progress from room to room."
A must visit in Udaipur!,"Really enjoyed visiting city palace to get a real feel of the life of the Maharajah. The palace is enormous, a wonderful large entrance which leads you up cobbles to the majestic building. I found the many stairs difficult to climb having a broken toe but didn’t let it stop me. Some of the corridors are narrow and end with more stairs up. It’s worth going up though for the wonderful views and  you can take photos of through the arch frames of the Rajasthani palace which overlook the lake. The architecture is beautiful, there are also well preserved peacock designs set with glass, mirror tile and semi precious stones as well as Rajasthani flower patterns. On one floor there were paintings and artwork and on others decorated blue and white tiles in arches. There are also artefacts dotted around the floors, it’s very interesting.Put this top of your list of things to see in Udaipur as well as other places I’ve mentioned with tips. Tip: If you have a serious mobility issues it will be difficult to do the many stairs that there are. However, there are places to sit outside and marvel at the building, there’s also an on-site cafe/restaurant and shops though we didn’t go into any of these. If you love history, art, architecture or beauty then you won’t be disappointed. We took some lovely photos. What I enjoyed was looking out from high arches over the lake, it’s beautiful."
Fascinating exterior.  Strange interior.,"We have mixed emotions about this palace.  The exterior has an intriguing look, with its size and many shapes, and it entices one to go inside.  Once inside, it just seems weird.  There are long, extremely narrow, winding hallways, some with low ceilings - which apparently were intended to keep masses of intruders from making a quick, forward invasion.One is constantly having to duck due to the low ceilings.Some of the rooms are very interesting.  Most fascinating are a few rooms, and some courtyard walls,  that are covered with elaborate mosaics.To us, this was the least interesting palace in Rajasthan.   It was certainly the quirkiest, and the most difficult to walk through.  It is not recommendable for anyone with any impaired mobility.The views of the lake and the mountains in the distance are spectacular."
"Nice palace, great guide","We visited the palace with a guide,  the guides have a fixed route they must take and must cover in 1.5 to 2 hours.Our guide was informative without boring us with multiple dates and names that you never remember. There is quite a lot of walking with multiple sets of stairs some of which are narrow and steep. You can get views over the lake, but there are multiple restaurants in town that offer better views."
Pocket unfriendly,"The palace is located on hilly area with beautiful lake on one side of palace. Inside the museum it is one way. If somebody can't walk much, better to avoid, because you can't come out in same way and there is lot of stair climbing and narrow passages. Inside like  all other museums exhibition of old things are there,  well organized.Entry fees are too high. Even e cars (?  rickshaws )are not cheap which are supposed to take elderly and disabled (no mention of pregnant or with small children ) to take uphill to the palace."
Just pay for a common grounds pass (not the museum pass),All the magic of this Palace is on the external facade and views over lake Pichola so you really don’t need to get a museum pass (300 bucks) unless you plan for spend 2 hours wondering the museum and studying the artifacts. Remember you can always buy additional passes once you are in the grounds with the common pass.
Well maintained and simply beautiful,Dont miss the visit of city palace when in udaipur to get knowledge about the history of mewar and the lifestyle of royals. the place holds many told and untold stories which will unfold in front of you as you understand more and more of it.
Majestic experience,Places like City Palace do not need reviews. They are grand palaces which depicts lived and luxury of the royals. City palace has an entry charge of Rs 300 for adults and Rs 100 for children under 10. The palace house artifacts used by the kings and their heirs which is a great…
Typical tourist attraction. Magnificent but too crowded and expensive,"City Palace is a magnificent piece of art and architecture, there is no doubt in that. However, people who come from heritage cities having forts/temples might not find it unparalleled. Also, since this is a major tourist attraction of Udaipur, it is extremely crowded and…"
Big Palace,I would recommend to visit City palace if you are in Udaipur. The palace tour takes about 2.5 to 3 hours. In my view City palace is basically about 2 things : 1. History 2. Pichola Lake Boating  I recommend people to take guide to understand History of palace
What A Beautiful Palace,"One Of The Best Place Of Udaipur. It Is A Great Historical Place. Nice Palace For Boating Around. A Great Piece Of Art. Lots Of Things To See in The Museum Like- Colorful Paintings, Ornaments, Weapon, Musical Instruments Etc."
Not Quite As Impressive as Other Palaces but Offers some Quirky Features,"After being spoilt by the Forts/palaces of Jodhpur and Jaipur it’s hard to get as excited by this palace but it does have some noteworthy features: 1. Elephant beds - In front of the main entrance there is an area with stone posts, chains and stone banks. These stone banks were…"
Local conveyance: Auto hire + 2 wheelers ,I recommend taking auto drive if you are 2-3 people travelling to Udaipur : you can contact Dinesh @ 07300-480902.. he will give day -1 city tour & day 2 to some far off location.. Nice person.. Second option is hire 2 wheeler for market & cafe hopping.
City Palace,It's a beautiful palace like the name says it all 'City Palace'.Lake beside this palace is a bonus for visitors like us!
Recommend but DO NOT BUY ANYTHING from the shops,"This is one of the prominent attractions of udaipur and a recommended sightseeing spot. However, do not make the mistake of entering surrounding shops that your guide will recommended (if u take one). They will trick you into believing their items are purely organic and unique and will charge a premium price for this (2-3 times more that what local shops in city centre will cost). The guides get commission for any purchase you make. We fell prey of their deceptive tactics and would like to warn others through this platform."
Amazing ,"It is like a maze in and out of rooms up and down stairs. Incredible property but not handicap accessible. Amazing art, history and architecture to see how the other half lived."
Worth a trip,"A little pricey, and wouldn’t say a guide is necessary, but the city palace is beautiful, expansive and a good way to enjoy some historical architecture."
Slightly more plain than the other palaces ,Thought this palace was relatively plain compared to the other ones from Jodhpur Jaipur.. lots to see.. quite crowded as well with guides and tour groups .. Still a must do in Udaipur
A lot to see - you need a good guide,This is a huge fort/palace with some interesting rooms and history. Worth a visit and worth taking a guide for £5 or less. Make sure you also visit the Crystal Gallery which is extraordinary and has the smartest loos in India!
Beautiful among all the palaces.,This Udaipur City Palace is lragest and more beautiful than other city palaces in Rajasthan. Worth visiting. Should definitely visit.
Must Visit in Udaipur,"This palace is located on a high altitude , the road to this is very narrow and has a market on both sides where you can get Unique stuff. The entry to this palace is 300 per person and 100 for students. Parking charges are 300 for car and 25 for 2 wheeler. The palace is very beautiful and you can learn very much about the history of Rajasthan from here. You can rent a guide or take headphones which will explain each and everything to you about the place. The museum has boards which explain the details . The View of the city from the palace is astonishing."
Incredible complex,"Built over a period of 400 years and including 11 separate palaces, this site includes many different types of architecture and design. Beautiful inlaid work, rooms comprised totally of mirrors, separate areas for the royal ladies, panoramic views of the city - all worth seeing. Truly amazing."
Amazing castle,An exceptionnel place for visiting.Do not forget to go to Udaipur if you are visiting Rajasthan in India !
Very nice,Great visit. It's not a luxurious palace but has many different and picturesque rooms. Top site in Udaipur
Beautiful but a bit boring,We loved the views and the buildings but were a bit bored of the museum side of things. I guess if you're into history then this would be great but otherwise na. Bit of a maze just to get to the views as well...
Round visit of City Palace,"City Palace, Udaipur is a palace complex situated in the heart of the city. It was built over a period of nearly 400 years, with contributions from several rulers of the Mewar. Construction began in 1553, started by Maharana Udai Singhji 2.It is the real Beauty of Architecture."
Not sure,It is so difficult to comment but then I believe that one should to help the new travellers. If you have not seen a fort in your life then for experience one should. For Foreigners it would be a good experience but for Indians it is a okay kind of experience. What I loved was the coffee shop in the middle of the Palace. Loved to sit and sip my tea and look at the Palace.The staff is amazing at the Palace.
Not to be missed,A fascinating showcase of life of Majarajahs from years back and very educational. Taking a guide is to be recommended as they give great insights
Well organised . Impressive,amazing palace.well worth visiting. the route was well organised and there is much splendour to enjoy. As with all India there are stairs but not too bad at all. Also enjoyed senior citizen rates.
"Nice place to visit with hefty charges for some so called "" exclusive"" boating privileges.......","Place is a nice one to be visited just like any other city palaces. There are two kind of gates , for entry it's one and for exit there are two. Routine price ticket is 300 INR for adults , but when u intend exit from palace ,u need to have separate 30 Rs ticket for second gate, which is never explained by palace staff stationed there.Apart from that, one need to pay separately for 500 INR for boat ride before 3 pm and 800 INR per person for temple visit and so called ,"" exclusive "" boating area for privileged.Boating point staff is rude , arrogant and not willing to explain anything to commoner about charges. I had posted this review while sitting in palace itsel, which explains the arrogance and rudeness of staff.....Another information, u can take exit from front gate, take auto from main exit gate to ropeway point, and then reach boating point managed by government with reasonable charges of  INR 150 to 200 for same beautiful Lake Pichhola of Udaipur. Posted this review urgently so that other commoners like me are not aggrieved for similar issues."
Visit to Royal history,Worth a visit.You may need 3 hours if you are interested in history.Approach road is quite congested. Driver carefully if you hire a self drive car.
Great Historical Place. ,"It's a very nice place to visit At Udaipur, Rajasthan, India. A great Historical Place One should visit with Guide to know more about The Place."
Wonderful palace ,"This palace consists of three parts—a public area, a luxury hotel and the part of the palace that the present Maharajah lives in.  Definitely worth a visit, the museum portion has rooms decorated as they were when the palace was in use as well as a wonderful silver museum. …"
Must visit for one time,A royal treat to visit. Every corner of the palace will make you take out your camera. Don't go for guide as most of the places have been provided with description and history details. Audio guide is available. Felt little high on price considering a public place. 
Large palace,It is a very big palace situated on the banks of Lake Pichola. It is one of the best attractions of Udaipur.
Great experience ,The City Palace was a great experience with a lot of history of Udaipur and cool works of art and architecture. 
All time favorite city to visit in rajasthan.,I visited Udaipur last year for two days and fall in love with the city of the lake there are still many places are left to visit.
Spectacular Visit,"This is still inhabited by the original family but much of it is now a museum. It’s beautiful inside, so much history, really worth seeing."
Worth it! ,"Really interesting Museum inside the huge and beautiful palace! But bring your student ID for a discount of 200 rupees :) if you don’t have one, 300 rupees will be the normal price! But totally worth it!"
Do with a guide,There’s a lot to learn here so a guide is recommended. Nice architecture. Golf cart available for seniors for about $2 to take you up the hill but I think anyone can hire one.
Historical palace,It is historical palace in udaipur. It will take three to four hours to visi. Palace is very good but entry fees is very high which is not affordable for everyone.
Fascinating history and architecture,Great time of year to go with the weather warm and sunny. Beautiful to see from the water especially at night
Splendor ,The city palace is a display of splendor and grandeur of the bygone ages. The royalty and their style of living.... the history the music the romance all intricately captured. The palace is beautifully maintained and the sun dynasty insignia all beautifully illustrated and…
Worth the visit,A rabbit warren of stairs and corridors full of artifacts and uique rooms with vistas through the windows.  The place to visit in Udaipur.
Visiting place,"Great place to visit, Very convinient and exciting place Guides here are fantastic and palace is very large"
Full of history ,We had a guided tour of this palace with Javid and Fairoz. What a lovely experience. Javid is a native of Udaipur whose grandfather had worked for the maharana. He shared his knowledge well.  The Palace has many beautiful rooms and artifacts. Get there when it opens as it does…
Must see,"Not surprisingly a must do visit, clues in the name. Visit every bit, it takes 2-3 hours and buy outside for half the price"
Iconic place,It is one of the iconic place to visit in Udaipur. There are tourist guides available with id cards. You should watch the palace as they explain each and everything it feels so connected to see all the things. It is so beautiful and the view from the palace is very serene. 
Must do,"A imposing structure and collection of historical facts and art that is really very good.Great arrangements, good guides, loads of information, a good exercise walking through the palace, 2 hours of great walkthrough ."
Must Visit,If you are visiting Udaipur then this a must visit. Try to do a guide there since you will get to know about the history.
An excellent place to visit,"Well worth the time to visit here. It’s a large palace in a beautiful setting on the lake. It’s scale can only be appreciated by walking to the opposite side over the footbridge, only 15-20mins or, take a boat ride on the lake. "
Shobha,"ShriNiwas Palace is an awesome heritage structure with some of the most exquisite artifacts & furnitures. The old world feel along with all the modern amenities is like a dream come true. The icing on the cake is the warm hospitality of Mr Ram & his team, who have been ever…"
Stunning ,"Simply beautiful, and massive place. Highly recommend coming at open (930) as this place is very popular and gets packed quickly. When we went at open it was busy but certainly bearable. As we left the tour groups were coming in by the masses "
Majestic palace with amazing history,"If you are in Udaipur, this place is a must visit... This place has lot of historic significance. Please take a guide with you,they help u understand the place very nicely. The rate may seem over but its definitely worth it. "
Nice,"Nice palace a bit overrun by selfie taking tourists. Located nicely in the center of town. Overall, I would do it again."
"Sort of cool, lots of tourists","Interesting and certainly beautiful, not much else for typical tourists to see here other than the regular street scenes, which I think are more interesting. It’s the first and probably only place most people go. Great for photography. It’s worthwhile, but I much prefer…"
Morning Tour,"A huge palace on the side of the lake in Udaipur. Well worth a visit, and you need at least two hours without seeing the crystal museum. Lots of steep stairs and narrow passages, so you need to be fit and able. Well worth a visit as the rooms and artefacts are very interesting,…"
Cool place!,It’s a cool place and worth a look around! The bazaar inside is quite pricy but the staff aren’t at all pushy and it’s nice to browse. If going definitely visit the museum as well.
Fascinating place!,This is probably the number one site to visit in Udaipur.  It was just as fascinating to me on this trip as it was 10 years ago.  Lines can be long... riding an elephant up is a fun experience rarely to be had!
Nice Views But Costly Affair,"The City Palace of Udaipur is still under the tutelage of the royal family, unlike other properties that were taken over by the Govt of India and Archaeological Survey of India. For the same reason, exploring the city palace turns out to be a costly affair. No doubt the property is well maintained and grand with charismatic views of the surroundings, but the entry tickets to various galleries and sections burn a hole in the travellers' pockets. You may skip the crystal gallery if that does not resonate with your taste and the museum guide can be given a miss too as most of the things are self explanatory along with written information available on site."
Amazing palace with great views,We went to the City Palace last week in Udaipur. It is big and have so much history and amazing views over the lake.It is easy to get to and you need to spend at least 2 hours having a look around the amazing rooms etc.It only cost 600 rupees to see.Well worth a visit
Must see,Historical .visit needs 2 hours.lot to see.be prepared to climb lot of stairs.They could keep a site màp
Must visit,The museum at City Palace is a must visit.  There is so much to explore and we need atleast 3-4 hours to give justice to this place.
Trip ,"Renowned palace adding beauty to Udaipur. Nice place near pichola lake. Maintainance 10/10. Palace includes garden, museums and cafeteria as well."
Good,Good place to visit but the entry cost is little bit high it's around 330/-. Inside boating the cost is also high. Overall it's good palace.
A palace rich in history,Udaipur City palace is a palace rich in history.  The subtleties of the rooms (such as the reason there is a room with a giant sun) is lost without a good guide.  There was a a very pretty central garden area and there are nice views of the city from the palace.  There is a…
Beautiful,It is very beautiful . If you are in Udaipur this place should be in top of the list . Enjoyed my visit here with my family .
detailed tour of how the custodians of the mewar dynasty lived,"a must visit for history of Mewar. beautiful places in the palace with things from different custodians of the mewar dynasty. Audio tour (rs 200) that i took was good, but there are tour guide options available which will be more economical for a group of people.  we also took…"
Wendy Wu tour visit,"Well worth a visit, particularly with our tour guide who was a wealth of information. The usual hawkers who are persistent, but on advice of our guide did not buy anything until back on the bus, when prices dropped to a quarter of original asking."
Blah blah blah,A highly commercialized palace that frankly looks like every other palace I’ve seen in India. Except for some subtle architectural differences. I would have much preferred doing ANYTHING else. 
Very historical,Would highly recommend wearing comfortable shoes when visiting the palace as you will be walking around for at least 2-3 hours. Mornings are a better time to visit the palace as the crowd isn’t at its peak and the sunlight just makes everything better. Do hire a tour guide as…
Nothing,"There is nothing worthy here as like all old forts there is nothing to see. Also it is very highly chargeable to see here as you have to pay 330.00 pp for museum,700 for crystal museum,  500 for boat riding & for any other facility you have to pay extra."
Unimpressive Start to Finish,The City Palace in Udaipur is one well worth missing. The building lacks any real semblance of a museum and there are barely any artifacts to view. The building is on poor condition and the overwhelming number of rooms are bare. I would not recommend a visit.
Fab-u-lous,"A must in see - lots of steep steps inside palace, so anyone with disabilities might struggle.  Took boat ride out on to lake, once you get on to landing in middle of lake you can have a massage as there is a spa. Expensive for India but very good."
wow,this palace is just beside the lake .you need entrance ticket .the palace is amazing just like the one you see from postcard.cant describe its beauty by writing .need to go there experience by yourself .lots of details from outside .i would say its a dream palace .must go there.
Beautiful Setting with Lakes and history all around,"This is not a huge city but it is well worth a visit.  Very beautiful palace, some lovely gardens and first class hotels. Rich in history and character."
Mesmerizing but pretty expensive,"Got mesmerized by seeing grandness and royal heritage of Maharana's. Lifetime experience, it's a must visit place. Keep wallet pretty heavvy, by the end of the tour u will feel wallet turned feather lite."
Interesting insight into how the other half luve,If you want to take a peek into the lives of maharajas look no further. This palace reveals all the opulence and wealth of these kings of past times. The ceramic work and tiling is incredible and displays the incredible artwork of the region. Reasonably priced entry fee.
Vaza study tour of Mewar,Beautiful. India's proud heritage. Very well maintained.it tooknus back to several centuries giving a prep into the longest reigning dynasty of India.
Worth Visiting,I traveled during the January month with my wife and decided to go to palace as we cannot miss this one.You will get proper parking space and then you've got guide who can tak le you in and explain each and everything precisely.It will take around 1hr30mins to look the property The main thing is that the king's family still resides in the PALACE and they are the 24th generation. They've got hotels also in the palace which are Shiv Nivas palace and one more is there.Its worth Visiting this palace.
Do take a tour guide,"Beautiful palace, some parts of it will literally take your breath with the amount of work put into the walls’ decoration. The details are stunning. I would highly recommend visiting the palace with a tour guide. Easy to spot them at the ticket counter, they all have an orange badge straps. We got Soni who was amazing! There wasn’t any question that he couldn’t answer."
Royal Feeling,City palace is very much closer to Pichola lake. If royal things attracts you then this the place for you.
Mrs lin,My trip to India was just an experience to remember . We visited city palace my husband and I.  Enjoyed all the site seeing.snd Rajastan as a whole. Jaipur was also interesting.
Great history and views,This is well worth the visit in Udaipur. Get a guide or the recorded tour. Also include the boat out to the Jag Mandir very relaxing and you get a different view of the Palace from the water.
Exposure to Rajasthan ,This guided visit started early morning which proved to be wise and the talent of our guide to introduce the interesting elements of this huge structure meant we learned a great deal of the historical background to the formation of Rajasthan and the part of the Maharana of…
Palace !,"In Udaipur, the palace is the heart of it. A beautiful grandeur structure giving us a peek into the life of the Maharaja's. If you really want to understand each and every section of it and the story behind, please opt for a guide. They charge starting from Rs 300 I believe and…"
Will maintained palace,"Palace is well maintained, though entrance fee is more 300 rs per adult, you can visit and you need to walk quite a distance, you have battery operated vehicles running at extra cost, once inside the palace you have to go through narrow and low roof passages, may be difficult…"
Nice,"We visited Agra,Jaipur,Udaipur,Delhi with my family (wife and 2 kids) in Christmas 2019 holidays and so visited this attraction during our stay in Udaipur.  City Palace is not as awesome as Agra Fort or Amer fort but it pleasant experience.  Roads in Udaipur are not that great…"
Difficult access with a car ,Best to take auto rickshaw if visiting this place. Impromptu one way road closures makes it harder to access with a car. Worth hiring a local guide if you enjoy a bit of history for Rs 450 but dont worry if you are only after a quick tourist attraction and selfie or twosie. 
It is must to visit,City of palace is the 2 best Palace after the Mysore Palace. It is a must visit place in Udaipur. There are variety of things you will get to know about Palace and Maharajas over there but you have to take a guide with you. It will be very easy for you to visit palace with the…
Impressive Palace ,"The enormous City Palace complex sits high on a rock, surveying the city of Udaipur and the lake. Part of the complex is hotel, part is royal residence and part is museum. Security is tight because of the royal aspect. We booked a guide who sorted the Palace tickets: booking…"
One time visit ,Visiting Udaipur city palace comes first in the sightseeing places and it’s worth the visit . It takes min 1 hr to quickly finish the tour and for a time is a good experience . 
Magnificent Architecture,"The City Palace is a must visit in Udaipur. It is one of the largest palaces in the state of Rajastan built on a highland overlooking Pichola Lake.  The views from the palace afford a panoramic view of the countryside and lake. The palace took over 350 years to construct and includes a number of palaces (something like 11 or 12) all built over a long period of time although you would never know it as all the architectural design is all in the same style. The palace complex has a number of towers and countless balconies that one can view other parts of the palace, the lake and the city of Udaipur. The structures have been well maintained and the grounds are in extremely superb condition."
Top Udaipur Attraction,"A must visit if you are in Udaipur, beautiful palace, seeped in history, well kept, good museum, excellent views of lake pichola and Udaipur city from the palace. We took a guide who helped us navigate key parts or palace/museum quickly, ideal for us with young kids.Ticket queues and queues inside the palace could definitely be managed better by administration. Road to palace is narrow, is not in great condition and traffic could be bad at times, only 5 minutes to Lake Pichola in a rickshaw, where you can take boat ride and enjoy brilliant views of the palace and hills around it.You can also take boat ride to Jag Mandir island from City Palace."
beautiful,"nice place , but quite huge for covering complete palace in less time need 3 hours and energy.with kids its really tough."
Crown of Mewar.,"Awesome Palace to visit, major attraction of Udaipur City where Current King lives.. When u'll go there, you'll be mesmerized by the royalness of Palace. It is divided i 3 portions 1. Royal Palace for visitors 2.Royal Palace for where Royal family lives 3. Shiv Niwas- Royal Hotel. There is also a beer bar in Darbar-e- Aam area. You can also purchase tickets from here for boat ride in Lake Pichola."
City Palace,"City palace is beautiful, the evening show could be better, the lights and sound show videos maybe are of some occasion. Only visit if interested from historical point of view."
A huge palace complex but no exhibits of palace furniture,"The palace complex is huge and visitors have good audio guide facility. The oldest part of complex is historical and interesting. However the latter additions do not add any charm to palace. In the absence of any furniture or decorations , the complex fails to make any impression."
City Palace Udaipur ,City palace is located right in the center of the city on a high ground from where you can have a majestic view of the whole city and Lake Pichola.But to reach the city palace needs a great effort as the lanes leading to palace are narrow and crowded. Taking your car is almost impossible. Best is to hire a Three wheeler Auto Rickshaw or go walking enjoying the market in the narrow lanes selling local Arti facts and street food.There is a nice cafe with a Bar inside the city palace.Nice food and drinks.
One of the largest Palaces in India!,"If you plan to trek till the palace it would take a while, but would be worth it! If you have senior citizens, then please take the golf cart ride. They charge for it, but worth it! They golf carts are run only till 5:00 p.m on the return. Do take a guide who can help you with the history and the artefacts, completely worth it. The grandeur of the palace would leave mesmerized."
A jewel in Udaipur,"An impressive structure, filled with beautiful art and brimming over with history.Definitely a must see attraction in Udaipur. The only downside was the crowds. We visited during the holidays, so the crowds were  larger than normal. (Lots of pushing, which wasn't too pleasant.)"
Rajastani treasure,"This palace had the musuem where we can see the works done by all mewar kings like udaisingh,rana pratap,sajjan singh,amarsingh etc.This palace is on the banks of lake pichola.We can see the nice view of the lake from the palace.It had display of paintings,silve items,ruins of rock sculptors etc."
City Palace Udaipur,Beautiful Palace and a must visit. The view of Lake Pichola behind is beautiful. Lot of history and is a must see place in Udaipur. You can see rooms with lot of miniature paintings and  windows with colored Belgian glass. Great photo ops. You can see the grandeur of Royalty.
Must place to visit  in Udaipur,"A very big palace on the banks of Lake Pichola. This palace (museum) is a must visit place in Udaipur. Though I have covered only some part of the museum due to time costraint, it was an good experience to see the palace. it needs around 3-4 hours to complete the palace visit."
Wow,City palace of udaipur is wow .what a structure it was lovely place great huge palace and I totally loved it wow and I love it
400 years old and steeped in history,"This beautiful palace over looks lake pichola, we had our Audley Guide with us who was very knowledgable about the history of this truly amazing palace, you will need about 2 hours here, interesting on how the kings of this era lived, "
#1 place to visit in Udaipur,Beautiful architecture palace which tells you the whole story of Udaipur for the past 400 years.  Highly recommend to hire a half day (minimum 2 hours) guide not just to tell you the hundred of years history of the palace but also as a guide as the place is huge with many…
"Why you should not miss this Palace, Read and Plan it better!","Udaipur City Palace is one of the architectural marvels of Rajasthan, located peacefully on the banks of Lake Pichola. Undoubdetdly, this is MUST to visit place in Udaipur.  Timings & Fees:  930 AM - 5:3 PM Adults : Rs 30 Child : Rs 15  Important Points :  1.  Duration 2.5 hrs - 3hrs 2. 3-4 important Udaipur tourist points are adjacent to the City Palace. So, if you start early, you can cover most of the places. 3. Near By attraction ( walking distance) - Jagdish Temple, Lake Pichola, Bagore Ki Haveli ( 7 PM dance show- details in my other review), Gangaur Ghat etc. 4. IMP: Guide is my strong recommendation. You will get them just before the main entrance of the palace will show themselves busy; however, if you reach early they will take your group alone.* Do not rely 100% on guide for information, do ask questions and history. They add a lot of spicy flavours and keep you engaged. * Guide's help you in taking the picture and getting you best picture spots. Check with them.* Keep your kids in front of the guide to listen about the history, they will really enjoy and feel proud about Indian rulers.* They help you in skipping the long queues by taking you from the short cut.*Don't pay the guide fees in advance. 5. If you reach early, you should be able to get good pictures. By 11 -2 PM the sun will be on TOP and make your pics dull. Again - start early. 6. You can start with Jagdish Temple in the morning and then reach to City palace by 9 PM ( 200 steps away). 7. If you are able to cover the City palace by 1 PM, plan your lunch at NATRAJ. BIG Auto will charge Rs 80-100. 8. If you plan to cover the CP in the second half of the day, then you can visit Bagore Ki Haveli ( MUST- MUST) show at 7 PM. Book your tickets online and read my review.  ** If this review is useful for you, please do hit the ""Helpful"" thumb below. My other Udaipur review ( link provided below) will help you to plan your trip better.**"
Beautiful,Beautiful palace. Budget three hours if you want to see the palace in detail. Dont miss seeing the old statues and paintainings at the government meuseum near the inner entrance. U will need to separately buy ticket for this meuseum
Beautiful palace ,"If you are someone who admires the heritage of Rajasthan, this is a definite place to visit. It’s intricate details and the history is so beautifully depicted. You have audio guide for just Rs. 200/- and you won’t be conned by guides who charge unreasonably. There are steep steps which could be a challenge for people with knee problem."
Not much to appreciate,A few photos and a lot of history.. nothing much but visit once just for tick mark.guides are bad..all of them want to attend foreign tourists only...
Udaipur City Palace Museum,"It is indeed all hype and sheer money making without real value to the tourists (Indian) India has many other forts and museums with much better value! Poor service, high costs, dilapidated condition, and just adds to Rs 9 lakhs per day to the current kings revenue! Someone did tell us that’s it’s a sheer waste of time but we didn’t heed - hope this review helps others!There is an entry fee - Rs 30/- per person and this is just for stepping inside the gates.Then there is an erickshaw @ Rs 50 per person to take you to the top of the road/ climb to the gates of the museumAt the museum, you need to buy individual tickets again which are Rs 300 per person to gain entry to the museum.As in most museums and forts, it is advisable to have a guide and when one goes about seeking a guide, it is very hard to get one here! It seems there is a cartel as most guides waiting at the gates, ignore Indian tourists and want only foreigners and no guesses here for why they do that!We started by complaining at the ticket counter- no one listened.we asked for a complaint register, they showed us the visitors book or gave us a plain paper. When we complained to Mr Sharma (the head of guides) and Mr Podwal (the administrative head of the Museum), Mr Arjun Singh Dhawad- no one cared! Each one of them kept on brushing responsibility to the other and obviously you are just one tourist and who cares? As a tourist you think why waste time and you move on. While we were complaining, there were 3 other families who wanted guides but couldn’t get any as the guides waiting would not come along with Indians! It is a very organised cartel and there is no one person who will take ownership of this! Each person or official we spoke to and we did speak to the people above and a few more, they cane, listened and just walked away! Any other country, they would be deeply ashamed but who cares here!"
Must visit! ,Very beautiful from outside. Museum is ok but worth 300 rs. . Lot of stairs inside museum so not good with babies and elders. Backside market is also good for handicraft.... Only one restaurant inside palace which is too costly so plan accordingly
A must see,We arrived early just before the crowds which we were thankful of as mid way it became very busy once people started arriving. The palace is vast and well looked after with sufficient written information throughout. We took 2.5 hours but you could easily spend 4 hours.
"Nice, but very crowded with no effective safety measures","I went to visit with a friend in December and the place was very crowded. We were informed that over 12,000 people were visiting that week due to the local national holidays. It was evident that there were no safety measures as there was no limit to the number of people who…"
Must visit when around Udaipur ,This is a must visit place for the people loving great architecture. Recommend this place for students

Overlooking the Pichhola lake and surrounded by beautiful scenic beauty, this palace stands…"
city palace Udaipur-Overrated,"One time visit is fine but palace is really not that grand as being made out. Good to explore the history but flamboyance is missing. Also toilets inside for ladies are absolute mess. Only for old memory sake, it is fine otherwise nothing much."
A must-see in Udaipur,"This is a beautiful palace complex. There is something awesome to gape at around every turn. Besides the palaces with their intricate and ornate marble and masonry carvings, there are “glass rooms” and beautiful wall paintings.There is also a museum worth seeing."
Royal Palace of Udaipur built on Lakeside,"City Palace Udaipur is a palace complex built over a period of nearly 400 years, with contributions from several rulers of the Mewar dynasty. The palace is located on the east bank of Lake Pichola and has several palaces built within its complex. It has a flamboyant style and is…"
Good palace. But very expensive ,The place is good and very well maintained.. But 300 for a ticket is too greedy. Should have been 100-150 instead. 
Just Majestic —City Palace of Udaipur ,Rock Solid Structure ...on the Banks of Lake Pichola ...Called the Palace ..just Majestic & Beautiful  ...built 400 years ago ...amazing architecture and what a vision the rulers of Mewar had then ..lots of small details were considered while planning and designing such a huge…
Crowded in December,"We visited the palace on a Saturday. It was a beautiful palace, but it was so crowded that we could not enjoy it, nor see any of the exhibitions. At one point they opened an emergency exit to reduce the large crowd trying to push through a very small door and exit."
Impressive Fort,This one is a must to visit. Very opulent design and intricate work. It does resemble other Rajasthani forts like Jaipur and Jodhpur but still offers its uniqeness. A must when in town.
Nice,It is a nice place to visit must visit this place when you visit Rajasthan you can explore Rajasthani culture over
Udaipur City Palace Visit,"Visited the Udaipur City Palace and loved the history and architecture.  Beautiful separate palaces for the King and Queen.

Rich History and beautiful trip worth visiting,"Visited the beautiful City Palace of Udaipur. Teeming with tourists, but able to spend quality time learning about history and culture. Well maintained palace complex."
Waste of time n money ,You can get best view of city palace from pichhola lake. Tickets were high priced. You can visit sajjangarh fort .. it is much better to visit there.
Beautiful place but crowded,"Visited the city palace and museum in the Christmas-New year period. My advice - PLEASE DONT.   The queues are ridiculous in this period. We had to queue for half an hour at multiple points in the palace and museum. Given the usual indian “respect” for queuing, we had multiple…"
"Magnificent, but scary when grossly over crowded","This is a magnificent Palace with lots of interesting architectural features, stunning views and some great art. However the safety issues relating to unrestricted number of visitors pressing through a labyrinth of narrow and often very low passages and stairways (endless signs…"
Big fort and museum,This is big fort and having museum with Marwad kings memories. Must visit place in Udaipur.. Good guide will tell history
Udaipur snippets ,"The city palace is a huge collection of grandeur , history and local culture. A must visit when u visit Udaipur "
A palace complex,"This is a huge palace complex built by several rulers from1553 AD onwards, started by MaharanaUday singh2 when he shifted his Capitol from Chittor to Udaipur. This palace complex consists of gateways,Amar mahal, Badi mahal,Bhim Bilas etc. It takes pretty 2to 3 hours to see…"
Outstanding Palace,The best and number tourist attraction spot.  Its located near Lake Pichola and palace has beautiful painting and Murals.   Come early before its really crowded. Check the rates and guides in the photos.   A must visit! 
Good palace with nice boat ride,"The palace is good, and the boat ride to the Jagmandir is scenic. We visited during the Christmas time and the palace was packed, over crowded and so we didn't enjoyed the tour much."
Very scenic from top of the palace.,Enjoyed coffee & cake in place cafe...quick & excellent service by staff @ cafe   Place is also clean and well maintained.  I  love to visit every year.
The Palace,"Nice Palace, well maintained. The ticket price is very expensive (300 adults & 100 kids) compare to other forts or palaces in Rajasthan. "
Great place to visit,One of the most interesting palaces because it has been lived in and well kept with many thing to see. Different from most other palaces and worth the experience.
"Skip the museum, it's not worth.","Better take the ticket for only entry to the complex(₹30). Museum (₹300)has nothing interesting unless you are a history enthusiast. Souvenir shop has reasonable price,and nice collection. Staff is rude,as if they are themselves Maharaja! Washroom was dirty. Avoid visiting on…"
palace to see,"its 1 of the palace to see in rajastan, they are maintaining well, as udaipur is city of lakes, u see this besides a lake, u can see the royalty of the kings life they lived in india,  obviously, if u r rich enough, like ambani or birla, u too can lead that life...small rooms…"
Gem of a palace,Well worth spending a couple of hours to explore this Palace away from the hustle of shop and street vendors. The maharaja definitely fared better than the maharini... 
A Palace which knows its worth,"One of the good things I realize this Udaipur City Palace is main attractions of city and palace keepers knows the worth. So they charge you a much higher price for entry to museum and the so called boat ride, and light and sound show.   It may sound ex-orbitant to local…"
Hearded like sheep,"Outside of the palace the grounds are well kept and looked after, very nice and enjoyable to walk around. Inside however, save your money and don't bother. It's crazy the crowds. Massive ques to get go single file through small doorways. You don't get a chance to look at the…"

Better from the outside,Beutiful from the exterior little less from the interior. More impressive palace/fortress is in example in Jodhpur as well as less crowded.
Excellent way to spend a few hours,"We really enjoyed our visit. It was fun to explore the palace and the decorative rooms were amazing. Very well preserved. Clean toilets, coffee shop, gift shops and photography studio available "
Lake Palace light show,It a beautiful show of lights and history of the story of the Raj pure. Its starts in the evening around 6 or 7 for an hour show. The tickets price is a bit high people coming from other part of the country.
Wonderful place,Nice palace capturing the essence of how life evolved over 4 centuries.  Great depiction of life in era of princely India.  Shouldn’t miss out to visit the splendor of maharaja age.
City Palace udaipur,A real good experience. The boat ride to Jagmandir is awesome. The sandwiches n coffee at restaurant in jagmandir was great.
Splendid palace,Must to keep a guide for visit. Guide will take 300 rs no bargaining but it is worth.Entry charge is 300 rs. It will take around 2.5 to 3 hours to see. Worth spending time here. Ticket window is closed after 4 pm.
A huge palace,"City Palace is huge though from inside it is comparatively smaller as some portion is just mountain covered with walls. Main attraction is Men's section alias ""Mardankhana"". The palace was constructed by the side of a huge lake & is sorrounded by hills. It is Udaipur's star attraction though the Jodhpur palaces are more lavish"
"If you only see one thing in Udaipur, the City Palace would be that one thing","City Palace is a palace complex that was the home of the former royal family of the ruling Merwar Dynasty. Nowadays, it’s basically a museum, with many of the rooms restored and opened up to the general public, while other rooms have been converted into exhibition spaces. The palace complex and many of the palaces within the complex look amazing. The Bada Mahal and it’s many glass mosaics are beautiful, as are many of the former royal apartments. The many bay windows and balconies are popular spots for photographs too because of not only the attractive designs, but also for the views.If you only see one thing in Udaipur, the City Palace would be that one thing."
Wonderful palace - an essential visit in Udaipur,Beautiful architectural building from the outside and glorious internal designs for the chambers of this royal palace. Enjoy !
Sunset boat trip,"Lovely thing to do on an evening take one of the boats from the banks by the palace,30 mins loads of lovely photos and a fabulous sunset."
Nice architecture,"Pleasant afternoon visit at the city palace. Go early to avoid crowds and take better pictures. We did the audio guide and it took more than 3 hours. The audio guide was ok, but the architecture and views were the hi-light. A must-do for udaipur. It seems like the guides have sell their tours themselves so they plug the tour guide option when you meet them."
Huge,"It's huge. Be ready to spend there at least 3-4 hours excluding the time for the surrounding. The main part is arranged the way that you can't skip anywhere but going in the line, so make sure you are not limited in time."
Must visit !,"There are 5 palaces adjoining together, built by Maharana Uday Singh. When you hear guide sharing the story about this place, I felt like a Queen. Its very touristy thou !!!"
Wow! Just wow!,"This is my first time in Rajasthan and I couldn’t have asked for a better place to start.. such a beautiful palace with intricate carvings, sculptures and amazing paintings. Everywhere I turn, there’s artwork that’s not to be missed. Stained glass windows, colonial era porcelain tiles, Persian-influenced glass & mirror inlay work, and the classic Indian temple style column and beam structure each carrying a uniquely carved motif. The paintings depicting contemporary lifestyle, battle scenes are a thousand times better than any movie you can watch in recent times! The audio guide enthralled us with fascinating epic stories of the royal family over the ages. Words, and definitely 10 photos can’t express how much I have to say about this magnificent landmark!"
Overrated,"While the place is actually an enormous palace, well maintained and in the middle of the city, your post-visit disappointment to this palace will be greater than your pre-visit excitement. The palace of course is royal, but so is its entry fee. INR 300 to enter a palace/museum? Seriously!!If you are expecting a museum with lots of artifacts, weapons, etc, you are at the wrong place. You have paid INR 300 just to see millions of photos/paintings lined up in never ending passages made within the palace. While you will see the guides & security guards extremely courteous and welcoming to the foreigners, their behavior is opposite towards local tourists. 15 mins in the palace, I started looking for an exit door to get out of that boring maze of photographs, but had to complete the entire marathon just to get out of the line of nerdy tourists. If you appreciate the beauty of the palaces of royal families and are interested to sip on some expensive drinks in a cafe between a crowd of foreign tourists, do visit this place."
Palace visit ,Lovely palace a bit run down in places. Audio is good to get helps you understand a bit more. Sections were closed when we were there. A lot of people probably better to go first thing in the morning
Absolutely beautiful!,"Appreciated the historical site, art and the elements of the palace, with breathtaking views of the city and lake. Tour guide helped take some artistic pictures using the mirrors in the palace. The palace can use restoration to bring up the true nature of the marble! Never the less it was worth the visit."
Brilliant piece of history,"Udaipur isn't just the city of lakes but also home to one of the most amazing palaces in the country. The City Palace is a spectacular piece of architecture and has stood the test of time since it's origins in the 16th century. It's surprisingly well maintained, but I guess it probably has to be when you have the direct descendant and the current King of Udaipur living in the palace next door. It's best to take a guided tour of the palace as there are so many things to learn about which you risk missing out on should you go solo. Be prepared to spend between 2 to 3 hours here if you're stopping to take plenty of photographs which I highly recommend. Point to note - it's not ideal for individuals with injuries or mobility problems as there are a lot of stairs and no wheelchair access."
Must visit attraction of Udaipur and India's 2nd largest palace for tourist,"must visit place of & No.1 place to visit during Udaipur visit, very well maintained and highly visited place by Indian & foreign tourist, need atleast 2 to 3 hours for knowing the history of Rajput's and lot of nice photo shoot locations"
Wonderful palace,"An interesting assembly of palace buildings developed over several centuries. The tour is extensive and involves a number of steps, with some excellent views across the Lake. Museum rooms have some interesting exhibits, including currently a comparative photo/art exhibition."
Enchanting,Despite it’s size this is an enchanting place with beautiful garden. While there visit the nearby Jagdish Temple. Chances are that you will witness a very lively service with lots of energizing clapping and singing. Quite a contrast with the mood at the nearby “popular soup” for the poor and homeless.
Udaipur lights and sounds show,"It's heavy on pocket and totally in English. If you are not a history enthusiast, and don't have excess money to waste, it is avoidable."
Worth the visit ,As it’s one of the main attractions. And worth getting a good Guide or yourl just be walking around in the not know
Anniversary trip,One of the best palace I have ever been to. It's royal palace belongs to descendents of Maharana Pratap. I love the garden inside the palace. You can have a great view of whole city from the palace. The ticket price could be lesser for domestic tourist.
Sound & light show of city palace,It's totally waste of money if you don't have any interest in history. I have seen most boring & expensive thing in Udaipur.
Glorious Palace near the beutiful lake,"There are many stuffs and very nice decorated rooms in the palace. And on the upper floor you can see the city view in one side and lake view in the other side. It serve who want to study histiry, culture, take photo and looking views of Udaipur city and famous lake."
Expensive !!!!!,We visited on month of November 2019. The city palace is not pocket friendly. Various entry fees for various things inside palace. If roughly calculated each adult person expense would be around ₹2500-₹3000 ( Indian Nationals). I would suggest just take the outside tour that’s more than enough. Attaching the price list of various activities and events inside the palace.
A must visit,Great place to visit. Will give a peek into the history of India. It is massive palace and requires 2 hrs or more to cover the whole palace. One recommendation- Hire a guide
Good ,The property is beautiful and clean. Musicians was interesting. Good manegmet and all is good .Thanks
Rude staff,The property is beautiful and worth to be seen but security is very rude and disrespectful  if you don’t have a guide.
Must visit,Palace of Palace - Udaipur City Palace. Must visit or without City Palace Udaipur trip is incomplete. One should keep sufficient time to enjoy. Good arrangement by department/ golf cart available but one ha to pay for it. Simply amazing and some part of Palace is also available for weeding/ events too.
A royal recap of History of Mewar visiting the Palace,The rich history of Mewar can be relived once one visit here..It is prime most attraction of Udaipur..During our 3 days of stay at Udaipur..we start our sightseeing with City Palace..the royal Architecture..awesome city view and Lake Pichola view..various collections in different rooms and Gallery is just mesmerising..One must have some time in hand to explore this palace..Audio guide facility also there ..to understand the place very well..The light and sound show in evening is worth to watch to understand the rich history of The capital of Mewar..Udaipur..
Not good experience,We went at this place with lots of good expectations but found every thing reverse of it. Food was triable and recepction people was very careless.
A Spectacular Representation of royal History of India.,"This Magnificent Palace Ia the Second largest in India. Beautiful Palace so much history ,so beautifully maintained & Facinating Visit with the place is right in the heart of udaipur city overlooking the lke. It was great to see conservation and repair work during our visit. It is such a Massive comple steep with centuries of history .One can spend Hours in this palace and imagine the lives of royalities in the past."
Wort visiting but do not keep high expectations,"If you have visited city palace of Jaipur.....do not compare this with city palace of Udaipur :)Both are way differentTo enter palace there nominal fee of 30/- per person for adult and then to enter museum it is 300 pp with camera. This is major attraction here. There are other museum like crystal and vintage car etc..for which rates were around 700there is also boating from city palace 500/- in the mrng and 800 in the evening..15min ride in lake pichola. To know which ride I took read my other reviews :)moving ahead....,,its is all photography place...if you like photography  views from city palace is awesome. To know history you can hire guide or take audio assistance But I didnt take guide cause I already read about it and also this was more photography tour for me.it took me 2hrs to complete city palace tour with museum...people take more than that it also depends on where you spend more time...there are tiny road, gallis ..and high stairways inside the palace to go from one point to other.I would not recommend this place for orthopedic patients who has knee problems...november being beginning of the tourist season  you will find many groups inside and you need to find your way out from them...loudly talking guides , corporates groups, tours and travel groups all in one place everyone wants to click same frame ,same spot...gets little chaotic but fine..there are places in between where you can sit and relax under tree :)there is restaurant in the campus. ...but dont forget to carry water bottle and some energy bar when you go there....its little hectic to once you start the inside tour. It is very huge place and you must love walking :)Also there is electric car/golf car available from gate to inside of city palace can save you 3/4 km walking. :)Overall good sightseeing point as this is the biggest city palace :)"
A must visit place,"Dec 25 afternoon: This is a magnificent palace and no reviews are required for this place. Amazing architecture, beautiful rooms, paintings, views and what not. The only thing is that it's quite a big palace including the museum and if you are with kids, it can be tiring. The palace has been maintained quite nicely with proper toilet facilities as well. The view of the lake Pichola is also very pretty."
India trip,"The Palace is well worth a visit , although not quite as impressive as the forts at Jaipur and Jodhpur .However the tour is still very interesting and the boat trip on the lakes makes for a very pleasant finale."
"City Palace, Udaipur","I have visited City Palace, Udaipur on 18th Nov with lot of hope of amazing royalty, however it turn out to be average experience, as most of places are either restricted for public or gas seperate ticket like Crystal Gallery ticket of Rs 700, Musesum ticket of Rs 300.Even Lake Pichola boating ride ticket is Rs 500 that is over-prized as compared to Rs 220 ticket price at Fateh Sagar Lake for same duration.Overall City Palace, Udaipur is only for Elite classes and is not meant for General Public."
Don't forget the audio guide,A good guide makes all the difference. In this case the audio guide was very useful and informative. You can spend a whole day here are the Palace is enormous.
visit to City Palace of Udaipur,Only part of the Palace is maintained and converted as a museum and public are allowed to visit.   Other parts are rented to hotels and the current heirs of the erstwhile king also stays in a portion.   Good place to visit to see the heritage and valour of the Rajput kings.
Most visit if in udaipur,If you are Udaipur don't forget to visit here . It is beautiful words are less to describe it's beauty . A beautiful place to feel relaxed and good .
A nice place. ,City palace is jus wonderful and amazing architecture of Indian history. Beautiful place with good maintenance. Museum is very nice.  They have tourist guide at entrance but don’t think that much necessary to having a guide.   And to take visit at Jagmandir you have to buy…
Visit to City Palace,"The palace was constructed by Maharaja Jai Singh II. It reflects the fusion of Mughal and Rajput Architecture.  The palace complex has several buildings, various courtyards, galleries, restaurants, and offices of the Museum Trust. The Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II Museum Trust…"
Picturesque setting with boating opportunities,"Suggest that you take a boat just before sunset to enjoy the lights of the palace, hotels and homes as the light up the city.  It's very relaxing and a great way to appreciate all the properties that are located on the lake."
Maximum coverage shortest time,Udaipur beautiful city of lakes and palaces a must visit... cable car in the evening gives a beautiful view of the city and its lakes
Experience ,As it's been a historical place.. Very crowded. But till they have well maintained.. Lots of changes.. As I have been after a very long time back.   There is no free parking space alloted.But pay and park is available inside.
Beautiful setting,"Udaipur was our last stop of an 8 city Rajasthan private tour and the City Palace was our first stop.We took a golf buggy up to the entrance, I would recommend this for anyone with walking difficulties.  It was a Saturday and very busy, we already had our guide for the day Abi and he was so informative and told us lots about the Palace.  I had researched before leaving the UK but it was worthwhile as he explained about the paintings and how they depict stories which we would never have known.There is a lot to see, paintings, armoury, weapons, musical instruments,  a silver gallery beautiful mirrored walls and stained glass and fabulous views of the lake. Part of the Palace is now a hotel and another part still occupied by the royal family, we managed to catch a glimpse of a princess as she passed in a car.You can buy tickets within the Palace grounds for the boat rides on the lake, we wanted to go in the afternoon so paid 800 INR, this ride also took us to Tag Mandir island where we disembarked and enjoyed a drink and admired the Palace from a different perspective and of course watched the magnicficent sunset."
Holiday ,"The City Palace Udaipur is a must see destination.The guides will hound you before you actually get into the palace. In my opinion you don’t need to go to the expense of hiring one, and although they claim to be the cheapest and better value than the audio tour, they’re not"
OverRated,Very expensive and overrated place. Also lot to walk due to old design.Avoid while with kids due to large crowds
Highlight of Udaipur,"Allow at least 2 hours, consider hiring a guide for Rs450.  Our tour lasted 1-3/4 hours. Lots of history."
Huge flight of stairs but worth a visit to the musuem,It costs only 30₹ to walk through the palace grounds down to the water and enjoy some peace and quiet. The ticket is valid all day so you can walk through as many times as you like.  However you pay 300₹ for a full ticket to go into the museum which is totally worth it with the…
Lovely walk for 30₹,You can pay 30₹ to walk through the palace grounds down to the water and enjoy some peace and quiet. The ticket is valid all day so you can walk through as many times as you like. Don't pay for a full ticket if you don't intend to go into the museum.
Royal palace ,This place gives an indication of how the kings use to live at old times. The walls and windows have beautiful architecture. Tickets are bit expensive but its worth the experience. 
A MUST ....with a informed guide and then do the Crystal Museum,"This was ALIVE - our guide explained so much from the entry to the doors, to the sati rituals, to the painting with the camel hairs, to the wedding customs and the history of the place.  We loved the colours and decor of the different rooms.  When you have finished have a coffee…"
Run of the mill kinda place ,Visited here early morning to avoid crowds. Its nice enough to visit but after visits to so many of these places I got fed up as this was my last. Great information in every room but not for me
OMG!!!,"A lot of stairs but this is worth the trip! Beautiful Myrano glass work,  beautiful mirror and cut glass work! The little rooms are beautiful with painting and paintings!"
Good,"Nice place to visit, there is museum also inside the city palace and that's also good but its expensive, nice city view from palace, shopping options are also available but again expensive,"
One time visit,"To see the grandeur of the royals of Mewar, it is a good one time visit. The sound and light show in the evening might be disappointing if you are expecting laser lights. It's a theatrical performance through sound and basic lights, basically. Might be boring for some."
Best lake view hotel ,One of the best lake facing hotel in udaipur.  It's a heritage look. Nice staff. Rooftops top restaurant is superb
Hoary fort palace at Udaipur ,Fascinating fort cum palace of the Mewar dynasty.. filled with history..! One can get a perspective of what life would have been during the difficult times of invasions and defence. Maharana Pratap stands out in his valour and courage
Beautiful Palace,Well worth a stroll around. Get in early as it gets really busy. Beautiful rooms and exhibits etc. Good views across the city and lake.
Welcome to Mewar- Extremely Beautiful Palace,"It is at walking distance from Lake Pichhola.   Take an auto if you don't want to walk. If you're with a car, park it at government approved parking place at Rs 20 for 3 hours. Charges to park inside palace premise in Rs 300. Ticket price inclusive of camera charges-Rs…"

City palace ,Wow.. Rajwada personified.. I was amazed to know about Maharana Pratap. The man with honour and pride. We saw the museum as well and saw lake pichola
Shops in City palace.,City palace Udaipur is must visit place. But the shops inside which the guides claim that they are NGO run is false. They are complete rip off. I unfortunately paid a very heavy price for a saree which was torn. Next day went back to change and I experienced complete changed attitude from the seller had to literally raise my voice to get the saree changed as i had paid 10000/- for the same. Please beware don't fall for the sweet talks of Guide.
'Must see' experience,Great place to visit but it can get jammed by tour parties and school children in the tight corridors and upper rooms.
Go early to get to good seats,"The show is beautiful curated, just go in advance to get good seats and to avoid Q.It was entertaining."
Great tourist attraction ,A great tourist attraction lots of information and history. We had a tour guide who was very helpful.
What a disgrace !,"The most hefty entrance fees on my trip in India. You pay for everything separately. And with cards you have to stand in line multiple times. Then the service was the most unfriendly I have come across. Just to access one of the sights, the Crystal Palace you pay 700 rupees (Indians too which is a shame) and then you can look at a lot of crystal. But you actually have to hand in your mobile phone. What a discourteous treatment. Shameful. And then the Crystal items are displayed behind very dusty greasy windows. And some of the biggest chandeliers  in India. But just one of three was switched on. The estate is saving in all the wrong places I guess. Just walk around the grounds for 30 rupees and give the rest a miss I would suggest"
Huge ,"Lot of walking needs to be done, can be tiring for senior citizen.boating part was very good.but quite expensive."
Beautiful palace,Beautiful palace with an interesting history. I would recommend hiring a guide though as otherwise it's easy to wander around without really appreciating what you are seeing.
A class apart,"The city palace at Udaipur is a class apart. The murals, the wall paintings, the collection in the museum, the beauty of lake Pichchola..all take you down the saga of the Rajput valour and grandeur. The crystal gallery in the adjacent Fateh Prakash Palace is not to be missed.…"
Fantastic place to visit,"Very, Very large historical fort. You will need a local guide to get the most from this tour. Excellent views a camera a must"
Good experience ,Good experience with udaipur  For food I am always preferred Grasswood cafe and for visit so many places available 
A must do attraction,"We did the palace attractions over two separate days; just doing the Crystal gallery at sound and light show on one day and then the palace museum and boat ride the following day.Personally I though the crystal gallery was overpriced and the palace museum underpriced but together they balanced out.We spent 3 hours in the palace museum and could have spent another hour but then my wife and I like to look at everything. The Peacock Court was quite something to behold. Also displaying the chair from the Durbar which the then Maharana did not attend was a lovely touch.The items in the crystal gallery are incredible and I cannot imagine there could be such a collection of crystal glass furniture anywhere else in the world.The boat ride enables you to see the buildings from different angles but Jagmandir was disappointing in itself (understandably the best bits are enjoyed by residents at the hotel) but the views back were good.I would certainly do the museum before the sound and light show as if you are new to the history of Mewar and the dynasty, the history told by the show will be easier to follow."
Interesting but lots of walking ...,"Visited with a guide, which actually I think might have been more hindrance than help. They have audio guides here and I think this would have been a better option for us, allowing us to tailor the visit to our preference. This is a very beautiful palace and there is plenty to see and of course, there is much history attached to it as well. I would say it's definitely worth visiting, although I found it quite tiring with a guide, as there was barely a pause between one area and the next."
Too hyped,Over prized entry..without guide is waste. The electric car service is laid back as no coordination.old age and people with knee pain pls avoid. Lot of walking and high steps.  Palace is good for someone who is interested in history however frankly there is nothing much to see or do here for the price charged.
Superb Architecture!!!,"So I went to City palace today and it was the best experience in udaipur, a really well maintained and groomed place. There were horses which was very fascinating and the architecture was amazing and I really loved the way the palace was built."
Must See place,"One of the major attraction of Udaipur is city palace, located in center of city and close to Jagdish temple. You can drive your car in narrow street to reach to palace. Parking charge is 350 apart from entry ticket. Walkthrough visit will take ~1.5h."
Udaipur trip,Nice museum to showcase old dynasty glimpse. Lot of walking and narrow passage inside museum.  Good view if lake pichola and other places. Boat ride is very good and you can stop at jag mandir for photos and food. Food is costly but good  taste. Not much inside museum.
Well maintained Palace and must visit sight in Udaipur,"City Palace is one of the must visit sight in Udaipur. It was built by Maharana Udai Singh II in 1553 on the banks of Lake Pichola and it acted as power centre of Mewar kingdom with Udaipur being capital. It is one of the largest royal complex in Rajasthan. The palace has many museums and restores best kept secrets of Mewar Kingdom. It is finest example of Rajput arts and culture. It has witnessed to Hollywood movie- 'Octopussy' and Bollywood movie-Guide and many others. The City Palace takes you to wonderful trip down the pages of history with architectural genius and rich heritage. It houses heritage hotels, restaurants, crystal gallery and a school."
The palace is beautiful,"The palace is really a beautiful thing to witness with the backdrop of Lake pichola and huge structures of the palace.But the fees are quite high.To summarize the whole thing: Rs 30 just to enter the propertyRs 250 if you want to park your car inside the Palace area ( remember: Gate to Parking: hardly 5 min drive but it's elevation)In Rs 30 you can enjoy and click pictures across the Palace except the Museum area.Rs 300 additional if you want to visit museum and click pictures there. ( For History lovers, else please enjoy the outside and gardens in Rs 30 )Rs 350 additional if you want to see the light and sound show at 7pm evening. ( Not recommended )"
A Historians Delight,History comes alive at this place. We really enjoyed our tour of the palace as well as the light and sound show. It's advisable to hire a guide while taking a tour of the palace. Please don't miss the light and sound show. It's amazing.
A spectacular representation of India’s living history ,Make sure you give yourself plenty of time to see the City Palace. At every turn there are more beautiful details to take in from delicate marble carvings to somewhat garnish Venetian glass insets. This is really a place to be savored over time. I’d encourage you to arrive in the morning immediately upon opening and start ahead of the tour groups if possible. The walkways and staircases can be very narrow and if you get caught between large groups it can be slow going. Be sure to pause and look out at the beautiful lake and city views too. In addition to being part of India’s amazing history it is also the continuous residence of the royal family and it is incredible to think that this is someone’s home.
"City Palace,Udaipur.","I have been to City Palace,Udaipur many times. Udaipur is the most picturesque kind of city in Rajasthan also called Lake City and Whiye City.City Palace is standing high on the bank of lake Pichola,man made lake.Inside the palace there are many more things to see like photo gallery,mirror palace,dancing courtyard etc."
Must Visit,"A must visit when you travel to Udaipur,  well organized staff and very simple to follow although taking services of a guide is recommended to get insights to the history of the place etc."
Great architecture.,Very old history and great architecture.Very well maintained. It is clean and tidy. Must visit at this place.
What a monument!,"It is a must visit place in Udaipur for any tourist. Take a cab to the palace. If you take the back entrance,  there is an additional charge of Rs. 30/-. Plus,  you may have to take a golf cart to reach the palace as it is a 700 metre inclined walk.  If you take the front entrace,  you are saved both. Pl take a guide,  it helps understand the whole place. It will take you around 2 hours to complete the tour. If you have someone elderly who can't climb stairs,  then there is a lift/elevator available for that person but then that person will miss visiting 70% of the palace.  Totally,  one has to climb around 200/250 steps while navigating through the palace.  There is a boat ride available @Rs.300/400 per head (Rs. 800 per head) after 2 pm which lasts for 1 hour. It takes you to a place called jagmandir- an island housing a temple,  park and a restaurant. I did not take the boat ride so can't comment on its worth. Also the charges indicated for the boat ride may have a margin of error of 15% as i wasn't paying attention since i did not want to do the boat ride. The ticket for entering the Palace is Rs. 300 per head.  But it is totally worth it. There is a souvenir shop located at the end of the palace where you get local stuff like sarees,  dress material,  kurta material,  scarfs etc which is exceptionally good.  The charges may be a bit higher as most of the foreigners buy stuff from the shop. But i think it is worth it. Photography is allowed inside the palace and the palace is an outstanding piece of art. In the evening there is a light and sound show and the ticket bought in the morning is valid in the evening too.  Of course you can't enter the palace but the show is conducted outside thr maim palace,  on the palace lawns. I heard that it isca nice show. I did not attend it though. Toilet facility is available at two places - that is at both ends of the palace. It is a big thumbs up from tourist's perspective. You get an insight into the kives of the kings who have stayed there."
Ticket per person too expensive however amazing palace,"Huge,Vast and expensive..The management need to work to improve visitor's experience.It must be renovated ."
Another money grab for rich people who don't want to work,"So this is the Maharana's palace but being a Maharana isn't as profitable as it was in the old days when you could simply tax everyone.  Nowadays if you wanna be a Maharana you may have to turn part of your family palace into a hotel, another part into a museum and live in the last part.  This is one of those arrangements.The museum is fine.  It has a boring silver exhibit and a boring clothing exhibit.  You can wander around and see how the Maharanas kept their women behind screens, covered in heavy jewels and getting wheeled around on wheelchairs because the jewelry was so heavy they couldn't get around.  If I were a woman I would find these displays absolutely ghastly.  The fact that these same anti-feminine values are still rampant in India makes me wish that these displays would be used to help fix the problem - not romanticize it.Anyways - as far as palaces go it's fine.  Go see it - what else are you in Udaipur for?"
"Take a guide, you will need it. Worth a visit","Hinge place. Lots of rooms, corridors and loads to see and photograph. Great views from the top and if you take a boat trip you can get good pictures from the lake. Between the palace and the lake is an excellent coffee house. Can't recall the name.  There are museum's  and art galleries in the fort. Probably need about 3 hours to take it all in."
Expensive entry - very less to explore,"The Raja’s are still squeezing the taxes from the people/ tourists by way of entry fee. The access to the palace for tourists is few areas and halls. Those are also not maintained well. Some of the exhibits are very interesting but those are imported or gifted by other kingdoms/ countries. More than half of the palace is occupied by Raja family for residence and hotels, out of which gives revenue to the Raja’s family. Other near attraction is vintage cars, which is not at all worth for the price of ₹400 per person. This shows, the rulers continue looting people, from ages."
Extremely Interesting ,This palace goes on forever. Not once did we get bored. So much to see and learn. Highly recommended.
Amazing,Just amazing nice place and very neat and clean city people are cooperative but needs to attention when you are out.
No longer charge camera fees,Well I have seen a lot of forts in the past two months and this is among the top ones. It is smaller inside but different and a lot better preserved. The costs seemed to have been kept at 300 rupees with no additional charge for cameras. Just dont use flash. I used the audio…
Grand and Rich,Has an awesome history. Guided tour is a must to know about the rich history and details of the fort museum. Our guide Mr Krishna Das was a fabulous guide.  It's a must at visit.  Needs a lot of time. Though guided tour is of 1 hour. But u can see and take pictures and absorb…
One of the main reasons to visit Udaipur,"One of the main reasons to visit Udaipur.  Extensive tour within the palace,  A good guide is essential."
Revisit to the Luxurious life of the Kingd,The palace is huge and very beautiful. It displays all the things from olden days. The palace was renovated a multiple times where new Chambers were added by the king's. It oversees Lake Pichola and is very beautiful
Great place to visit,Fascinating place filled with interesting art and artefacts. Central portion built round a mountain so no windows😮.  It involves a lot of walking around narrow corridors so not ideal for those with mobility difficulties. The last Maharani was paralysed after falling from a…
Historical Adventure,"Symbol of Rajout pride. Massive structure well preserved for posterity. Can be made more interesting with relics from past. Light and sound show very interesting , worthspending the time"
City Palace ,"Wonderful place to visit , lots of interesting history , I recommend the city palace museum tour , we used the audio guide but there are tour guides on hand as well , make sure you get an accredited guide who has identity to show you , the cost was 330 rupees for the museum and 200 tipped for audio guide"
Huge ,"Really big and beautiful place to visit, enjoyed a morning here and a reasonable 300RS to enter. Had to leave earlier that hoped because of circumstances but enjoyed time there"
Udaipur ,"Potentially this place is lovely for the tourist, it is very beautiful, has some great restaurants, bars..... personally though beyond  I could not really see much that differed from others tourist towns in Rajasthan, in offering of tacky clothes and mock antiques.  I may well have missed some things in the 5 days. Fort, boat trip was dull unless you like forts and castles etc.Recommend the the walking guide with Umish and some of the lanes with silver smiths and jewelers are beautiful."
The no 1 place to visit in Udaipur,The City palace is well maintained and a lot of things to see here. Takes a couple of hours. A guide is a must to get the best out of your visit.
