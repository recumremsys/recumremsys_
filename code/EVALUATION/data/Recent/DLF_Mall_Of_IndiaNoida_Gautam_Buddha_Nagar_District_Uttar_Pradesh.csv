"Pretty huge, medium to high end shopping and a vast food court on top.",I go here every couple of weeks. There is plenty to eat at the food court on top (along with pvr cinemas where I usually grab a movie). Most brands are available here which gives you plenty of options to shop in every price range. You can easily spend a couple of hours here.

"Biggest Mall of India, Best of Delhi NCR","This is perfectly a destination Mall, where you can go just for the sake of Malling. A notch above other Malls, someone may find it a bit expensive, however, if you really want to buy quality goods, spend quality time or simply want to roam, it is one of the best places in Delhi NCR."
Shopping ,It's a good place to visit and you can get everything under one roof. Parking is in the basement and no problem to find parking. There are lifts from the car park to the each floor. There are many international branded stores in this Mall. Many food joints on the top floor. Same time there is games  arcade towards the top floor which can keep the kids and grown up busy for long time. It was good experience for our visit to the Mall.

Best Mall in NCR.,"Great collection of stores for shopping, Excellent Food court & variety of fine dining restaurants....along with a set of super Movie theaters , makes DLF Mall of India a great destination mall."
"Great Mall, Great Collections","You will find great collection of shops and food options with fine dining restaurants as well as food court, in this mall located on just starting of Sector 18 Noida. There are lot of entertainment options starting from PVR to Kids game zone, ice zone, etc. Only downside is parking and traffic en route to reach the mall, considering the footfall. You can however park in multilevel parking of Noida Authority across the road. Else use of Ola/ Uber may be recommended."

Wide variety of brands .Many activities, smaash ,funcity, snowworld, pvr all available.Food court is good and huge . Only card payments at food court or u take a swipe card and load cash in it.

A lot of brands both for apparels and food,DLF mall of noida is filled with brands and a great movie theatre the pvr. We love visiting here.

However, if you really want to enjoy, avoid on weekends due to rush for parking as well as it‚Äôs very crowded.Enjoyment is for all age groups from kids to senior citizens. Many international brands for shopping and many choices for food to from Punjabi to Italian etc. This is the right season to visit due to SALE at almost every store."
DLF Mall Visit,Best Mall in Noida to Visit. Around 500 meters from Noida Sector 18 metro station. Ambiance is very good. Lot of brands are available.

Great & full mall of NCR Delhi at NOIDA,"I bought 3 piece suit clothes from DLF Mall of India,NOIDA for Rs.13000 which was very suitable & best choice of mine. Other all goods are available at one place(Mall)."

The Best Mall in Noida,"Good restaurants, every possible brand outlets and a perfect place to watch movies. I visited Mall of India thrice to cover every aspect of the mall. I mean it‚Äôs better than the GIP. Would strongly recommend it."
Great place with great experience üëç,"The mall is one of the best place to go out for shopping, eating, activities,get together etc... you can go there for anything..awesome experience in every way possible."
Best Mall in Noida,Good selection of stores restaurants. International brands as well as Indian ones. Excellent restaurants.
good one,DLF Mall of India is the largest shopping mall offering the best price shopping in Noida. It is the place to visit in Noida where anybody can make fun and shop ...
A lot of brands and restaurants,This mall is awesome in terms of brands as there are a lot of options for medium to high end budget. Stores are usually crowded and you have to wait in queues outside changing rooms or billing counters during sale but things are mostly returnable or exchangeable during sale.
Great place for shopping,All popular brands are available here. Great place for shopping and dining with family. Kids enjoy a lot here.
Best shopping mall,"Best place for shopping garments, shoes,home decor and all others of daily need,with best eating joints extra"
A visit to The Mall of India,"It is one of the largest malls.everything under one roof from varied dining to shopping, Truly it is a mall of India. All brands are represented."
Great Mall for shopping and food,"Of course this is a great mall and is always packed on weekends. The mall has sections divided by colors for the ease of identifying places. The mall has some of the top brands such as Brooks Brothers, Tumi, Charles & Keith etc. The mall also has good places to buy not so expensive items such as Store 99, Miniso. And home center to suit variety of requirements.If you are going on a weekend after 11 am or something, there is low chances that you will get a parking. I usually used to park either in the new multi level parking that they have made opp to mall or even at Gardenia mall opposite to it and then walk to the mall. The mall has some great places to eat such as Pizza Express, Burma Burma and many others and of course Theos for some lovely deserts.All in all a great place to visit."
All brands in one place,"Mall of India is a pretty big mall of all possible brands that you can think of. You have fashion, home decor, culinary and skin care that you can think of. One problem is that the mall doesn't have short term luggage towing facility. This is probably a basic necessity that all malls should have to help travellers."
"Mall is quite good, but parking sucks!","Parking here is a nightmare. Parking attendants are absolutely clueless. The mall management shuts the parking deliberately on every weekend & creates a jam on the road.. asking people to park in a separate multilevel parking across the road! There is not facility for old people or toddlers.. the parking attendants are not sensitised about it either!Last Sunday, we waited for 20 minutes outside the mall with a toddler just because the parking was ‚Äútemporarily shut‚Äù. All this while, we could see cars leave the mall in droves.. However, the attendants didn‚Äôt let anybody in! Not even senior citizens or people like us with toddlers! Eventually, we went in after about 30 minutes and there were at least 200-odd empty spots inside! I was astounded by the needless harassment we had just endured and I feel that the mall should be fined heavily by the Noida authority for unnecessary creating bottlenecks on public roads, especially when the parking had a lot of spare capacity at that point! Just for the parking troubles alone, we have to say a pretty decent mall is getting ruined due to poor planning and lack of empathy!"
Big Fun Place,Very near to the Great GIP Mall Of Noida it‚Äôs the new Fun Place in NOIDA!...Needless to say that it house all Famous International Brand names and a very Good PVR Cinema.Good Location near to Metro Station.... Good Parking facility!... Very easily accessible from two Sides of the road!... The mall has some Innovative Playing area for Kids!
Very good mall,It's very big and nice mall of noida . Here decathlon is there can all types of the sports accesories
Shopping,"Went there to shop to take advantage of the seasons sale. Well organised and the mall maintained its quality which was missing in Noida. One had to visit Select in Saket, glad DLF did a good job"
Great premium Western Style Mall,"All major brands are here. Tommy Hilfiger, GAP, Nike.Also Premium Swiss Watches: TAG Heuer etc.Some restaurants are also Western Style, Such as Nando's. If you dont have stron stomach this is really a good option instead of Hotel Restaurant."
Wonderful mall. Most relaxing. Gives u wide variety of Merchandise to choose from. N,LWonderful mall. Most relaxing. Gives u wide variety of Merchandise to choose from. I love being theRe even for cup of coffee
Happening Place in heart Noida,"It is one of the best place to hangout , it has all the global brands with good variety to choose from. The mall has openess in it & which make it better than other malls.One of the issue is the parking due to which i refrain going but overall good place to roam around & have good food"
Such a lively place!,The mall is really big. You will find a number of international and national brands. There is a funcity on the top floor for kids to enjoy. Huge parking.
Still okay to go,"The mall is still the favourite haunt of delhites, good for shopping, trying different cuisines or just to laze around, i always get my parking in lowermost basement even if i reach at 11 AM, this is what irritates me, funny indifferent management"
"DLF MALL, NOIDA",Excellent mall with branded shops with quality goods for shopping and good environment for spending time.
For dinner,Swagat restaurant is good for eating. Parking is good . Dal special swagat wonderful. Fun city is excellent in DLF mall for kids. You will enjoy
A Rich Mall of Noida,"This place has quality of brands, Cinema and a fun play area for kids with food court.Brands available here are of top level.Good for window shopping."
Awesome mall,"It's one of the kind mall where you will found most of the brands along with awesome food court.bon weekends, it's little bit crowded as everyone wants to visit this mall only. Highly recommended"
We went for lunch,"This is the best mall of of Noida..easy parking.all shops brand available..but please make sure you take snap when you park your car otherwise when you come back you can't find your car easily.thye have red,pink,blue and many more colour  zon"
"DLF Mall of India, NOIDA","Visited the Mall once again on 04 Oct 2019. Its as good or better than I visited earlier. Quality of shops and brands is very attractive. Its a huge mall and it is difficult to find/ locate the desired shop without any help. I had visited Reebok, Adidas, Nike, Decathalon, etc. Ultimately found what we were looking for.The food at Vango on 03 floor was excellent."
Mall of India,"Seen many Malls, but there is a magnetic pull in the mall. There is a feeling of warmth around. Pin to elephant everything under one roof.Name it and you get it. Good restaurants to suit all pockets. Cleanliness is being maintained. It does need a visit and then it keeps pulling you ."
One stop labels shop,"Bring all Indian and global brands under one roof, add amazing cafes,provide parking, happening restaurants andConcierge service !"
Great place for shopping kids and food,"I would advise not to visit this place on weekends because:1. Entry and exit is mismanaged and may take 30-45 mins reaching to parking. Also parking is like a maze so better remember your parking spot2. Average waiting time for lunch in most of the restaurants is 30mins. The food court is overcrowded and you may find difficulty to get a table. Most of the food counters are having long queues taking another 30mins3. The kids play area is overcrowded having very little moving space. Also there is waiting time on rides and games4. There are long queues in big stores like Lifestyle, Pantaloons, big bazaar etc.Overall cleanliness is good and it is beautifully designed with most of the high end brand showrooms. Lots of variety in food and beverages. Entertainment section also has good variety. Overall a complete package for all age groups to visit this mall."
Adventure sports,"This mall has nice adventure sports including zipline, skiing,sledging. Is India largest snow adventure park in the mall. I am always stoked to go in a snowing amusement park with a ticket of only Rs1150 per head."
Amazing selection of shops and restaurants ,This may be the biggest mall in delhi ncr region.   Wonderful option if you want to optimize shopping in one location.    Amazing selection of shops and restaurants‚Äî-all types and price points.
Bad food,I ordered spicy Bangkok bowl with sticky rice. The food was of sufficient quantity. But the taste wasn't good at all. It was too salty due to the excess soya sauce in it. Imagine eating rice with soya sauce and bits of veggies thrown in. It was not worth 579 rupees. Seating was good. Staff were great. Food rating 5 out of 10. Mango mule drink was ok ok.
"Great brands, good entertainment and multiple food options",This place gives it all from the top most brands for shopping to some amazing entertainment options for kids as well as adults and when you are exhausted it allows for some variety of food options too. It's huge and the only thing to be mindful of is your parking slot number. Else it's tough time find your car back after you are done with roaming in the mall.
Went shopping,This was my first trip to Mall of India and I was impressed. It's huge and busy yet so clean and cool inside. It has separate floors for separate things so it's easy to navigate. There's information kiosks to guide you. Many international and local brands shopping.
a day well spent in dlf mall,I would highly recommend visiting this mall once if u are in noida. The infrastructure is really good and i love the ambience there. People from good families come there. Its a bit expensive mall but u can buy decent amount of stuff during discounts.
Best place to hop and shop,"Definitely the five star place to feel comfortable and relaxed while shopping, dining and entertaining yourself at weekends."
Massive!!,"The mall is massive! Been here twice now and I must say that it is quite busy regardless of the day you're visiting. The food court especially is packed Lot of options, a great one to visit."
Always the place to hang out!!,This is one of the places for people in Ghaziabad and Noida to hang out. Aggregation of all top brands with great deals makes it a must do option. The food court is decent and the assortment of restaurants is simply amazing!! Best part is the kids game zone and Hamleys play zone for kids. Kids have a gala time here. Great family outing destination.
Goons of SBI card and American Express harass customers,"As the title indicates, these goons ambush you while you are walking, block your way and cause embarrassments in forcing you to see their literature. They are mannerless and have scant regards for ladies or elders. ABSOLUTELY SHAMEFUL! Have complained twice to the management, but they have done nothing and are helpless.SBI and American Express have reached a state where they now  resort to such deplorable conduct to sell their cards. These goons should be thrown out of the mall. Ruined our evening."
Impressive,"Many popular stores, along with many restaurants, and lesisure land at the top with Snow World. It's huge with much to see."
DLF Mall of india is a proud thing for people of noida,"DLF Mall of india is ..i guess the best place in noida. its something to be proud of amongst people of noida. it has fun games, food court and all expensive brands. i love to shop from zara and H and M alot . its a cool place to hangout for girls nd guys. i had fun with my best friend there .."
One of the Best Mall in NCR,"The Mall of India located in sector 18. Easy to locate, nearest metro station is Sector 18 Metro station. The mall have, international and domestic clothing brands, movie halls, indoor sports, restaurants, food courts. Must visit place in Noida."
Great place to shop in NOIDA,"I arrived  in NOIDA with my adult son yesterday. Planned to visit GIP but my daughter called me and asked me to purchase cookies and brownies from Theobroma which is located in DLF Mall of India. So went there earlier today with my son. Loved the place. It is bigger and better than GIP which I last visited seven years ago. Shopped some essentials items at Big Bazaar, bought a few cookies and brownies from Theobroma and had a delicious lunch at the Zizo restaurant. Wanted to taste something unusual and enjoyed the food there. Would love to visit again. Have to thank my daughter for asking me to buy from Theobroma."
Big brands collection,"All the famous clothes brand like H & M, Zara, Kalvein kleen, Arrow and many others have got their outlets spread over 5 floors in this centrally air conditioned and vibrant shopping mall in the Noida .We can spend quality time with family shopping and hanging out within. A good way to beat the scorching heat of Delhi NCR"
Shopaholics dream,"You need to allow a day to visit this mall as I have been told its the largest in India. Huge variety of stores. This is not a market so prices are mall prices. All popular brands you will fine here. Top floor is for kids, big or small to entertain."
Shree Ratnam - DLF Mall.,"While the south Indian Is just OK( Horrible Chutney ) .  But paneer butter Masala is excellent, better than most of the restaurants in Noida."
Best place for Shopping,Get all brands under one roof. From watches to shoes to apparel to food. From movies to games and so on. One of the best malls on Delhi NCR
Dlf Mall of India,One of the best malls in Delhi NCR. Perfect for family outing. You can do so much here and all this in great ambience. Only draw back is the parking. At times one has to use the elevated parking outside
Perfect place to escape heat!!,It is filled with top brands and amazing shops and many places to eat.  The time of May and June is the best to roam around in the malls as it is having excellent air conditioning and you will be able to enjoy the food in peace. There is also gaming zone for kids .
"Big, crowded & happening",A great place for Noida crowd to hang over. Taken over from GIP. During weekend remain over crowded. Parking during weekends is an issue.
Very noisy...,"Visited this Italian outlet located on the 3rd floor at DLF Mall of India, Noida for lunch. We were lucky to find our table soon for the five of us. Since this was a meeting of two friends and families after a long gap, there was much conversation on the line. However we found ourselves drowned out in the noise of guests at the eatery hitting high decibel levels.The service was good and food was average. We ordered two varieties of pizza and baked pasta with bread. The desserts were delightful as you'd expect from a place specialising in bakery items. We enjoyed our cheesecake and mango tiramisu thoroughly.I was delighted to see that they had not levied a service charge in the bill and I was at liberty to tip my attendant at will which I gratefully obliged with."
Heaven under one roof for brand lovers but parking is confusing,DLF is a wonderful place if you love brands and you get many options under one roof. But at times i find locating a shop is a tough job as you get lost and then you have to walk a lot to identify where the shop can be. Even it is a task to park the cars as the parking is always full and you keep on going levels to find a place and its a lot confusing also.
Good place for taste seekers,"The mall has brought many famous names under one roof that leaves you with plenty of choices to experiment with food. The food court is too crowded especially on the weekend - Taco Bell kind of joints should not be there. Nando's, Chilli, Carl's Jr are average, Mamagoto and other fine dines are living their standards.Shopping as usual is expensive, good time visit during sale."
Great Clean Shopping Mall,"If you want to beat the Delhi heat, and find all things western, jump on the Metro and head to Sector 18 Noida. Get your bearings before you leave the Metro, and it's a walk across the overpass.Great way to decompress and revive.Every shop imaginable, but just a nice way to spend a few hours."
Great Mall,"A very big mall with Luxurious Brands. A very good neat and clean food court. A variety of restaurants and food stalls. Departmental stores like Lifestyle,  Home Center,  Big Bazaar are present in this mall."
a must visit place of noida!!,never have people of Noida seen such a classic well maintained mall in this city before. its a place where youngsters family friends go to chill .the food court here is just awesome offering you a wide range of food variety .
Huge,"The largest mall of NCR offers many things. Clothing to food, you name it you get it there. You can feel exhausted from roaming around the mall, and still cant cover all. Very good brands."
Best mall in Delhi NCR,"A mall made for people who bleed money, this mall is preferred by people over The Great India Place just because of the kind of shops available allowing them window shopping of higher standards. Other than that, this is no different than any other mall and is just bigger in size. Some very good restaurants are inside which provide quality food and service. If you have the financial strength, shopping would be a definite treat."
A good mall to shop around,This was my first visit to the DLF mall. The mall is big and has a lot of different shops. We went looking for wedding outfit and were not disappointed. Manyavar has a huge collection and they have something for everyone. We had lunch at Imly which was extremely busy but had a nice service. Also at the chai point we had overpriced tea which tasted good so no complaints on the quality. Overall I would recommend this mall to anyone who wants to shop around in the area.
One of the kind,This is actually one of the best malls in the NCR region. The mall is huge and comprises of all almost the big brands. There are a plethora of good restaurants on the third floor. It also has SMAASH
I like the ambience,I like the ambience of the mall and specially the Mi Store that it has. Majority of the brand outlets are there.
Immersive shopping experience,"Spacious , captivating full of myriad options. Sopping experience at its very best for all, whether you are big or small."
DLF MALL OF INDIA,One of the best malls in India...gives feel of UK with its concept n brand collection..must visit..parking in the mall is a major issue..better to park outside in multilevel parking
Phenomenal experience,"Great place to watch movies, shop and eating. Meeting & hanging out with friends where you enjoy üòä leisurely"
Good hangout zone,Placed far better than competing malls and overall it is a good hangout zone. Security is unnecessary hassle. I think they should avoid too much frisking...
"Great Mall, good restaurants ","I would rate it as one of the best malls in Delhi NCR, but avoidable on weekends as parking is an issue and you could waste a lot of time waiting to park in the mall"
Njoiyed every bit,"Good place to hang out, all brands under one roof, super collection of stuff and amazing food options.Best place to dine in as well"
Best Place in Noida/ Delhi,"Modern place for shopping , dinning and partying. You will find almost all top brands here and top of the line restaurants."
Everything under one roof,It‚Äôs called India‚Äôs largest mall for a reason with almost ever brand be it normal or luxury available. Clean n large. Weekends are busy n parking is an issue.
Great Experience,"Best place to hang out, provided you find a parking space in time. Although there is multi-level parking very much near to the mall. Many big brands under one roof, so a good place to make your wallets dry. Jokes apart, all in all, a great place to hang out whether you are with the family or friends. Brands like Smash and snow world will keep you and your kids engaged in games and your younger kids get all the fun at the fun city. After this, you can sit and enjoy your food with unlimited choices."
Once you find parking....,As in most of Delhi...only once you find parking can you actually start somewhere. It‚Äôs a good mall. You will need to be patted down and women‚Äôs bags searched at every entrance so be prepared. The mall has a wide range of local and international shops with ample eateries.
Best ,"It‚Äôs easily the best mall as of now in NCR. Do well to keep your standards high. Great brands, good ambience, ample parking etc"
major brands under one roof,"good place for shoppingall major brands are availableeco friendly, very nice exteriorgreat interiorsgood maintenanceeasily accessible via metro, car, any transportOnly drawback- its too big that sometimes it becomes a bit confusing"

For meeting,"The is the best Mall of India, with class, and suitable for all requirements. I personally love visiting for all reasons"
Awsome Mall in NCR,"Lots to do - Shopping / Cafe / Restaurant / Play Area for kids.!!It‚Äôs a place you can spend full day and still will won‚Äôt be able to cover all - Folks wanting to shop a must go as gives mix of ethnic, western, sports wear, etc.!!Location wise also it‚Äôs central so should be easily reachable for all folks in Noida / Delhi / NCR region.!!"
Good and huge mall,Good and big mall. Most of the Indian and international brands are available. Nice food court with variety of indian and international options.
DLF Mall of India,Super huge and indeed worth spending a few hours. Definitely worth a visit if you are anywhere near Noida.
The go to place for Delhi/NCR,"Mall of India is undoubtedly the best and the largest mall in India with thousands of brands and hundreds of food outlets. Located centrally in Noida it gives Delhiites a chance to shop at ease as its not very far from the highway. The largest parking possible for any structure is also a part of this mall. Whether youre in a mood for shopping or just casually want to go out, this is the place to step in to."
Spacious mall but missing compactness!,DLF mall of India is a Spacious mall but it requires well planned arrangement of shops / flagship stores such that it becomes a compact mall.
very good mall,the mall is very good and not so big as the Great Indian palace mall  there is a verity of product is available
Parking issue.,Aaj din 22apr2019 timing 12:00 ke aas pass maine apni bike P1 ki parking mai khadi ki thi or jab mai 4:30 par aaya to uske pichle wheel mai air nahi thi mujhe laga ki sayad pancher ho gaya hai or jab mai mall ke bahar gaya panchar wale ke pass check karaya to pata chala ki panchar nahi hai mall ke ander security guard ne bike ki air nikali hai.

Best Mall in Noida,"This Mega Mall in the best one in Noida. It has some great exclusive showrooms and restaurants. The place is top notch and very clean. The housekeeping service is very efficient. One would love to go here just to do even window shopping. In terms of parking and accessibility, it won't disappoint you."
Good place to visit,"Good place to visit . You get everything under one roof. Whether it is good renowned restaurants / eating place or good branded shops. It has even good movie place with latest movies ( PVR cinemas). For kids also it has god place for entertainment,"

Very good ,"Excellent place for shopping, amazing eateries, game zone awesomene, all brands at one place, must visit"
A good shopping destination,I visit this place few a times and it feels good to be there. You shop till you drop... üòÅüòÅüòÅThe food court is an icing on the cake with many other restaurants also available besides the food court area.
Rides and Turkish ice-cream,Rides are bit expensive but they allow guardian along with kid.  ice-cream from Turkish is fun to see.
Top mall in Noida/South delhi/east delhi,"A large bouquet of fashion, food and home. Not good for mobiles and electronics. Must remember the pillar number while you park your car."
Nice hangout,Great hangout place for family and friends.. lots of retail and food outlets.. parking sometimes is a problem
One Stop Mall,"You just can't get better shopping experience in NCR in a Mall. This is amongst the largest in India I guess. Its next to impossible to finish going around this mall in a day. And the brands present are all awesome, one can shop from basics to mid segment luxury here. You name it and this mall will be able to offer. Yet again DLF has done an amazing job with the choice of brands they have been able to get at one single mall. Wish this or a similar mall was present in Gurugram."
Typical Mall,"For an American this is just a typical mall you would find in the U.S.  As a tourist to India its not exciting but it does provide a airconditioned, clean environment to eat or pick up something you forgot to pack."
Shopping time,"This is THE ""MALL OF INDIA"". You will find luxury brands here, just name it- Armani for example. Lot of restaurants, coffee shops, Branded Clothing , shoes, perfumes, accessories what not. A big food court with good food chains like MC Donald's, KFC, Dominoes, Pizza Hut etc. Movie hall and a gaming zone for kids and adults as well. All in all a good place to roam around and do shopping."
Good nice with all collection of things for shopting at one place,Amazing place wit has lots of shopping options amazing shops with type of decent rates. Only issue is when you visit and use parking keep a photograph of the neareSt numbered pillar else difficult to find your vehicle
Best in the vicinity!,"Great for Noida and Greater Noida dwellers , though visits are paid by residents/non residents from all over... as it's the biggest mall of India. My favourite stores and brands (Zara, Mango, Promod, GAP, H&M, Forever New, Aldo...etc) are here, though I feel the food court lacks a little edge. I feel restaurants a level below and cafes and eateries on Ground Floor are much better than the options available at food Court. Favourites are BURMA BURMA, Soda bottleopenerwala, Pirates of Grill, Big Chill, Chili's, Made in Punjab, United Coffee House..and many more. At food Court, you have also find a gaming zone for children and adults...separate zone for kids.. for rest we have Smaash, ISkate... they are an experience in itself.Collection in lifestyle store needs an improvement (GIP Mall excels in that) Overall 4.5/5 for a good shopping and dining experience."
Great!!!!,Fully of light. Big amount of shops. Good price and variety. Food and all other stuff. Big parking area (dont forget to keep the position of the car)
A perfect place to shop and escape summer heat,DLF Mall has now become the weekend destination for serious shoppers of Delhi NCR. The place if you want to watch a movie or eat out with your friends and family. Or maybe just a window shoppers who want an escape from summer heat and pollution. The place has top brands but sure it is for moneyed who want to shop in the comfort of Air conditioned environment. The Mall is quite large and it will take you a while to figure out where is what. Do not forget to note down your parking slot in the basement parking and floor otherwise you may end up spending an hour in searching for your vehicle. A great place if you are a lazy bone and want everything under one roof.
My views on the Great DLF Mall,A place which is a must visit for everyone in Delhi NCR. This place has almost everything a person would want. Great Mall.Visit today and have a memorable experience.
Must visit to have great shopping experience.,Amazing place to shop till you drop. Almost all the international brands under one roof.It has movie hall and food court.
Birthday celebration,This Mall is one of the biggest and best Mall in Noida. It is well maintained and we get almost every brand available in the market. The crowd is also very good and there is always something interesting happening in and around the Mall. Keep it up. Thank you.
Hands down the best mall in Noida right now,"I think DLF is the best mall in Noida right now. It's easily accessible through metro. Have a lot of parking space. Have almost all the mid-range and big brand showrooms here. There are a few luxury shops as well.Overall, a good hangout place with lots of restaurants that can cater any kind of food choice, let it up take-aways, fine dining, casual dining, drinks and snacks, whatever.Smash is another hit place. Although, charges for bowling there are quite high than other places in Noida. Most of the time you can find Smash coupons for discount so that balances it out."
Convenient shopping but,"Mall with nearly all famous brands,  also with multiple food options,  very nice walking area and vibrant environs,  the parking for Senior citizens is not given to elderly,  the guards need training to speak to guests with courtesy"
A great place to hang out,"A great place to hang out, shop and dine, has a lots of variety both for shopping and dining. I specially appreciate the choices of fine dining options available here."
DLF Mall Noida.,I don't have much impression on the PVR in DLF Mall of Noida. Badly maintained. AC was not working satisfactorily. The floor area is also in bad shape.
A place to chill,"The DLF mall of India is located in Sector 18 Noida. It has 6 levels of shopping with domestic and International Brands, a food court, a number of restaurants my favourites being Burma O Burma, Chillies,Irish House and Unite Coffee House .The Big Chill cakery is an excellent stop for ice cream, frozen yogurt and desserts. Starbucks, Costa Coffee and Cafe Coffee day. There are also a number of  eateries for a quick bite Nandos, Wendy‚Äôs,Dunkin Donoughts, Chai Point, to name just a few. There is a cinema theatre PVR ECX Ron the topmost level playing the latest movies including in 3D. A wonderful place for shopping or eating or entertainment or just lazing around, Benches provided on e dry level to sit down. Also has a Big Bazaar at the mezzanine level for groceries, clothes and everything else! A good place to hang out during weekends.Ample parking and also pick up and drops provided ."
Noida best mall.. ,"DLF mall of India, Noida Up, is best mall in Delhi NCR.. Good Ambiance, one center for all international brand of lifestyle products and food.."
Wonderful place to be,Best of brands best of food outlets to be. Certainly a must visit no doubt! Several Usa brands as well
Good mall,Great mall. Has a lot of international brands and can be visited for buying toys to furniture. Very huge. Should visit with family and friends onlyüòä
Christmas üéÑ ,We have visited during Christmas but this time didn‚Äôt find anything attractive Average decoration Less enthusiasm They need to work more effectively to maintain the level
Offers you a lot under one roof!,"It‚Äôs packed on weekends and parking takes over 30 minutes, so I prefer going here on other days. Apart from all the national and international brands on display, there are coffee places, a food court and multiple food options. There is usually some festival/promo going on or some music group playing music in the lobby. A complete outing in itself!"
A respite in the suburbs,"We went yesterday to watch gully boy movie in the PVR. The mall is big, has a large food court and is quite a respite in such a deserted suburb of Delhi-NCR"
"A complete week end outing, Fun, Great food and varity of goods",DLF Mall Of India is a complete entertainment cum shopping experience. Kids area is very well crafted to give a memorable outing for the young kids. it is a shopping paradise for the young and old. The food chains offer a very large verity of cuisines. A foodies delight. Worth a week end visit for the hard working and an equally satisfying for those who are privileged with the luxury of time. The coffee outlets offer the most delightful variety of aroma.
Very nice mall with all the stores,"This is a very nice multi-story facility which has all of the international chains, as well as a lot of local vendors.  Very clean and quite a number of restaurants."
My Baby's Day out & shopping day.... ,"In Noida if you talk about premium & best shopping destination.....then it has to be DLF Mall Of India. It has a wide variety of brands which stands ideal for all the sections and class of people.... Starting from H&M to Gant, Superdry to Bigbazar, Miniso to Max, and has an incredible food court with ample food outlets along with PVR multiplex.... Now, if you wanna have a day out with your kid then the fun city has the widest collection of games and your kid will have a blast....Smaash is a must go place where you along with your family and friends can have a great time and it's loaded with lots of arcade games and in house food zone and believe me it's awesome....

One of the best mall in NCR,"One of the best malls in NCR, it has amazing options for shopping and eating out. You will find almost all brands including premium ones. The mall also hosts PVR cinemas and a very good food court. There are several well known cafe/restaurant chains that offer multiple cuisines."
Great place for shopping,"I found great clothing, electronics and jewelry stores with excellent discounts. Security was very good and the man at the information booth was very helpful. The bathrooms were very clean and there were many food options."
Excellent,Good service and best in all india.Very friendly excutive and have easy to find all the thing.i love it
best mall in town,it is the best mall in town will all amenities .it is must visit mall for families and kids .better to visited on weekdays
Dinner,Good restaurants and outing place.Had fun and felt good ambience. Richer experience. Good shopping area. Mutiple brand options.
Super,This was much needed upgrade that Noida needed after GIP and DLF gave it. Previously people had to go to select City walk may not go here
Visit there any time of the year,All brands are available...so Shopping here is a pleasure. Food court is good...and ample number of restaurants are available for multi cuisine dining.Play area for kids is on the top floor next to the food court.
One stop for all,"I am a regular visitor to the mall since it opened. If there is one people want to visit, this is the one to come and indulge in the NCR region of Noida. Almost all brands, designers, boutiques, fast food, restaurants, PVR and what not. Must for shoppers. 5 stars!"
Shopping,DLF Mall of India is the most happening shopping & leisure place in NOIDA.You name it and Mall if India has it.This is strategically placed & reachable for all either somebody from NOIDA or outside with no problem of Parking.
Shopping,I visited this place on Friday and had good time shopping... It's a real big shopping mall in sec 18 of Noida... I visit this place only because of one reseon that it has almost all top brands here .. one of my favourite place of Shopping..
Best Mall in NCR,Great range of shopping. Adequate escalators and walkways. Well managed parking. Spacious food court besides multiple small floor eateries.
Mall gives Feeling of being in Foreign Land,"The DLF Mall is situated in heart of Noida and  is very Systematic , Clean and having a very Good Ambiance. All the Foreign brands have set up their shop at DLF Mall it is to say you Name it and We have it. For a Normal Middle Class Family such Foreign brands are normally out of reach except the Food court. This is my Personal Opinion and should not be taken on face Value since every person can have his or her own Opinion"
Real Fun along with Shopping and Dinning,"Usually every Mall have lots of big brand Shopping outlets and Restaurants and some some Departmental stores. But DLF Mall of India have more then that. Main attraction of the Mall is, its Kids Zone which is a full flash amusement park where you can also enjoy the snow show and lot more."
Many brands,"Big mall with nearly all the good brands available. Good option of eatery. Surely recommended if you have time and in this area.Getting cab is a big pain in this mall, so better use uber and set the right gate as that is the most confusing part."
DLF - Daily Life Fun,"Any body can relax at DLF Mall of India. This includes shopping national or international brands, variety of food, coffee or fast food, many brands of beer or just window shopping. However, if you really want to enjoy, avoid on weekends due to parking as well as it‚Äôs very crowded."
Western style mall in Delhi,Lots of international fashion brands and some indian brands specialising in ethnic indian wear. I bought quite a few ethnic style tunics from here and I would definately recommend if you fancy escaping the streets of Delhi for a few hours :)
All under one roof,Can say it's a shoppers paradise.  All kind of stuff under one roof.  All range of stuff available we enjoy shopping with kids & teenager
Quite big,This mall is quite big and has outlets for several Indian as well as foreign brands. The one thing that bothered me was the lack of drinking water facility. They were only located in end of the food court.
Lots of shopping and eating under one roof,Quite a big mall therefore includes shopa and eateries of almost all types except a departmental store (for grocery specifically). With 7 theaters and an exclusive kids' playarea one can be in it for hours without getting brestless or suffocated
Nice experience with family,"Spread over a sufficiently large area, it has ample parking space.  the whole place is clean and very well maintained, with adequate number of escalators and lifts.  The mall has most of the popular brands Food court has sufficient sitting and serving area, with stalls offering a good variety of food.  Nice place for family visit."

Have it all mall,"It has everything for kids - a play area, hamleys, smash and a mini snow park When it comes to shopping it has the maximum number of stores in Delhi ncr. Go there for a huge variety of restaurants as well Mexican, Italian and Indian, they have it all!!"
Best place to shop in Noida,Awesome mall to shop at best brands and eat at best restaurants. Cinema is very nice. They have wide variety of food available at the cinema. Very nice and secure environment. Must visit.
DLF Mall is an exciting place,"Some of the brand and stores are unique to this mall, which you may not find in other malls of Noida and food court is too the best in Noida with lots of options for good food."
mall of malls,a mall where you can get anything you ever thought of be it shoes or clothes or fancy watches. but do remember to put on comfy shoes coz you have to travel a lot in the mall with so many floors and so many stores
BEST MALL IN DELHI NCR,"DLF Mall of India, one of the largest in the country is the best Mall in Delhi NCR region.  Impeccably maintained,  great food and entertainment options and all major Global Brands are present.The only negatives I see is the clogged Entry during weekends/ holidays,  claustrophobic Basement Parking which is always very confusing.  The Exit too usually leads to a jammed street outside."
DLF The Best NCR Mall.,"Nice place as always, although it's getting overcrowded in the weekends but it is hands down the best NCR mall this day. The facilities are great & they are trying their best to improve every day & time."
Truely Delhi food,The quality service and interior are well complimented. The variety and presentation of dishes is rich. The total eight vegetable juice.  The dhaba paranthas and thePiza Alfredo were particularly very tasty. Must visit for a typical Delhi tAste
Visit to funcity,"Funcity is a place in dlf mall of india where kids would like to remain all day long. Besides, this mall offers best brands under one roof for shopping-alcohlics but parking can play spoilsport during weekends as it remains full."
Sumptuous food,"You will never regret going there, Delicious food,served with ever smiling staff, order anything and everything turns out to be best, you will simply say wow and will enjoy every minute of sitting in the beautiful ambience."
One of the biggest and newest mall in NCR,"One of the newest mall,where you can spend you weekend. Good place to have shopping and good for food too. Although shopping is costlier than other malls"
"Its massive, Keep enough time in hand","It can be one stop destination for all your needs. Be it clothing and accessories, household electronics, mobiles and even grocery. Almost all brands are available and the layout of the mall is very user friendly. Visited the mall during Christmas vacation it was very crowded during that time. children have lot of space for entertainment and recreation."
Excellent mall,DLF Mall is extremely well maintained property.There are top rated branded selling outlets.For taste buds top restaurants are also there
reat shopping experience,Great shopping experience ... all good brands... Kids friendly - shops only for kids like DISNEY etc..Lot of options for food - from fast food to fine dining....I am a regular visitor here....
Nice mall for every needs ,"Mall is always busy, because it has good outlet chains for foods and clothing with gaming experience and clubs. Also this mall has in-house ski area. Parking is huge and available all time."
Mall of Delhi/NCR,Best shopping place... all best brand under one roof. Information screen/desk available in all floor... huge space for parking too..
All in a place,"You want to ""shop"", ""eat"", ""hangout"", this mall is perfect for all. You can buy anything here from expensive to cheap. You have all the brands under one roof.and about food, you have every type of cuisine available here. cafe to fine dine.This mall is a mini market with catering all your needs."
Largest mall in delhi ncr,"This mall is paradise for shophilics. All great shopping outlets, lifestyle, shopper's stop, hnm, splash, big bazaar, store 99 n many others are under one roof of this mall. They have a Smash play zone with many vr games, bowling games. They also have  SkiIndia on top floor  for recreational activities. They also have a huge kid play zone at top floor. The PVR cinema n food court of this mall is also awesome. Overall its a must place to go for every tourist."
A new place to hangout and shop,"Went to Dlf with bunch of my friends. First of all, I was impressed by how they have managed parking for cars. This mall has most elites brands from all over the world.  You can also find some mid range brands like big bazar and pantaloons as well. Top floor is occupied by food court area and kids areas for vr games and rides. One of the main attraction points in this mal is ski india which is artificial snow area where you can ski and play with artificial snow"
Best mall in Noida,"I love visiting this awesome mall in Noida Sec-18. There is so much to do here that I can easily spend 4-5 hours here, even if I don't watch a movie or something. I love the variety of food available here. I love to shop here. I love it."
A well equipped mall,"It is a huge Mall with all the latest ware shops luring you with their splendid displays.The Mall has well defined car parking which is on three levels and over all even the shops and wash rooms have appropriate sinages .On week ends even a mall of this size seems small to handle such big crowds and the parking seems perpetually full. The parking attendants lack mannerism and professionalism though.Good to visit on a week day.There are movie theatres that are  state of the art , latest , modern and a must visit , with best quality sound system.Adjoining the theatre is the food court and many other fresh breweries too.The quality of food too is good.Must visit once"
Parking sucks,Mall is good but parking is totally a headache here.Parking Attendants are clueless its so hard in here to park vehicle.
DLF Mall noida...nice ambience to hang around and chill...parking is a maze,"Nice mall to visit to browse around and make day of. Parking can be confusing and you can get lost as to where you parked your car ..it has happened to me couple of times...despite noting the zone I am parked in. It is important that you make a note of the land mark shops as you enter the mall after getting off the escalator, and lift...make sure which are the first few shops you see when you enter so that you can come back the same way...this will help you to locate your car easily. I would have given the rating excellent but for the parking layout can be very confusing....this is based on my personal experiences of visiting the mall"
Remarkable!,"A big competition to GIP mall and a lovely place to hang out, you have several options to spend time here, ski INDIA, smash! And many others. Top brands. Take out 5 to 6 hours and enjoy the day here. Food court here have several options to dig in. You will not feel Bored."
Lots of high end shops ans places to eat,"This mall is right next to our hotel. There are lots  of food options. The air quality on the upper floors is not so great on some days. They have an indoor air quality report that was displayed on one of the large screens near the entrance. I think management realized it probably wasn't a good idea to tell shoppers that the CO2 levels in the mall were high, so after a few days here they turned it off. There is a Chili's, Carl's Jr., Starbucks, and plenty of other food options.  Because this is India, you wont find beef on the menu."
Best Mall - One Stop Mall for All,"Over the last two decades I have visited several malls across India but this is definitely one of the best.It is huge with global luxury brands (like H&M, Hamleys, AIX, Zara and many more) to Indian brands. Has great pubs, restaurants and a huge food court catering to variety of food.As a result the Mall pulls best crowd.Parking is spread across three floors however considering the huge rush it also falls short and one must definitely keep some time aside to find a car parking."
For Shopping and Rides,I liked that place so much its very nice place for having good time with family. We enjoyed the rides in DLF MALL. We had great fun there.
Big Clean DLF Mall,"The range of options for shopping is impressive. Be it clothes, shoes, electronics, food, tea or coffee shops, games and so on. It is a clean and well-maintained Mall. Always fun, frolic and fruitful to visit DLF Mall or Mall of India at Noida."
Complicated to reach but easy to enjoy.,With so many malls in the same area one needs to be careful with directions to reach..... Complicated to reach.Has a nice place to keep kids occupied in the top floor. All paid rides.Nice food court.Easy to be enjoy.Needs to be careful about rush time as it gets pretty full and then exit is time taking
Best Mall of Noida,"DLF is the best place for shopping, This is best & biggest mall of Noida, Here you can get anything you want."
Best mall in Delhi  undoubtedly. ,"A wide variety of stores , amazing dining options,,, a great multiplex,,, good parking management and courteous staff."

A Weekend Family Destination ,"A Weekend Family Destination That we love.One mall that caters to the taste of all possible shoppers with the numbers of stores that it has. Zoning has been done nicely. Perhaps a little thought on locating stores on the upper floors may be a wise idea. People often get lost finding stores on second and third floor.Overall, a great place to be."
Went for ladies and Kids Apparel.,"well laid out, as divided in different sections according to national and international stores. Plenty of options. Food also has a vast option to select from."
Damn it's a complete package...,During festive season I love to come here and shop why because during these seasons they offer some sweet discounts on some of the best brands... that really makes my day... and thats one of the many reasons I shop here.
Biggest Entertainment Destination in Noida....,"It is one of the biggest mall with classy high end taste,be it for shopping, eating or enjoyment. It has all the big high end brands available for shopping. You would surely become a shopaholic once you see the brands. For food lovers it has various cuisine restaurants ranging from north indian-south indian-parsi-italian-american-japanese....etc. For adventure/sports lover - it has many options available. It has different section like ice/snow playing, indoor amusement part, bowling, cricket, video games, kids section...etcIn short it has everything under one roof."
All in one,Great place for shopping as well as adventure for kids and adults. As game zone of kids can keep them busy for 2 -3 hours and adults can enjoy at Smash. Smash is a few place to enjoy with group of friends.
Spacious mall with good brands,"This mall is spacious.. has good international brands. Many restaurants to cater to foodies. Strategically located across another mall, Great India Place which is connected by footbridge."
Big chill cafe,Great selection of restaurants and a super food court. Only place to eat out in noida. I haven‚Äôt eaten out at any other location since this place opened a few years ago.
DLF visit,"Best mall in Noida. Neat, food court the best and one gets all the brand's under one roof.Big bazaar here has genuine good collection. Caters to all types of people."
All in one,"The mall is well constructed and caters to all your clothing, food and daily shopping needs. The movie theaters is an added bonus.Yes parking can be a nightmare on holidays , but now that the the new sec 18 multi level parking is operational it has eased some of the parking woes. The food court is huge and offers an amazing variety of cuisine. The mall is an all in one stop for shopping, eating, movies, pubbing.This is definitely the place to hang out when in Noida."
Great place for family shopping,Great place for shopping with family. This mall is great to have many things in one place. I like the Big Bazar with huge collection with many varities
Something for everyone,"This is the best mall in Delhi NCR and has almost everything for everyone. You will find both local as well as international brands available here. The food court is decent with lots of options. Parking is always full on weekends. On weekends, It's better to park in the nearby Wave Mall and then walk to Mall of India."
Good place to visit with family,"Superb place.. love all the restaraunts here..favs are chilis, nandoz and big wong.. food court is also good..cheers"
Everything under one roof,"It's new, it's fresh, it's vibrant, it's got everything going for it at the moment. I was particularly impressed by the movie-watching experience."
HUGE MALL- ONE OF THE BEST MALLS OF INDIA,"One of my favourite mall to spend the weekends. With wide range of brands, huge kids playing area, large food area where unlimited options. Whats more it is located at the main hub of Noida. Undoubtedly one of the best place for shopping and fun."
Just another mall! ,"Just another mall, only thing is that it‚Äôs BIG! It has almost all the brands. It has Nando‚Äôs! Good for shopping brands under one roof."
Marvellous,"The mall is almost have over 550 outlets with 7 cinema screens and multiple restaurants along with 20 odd food court counters.All most of all the reputed brands in all the segments we're present, and excellently maintained.One must visit this mall and a minimum of half day is required to have a glance. Great mall"
Awesome Mall Great Brands ,One of the finest malls in Noida with almost every good brand available. Very clean and hygienic. Kudos to maintenance agency and staff. Food court is awesome and Pita Pit and Nandos also there now. Overall perfect for family and friends and children.
Omnifarious,"There's a multitude of outlets for shopping, dining, relaxing, parlours, etc. There's a huge variety to choose from and houses few of the finest shopping and dining options,such as fennel, chaayos ,maspar ,Aldo, AND, A/X,cinnabon,bobbi brown, Bombay Selection, etc."
Shopping army Rangriti,At third floor traditional wear are available.would like to visit again. Earlier also I visited fir purcamhasing western wear. Love to do shopping from dlf noida.
Biggest mall in Noida,"DLF is the biggest mall in Noida and the most recent one providing all amenities that one may typically expect from a modern day malls.Car parking is bit of a mess, specially on week ends and one may end up parking at the multi level car park outside the mallIn case you are going for movies, please ensure you arrive well in advance to avoid parking chaos.All leading brand stores and restaurants available, making it more pleasurable for visitors to spend time."
One of the most trendiest and upmarket mall in Noida Area- Home to many high profile brands,"What ""The Great India Place"" was to Noida once, the ""DLF Mall of India"" is to Noida now. It is large sized upmarket trendy mall, spread over 7 levels- three underground for vehicle parking (can accommodate upto 5000 light and medium vehicles)and four levels of shopping arcade, kids zone, food lounge and PVR ECX Multiplex on the top most Level 4. There are all kinds of shops with A list names catering for all kinds of shopping needs. There are many food kiosks on each floor like Theobroma, Costa Coffee, Galeto Venito etc. and a full fledged food court EAT with many more brand names in restaurants and fast food chains. The to floor Level 4 is the most attractive one as it caters for fun, games and entertainment. There is a big problem of GPRS/mobile data network in the entire mall, especially in basement parking and upper levels. There is no free wi-fi available, which ideally should have been the case. So, if you plan to use NFC or wallets payments anywhere in the mall, you are bound to face network issues to complete your transaction successfully. That was a big pu off for me. The Info/Help Desk is available on ground level but the staff was helpless in connecting me to the mall's wi-fi network. Overall, an upmarket trendy great hangout for family and friends of all age groups, which certainly needs improvement in mobile network issues."
Noida Key point,"This place attracts people not only from Noida but from Delhi also . Beats select city , saket .  A place for the families and bachelors both ."
India's Largest Mall,"This is a huge mall with the biggest brands under it's roof. It has a PVR movie hall, Ski India adventure park, a playarea for kids apart from big eating joints.The brands and the restaurants are slightly on the expensive side but the food court is a good one though.For kids, a visit to Hamleys and Disney&Me is a must."
High profile brands available here,"This mall is good and if you are looking for high brands in Noida region then this is your place.But I must tell you, parking is a headache here and on weekends you might have to be in queue for an hour or so if you stuck in peak timings.Cafeteria is situated on top floor and heavily crowded."
Best mall in the world,"I think DLF mall of India is my second home. It‚Äôs a beautiful mall with almost all brands. It has a big food court and other restaurants as well. It has smash ( playing area), SKI and other shops. For shopping it‚Äôs the best place in noida."
Mr. ,"One of the best malls to shop in in the NCR, centrally located, parking spaces available.Wide range of goods available and plenty of Sales."
Best Chai spot ,"The best place to relax and chit chat after shopping .Teas taste the best and also they have perfect menu to snack on . My favourites are Masala Chai , Crispy Jalebis and Pakoras ! Love it."
Nice place to hangout with family,It's a nice mall to hangout with family. There are so many showrooms to shop from. A nice food court is also there.
One of the biggest mall of Noida ,"The mall is conveniently located in sector 18 of Noida and houses numerous shops, multiplexes, restaurants and food courts. However, I feel the mall is not compact and shops are not well organized."
Very big mall,This is one of the India biggest mall. There are nearly all reputed brand inside the mall. Interior of mall is excellent. This is one of the best place for shopping.
Huge. Lots of Stores. Crazy Crowded,"Well, getting into the Mall of India was quite an experience. Long queues and crazy crowded. It seemed like there was some kind of crazy sale going on, but that wasn't the case since not many people with shopping bags. Perhaps they were enjoying the air-conditioned environment. The mall has a large variety of stores and thus is packed."
The Best Mall at Noida,"My recent travel to Delhi and Noida ,I visited the DLF Mall  and found to be the best when compared  GIP or Gardens Gallera. etcFull of all best brands in India and abroad, this is a shoppers paradise where travelers from all areas can find something special to buy for them or family..The food court also has vide variety of best cuisines .Best place to visit."
"""The B.E.S.T mall in NCR""","It is the place to be. Happening, exciting, international shopping experience!!! haven for foodies too. Both the eating options in food court as well as other fine dining areas have multiple options though the food court is a bit crowded at times."
Nice one,"This mall compares to the malls in south Delhi. Shining show rooms , big brands, too many good places to eat, lot of fun things for kids to enjoy specially skeeing . Also parking is also quite huge so u never follow issues like in gip"
A truly Mall of India,"As the name suggests, this mall is one of the best mall you can find in India, particularly Delhi NCR. It has a great range of brands and it is really heaven for a shopaholic. The food court offers all sort of cuisines and restaurants. The only negative point is it's way too crowded on the weekend, literally a nightmare."
Great place,Good and great place for dine and shopping. Avoid Made in Punjab for third class buffet dinner and service.
Nice mall,This is a nice Mall but there's Not much to do there and it easy to get tired and bored. The restaurant there are very standard. But the shops are good and it has many floors.

Family outing,"Good mall , clean ambience, nice area for children's and good food court, ample and nice organised parking also, overall better experience than GIP."
GREAT HANGOUT PLACE IN NOIDA,It was a business trip and we thoroughly enjoyed. Think of a brand and it's there. Very huge space and is a great tourist attraction.Food lovers will just hit the spot as all lucrative foodie restaurants all around. This place is a must visit if you are in NCR.
For Food and Fun ,It's a great place such a beautiful structure and ambience superb üòçüòçIt's my second choice after Ambience ( Gurgaon ) Too many brands few new and popular brand i am fan of this place
A great place to shop.,"The overall ambience of the mall is pretty good. Coming to the shopping part, you will get a nice experience of niche marketing"
Good elite mall ,Surrounded by three four malls and sector 18 market Being new old ones near it become forgotten chapters Old saying one new opening kills another Same old North Indian brands Good food court with well known delhi eateries at one placeHuge big anchor store but difficult to locate Parking a problem takes time on weekends
wonderful place to visit,"Biggest mall of India , wonderful place to shop , eat and entertain yourself and kids , we used to go there mostly fior our 4 year old kid ."
A Great place to enjoy the day with your friends and family,"It's a huge mall, and has a lot to offer to everyone. lot of global brand outlets are here. Some of the best restaurant are here too. Hence a must visit. The only downside the parking and traffic issue, specially on weekdays(after 7pm) and weekends. Sometime we have to return from midway coz of all the above mentioned reasons."
Beautiful and Well Planned Largest  Mall,DLF Mall of india is Delhi and NCR biggest mall..it is well maintained and host all the big brands...Food court and gaming zone are the biggest attraction here. One can easily spend the whole day in it without any problem.
big attraction for the well to  do,"all brands, including global are here. very well maintained aisles, lobbies, facade, restrooms and friendly staff. Glittering lighting, great air conditioning, great location."
Luv this place,The best place for movie and food. Liquor is little expensive though but food is awesome and open courts are amazing.
Biggest mall of Delhi NCR,This is the biggest mall in Delhi NCR with almost all the brands. You name it they have it. Ground floor has all international brands. They have next gen big bazaar as well. Lots of activities for kids & huge food court. Movie lovers can also visit this mall. Highly recommended for visitors & local people.
What a scam.,"Don‚Äôt get me wrong. It‚Äôs mall - one can‚Äôt really go wrong with it if all the brands housed are the best ones in the city, and the places to eat are good enough.But there‚Äôs something really wrong with the planning! Parking on a slightly crowded day can take up to an HOUR! And they advertise themselves saying ‚ÄòEasy Parking, Easy Shopping‚Äô. WHAT A SCAM!"
Too huge,I think this is TOO huge for a mall. Shops have decent stock. However too confusing for actually looking through all the shops.
Exploring place ,Best thing is that every time you enter you feel something new in the entire mall. Starting from dress es to restaraunts. Everything I find a new cafe here.
Best place in Noida,If you want to shop this is the place. You will find almost all the brands you have heard here and also brands which you might not have heard about. There are many amazing restaurants also here apart from the food court. You have smaash and fun city for kids and for adults as well. You also have PVR for watching movies and over all these you have ski India - Snow park a must visit place.
OK OK,Collection of apparels in stores is not good. It is a big mall but still no space to stand or sit as it is over crowded.Food options are quite good as plenty of restaurants of all type of cuisines qre present.Better to visit on weekdays.
Good visit,I went their to passing time as I was alone and nothing todo so I thought to go their . It is good mall I thing biggest in NCR . Due to Saturday too much crowd there even the parking was full .But it is good place as there are so many big brands showrooms.The main thing that attracts me was it has so many good restaurants as I am a very foodie person .Really good mall
Too big too much fun!,"The first thing that you notice as soon as you enter this mall is how big this is. Every shop, every good joint and every brand that you can possibly imagine is sitting right up there ready to serve you. The first two floors are dedicated for shoppers, wherein you can buy clothes, watches, sunglasses, cosmetics and other accessories in all price range. The third floor is mostly full of private dining restaurants which have their own private sitting and quite expensive as well. The top floor is the gaming and entertainment zone plus the food court which is obviously the most crowded and most popular area of the mall. I think this is by far the biggest mall of india and if you do like spending your time in malls, we'll you are heading to the right place."
Very good,"Great place to shop , eat, entertain and relax. A lot of stores with good traditional Indian clothes"
Casual shopping,The overall vibe is very good and one must visit here atleast once and try all the stores for shopping bcoz of their exclusive discount offers going on here
Dlf mall,Wow.. very big mall.I have never seen such a huge mall anywhere.I really enjoyed at this mall along with my friends.
Newly Constructed Mall,Mall is newly constructed and well organised. You will get all type of brands & varieties in the mall. Worth to visit and spend your quality time. Better you park your vehicle in sector 18 as surrounding of the Mall is jam packed most of the time.
Great to hang out,"Good crowd, varied shops and great selection of brands. Plety of nice restaurants as well, it's definitely worth a visit!"
Huge Mall. Be lucky to get parking,Undoubted best mall in noida.. But parking is a major issue here.. If u planning to go there using your own vehicle... Yes it's very crowded all the time i visit this place.. It has got evrything u need.. Party plaaces.. Eathing places.. Food court.. Movie theatre. Gaming zone... Branded strores.. Multi brand retail stores.. Ski Noida.. So all in all its a best place to hang out and shop..
Be selective,Malls are good place to hang out esp when it‚Äôs too hot outside. Buying big brands at mall is not a wise move. Why India has to charge so much higher? Stay with local brands to make smart decision. It took us 2-3 visit to understand what this mall had to offer. It‚Äôs always a challenge to buy on need vs buy on deal. Retail Therapy needs an escape too.
It is the new hangout place in noida,"Mall of india has everything in house from shopping places to eating joints to gaming place for kids. Everything is here. Nice place. One big issue is parking, not a good design at all. It may take u 15 min to come out of it."
Truly Imposing Grandeur,"We went to DLF Mall of India as had heard a great deal about it. The experience before entering the Mall was not that pleasant as we wasted around 45 minutes on the turn for the Mall as the vehicles ahead of us were crawling. Well, we entered the Mall and I must admit that the decision of going there during a weekend was not at all unwise. The stores of almost all the regular and premium brands are present at the Mall. It looks so huge and impressive that I cannot explain in mere sentences. We kept on walking and entered one store after another. Be it Lifestyle or Zara, the collection is latest and truly amazing. The people were moving from one store to another like a swarm of bees. We entered Lifestyle store and there was a long queue outside the trial room for which you require a great amount of patience. One floor after another had different stores for apparels, watches,artificial jewellery and others. The food outlets were not less in number and again had a long waiting list. We finally settled for Shree Rathnam and devoured our meal.We had entered the Mall at 16:30 p.m. and it was 22:30 p.m.when we decided to head back home. It was an experience enthralling and somewhat tiring as you have to walk and walk and walk more..."
Most frequently visited mall,"1km from my house. Clean. Good loos and good layout in general. Very crowded on weekends. Mostly expensive. Good cinema Halls. It's got ice snow rink, mini indoor amusement arcade and gaming arcade in addition to the restaurants n food courts. Most indian and foreign brands available. Noida first stand up comedy place. This mall is in close vicinity to other Noida malls and entertainment areas and metro. The autos outside will fleece big time anyone. Car parking exit is not well marked. Sometimes staff is helpful. Most interactive maps of the mall are non functional and are very few. Restaurants need more variety. Mall needs some space to sit and have good wifi where u can do some work n chill, don't know if the mall has good secure wifi or cosy places to sit"
Spend an entire day at leisure,"The mall is a luxurious destination for young and old alike. With its seasonal installations which send a warm welcome to its big brand exclusive stores, eateries of the world cuisine, Snow Park, Kids' play area and a gigantic food court - its a treasure trove for leisure."
Best Managed Mall in North India,Very well managed mall. The shops are segregated on a proper theme. Even food courts have a logic. Reputed brands are evenly spaced with ample space to relax or to take a break. Entire space is dotted with utility kiosks and coffee shops which also adds to the looks of the mall. A visit is a must.
Luxurious Trip,Luxurious mall with all the big brands and wonderful food court with various options and good options for fun and kids activities
Fabulous entertainment and shopping under one roof,"Excellent place with lot of shopping and entertainment options. Be it funcity for younger kids or smaash for older ones. Lot of multi-cuisine eating joints. A day well spent, just avoid Sundays when it is extremely crowded."
India's International Mall,"Te moment you enter the Mall of India, you immediately feel a sense of sophistication so reminiscent of international malls. The experience is altogether different from being in any other mall of India where quantity prevails over quality as against the quality in Mall of India. The family can easily spend the whole day in this mall as there is everything for each member of the family - play areas, restaurants and food court, exquisite shopping experience, cinemas etc. to keep each family member fully engaged."
Mall of Shopping üòä,A nice place for all kinda shopping and food... must go place.. moreover the mall is so huge and have multiple brands to choose from.. Staff is polite .
Fun Fun and Fun,"Nice place for fun, food and shopping. Very crowded on weekends and mall parking might be a problem."
Just a Walk,"Went here casualy, and realised such a big place it is, will all the brands and showrooms, its so big loved it."
Must Visit,Biggest mall in Noida. Located near to Atta Market. Huge Mall with lots of shop. A gaming center is there at the top floor. Food court is also present at the top floor. Huge shopping market Big Bazaar located in the basement. Cinema at the first floor. Lots of shops on each floor where you can do shopping. Also electric auto  drop and pick-up to metro station
The Brands,"Under one roof , most of the brands in a mall, then its Mall of India. Plus lot of eating options and fun joints for kids as well as for elders."
Buzz of the city ,DLF mall of india has totally changed the mall experience in Noida! You name it and you get the brands you want in terms of apparels or dining! This mall attracts crowd from all over Noida and delhi and the place is well maintained in sector 18 Noida! Speaks quality time with your family or friends here!
Best and huge mall,one of the biggest mall in Delhi ncr have ample of brand shops best place for shopping and can also get no. of brand in single roof and if you are hungry then go to the top floor and have variety of food options
good place to chill,This is perhaps one of the biggest malls.One can find all the brands under one roof.Food court is good. Lots of games for the Kids.Ample parking is availableCons  parking rate is exorbitant.
Shopping,Good place to shop..great n huge variety..nearly all brands..Nice environment..would love to come again and again..
DLF Mall of India,A nice mall to hang out in with the interesting snow activity and cricket games for children. Many shops not found in other malls. Infact none of the run-of-the-mill shops to be found here. Good place for window shopping since the items are way too expensive.
One of the best Malls in NCR,"Excellent mall with a premium feel, probably one of the best among the other premium ones in NCR - Ambience Gurgaon, Promenade, Emporio.Avoid going by your own car on weekends as you will get to park in the multilevel parking adjacent to the mall. Multilevel parking is well maintained though just that one has to walk 10 mins from your car to the mall gate across a road - a problem if you done lot of shopping. The mall has lot of premium restaurants and a huge food court which is always occupied. Only thing I miss here is a Haldiram kind of restaturant for a quick value for money bite."
Grand,It has everything! From theaters to kids play area to video games to every kind of food to shopping complex! Everything.But it's better that you avoid taking your own vehicle on weekends/ public holidays as parking can take time on busy days.
Stylish Mall,Amazing mall. Great fun with friends. Very well located in Noida. All top brands are available under one roof.
Must visit in noida,"This mall has everything you want from top brands in clothing, footware, cosmetic, accessories and food.So well planned mall with different floor for different purposes. Really liked the place and 3rd floor of the mall is food heaven.Must visit"
Great place ,The mall was very crowded on Sunday.  The parking takes a bit of toll on you as they have limited parking and it gets crazy on weekends.  However the staff is excellent and extremely caring.  They have concierge service almost on all floors and hence no issues about checking about things.  The air-con was perfect considering the outside temperature was more than 44 c. Would love to come back here. Try entering from Gate no 6.  It‚Äôs less crowded.
Advise to visit is better,This is the best palace to visit I enjoy with friends but next time my wish is visit with my family for enjoying.
A WORLD CLASS EXPERIENCE  IN EVERY WAY ,"The DLF Mall of India in Sector 18, Noida is a truly world class entertainment  and shopping hub comparable to the best anywhere in the world. Combing  shopping encompassing almost all world class branded stores with equally diverse options for dining encapsulated in a magnificent layout  it is no surprise  that it attracts clientele  from all over Delhi and the NCR.  Adding to the options are the entertainment segment with a multiplex too.Perhaps even more surprising  is the fact that it attracts international tourists no less.The  Mall of India  remains an unbeatable attraction inspire of a plethora of Malls all over Delhi and the NCR"
The most expensive Mall in Noida,Visited two times and realized that most of the shops belongs to foreign brands. Mall is really very big and spacious. Number of co-curricular activities can be found here. Overall a must visit place
Excellent Mall. All relevant shops of a theme are on same side. Very good eating place also.,Excellent place for shopping. Almost all national and international brands are present. Very good ambience. Parking lot is huge. Place worth visiting again and again.
Everything you wish for,The mall has everything you wish for. All the brands are available without any fuss. The location is well accessible and the beat part is you have OPTIONS.

A great place to hangout !,"Trendy place with outlets of the best btands, food and entertainment. Good with family or friends. Always a hit !"
Enjoyed the place,"Primarily went to enjoy Icy chill at indoor Ice Place on 4th floor of Mall. One hour at minus 10 was fun there. Each pack for 1150rs. While waiting for our session to start at 1.00pm, we did some shopping . Variety was there at reasonable price. After Session, we enjoyed meals at Delhi Heights. Was a lovely outing."
Nice hangout,"Great place, love going there frequently for good food, shopping ...it's all in one place...good movie theaters , that adds up to the charm of this mall"
A swanky mall to splurge,"A well stocked purse is a must if u want to have a nice time in this plush mall, unless u r the kind of type who would be happy drooling at the windows of the outlets of international brands. The mall is well maintained."
Good mall in Noida,"DLF mall : A general and standard I can be seen in this and every DLF mall. Shops , appearance , location is good however being huge in size parking is mess . Crowed everytime .. however all leading brand's shop are available here . Eteary is bit costly in food court.. than nearby malls like GIP etc ."
Mall with nice shopping and fooding options,"A Mall with larger no of high end shopping options, huge play area and Ski (though slightly costlier options) & a huge food court with long list of options over and above many fine dining restaurants."
