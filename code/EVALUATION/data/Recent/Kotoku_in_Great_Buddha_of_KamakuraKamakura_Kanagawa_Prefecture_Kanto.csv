It’s old but not that ‘great’,"The Buddha isn’t that huge, although it is very old and full of history. It is also very far from the train station, need to walk 20 mins to reach. It’s slow as full of tourist and very crowded. It also charge 300 yen per person to go in, but once you bought the ticket , no one will check your ticket at the entrance...... I don’t recommend to go there."
Kotoku-in(Great Buddha of Kamakura,Very much a highlight of anyone's visit to Kamakura.  Not the largest buddha in Japan but it is very much a magnificent serene statue.  It is located in a wonderful temple setting.  We visited Kamakura before Covid 19 and we were able to visit the interior of the buddha for a nominal fee.  The temple compound is quite massive so allow a few hours to enjoy the surroundings.
A Must See,"Visiting the Great Buddha is a must if you are enjoying a day (or more) in Kamakura. The size of the statue, especially given the time it was made, will humble even the most difficult-to-impress observer. It is also possible to go inside the statue for very nominal fee (something like 10 yen) and it is cool to see how the head is reinforced from the inside. The grounds are also beautiful and provide a serene backdrop to either walk around or sit and enjoy the statue."
Amazing work of Art,"What a wonderful day.  We took the train from Tokyo to Kamakura to see the Great Buddha.  We walked through the town to the Buddha so we could see the sights.  It was Amazing.  Cast in 1252 when Kamakura was an Ancient Capitol of Japan (1192-1333).  The statue is 36 feet in height, weighs 93 tons and is the third largest Bronze Buddha in Japan.  For just a small amount extra you can go into the Buddha and see how it was made in sections and locked together."
Truly amazing sight.,I was very lucky as I got to see the Daibutsu (Giant Buddha) statue during the covid Pandemic and the weather was perfect. Only a hand full of people. Easy to get to from both Hase tram station and from Kamakura station. I didn't get to climb the stairs inside the statue as access was closed temporarily but the view of this magnificent Buddha was very inspiring. Do not visit Kamakura and miss this.
Impressive Buddha,Kotoku-in temple is famous for its Great Buddha (Daibutsu). And its worth. The Buddha is quite big (13m tall) and (at least when I was there it wasn't too crowded). If you pay 20yen you can get inside. It's very curious. It's the highlight of Kamakura
Smaller than what I thought,"You can walk into inside of the Buddha at the additional cost of ¥20 (¥300 to enter kotokuin) nothing much to see but when I enter, I felt like going into total darkness but in minutes, I noticed it wasn't dark at all.  The magic of human eyes! * Due to COVID-19, this activity is suspended."
The Biggest bronze Buddha,"The Great Buddha is easily accessible from the local train (Enoshima Electric Railway), coming from Kamakura station to Enoshima, being the local attraction itself. Coming to Buddha You should get off at Hase Station and turn right. It is about 5-8 minutes to reach. Buddha sits on the stone foundation at the area of the former shrine, which was destroyed by tsunami in 1495, leaving the statue in the place. The statue survived also a few earthquakes. The Budda is 14 meters height, sitting in the lotus position, surrounded by the pavillion and small but quite nice garden. Worth to see being in Kamakura.."
Icon of Kamakura,"When people mention about visiting Kamakura, the great Buddha is a must see. The grounds are quite empty, except for the Buddha. I thought it was quite expensive to just go in a see the statue. Also, you need to pay extra (though only 20 yen) to see the inside of the Buddha."
Great experience,"If you have 1 more day, you can visit Kamakura and Enoshima. There is a discounted ticket price of 1,520 yen. You can actually go inside the buddha structure"
Iconic symbol of Kamakura,"This is probably the most iconic and visible symbol of Kamakura.  Accessible by train and near  Hase station.  We took a JR train from Tokyo to Kamakura and then an Enoshima Electric Railway train to Hase station.  From there, we walked about 8 to 10 mins to the Great Buddha.  Entry fees is 200 yen and an additional 20 yen to go inside the statue. We need to pay to take clear photos of the statue as there are no clear views from outside the fence.  Don't need to spend much time here unless you are into religion."
Giant Buddah,"The giant Buddha was my main reason to visit kamakura, it did not disappoint, but then I love religious shrines and statues. It is a huge bronze statue which survived a tsunami in the 15th century. You can go inside and understand how it was constructed. Or wander in the gardens."
Peaceful,"It is always good to spend sometime here to get some fresh air with the spiritual ambiance. Not far from the station, this place is suitable for family visit, to get a good photos, and to learn about Japanese Buddhism. Garden is located behind the statue, and there is an entrance fee."
The Great Buddha of Kamakura,"It's really impressive no matter how many times you have seen it. The sheer size is awe-inspiring. You will get goosebumps just by looking at it. Words are not enough, you have to see it with your own eyes. There's a 300 yen fee to enter the grounds and 20 more to actually enter the statue itself."
Big,"Traveled to Kamakura on the train from Tokyo about an hour and a bit (JR rail pass) what a lovely town  on the coast small narrow streets not much traffic except for the tour buses an enjoyable place just to walk around  from the station to the Buddha is about 20mins and it's worth the walk even, in December there were a lot of tourists if you time it right you can get some good photos"
Great Buddha in the small place,"Kamakura seems like a small prefecture or small town. To get to Kamakura you can take a bus just from outside kamakura station, and pay about 200 yen.The great Buddha itself was really big, and add another 20 yen you can get inside the Buddha, but the stairs was too narrow.The souvenir stores in the Great Buddha area were quiet fascinating, so many small unique stuffs"
Very Pleasant,I like great Buddha's as much as the next guy.  This one was great.  Maybe less than a kilometer away though is the Kosoku-ji temple which had more room to stroll around with interesting and meaningful items around every corner
Kamakura,"We recently travelled down from Yokohama by train (2 trains, including a local electric one) to see the town of Kamakura and walk up to the Big Buddha.  The town is touristy but pleasant to stroll through and quite busy ay the Buddha.  You can buy a ticket to go down inside the statue although we didn't.  The thing I remember- the young train driver jumping out of his cab at the station to help an elderly lady of f the train, together with her shopping trolley."
An amazing place to visit!!,This statue of Great Buddha is unique in Japan and worth visit without doubt. There is the option to see the statue from inside and look how it was constructed. The area of Kamakura is also very unique. Do not miss the chance to walk to the nearest beach which will make you want stay there forever!!!!
A must visit,I really love this place surrounding by attractive place not far from Tokyo temple really peaceful very recommend.
Unique attraction,We spent the day visiting a number of attractions. The big Buddha is an amazing feat . The area is easy to get to by bus from the station. Get a day pass at the information office at the station. An easy day trip from Tokyo with a one hour each way JR train from Tokyo station
Must see if in the area,It is about an hour from Tokyo by the train (JR) and then you can either walk or take the Enoden half way. Kamakura is small town on the Pacific. Great Buddha looks beautiful from all sides. Truly serene.
Must go if visiting Tokyo,I live in Japan and can’t get enough of Daibutsu. Is a 1h train ride from Tokyo.Every time I visit is an amazing time. There’s so much peace around.There’s a small visitation space underneath the Buddha but that one is not worth it.The stores around are great to buy souvenirs and are not pricey as most people would think.
Yep it’s big! ,A great big Buddha set in beautiful clean courtyards and gardens. This is really a must see as part of a trip to Kamakura.
Beautiful statue,"Big Buddha is amongst the main attractions of Kamakura and it delivers. It’s a beautiful big statue of Buddha overlooking the city inside the shrine grounds. Behind the Buddha, there is small shrine grounds but nothing worth mentioning. Overall it’s a smaller Buddha than “Big Buddha” statues in Phuket, Da Nang or Hong Kong but it’s still a pretty marvellous statue in blue color. It’s the second largest Buddha statue in Japan after Todai-ji in Nara, but this looks nicer as it’s outside rather than inside in the other one. You can even enter the statue but we couldn’t as we were too late for it courtesy delayed bus from Hokokuji."
Big Bronze Buddha ,The ancient bronze Buddha statue is iconic of Kamakura .It is relatively small ground to visit. But it is still worth the while to pay a visit if in the area. The fun part of the visit is taking the Enoshima train from Kamakura station.
Famous Buddha Statue I Had to See,"Simple to get to by train from Tokyo.  I opted to walk from the Train Station to the Great Buddha, which was not a problem, a little hot and you need about 30 minutes.  Loved walking the streets of this town and seeing some of the local vibe.  Very busy location and tour buses coming through at a regular pace.  Still lots of good opportunities to take photos.  Walking around the grounds behind the Buddha you can see some interesting architecture, gardens and trees.   Spent the morning around the Buddha then walked to Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gu Shinto Shrine for a couple hours in the afternoon.Ran out of time to do some shopping around Kamakura station, lots of shops and restaurants."
Great Buddha,Giant 30 meter tall statue that you can go inside of too. Nice temple near by too. Easy to get to by train then a short walk. I recommend this destination
Peaceful ,Don’t expect to much since this is a shrine but it’s a great site. Cost ¥300 to enter. Could do solo or like minded friends
Wonderful way to spend an afternoon with Japanese history,"A very easy train trip to see one of the sights I remembered best from living in Japan may years ago.Logistics are easy and well marked--you need to take a private private train 3 stops from the JR Kamakura station for about 15 minutes, and then it is 20 minute direct walk to The Great Bhudda.It is an impressive sight, rivalled only by the larger statute in Nara,We were there on a weekend afternoon, and while there were many people there, it never felt crowded.  As several posters have noted, the look of serenity on the statute dominates the mood there."
"Small but lovely temple garden, enormous Buddha statue of bronze","We enjoyed our trip to Kotoku-in and the beautiful temple. We did go inside the Buddha statue, it was underneath and a little claustrophobic.  Would not recommend it.  The outside and the garden were more worthwhile."
Impressive! ,A lovely garden もみじ or maple foliage enhanced our experience. A  huge statue and there is a great feeling of serenity despite the onslaught of tourists every five minutes. Definitely worth a visit.
Beautiful,It's a beautiful statue and a serene compound. It's worth a visit from Tokyo. But don't visit Kamakura only for this.
Some tips.,"Nothing more to be said about this beautiful statue, it's amazing. Just like everything, if you come early it will be a better experience, but you can't do everything early, I would advise doing this one early. We came a little after opened and were able to get some great unobstructed shots and were able to really enjoy the are and the presence of the Buddha."
Interesting,"In my opinion, it is not worth a visit by itself. But as it is a 5 minutes walk from the Hase Kannon Temple, which we did want to visit, we did go there. After a short visit, we took the bus directly to Kamakura train station."
Wow !!!,"To visit this very impressive monumental statue you have to pay a small amount ( 400,00 Yen ) to enter, is really worth it. When visiting the surroundings of Kamakura it is a ""must"" visiting this area and meet the ""Great Buddha"""
Impressive,Incredible site to see. The Great Buddha of Kamakura was cast 750 years ago.  Get here early to avoid the crowds.  The JR railway takes you to Kamakura station and you ride the local subway (200 ¥ ) three stops to Hase.  The Great Buddha is about  a 10-15 walk from the Hase station.
Nice but could be free of charge,"The price to visit the place is not high, about 5 euro for two people, however as it is just a statue it could be free a charge. It does worth the visit, as European I don't have often the chance to see such a big Buddha statue. So I do suggest to visit but keep in mind that it's not free of charge.Tipp: you can Visite the inside of the Buddha as well for about 10 cent."
Great buda at the Japan old capital,Buda of light is a towering statue made of bronze.It was built by the ruling shogum after winning the war against the opposing party.Once pacified it was an era in which fir example the writing from China was introduced and thus enlightenment
Astonishing peace of metal engineering in ancient Japan,"The center peace of a visit to Kamakura is really worthy to visit. Even with all the crowd of tourists take your time to also enter the statue, but take care of the narrow steps inside. It was build with remarkable skill fro many pieces and has resisted even to the great Kanto earthquake."
Worth a visit,"My wife and I took a day trip. Out of Tokyo down to Enoshima and whilst in the area we visited the Giant Buddha.It is indeed giant, being so big that you can go inside for a small fee. The Buddha is inside a small park with other ornate and interesting items and structures and is a short walk from the train station.This is a definate stop if you are in the area."
Interesting big Buddha statue.,"Entry is at 300 yen. Not much inside but still interesting to visit the big Buddha statue, so I think the price is fair. Avoid the crowd by going early in the morning. Toilets available and also small shop for refreshments and souvenirs."
Big,Pretty big Buddha providing good photo op. Little town of Kamakura was nice to explore along the streets. Old style town
Amazing,This Buddha is amazing.  This Buddha is quite big and the craftmanship is impressive.  This was one of my favorite Buddha's to see.  You can walk inside of him...very cool.
Apart from the Buddah....,"This is a very average temple. The age of the Buddha and the fact that it has survived quakes and fires is a testament to it's builders many hundreds of years ago. For ¥20 you can go inside to see how it was constructed. Good to wander around as there are small lakes, and the inevitable souvenir shops capital8sing on tourists. In itself quite an un-inspiring site other than the large Buddah."
Worth looking at,"the sheer size of the statue is quite impressive, just think about how there used to be roof above...and it is said that ancient coins were melted to forge the hull of the buddha, full of interesting thoughts really."
Great town,"We went from Tokyo to Kamakura for a day trip and we loved it. They say it’s like a “mini Kyoto”. The big Buddha is such a sight and we went to a couple of other shrines too. It was a good calm day, nice to get out of the craziness of Tokyo too."
An impressive statue,"Jump on a local train out of Shimbashi . Get off at Kamakura and change to the small electric train for Hase. It’s then just a short walk through the village past numerous small restaurant and local craft shops selling many good quality souvenirs to the Great Buddha.What a beautiful serene statue it is , surrounded by tidy cool green gardens where there is ample seating to rest and contemplate life .Allocate yourself plenty of time for this visit. It’s a wandering day time to relax."
Amazing,"This statue is stunning in person, but there is not much to see immediately around. The Buddha is enough to merit a visit."
Great Indeed,It was far from Tokyo but it was worth the ride. There was an entrance of ¥300 and a little more if you want to go insiden the statue. So many tourists yes but mostly students. Definitely worthy to add in you itinerary in your next or first visit to Tokyo. It’s just less than an hour travel from Tokyo and there’s still so much to do in Kamakura after here.
Family,"Nicely set garden temple with a 7 centuries old Buddha statue and great surrounding too. Kamakura city is worth visiting as the tempo is slower and the other Hasedera temple ,which is within walking distance from each others, is equally serene with nice garden setting to fill the calm ambience."
The buddha is really big,"I've seen people uploading photos on the great Buddha in Kamakura a long time before I finally had the chance to visit it. With its long history, it's really surprising how well-maintain it was. so I finally ventured into Kamakura about two weeks ago and see it with my own eyes. My first impression of it was - Wow! It's really big! It looks quite sturdy, and of course it looks very good at its' age. I didn't enter the Buddha, but just the look of it from the outside is quite impressive already. The shop in the temple sell goodies/cookies/snacks that features the Great Buddha too. Not to forget, all the good luck charms/Omamori you could get as souvenirs for friends and relatives. I'm not sure how many of the tourists who visited the place felt this way, but I felt extremely peaceful while I'm at the temple."
Great photo opportunity ,Very easy to get great photos at this attraction. Everyone there was very respectful of others taking your photos. Well worth making the trip
Not that impressive,"While it is certainly remarkable that they built such a big statue with a very ingenious technique, it is really just one statue and nothing more. Pass by if you will but don’t go too much out of your way for it."
Impressive Statue of the Buddha,"The Great Buddha stands nearly 12 metres high and is an impressive sight. Made of bronze, the verdigris patina adds to the grandeur of the statue. Make sure you go inside, where you can see how they re-welded the head in 1960. A must see if visiting Kamakura or Tokyo."
The big Buddha,"A must to visit to see the big Buddha, spectacular. About 40 mins from Tokyo. Crowded with many tourists."
The reason for visiting Kamakura,"This attraction hardly needs commendation, since it's why everyone comes to Kamakura. It exceeded expectation - a most impressive statue and ambience. It is worth looking round the rest of the town, too."
"The One and Only Great Budda...exceeds expectations, awesome","Kotoku-in or the Great Budda of Kamakura will exceed you expectations, in size and profound impact.  Many visitors but well managed and not swarming with tourists."
Beautiful,Very nice area to walk around in and enjoy some of the best temples in Kamakura.  Beware of mosquitoes!
Just Another Daibutsu,"If you haven't seen a giant buddha and you're in Kamakura, go for it! If you want to complete your collection of visiting all the Daibutsus in Japan, go for it!  Otherwise, there may be other Kamakura sights more worth your time."
Simply amazing,"The location of the giant buddha is about 18 minutes walk from yuigahama station or about 25 minutes from Kamakura station. It is a nice place to visit with friends and family, there are also lots of seats around and a garden."
An absolute must,"The great Buddha or Daibutsu. THE main tourist attraction in Kamakura. When I came here for the very first time in 1973(!) and you compare it with the present situation a lot and I really mean a lot has changed. In 1973 I was about the only Western tourist in town while at present you are swamped with (mostly Chinese) tourist. Of course the whole town has changed with it and lost, in my humble opinion, a great deal of its original charm. Nevertheless a visit to the Daibutsu is a must if you are in Tokyo. It takes about a 1 hour by train from central Tokyo to get there. But again be warned: you will not be alone over there.The Daibutsu can be reached by bus from the station or you can take a pleasant 30 minute’s walk. In all cases it will be a visit you will never forget."
An impressive sight,A very beautiful bronze Buddha statue. Only 100 yen entry. About 2k walk from the station and worth it.
Impressive statue,"An impressive bronze Buddha statue in Kamakura. It was 200 Yen to enter (July 2019) and for an extra 20 Yen, you can go inside the statue. It was interesting to see inside the Buddha, but probably not worth the queues when it's very busy. The statue is inside a large open complex, so it doesn't feel too cramped despite the large crowds that go to see the statue. Recommended if you're already visiting Kamakura, but there are better things to see here if you're in a rush (e.g., some of the other shrines)."
The thing to see in Kamakura,"The Great budda is the one thing you have to see in Kamakura. I would not go specially there to see it, but if you are spending some time in the area, it is worth going.  There is a very nice hiking trail beginning just behind the Great Buddha."
Remarkable,This is a popular site so be prepared for a crowd. The Great Buddha is 750 years old and an iconic image. Read the history and posters about this before going or while there. It’s an additional ¥20 to go inside but it is worthwhile if you are interested in the construction.
"Yes, a BIG Buddha","This Buddha is the 2nd largest Buddha statue in Japan. What is amazing is that it was built 750 years ago! For 20 yen, you can actually walk into the statue and see how it was constructed. The entrance into it is at the rear side."
Place of visit an original big buddha.,"Rather than constant shopping, not bad for a family trip to travel to this area and visit this area. See and understand how in medieval times a bronze buddha was constructed."
I came here to get a glimpse  of  mount Fuji and got a Big Surprise,"I wanted  to see  mount  Fuji with  out  traveling  to far  so I  researched  this  small  town  was  a  good  bet  but   only on  a  clear day however  I  came  across  Great  Buddha of Kamakura and  Its  Spectacular, this whole  area is a  lovely  place  with  a lot  more  shines to  see  but  I  headed   for  the  beach to  see  if  Mount  fuji  was  appearing lol, but  it  was  to  over cast  as  it  was  a very  hot  day.  The  sand  is  black  and  the small seaside  was  not  busy and  had  a  great  walk  around it  was a lovely  day.  I  stayed  around  for  about  3  hours its    a  lovely place  to  be in and  peaceful.  I found a  Sandwich  bar  on  the  main  road back   to   the  station  from  the  sea  front see  photo,  this  Amazing   sandwich  cost 200 Yen with  fry's and a  large coffee it  was  delicious it only took  an  hour   from  Tokyo  train  station so  I  am  so  glad  I   came. I would  recommend this  place  even  thou  there is not a lotto  see  because its  so  peaceful  after  Tokyo and  Iove  to check  out  new  places"
Amazing,Our daughter took us here when we visited her in Japan. It made me feel so calm and peaceful to be in the presence of this.
Good atmosphere,Worth a visit if you're less than 1-2 hours away. There is a beach and shopping streets nearby so it makes a good day trip. The shrines are a must see and there is a traditional atmosphere in the area.
a very big Buddha ,"The great Buddha of Kamakura is one of the biggest Buddha in the world. The height including the pedestal is about 13.4 meters. Be aware there is nothing else to see then the buddha. Long time ago the Buddha was housed in a hall, but they get destroyed by strong winds. Normally you can visit also the inside of the Buddha, but we had very bad weather so we were not able to visit."
Impressive,"Well worth a visit - the Buddha comes into view from behind some trees and really hits you. Can get very busy , but the scale dwarfs the crowds"
A beautiful statue of Buddha,"Another nice place to visit on your trip in Kamakura, as the bronze statue is amazing to admire upclose,you can also go inside the statue for 20yen."
Must see in Kamakura,"The other temples and shrines in Kamakura are indeed historic, inspiring and beautiful, but the Great Buddha is truly a wonder to see.  Yes, there are larger Buddhas in China and Hong Kong, but remember that this bronze Buddha was cast in the year 1252 and stands some 11.4 meters high.  It originally was housed in a large temple hall, but the temple buldings were destroyed many times by typhoons and tsunamis, so the Great Buddha has been out in the open air since the late 15th Century.  Fascinating to see and set in a beautiful courtyard surrounded by temple buildings and nice gardens.  It's very close to the Hase-dera Temple."
Impressive!,"There is a minimal entry fee.  Upon entering the gates you will go through a nice garden, then see the Great Buddha.  It has an interesting history, and the workmanship is especially nice considering it was completed in 1252. We entered right when it opened at 8:00 am, there were only two others there.  The Buddha has a calm countenance. We also paid a small fee to see the interior of the statue. Booths are set up nearby for shopping with religious items for sale.  There is also a shop behind a wall to the left of The Buddha, that has many small souvenirs to purchase. There are also two huge sandals on a wall to the right.  Please remember that this is place where people practice their religion, so be respectful when others are praying or making an offering."
Amazing,Definitely a must do if you’re in Japan.We did this as a day trip from Tokyo. It was easily accessible by train. The great Buddha is beautiful !!The surrounding gardens are lovely too. We were expecting that Saturday would be crowded but it wasn’t.Plenty of gift shops near by for souvenirs
Must see in Kamakura,"When visiting all the temples and shrines in Kamakura, this should be on your list. You can buy good luck charms & souvenirs here also, or in the shops in the street."
Stately and serene,"One of the two major sights in Kamakura, the Daibutsu is a must-see. The temple associated with this figure is Kōtoku-in, and worth taking a look at too.As with most Japanese shrines or temples, seasonal gardens are also a major feature. We visited in late spring, so the azaleas were in full, perfumed bloom and looked glorious.The Daibutsu itself is an incredible sight, especially on a day with clear blue skies. If you’re lucky, you might even see a kite (the bird) soaring above it. Take the time to look at the fine detail on both the Buddha and things like the incense burner in front of it. I could look into that serene face for a long time!We took the opportunity (20 yen) to go inside the Daibutsu and climb up to see the way the structure was made. Our Japanese host chose not to. I’m not sure if this was because she was afraid of the dark, or whether she thought it was disrespectful. I felt uncomfortable doing so as a result, but I suppose if it was truly disrespectful the temple officials wouldn’t allow it, would they?"
Great Buddha ,It is rather easy to access from Kamakura station by bus. One can pay to enter the Buddha statue to understand how the statue is being built.
Nice Buddha statue,Had been there. It is quite tall and while entering the statue we realize that it is neither easy to construct or restore these monuments.
Big but not huge,All depends on what you’ve seen already. On our travels I’ve seen much bigger budhas than this one. It’s a nice average big budha :-)  in nice surroundings. Exceptional it is not. But still worth a visit.
It's a big Buddha,"The temple is most famous for the big Buddha at the centre of it. It's humongous, but not as big as the one in Todai Ji. Nor is it made of Bronze. Overall, this one loses in comparison to the temple in Nara, but it gets points for trying. Not everything can be number one, but this can be number two. Besides that, there isn't actually that much to do here. I tried to get a goshuin here, but the shop closed early for some reason. It's fine though, I got my last goshuin at hasedera for the goddess Kannon, which was the same as my first one."
Big Buddha and temple,Something like 900 years old.  2nd highest in Japan I think.  Made of copper I believe.  Lots of cool artsy statues.   Nice courtyard.
Must see,"400 yen each to get in, easy access. Done within 10 mins really, but lovely sculpture worth a visit. Great amount of detail"
Big nice Buddha,"If you visit Kamakura, the Kotoku In Tempel is a must. A impressive Buddha is standing in the middle. But: It is very crowded and the temple complex could be better designed."
Very impressive Statue,"One of the large Buddha statues in Japan and a very impressive bronze statue, visited by scores of tourists and locals.  Lot of souvenir shops around."
A great visit,"This was on my list to do for a long time and it certainly didn’t disappoint. It’s one of the most amazing experiences I’ve had in a long time. The area was very organized, cleaned and everyone was so polite and friendly."
Just love to be around that area,"The place has the mixed reviews, but we loved it. Peaceful vibes, the statue itself is impressive. Yes, we saw many statues of Buddha in Sri Lanka, Bhutan, Myanmar, Thailand…you can’t compare them because each of statue has own energy.  Obviously, we did not go inside the Buddha."
IMPRESSIVE!  Eiffel Tower of Kamakura,"Everyone goes here so felt a bit touristy but, it is worth a visit.  We took the train to Hase.  Lots of cute shops on the walk to the Kotoku-in."
Beautiful shrine ,Beautiful shrine with plenty of things to seeFirst the Buddha you can visit from the inside. A sort of lady liberty visitNext the entire shrine is amazing with beautiful flowers and vibrant colours Go early in the morning to avoid the crowds
Beautiful,"Not the most convenient place to get to but it is worth coming. The big statue has a certain aura and beauty. The setting is peaceful, though there are lots of people. It's a pity there is really nothing else besides the statue in the compound."
Many Images of Buddha in Japan are Impressive - This Is Among the Best,"The Great Buddah of Kamakura is a National Treasure dating back to 1252-1262 A.D. and was built at the Kotokuinn Temple.  Originally it was gilt with gold foil and if you look closely, there are some small spots where there is evidence of the last remaining gold.  Originally, it was enclosed in a large wooden structure that was destroyed by typhoons, and tidal damage (1369 and 1495).  It remains now exposed to the weather and has stood the test of time.  This image is the second largest in Japan with a sitting height of 11.3 meters.  Nara has the largest statue housed in the Toodaiji Temple.  Despite being smaller in size, many consider the Kamakura Buddha to be the superior image.  It is certainly amazing to consider the skill of the craftsmen at this early period in history.  This is a worthwhile visit."
Come before closing...,"The great Buddha Kamakura (in Japanese Kamakura Daibutsu) is the main attraction for which tourists go to Kamakura. The 13-meter statue is the second tall bronze Buddha of Japan after the champion at Todaiji temple in Nara. We visited the bronze Buddha champion in Nara a week after his fellow in Kamakura. Here it is necessary to emphasize that we are talking about bronze Buddhas. Kamakura Daibutsu is very far from the Japanese champion, the third highest Buddha in the world, 120-meter stone Daibutsu in the city of Usiku. But Ushiku Daibutsu is uninteresting remake of 1993 and the Kamakura Daibutsu is the history. Presumably 1252. That time the capital of Japan was moved here from Kyoto to a century and a half.  As the Daibutsu of Nara, the Kamakura Buddha used to sit inside the temple. However, Kamakura unlike Nara is a coastal town and the walls of temple were washed into the sea,by tsunami in 1498. Buddha of Kamakura is now breathing in the sea air. Fortunately the beach is 700 meters in a straight line. Buddha, which we see, by the way, is not a wooden original, but a bronze remake. It may not even be the first one. As you know, the samurai Kamakura did not keep the design documentation...The bronze Buddha is hollow inside, which is indicated by a hole in the back. It`s possible go inside for little money (20 yen). However, we came under the closure and ride with viewing the hollow inside of the Buddha has ended. The pre-closure visit resulted in a relatively small number of tourists. A big plus for today's times."
Big Buddha highlight of a big Kamakura day,"We visited Kamakura with our guide Shizuko, from Pinpoint Travel. She was fantastic as she guided us through public transport to reach this marvellous temple. Her knowledge of the history was amazing as she related the stories behind this Buddha and how it came to be freestanding. The relevance of Japan’s frequent tsunamis on this huge statue was clearly given in Shizuko’s very good English. The whole area is so peaceful with many opportunities to offer traditional requests of the Buddha."
big budha statue,"big budha statute at kamakura! the daibutsu is so amazing, when i visited this place, it still morning andpeople still less, it was peaceful. you alco can enter the budha to see how the inside by pay 60yen> i forgot how much it was. lol"
Must see when you are in Kamakura.,This is Kamakura's most iconic sight.  The statue was completed in 1252.  It's inspired by the big buddha from Nara.
Amazing ,An amazing sight to be seen. You can actually go inside the giant bronze Buddha. I would recommend a tour guide like Japan Wonder travel or others to help with touring around Kamakura. It's only an hour or so on the train from Tokyo.
Hours,"Be careful!  This site says it’s open until 6:00 pm but it’s only open until 5:30 pm and the hours vary by season!  We got there at 5:21 and couldn’t get in because they stop selling tickets 15 min prior to closing.  Eat dinner after, not before, or you’ll miss it! 😡"
Large Buddha,This is a large bronze Buddha  that is similar to the one in Nara. This one is outside and you can go inside to view it from the inside.  You take a cute train from Kamakura to Hasa and then it is a short walk to the temple
Inspiring Trip,"An hour south of Tokyo by train is Kamakura, home of Kotoku-in, a Buddhist temple where the Daibutsu (Great Buddha of Kamakura) is located. The temple is a place of relaxation where one can absorb the peacefulness of the temple, even with the number of tourists present during our visit. The interior of the Great Buddha (20 yen admission) reveals construction details that are quite interesting when you consider the shrine was assembled in the 13th century.The temple can be reached by several ways, but walking to the temple affords one the opportunity to investigate the many stores & sites along the route if you walk up from the train station or take in nature should you choose one of the walking trails. The local train to and from the Daibutsu has multiple stops & a stop at Enoshima allows you kick your shoes off & walk along the black sand beaches"
"Its BIG, go see it","If you are in Kamakura then this really should be a must see. Not as impressive as the Nara Big Buddha, but much easier to do in a day trip from Tokyo. It was great to come to this after doing the Daibutsu hiking trail from Kita-Kamakura. Google ‘timetravelturtle’ for the Kamakura day trip plan. The hiking trail is so peaceful, and such alone time - can be hard to find sometimes."
1-day tour of Kamakura and Enoshima,"Our 1-day tour of Kamakura and Enoshima, organized by Sunrise Tours (booked through Japanican), was one of the most enjoyable and memorable experiences during our 2-month stay in Japan. The huge statue of Lord Buddha in the open space, surrounded by natural beauty, has an intrinsic touch of peace. But, what is unique about the statue of Lord Buddha in Kamakura is that we could enter into the hollo statue and pray there. The visit to Enoshima in the post-lunch session ended with the splendid view of the beach and blue sea water from the shinto shrine on a hill."
"Many tourists, but ...","There were many tourist, but there was a nice travel way through the nature. I went out at Kita-Kamakura. There was a nice temple complex too. Then I want straight thrugh the nature to the Great Buddha. It was a very nice trip. Please use your feet a little bit more, to see much more from the country side."
Worth Visiting,"The statue of Buddha was our last stop on a day's trip through Kamakura - sadly we arrived too late that day to actually be able to enter the buddha and take a look from the inside, so best arrive a bit earlier to closing hour. Its a worthy stop to take while in Kamakura, and within walking distance from the center if you don't mind a few more strides."
Amazing!!,A must if you visit Japan. Huge Buddha statue surrounded by a beautiful garden. You can enter the statue to see how it was built. Arrive early in the morning to avoid crowds.
It's Big,It's very big and very old. Impressive that they could build it so big back in the day before power tools. You can photo it for Instagram and maybe offer a prayer or meditate. But that's it - nothing else needed.
Just astounding... you will be amazed this was constructed over 750 years ago.,"There are so many temples and cultural sites to visit in Japan, this was one of the best we saw. Just astounding that it has survived for nearly 800 years. Worth the effort, get there early as the large bus groups started to arrive as we were leaving."
Great Buddha of Kotoku-in ,"Only thing to see there is the monumental bronze statue of Buddha, one of the National Treasures of Japan. Both from within and without."
The main reason for visiting Kamakura,"Even at about 10am there were quite a few people here (not too crowded), but the Great Buddha is worth visiting. It's not the biggest I've seen (I have been to the one in Hong Kong) but it's certainly the oldest. It was constructed in the 13th century and has outlasted every building put up around it. Very impressive.Admission is 200 yen. If you want to go inside the Daibutsu (it's hollow), that's 20 yen and I frankly think it's worth it at that price."
Kamakura and the Great Buddha of Kamakura,Kamakura is a small town located near Yokohama and Tokyo. You can reach the town  by train and walk around it. The Kotoku-in temple should be visited where the statue of Great Buddha is located. The town has also beaches to the ocean and it is possible to swim or do water sports in summer season.
Definitely worth a visit ,"The Giant Buddha of Kamakura is amazing, set in a tranquil spot. It provides an excellent opportunity for reflection. It is definitely worth seeing if you are in the area."
One for the bucket list ticked off.,Since my mother came here when she travelled to Japan in the 1960’s I’ve always had a fascination of the Buddha of Kamakura. Well today I can tick it off my bucket list. The place is magical and very peaceful. I was lucky as there wasn’t many people here. The statue is enormous but the setting is beautiful. I was even impressed that I was able to go inside and the inside of the statue. I am grateful in seeing this.
The 3rd largest bronze Buddha statue,"The bronze Buddha of Kotoku-in is the 3rd largest Buddha statue in Japan. Based on history, the statue was originally house within a temple. However, several temple fires have destroyed the buildings, eventually it was decided that the Buddha statue be left outdoors. An admission ticket will be required to enter the temple grounds, additional fees is required should you wish to enter the Buddha statue. The statue itself is magnificent and the garden that surrounds it gives a very Zen feeling of the place. Please arrive at the temple early should you want to avoid the never-ending crowds at this attraction. PS: Other than the bronze Buddha statue, there is nothing much in my opninon around the temple grounds. There's a shrine behind the statue, a gift shop and a small tea house."
An Incredible Sight,"Stunning views of the Great Buddha at Kamakura.  Caused us to stop and admire the statue, walked around it a couple of times to appreciate its size and art work.A great tribute to the religion of Buddha."
Buddha in Kamakura,This temple close to Kamakura is a must see. The size of the statue will take your breath away. The gardens around it also will give you a closeness to nature.
Beautiful Statue of Great Buddha,It is a beautiful statue of seated buddha. Construction of the statue began in 1252 and it took ten years to complete it!! Thre is a nice garden around the statue
Less is More Part 362 - Big Beautiful Bold Bronze ,"Quite unbelievable that the Daibutsu at the Kotoku-in in Kamakura is nearly 800 years old! It has aged very well.  Although neither the largest nor tallest, it is evidently the most famous and iconic - something to do with the proportions, the expression or serene natural setting OR ALL THREE. Interesting to find out that it was originally housed indoors but those structures sheltering it were repeatedly destroyed by earthquakes and floods over the years. The last one was in 1498 and since then the statue has stood outdoors. A visit does does not take very long since it is actually quite a small place. Getting in costs much less than parking for an hour nearby (200¥ vs. 800¥). For a mere 20¥ more, you can get inside the statue. It’s a novelty since there’s hardly anything to see inside. On a chilly wintry morning, the crowds are thin. Not much has changed since our last visit 30 years ago, except the touristy souvenirs have become more tacky. Daibutsu lollipops? Daibutsu snow globes? Daibutsu cartoon key chains? Daibutsu socks anyone?"
Just Beautiful,"Looking at pictures of this place doesn’t do it justice to how seeing it in person feels. There is also a walkway around the side and the foliage is nice to stop and appreciate as well. This is a good day trip from Yokohama and we went in the afternoon/evening and but if you go later and are using the rail pass, keep in mind there is a cut off time for transportation hours from the site."
Beautiful and serene place ,"I love this place! The great Buddha is breathtaking and the atmosphere is calm and serene. Easily accessible by bus directly from the train station, 200 yen in coins for the ride."
Not Just A Big Buddah!,"First of all, DON'T book yourself onto one of the expensive Kamakura day tours - it is easily accessible from Tokyo (took me about an hour on the train from Asakusa area) and Hasedera and Kotoku-in (Big Buddha) are within 10 minutes walk of Hase train station, and you can't go wrong, just head up the main road from the station - Hasedera is on the left, Kotoku-in on the right a little further up. The cost to enter both are minimal (I think about 300 yen), and the return train trip about 2000 yen, so you will save yourself an absolute FORTUNE doing this under your own steam, unless, of course, you are desperate for the minimal history a tour guide gives you that is easily found on the internet!The Buddha is impressive, but this shrine has more to offer including some architecture and plants/trees that are quite beautiful! Not worth coming to Kamakura just for this one thing, though, as you only need about an hour, so team it up with one or two other good sites like Hasedera and the beach! There are also many little shops and cafes lining the main road that are well worth a look!"
Great Buddha of Kamakura,The Great Buddha of Kamakura was indeed great. It was a long trip by train and a bus ride but I’m so glad we went to see him. You can actually go inside the Buddha but we did not because it was very warm outside and the line was very long. They have a place you can buy charms or other things like prayer beads. There’s not a lot to do right around him but that’s ok because he was magnificent. On your way back to your bus stop there are little shops lining the streets that you can pick up anything from souvenirs to a brand new knife set. A short bus ride back to Kamakura station gives you plenty of food options.
Top!,One of the best places I’ve ever been! It’s absolutely suggestive to stay around the Great Buddha and it’s an experience that I’ll remember for the rest of my life!!
Great Buddha of Kamakura,Kamakura is a short trip from Tokyo. You can catch a train at Tokyo Station. We paid 950JYP in Dec.2018 for the train ticket. It includes the romatic train that connects to Kamakura. The Buddha wasn’t that big at all. We also went inside the Buddha for a fee. From Kamakura we also went to Hase Temple. It was a short walk. It‘s a half a day tour.
JPY200 entrance fee for adults ,Visit other places before you visit the great Buddha statue. Make this as your second last place to visit before you go back to the station to go back to Tokyo. You must visit Hase-dera Temple from here
Munumental,"This is a must see when visiting Japan.  It is impressive, not only because of its size but of the way and the time when it was built."
A place of Peace,"Even if the area of the Great Buddha is normally full of viitors it is worth to go there... a beautiful place and an interesting monument (you can even go INSIDE the bronze Buddha Statue!). Its a ""Place of Power"" - and it is very nice to go there by the local trains (not expensive, fast and easy from Tokyo!) Really a great place to visit."
"A Trek to See It, but Worth the Walk","If you get lost like I did (in 1992 and 25 years later, in 2018) and end up doing the walking trail (as I did, in the mud), just be prepared for a lot of hiking.  However, that's just getting there the hard way.  When you arrive, it's so worth it.  The serenity of the whole place just overwhelms there, and you want to stay and admire this sculpture and just reflect on life itself."
peaceful,I have not been to the big Buddha for the last 20 years.  Did a day trip from Tokyo. Started early and arrived before 9 am. Calming and majestic. I paid 20 yen j more to get inside the belly of the Buddha. Tour groups started pouring in around 9 am. Avoid weekends.
The Great Buddha of Kamakura,"We just re-visited the Great Buddha of Kamakura, which I remember visiting as a student in high school long ago.  It seemed much more impressive then, somehow.  But it's still a significant presence.  You can go inside the statue and see how it was constructed with the ancient technology of the time.  Impressive.  I asked my granddaughter if she thought the Buddha was beautiful.  She said he was ugly.  Oh, well.  The image does capture the introspective atmosphere of Buddhist meditation, which, after all, is focused on the non-being of the self, or ultimate emptiness or nothingness of all things."
Definitely worth a visit,"Majestic, peaceful and massive - this Buddha is worth a visit. Burn some incense, say a prayer and take in the calm. Stroll around the surrounding areas and absorb the harmony."
Amazing piece of history and culture,A must see if you are headed to Kamakura for a day trip from Tokyo or staying in the area itself. Absolutely magnificent to look and gaze upon something that’s been there for 500 years plus.
Stunning ,Anyone in admiration of Lord Buddha can’t miss this location. A pleasant walk from station and a beautiful setting of the statue in nature.
A must,I used the eno-kamakura free pass which it gave me the roundtrip fromShinjuku and the enoden for the day.The great buddha was totally worth it. What it wasnt worth it to enter there. Only 20 only yens to enter there. If youre curious go ! But there is no light and really small place
I hadn't visited  the Daibutsu for  at  least  twenty years. It was good to refresh my memory and the history.,"Following Haseji Temple, I visited Koutokuin Temple and its Daibutsu (gigantic Buddha statue) as the end of  a day tour of Kamakura with an  American friend. It is basically a bronze statue with a height of thirteen meters including the sitting bench. It was built in the 13th century. Originally it was housed inside a temple but has been sitting outside after the temple collapsed in the 14th century. What is remarkable is the fact that the statue retains its original features from the 13th century. The Great Buddha in Toudaiji Temple, Nara is older and taller, but very little of the original statue has been retained. The inside of the statue is hollow and you are allowed to enter. Although it was a week day the Daibutsu was busy with many tourists and students on school excursions. I hadn't visited  the Daibutsu for  at  least  twenty years and it was good to refresh my memory and the history of the statue."
Very serene place to visit.,Such a peaceful place and a must see when you're in Japan. We were lucky that it wasn't so crowded when we came. The village itself is a must go to.
Ticking Out The Bucket List,"We visited this Kotoku-in Shrine with the giant Budha bronze (Daibutsu). We took the local train from Shinagawa to Uruga, which stops at Yokohama. From Yokohama station, we went to platform 9 and took Yokosuka Line which stops at Kamakura station. The trip from Yokohama station to Kamakura station took around 25 minutes. From Kamakura station, we walked around 1.9km through 2 traffic tunnels to the shrine. Signs are easily found on the streets showing which direction to go to the shrine. Walking in Kamakura was also nice, given the cool December weather, with a light rain. The shrine itself was not as impressive as we thought before. The seated Budha bonze statue is huge, but we have seen similar statues in other countries. Nonetheless, the shrine was very serene, clean, and provided lots of benches for visitors or prayers. Daibutsu is a national treasure and was constructed in 12th century. Entrance fee per person is 200 Yen."
Stunning!,"Must see in Kamakura! For me, the level of awesomeness is at par with the daibatsu in Todaiji (Nara Park). It’s a stroll going there from the station. The goodies outside the temple is pretty cool as well."
Second biggest bronze Buddha statue,"Fairly crowded even on a weekday.  That's to be expected as this is a favorite tourist site in Kamakura.We rented the electric bike from the train station shop, so it was a short 15 minute ride and the best thing was we parked right at the entrance where they have spécial  bicycle rack."
Spiritual grounds for Buddhism practitioners ,"The grounds wasn’t extraordinary big and packed with lots of visitors. This may be one of the must see points of interest in Kamakura. The Great Buddha of Kamakura, the 2nd tallest bronze Buddha statue in Japan, resides outdoors on the grounds of Kotoku-in Temple. Exposure to the elements have rendered the bronze to a mottled green color. Nonetheless the size of Buddha statue is pretty awesome. One can picture this location is significant for Buddhism practitioners. For 20 yens, you can go inside the Buddha and view the statue construction from within. Not much to see in there. It’s only a 10 minute walk to the Hase Station to ride the electric Enoden train back to terminal station in Kamakura. We then took the JR train from there back to Tokyo."
It's the Big Buddha.,"Admittedly, this is why we came to Kamakura to see the Big Buddha. I mean it's literally reason that place exists. It's usually a pretty busy place, lots of people milling around and for something like 10 yen, you can go inside the Buddha to look around. It's kinda dull in there, you can't climb up but who can say they've been inside a Buddha statue? There's a lot of shrines and temples in the area and a nice little noodle shop where we each got a bowl of the house special ""Buddha Face"" which is a bowl of udon noodles made to look like the Buddha. Sure it's kitch but tasty kitch."
Beautiful bronze Buddha statue,The temple is located in Kamakura which is a short train ride from Tokyo using JR line and a short local train ride when you arrive to the Kamakura station.  It’s not a big site itself but the Buddha statue is huge and worth the trip.  You’ll get some great photos for sure.There are many cute shops and nice restaurant in the area so take your time to explore.  There is a greater sushi place called Sushi Yamamoto that you must try.  See my review on this restaurant for details.
Big Buddha,"Buddha hasn't changed at all but the area looks different over decade. There is direct blue line from Tokyo, now. I do not recall if we could get in the Buddha before but this time you pay 20 Yen to be inside of the Big Buddha. Actually nothing special, it is just inside of the vacant cast.. but new experience to be inside of Buddha. It was nice village to walk around."
"Impressive, pair with a visit to a temple or shrine","My son lives near Kamakura, so we took the train here as a day trip. We walked to the Great Buddha (mid-week, off season, and still lots of people with us, so I imagine it gets pretty hectic - think about doing it early morning for some peace & quiet). You can take a walking tour if you want, not too expensive. You can also pay a small amount to go inside the Buddha, which I thought was pretty interesting. The town has several temples and shrines; we visited the Hasedera, which is near the Main Street as we walked back to the train station.."
Beautiful statue in a tranquil setting,I followed on my visit to Hachimangu shrine by walking to see the Kotoku in statue of the Buddha. It really is a very impressive structure with a fascinating history. Peaceful setting that should be treated with due reverence. Once of the highlights of my trip to Japan.
VERY EASY Subway ride from Tokyo,"We left late morning, got on one train, rode for 45 minutes and we made it to Kamakura. great little town with tons of shops and restaurants. Perfect sightseeing day. Lots of people taking photos but you can also go inside of the buddha."
Must See,I would recommend taking a tour here to appreciate the history of the Giant Buddha and the temple. It is truly amazing and you will enjoy the walk. We never tire of this destination
"Astounding in size, an amazing accomplishment weighing more than 100 tons, constructed in 1250 or so.","Well worth a train ride to Kamakura to see this amazing structure. It towers over visitors and as a side benefit, you can go down some small stairs (watch your step) and see the interior of the bronze behemoth. Despite all the people viewing Buddha, it's easy to get great photos of the huge icon."
Awesome,"You have to go to the beautiful coastal town of Kamakura. This beautiful resort town served as the political center of the Japanese administration in the 14th century. Kamakura can be reached by train from Tokyo Train Station, on JR Yokosuka Line. The duration of the trip is between one hour and an hour and a half. Another option is to rent a car and travel by yourself to Kamakura, an hour and a half drive. - After arriving at the Kamakura train station, take the Enoden train line and get off at Hase Station. From there, take 5-10 minutes on foot to the main attraction of Kamakura - the Great Buddha of Kamakura, also known as Daibutsu. The bronze statue of this impressive Buddha is in Kotokuin Temple, 11.3 meters high and is the second highest Buddha in Japan. If you wish, you can enter the Buddha (paid, of course). The statue was created in 1251 and originally stood in one of the great halls of the temple. However, the temple's buildings were destroyed several times by various natural disasters in the 14th-15th centuries, so that since 1495, the Buddha has been standing in the open air. Entrance is reasonably priced. Opening hours: Daily from 8:00 to 17:30 (from October to March until 17:00). How long should I visit? Between half an hour and an hour."
Picture Worthy,It is definitely impressive to see such a large statue. To avoid the crowds I recommend going weekdays during non-summer months.   All you need is 30mins here to take some photos and read some of the information - I recommend going to Hasedera next which is a 5min walk.
Truly impressive!,"Yes, it is as impressive as you've seen in photos and film.  A truly beautiful piece of art, set in a lovely garden.  Worth spending the 20 Yen to also go inside to observe the structure.  A simply sublime statue!  Easy to reach from Tokyo."
A must do in Japan,"A wonderful place to visit. If you are in Tokyo it is so easy to go, one hour and a half by public transportation from Shinjuku Station. Once you get the place you will find a sublime spot surrounded by nature, as you walk in to the Kotoku-in or Great Buddha of Kamakura, you will feel that sublime sensation of peace. I went on summertime weekday around mid-day, it was no so crowded which allows to enjoy the place."
"A large Buddha, many crowds","Compare to some of the more peaceful places in Kamakura, I found this great Buddha to be too crowded to find any peace, Having said that it is impressive, and worth a view."
Visit the Great Buddha of Kamakura,The Great Buddha statue is worth seeing. Once entering the grounds and the first simples of the Great Buddha are memorable and impressive.
"It's a place to go, preferably on weekdays as on the weekend the park will be quite busy","Yes, you need to pay entry feeIt's a nice place to go while in Tokyo only 45 min from Shinagawa by train"
Beautiful Buddha,Dont miss this place. You Can even go inside the Buddha for a small fee ( 20 yen ) Close to “Hase” train station. 200 yen entrance fee.
"The Great Buddha of Kamakura, Japan","The Great Buddha is highly recommend to see in Kamakura area of Yokohama, Japan.During your visit, you will experience an  impressive sight to behold the Great Buddha. You will find lots of people praying in front of the Great Buddha you will be drawn in by the powerful experience of the Great Buddha. The height of the Buddha is 37.1 feet high and  the beautiful Bronze Buddha is placed in a seated meditative pose.Many Japaneses locals come from all around Japan to pay homage to the Great Buddha and hope their prayers are heard and answered.The Buddhist Religion is one of many religions in Japan & Asia and those who  worship Buddha are very serious in their belief of the powerful Buddha.Please when you visit the Great Buddha, honor and respect and feel free to join in with a prayer.You just might find deep in your heart the power of the Great Buddha itself...   Once again the visit is highly recommend by all even if it's 30 minutes to a hour; the visit is really worth the time and effort, you will not be disappointed!Now for Handicap people you will not any problems visiting the Great Buddha. It's a very enjoyable area.Just one of many things to visit in Yokohama, Japan...Till Later; Be-Safe   Happy TravelingJohn & Jackie Scalise/Palm Harbor, Florida"
6th visit ,"The first place when I’m traveling (Yokohama-Tokyo area). Feeling get powerful when you praying in front  of the Great Buddha. Nice & lovely town Kamakura , Fresh food also."
Lovely Buddha,"This was a lovely day out, lots of temples and lovely train journey. The Buddha for me was the highlight. Recommended."
Impressive. Most Impressive.,"Seeing Daibutsu is always an impressive sight to behold. The temple grounds themselves are fairly small, and don't have much to see beyond Buddha. Be sure to get a temple stamp to the right of Buddha! You can also enter the statue for a small 10 yen. Behind the wall on the left is the gift shop. Everything from trinkets, and charms to their very own beer yay!"
Great Buddha,Worth the trip... an hour from tokyo.  You walk the streets of Kamakura and then arrive at Kotoku-in - worth the 200 yen entry.  Even the 20 yen to go inside the statue is worth it.
Oldest Big Buddha,Big buddha a short walk from the Kamakura Station.  A few signs guide you along the streets to it.  Near a temple.  Need to pay to enter both the Buddha and the Temple.  One ticket for each.  If you can get there early there are not as many people allowing for better pictures.
English lesson for Japanese kids!,The great Buddha is very neat- and if you’re in kamakura. You’re going. You’re paying a $3.00 fee to get in- and you’re going. What ended up being really special for my husband and I was we stumbled into a massive group of school children who were delighted to see us- and wanted to practice their English because they had an assignment. Haha. Obviously this won’t happen every time but if you do wander in and see a sea of little yellow hats- be ready to answer “what Japanese food do you enjoy?” At least 30 times! We loved it.
Beautiful,The Great Buddha is a must see. You can also walk inside the Buddha which is pretty cool. After the Great Buddha I would recommend exploring the streets of Kamakura.
Worth seeing,"The Grand Buddha statue is well worth seeing. Very impressive size and sits in a lovely wooded area just outside the town. We walked to the temple from the train station, it's just less than 2km. There are buses and a tram available, we got the bus back.There are much more impressive temples in the area but the Grand Buddha is a most see if in the area. We travelled from Yokohama on a direct local train than took about 25 minutes.The town of Kamakura has plenty of shops, cafes and restaurants as well as other shrines in the area."
Great Buddha of Kamakura,One of the iconic landmarks which should not be missed if you were in Kamakura.  The Great Buddha of Kamakura is one of the biggest Buddha statues in the world.
Daibutsu - Great Buddha at Kamakura,One of the three great Buddha statues in Japan. This one is located in Kamakura. This is a bronze statue. The shrine is known as Kotoku-in. The statue is located outdoor. The Buddha statue is a representation of Amida Buddha. It is considered a national treasure in Japan. The statue is approximately 44 feet tall. Additionally the statue is hollow. Visitors can view the interior.The location can be reached using the Enoshima Electric railway Hase station. A walk of about 10 minutes from Hase station to the Kotoku-in shrine.
Worth a visit!,"While not as HUGE as I was expecting, the Buddha statue is still fascinating and alluring. The gardens of the surrounding temple are nothing special, but the whole trip to Kamakura is a relaxing and a nice break from crazy busy Tokyo."
Beautiful and fascinating,"The Great Buddha of Kamakura is, well, great.It is imposing and fascinating and so beatiful, gives off a feeling of calmness and peace.The grounds of the temple are also very relaxing. Well worth the money."
Great spiritual experience ,The spiritual experience is well worth the trip to Kamakura. It is one of the better Buddha sites to visit with a great history. Additionally getting to experience the train system in Japan to get to Kamakura is an adventure in its self. After visiting the Buddha also recommend having a meal at the Hase Dinner.
Another great photo spot. ,Get here early. Pay to enter inside the statue for an idea of how it was made. Vending machines and toilets available here too.
Nice but not a must-see,"The Buddha is big and its history interesting but if you’re not there for religious reasons you will probably take a picture and leave. There are a lot of other beautiful spots in Kamakura, so looking back I would have rather spend my time seeing something else. That's not to say the Buddha isn't impressive - just that it's a 10 minutes activity max."
Awe inspiring,"This Buddah dominates the area. The local challenge is to count the curls on his head! As with other areas of interest, there is a lack of seats and places to rest."
Peaceful statue and place ,I loved this Beautiful Buddha with its surrounding gardens. They open at 8 arrive early to avoid the crowds
Enormous experience..,"One of the famous icons in Japan is the Great Buddha of Kamakura. It was a bit far from where we were booked, took us one train transfer and a bus ride to get to the place, but the commute was worth the experience. It was a few walks away from the bus stop.The statue was enormous. And the place was quite solemn. There aren't many souvenir shops outside but there is one across the entrance, near the bus stop, where you can buy tokens to bring home :)"
It's okay,You have to pay to see enter the area. In there you will find the big Buddha which is quite nice. Other than that there is nothing much to see. Is it worth to see? I think yes since its not expensive to enter. But don't expect to much
Nice Great Buddha,"the Great Buddha was nice and impressive, and worth going just for that.  I always feel a sense of serenity when seeing these type of structures.  the surrounding is really nothing to shout about.  there's the great buddha and nothing else.  you get to pay an additional 20 yen to go in the hollow space of the great buddha, but the space is really small, and maybe not so necessary.  there's some explanation on how it's made, and that's it."
Not that impressed,"We stopped to see the Great Buddha, the statue was impressive but the surroundings that Buddha was in was not so impressive, i wouldnt suggest going for a visit if it is out of your way, it was the least impressive place we stopped at on our trip."
Peaceful Location ,"A couple of hours viewing the impressive Buddha, buildings and enjoying the cool breeze in the grounds. Very popular and well worth the trip."
Very impressive and inspiring..,"Even though I knew what was coming from the photos, the first sight of this statue was still impressive and inspiring. Yes there are lots of crowds but somehow the sea of umbrellas only added to the statue's majesty."
Stunning view and back drop ,Amazing amazing amazing view of an enormous Buddha. Loved the surroundings and walking through the forested path to the statue. Worth a visit and time spent taking photos and enjoying and the ambience. Surprisingly not busy for a summer August day!
Just magnificent,"A good hour of train from Tokyo, that place is worth seeing. You' see a 11 meter height Buddha standing in the middle of the place (it's the second tallest Buddha statue in Japan after the Nara statue).It's one of the National Treasure of Japan and it was built in 1200's.You can pay 20 yens (0.2 dollar) to enter the statue. It's not a life changing experience but since it's not expensive  and should go see it.Nothing else to see though."
Very big statue,"Far 15 minutes walk from the train station is quite simple came here. The statue is very big, very beautiful. It is possible also to go inside. Very interesting"
A great Buddha,"More a photo op than anything, but still an imposing statue and worth the visit. Watch out for the Wayward school children who will prank you by yelling “hello” and then run away giggling."
Worth a quick visit,"There are many temples and shrines in Kamakura but the Great Buddha is definitely the highlight. We walked from the train station which was an easy 15 minutes, but if you're coming here in the summer I would recommend bringing a hat or umbrella. We were there pretty early in the day but not early enough to beat the crowd but then again it's a famous attraction so expect a lot of people. Oh and I recommend trying the local cider from the shop near the entrance. It tastes like sprite."
Massive,"I have visited many statues of Buddha around the world, every one of them has something special about it.  Cast over 500 years ago, you can go inside the statue and see some of how it was done and get an idea of the devotion it took to create this attraction.  My beautiful bride and I went on a very, very hot summer day, but he feel of the grounds and the peaceful energy made it seem like a very pleasant day.  Even if Buddhism is not your cup of tea, this is worth a visit.  The walk from the train station took all of ten minutes.  Lots of shopping along the way."
Okay Monument but the surroundings are quite exquisite,"We had heard a lot about the ""Great Buddha Statute"" of Kamakura and were naturally excited to visit the same. However, as we reached the site, we were a bit disappointed by its appearance both on the outside and in the inside.  But to be fair to the Statue, we believe it was destroyed a few times before being repaired and once could easily notice the repair work.  The interesting aspect of this Buddha is that we can walk inside the Statue and watch how the Great Buddha was built/cast.  It is a very small climb to the top of the Statue. The location of the Buddha and the surroundings in and around the Statue is picture perfect and is worth spending some time around it.  We walked around for about 30 minutes and enjoyed the natural beauty that surrounded this Giant Statue."
Absolutely Beautiful Great Buddha,"We took the train from Yokohama, which took less than 45 minutes in total, to see the Daibutsu (Great Buddha of Kamakura. From the train/tram station called Hase, it is a 10 minute walk up the street to reach this serene site. The entrance cost is ¥200 and for an additional ¥20 at the rear base of the Buddha you can go inside the brass statue. The statue is absolutely beautiful and the grounds so serene. Although it is the second largest Buddha statue in Japan, it is the largest outdoor Bronze Buddha Statue. The Great Buddha was originally housed in a temple, however the temple was destroyed in a tsunami in the 1500s.  If you would like to explore the inside of the statue there is a narrow staircase of no more than 10 steps to climb to be be inside. There are 2 windows located on the statue’s upper back to allow for air flow as it is very contained inside and on a hot day EXTREMELY hot and stuffy. Not really much to see inside but for ¥20 (about 20 cents) I am glad I took a quick peak. At one time you were able to look out the Buddha’s eyes but now you are at the level of his knees and no higher. Those with mobility issues I would not recommend the inside as the stairs are narrow and somewhat steep.There are 2 shops on site that souvenirs can be purchased as well as ice cold beverages in vending machines. There are also washrooms available."
Impressive bronze Great Buddha built in 1252,"A short bus-ride away from Kamakura train station (bus stop 1)), you enter another world. This grand bronze Buddha was completed in 1252 and stands tall to this day, inspiring onlookers to sit meditatively and be in touch with their breathing. For another 20 yen, you can go inside the Buddha (be careful of the narrow staircase in the dark!) and view the seams joining the different pieces of the statue. Well worth the journey from Tokyo just to be in the presence of this impressive piece of art."
Could not get in.,"It was supposed to be open until 6, but was closed at 5:20 when we got there. In the three minutes we were there, I counted 24 people turned away. I’m sure that it’s great if you can get in, but was irritating seeing it closed like that when we (and many others) should have gotten in. I recommend leaving lots of time."
What a special place to be!,"An incredible outdoor bronze statue of Amida Buddha, probably dates from 1252. A must to see (and feel the magical environment around it) if you are visiting Japan."
A Pilgrimage to The Great Buddha ( Amida Buddha),"A wonderful experience to pay homage to the Centuries old Bronze ( Initially Gold Plated) Buddha in Kamakura. Very peaceful & serene , indeed ."
Impressive from inside and outside ,"The statue is truly spectacular, though there are many tourists, so it may be quite a struggle to take a good picture. We also visited the inside of the statue (just for 20 yen!) and there one can feel its impressive size even more than from the outside!"
Amazing Big Buddha,"Went there from Tokyo by metro and the really old but wonderfully restored old Train. The Buddha is amazing, even when there are more temples in the city where you can spend much more time on."
"Great Buddha in Kamakura, Japan","We took a train from Tokyo to Kamakura. It’s a great day trip from Tokyo. Lots of shops, tried the local takoyaki and beer.  Lots of walking, so wear comfortable shops, hat and sunscreen."
Beautiful Temple,"This is a must if you’re in Tokyo and especially Kamakura. Plan for at least 25-30 min to walk around, sit, and appreciate the temple. It’s only a few hundred yen to enter and 20 yen more to go into the statue. I recommend both. There’s lots of little shops along the way to the temple from the train station (Hase) and there’s some shops right in and outside too."
Peaceful place,"I went early in the morning to avoid the crowd!!! Big bronzen statue of Daibutsu...garden around is nice and quiet.You can go inside the Daibutsu , to see how they built it. It’s worth to visit this place when you are in Kamakura...An hour away from Tokyo!!"
A must see in Kamakura,The giant Buddha is very impressive.  You can actually go inside and see if from another perspective.  A lovely spot.
You should see it,"It's the large outdoor Buddha here in Japan! There isn't a lot to do at this temple, and not as much walking around as some others in Kamakura, but it's great to visit. You can take the electric railway or the bus, or just walk. We took the train there and then walked back to Kamakura along the beach."
Trekking at Kamakura,"Spent a day at Kamakura, came here to see the famous BIG BUDDHA.  Although is huge it is hallow inside.  The weather is perfect so i went trakking on the hillside just right behind the big buddha.  At the top of the hillside, there is a Cafe called ""Tree Garden"".The property was bought by the late founder of Hikori Corp where he made it a summer house and he had offered  to trekker who trespass his property a cup of green tea and I accidentally came across this place and enjoyed a cup of fruit tea and a simple lunch.Continue the trekking and you will get to visit a few more temples in the surrounding area before heading back to Tokyo."
Second Time,"We were here in 2015 and this time taking family here before our cruise out from Yokohama. Most family members have not been here before so it was worth it even though we only spend a short time here. I liked the train ride, the walk in the little town of Hase, and the atmosphere so I did not mind doing this again. Everything looked the same, quaint and quiet. I enjoyed just sitting nearby and absorb the whole atmosphere while waiting for the others to get their pictures taken."
Good to see. ,Very easy to get to from Kamakura station. Get the bus from stop 1 and 6. It’s a small temple with a big statue. Easy to find and walk around. The Buddha is not on a peak or anything. Try and go early as it gets busy around 11am onwards!
Really Beautiful Site,"I would highly recommend if you have an extra day during your stay in Tokyo, to take a quick trip to Kamakura. It's only about an hour from Tokyo and it's a beautiful seaside town. We opted to take the Daibatsu Hiking Trail that ended with Kotoku-in, the Great Buddha. It's really cool to see in-person, and for a small fee you can go inside. It's really small inside the buddha, so not necessary to see, but it was still neat."
The amazing Great Buddha ...,The best way to explore and enjoy Kamakura is by staying there for 2-3 days. There are so many things to see within short distance when you Stay in Kamakura.There is a Day Pass for 700 Yen that you can use to go anywhere in Kamakura area. The Great Buddha is definitely a must to see. The best time would be the second week of April as you can enjoy the beautiful Sakura flowers (Cherry Blossoms) blooming in the garden.
Time well spent,"I have recently had the privilege to visit the Big Buddha in Kamakura. It is definitely worth the trip from Tokyo, however I wouldn't consider it a necessity on your first trip; I visited during my third time to Japan. It is a very lovely place to sit down for a while, regain you energy to continue your trip. It is extremely busy, however it does not take away from how peaceful of a place it is. There is an entry fee of about ¥200 and another entry fee of ¥20 if you wish to visit the inside of the statue. I cannot comment on the inside as I did not visit, however it is there if you wish to see it. Bus stop is right outside, easy to walk to or get the bus (you can also use your pasmo) and there is a nice ice cream place as well selling apple-mango yoghurt ice cream! Yum. Overall I recommend visiting this place, however I did not find much else to do around Kamakura."
Big Buddah,"It’s a big 13m buddah so that’s got be worth seeing, right? It’s an easy walk from the train station and has a small entrance fee, but nothing that would make you not go in. You can go inside the buddah, but I couldn’t be bothered to queue so can’t say if it’s worth it or not."
Gigantic Buddha status in the Japanese ancient town,"the popular iconic  tourist attraction spot in Kamakura area with the huge famous gigantic bronze buddha statue (Daibutsu),this second greatest size (the largest Daibutsu has located in Nara) has packed with long historical interesting stories.Kamakura is the nice place, easily travel from Tokyo by variety transportation options.the visitor can feel and enjoy more Japanese traditional living style atmosphere which might be disappeared or difficult to find in the rush chaos urbanization living. highly recommended, worth for visiting."
Wonderful,"An amazing statue of the buddha, we even got to go inside, seeing how it was built was amazing, the grounds around were beautiful too."
The Great Buddha of Kamakura,"In the middle of a quaint community, sits the Great Buddha, out under the skies, welcoming in serious and peaceful contemplation.  The garden is open till 5pm and has an entrance fee.   From Kamakura, take the Enoden (Enoshima Electric Railway) Line and get off at Hase.  Turn right and head onwards to the Kotoku-in.  Be prepared to walk with a multitude of tourists and pilgrims to this sacred and most beloved site."
Big Buddha,"Getting to Kamakura takes a bit of effort. We didn’t walk from the train station but took a bus. It was very crowded. Once we get there, it’s worth it. The big Buddha is one of the most majestic one I’ve seen (after the one in Hong Kong Lantau Island). With a small fee, you can take the steep stairs inside the Buddha and explore the working inside. Kind of interesting to be inside of the statue. Other museums nearby require entrance fee so we skip those. The only down side is lunch place is limited and other than the big Buddha, there isn’t much to see."
Kamakura Era till now!,It´s great to see how something pass through ERAS and still there! Thankful for made this trip. I highly recommend this trip and also the hiking courses.
Amazing Giant Bronze Buddha,"From the electric railway via Fujisawa get off at Hase and walk from the station down the street about 10-15 mins and follow the crowds to the Kotokuin temple of the Great Bronze Buddha, a sight to behold. The Temple has gardens to walk around also,but its the giant imposing figure you cant get away from , you can also go inside ,there is a small stand on the left of the Buddha which you pay to enter .The large imposing bronze Buddha is an insight of the importance that the Kamakura area once held . its a must stop off site to see and can get very crowded around midday .Also a midweek visit would probably be better than at weekends ."
Big Buddha ,I like this place the most and very excited to review the big Buddha statue on Kamakura era very thankful for this trip
Biggest Lord Buddha in Kamakura era,"Nice place, have good opportunity to visit the big statue of Lord Buddha. This statue have been created on Kamakura era."
Stunning and unique-don't miss this!,The Great Buddha is visually stunning and gives insight into the prominence Kamakura once held in Japanese society. Particularly  those new to Asian/Buddhist culture will find it fascinating.  All will find it beautiful.
Fantastic insight to culture of Japan,"This statue is a 15 minute walk from the local train , it is very worth while to visit , as you can go inside the Buddha from a rear door. There is a small fee for this , but it is worth doing. Because it is a very popular site with locals and visitors the train may be busy , particularly at the weekend."
Great atmosphere ,Located at Kamakura u can see a big statue of Buddha . The atmosphere is very clean. And it is not so expensive. Lots of people praying and wishing makes u happy. Being a nepalese it really feels good to see that big statue of Lord Buddha .
Giant Buddha Statue,Very nice and cosy temple and you can go into the inner core of the buddha statue itself by paying Y20. Buddha status is big and grand.
A gigantic sitting statue of Buddha,"This enormous seated Buddha, known as kamakura Daibutsu, was built starting in 1252 and is considered today a national treasure. The bronze statue was initially enclosed in a large hall, which was destroyed by winds in the 14th century and was never rebuilt. You can enter the statue from the back and climb to a platform close to the top to inspect old inscriptions and the inside of the hollow structure."
Big Buddha,This well-kept temple is one of the top attractions in this perfect town.  Stunning in size and fun to see many local people visiting it.  We had a group of school children approach us wanting to try their English out. Take the time to go into the structure.  The street from trolley station to the temple has some excellent shops and restaurants.
An interesting spot,"Although there isn't much else to see other than this statue, it is quite breathtaking to take in the sight of such a huge Buddha. You can enter the statue itself for a small donation of 20 yen (per person) too!"
Great Buddha ,"Very nice and clean temple.  Though there is nothing more than the great Buddha, it’s still a very interesting to visit."
Breathtaking ,"This was one of my favourite places absolutely breathtaking, so big , you can walk down underneath the great Buddha , was on my bucket list so many beautiful things to see in this country there was not one bit I didn’t like , the people are caring and very polite wanting to please , not a speck of dirt anywhere outstanding"
Overall a really great Buddha,"The seated Buddha is the principle deity of Kotoku-in temple. It is a National treasure constructed in 1252 and it took ten years to build.  Members of the community helped provide funds to have it built. It is 13.4 meters high, and weighs 121 tons. The buddha is beautiful and the grounds are nice.  Be aware it can get very crowded.  Go there early in the morning. A must visit."
Kamakura is a wonderful Outing from Tokyo,"I have been to Kamakura several times - it's so easy to travel there from Tokyo via subway.  Only about 50 minutes!  Yet, you feel that you have really escaped from the City!  The Big Buddha always impressives me, and the town itself is a wonderful walking town.  Enjoy!"
Not as impressive as the photo,"It's a very small compound and the Buddha, while old, is not as large as some photos make it seem. Much larger Buddha in Hong Kong. Going into the statue is possible, but very tight."
Stunning,Very beautiful and stunning Buddha statue. The atmosphere is so nice even though the place is crowded. Definitely worth to ho when you visit Kamakura.
"Stunning, impressive Buddha...crowded on weekends.  Worth it!","Stunner.   This impressive, magnificent Buddha is a national treasure.  Built in 1252 (took TEN years) it is imposing and beautiful.   I have been here twice.  Once there were NO people and one time JAM PACKED on the weekend.   So if you can visit on a week day maybe that is better.  :)"
Amazing to see in person,"After many trips to Japan, this was my first time to go to Kamakura to see Buddha.  Although not as big as the Buddha at Todaiji in Nara, this Buddha is still impressive.  There are hoardes of tourists but that is to be expected at all of the famous temples and sites in Japan.  Looking at Buddha up close is remarkably calming, and the 20 Yen fee to go inside is worth it just so you can say that you actually went inside!To get there, the short way is to take the JR to Kamakura station, buy a ticket on Enoden (a somewhat rickety electric train that costs 190 Y) and get off 3 stops later at Hase station.  Side note: you can go directly to Kamakura from Shinjuku in about 45 minutes.  When you get off, you cross the tracks and walk 8 minutes on a little side street that has a bunch of cute shops and cafes.  You will not see a hint of Buddha until you arrive at the entrance, pay the 200 Yen, and turn the corner.  Then you see Buddha and it hits you that you are actuallyin Koutokuin!   I loved that Buddha is hidden from view from the street until you are in front of the statue.  Equally impressive is the fact that the statue is from 1252. If you prefer more exercise and a longer path, you can do what we did and get off at Kita Kamakura station.  Right next to this station is Enkakuji, which is a sprawling temple complex that is worth the 400 Yen.  You can meander around the peaceful grounds for the better part of an hour, and don't miss the bell that was put there in 1301 at the top of the stairs.  It's quite a climb up but great exercise.  After Enkakuji, there are at least 4 more temples on the 1.5 km walk to Kamakura.  This was quite a hike along a windy road lined with nice, leafy green trees, but I wouldn't want to do this if it were 90 degrees.  There is not much to see until you start seeing all of the tour buses, tourists, and kids on field trips, when you know you are getting close.  When the road curves to the left for the last time and you see the big red torii gate, you will be plopped in the middle of what seems like every tourist in Japan.  This torii is the front of Tsurugaoka Hachimangu.  It was breathtaking to see in the distance.  You are now at the main street of Kamakura  and there are probably a thousand restaurants and shops on this and the neighboring streets.  It was very busy and very touristy.  Hint: If you are pressed for time or don't want a really long walk, I would get off at Kamakura station, go up the street to the left to Hachimangu, walk around, eat, go back to the train station, take the Enoden to Hase station and the Great Buddha, and then take the Enoden back to Kamakura station and then back to Tokyo.  This is more than enough walking and shopping for the day!"
Large Scale Buddha,"We were already in Kamakura and visited the Great Buddha in the Kotoku-in Temple. Lots of people were there - cherry blossom season and of course the main attraction, the Great Buddha. It's certainly a large casting of Buddha - weighing in at 120+ tons and is 11+ metres high. There is not much shade or seating."
The second Great Buddha,"I saw the great Buddha in Nara which is the largest one in Japan. With that said, I really enjoyed this experience in Kamakura much better. It’s located outside and you can really tell how big it was. I went in the morning and it was much less crowded. There are places to sit down in the garden behind the buddha. Only 200yen also for adult admission."
"If One is in Kamakura, One MUST see Big Buddha","The last time I saw the Big Buddha was 15 years ago. It hasn't changed, which is not a surprise as it hasn't changed in the past 700 years. The only difference are the crowds. Though worth a visit, I suggest taking a seat in the shade and spending a moment with Buddha-san in quiet contemplation. There will be plenty of time before and after your visit to visit the many stores and restaurants that line the street leading up to this iconic statue."
15-30 minutes,Great shrine and the giant Buddha is definitely worth seeing. Don't plan to spend more than 20 min here; the shrine is small. ¥200 admission fee.
Beautiful ,We took the hiking path to hell get here and it was a nice easy hike. Beautiful giant buddha. To me this is a must see!
Huge Buddha!,The impressive Great Buddha - Daibutsu - at the Kotoku-in Temple in Kamakura is enormous!  Certainly worth a visit.
43 feet high Bronze Buddha statue of 1252 AD,"This magnificient Bronze Buddha status is said to have survived many earthquakes.Located 50 kms south of Tokyo in Kamakura, the Kotoku-in temple is a must see place in Japan with Buddha statue being a national icon. Beautiful gardens and peaceful environs relax the visitors. Once can catch glimpse of innards of the Buddha statue through a narrow pathway."
Nice shine ,Nice shrine with very quiet gardens. Impressive perspective with Stone stars. Japanese carps are nice to tu the people feeding them. The harmony in this area is really peaceful despite the high number of visitors
Impressive Buddha,"The only reason to visit this temple is the Great Buddha, but that is enough. This truly impressive sculpture should be a must see for any visitor to Kamakura."
Impressive ,This is the biggest Buddha statue I’ve ever seen.  It was pretty impressive.  The grounds are small but was very nice.  There were many cute shops on the Main Street outside of the temple.
A great day trip from Tokyo,"I was really excited about coming here and I think I would have been really impressed if I hadn't just come from Hong Kong a week prior and seen the Tian Tan Buddha. So while I was a bit underwhelmed, it still was a beautifully detailed Buddha. The surrounding area is nice to explore and there are shops to buy souvenirs and food at too. It wasn't hard to get here from Tokyo, simply take the train from Tokyo Station to Kamakura Station, then transfer to the Enoshima Dentetsu Line and take the train to Hase. It's just a short walk from there. Make sure to stop off at Hase-dera Temple too!"
Main attraction in Kamakura and lived up to the reputation,"Kamakura is really a perfect day trip from Tokyo.  The JR Yokosuka Line connects Tokyo Station directly with Kamakura Station. The one way trip takes just under an hour and costs 920 yen.From the Kamakura Station, stop in the visitor's center to get some maps and direction.  Then catch the Enoden railway, 3 stops to Hase Station.  There are a number of sights to visit.The Great Buddha is impressive.  It is the second tallest bronze Buddha statue in Japan.  The cherry blossoms were in full bloom, photographing the Buddha with the blossoms was easy and beautiful.  Even though there were lots of tourists, it was still a nice visit.  You can walk right up to the Buddha's base for a good 360 degrees viewing."
Great Buddha,Our main destination in Kamakura is the Great Buddha in the Kotokuin temple. We travelled to Kamakura from Shinjuku using the Kamakura Pass offer from Odakyu train. We get return train ticket from Shinjuku to Fujisawa near Kamakura and unlimited ride on Odakyu and Enoden trains around Kamakura and Enoshima. I think the package is worth it for a day trip from Tokyo. We got off at Fujisawa station and change to Enoden Line until Hase station. From there it's a 10 minute walk to the Great Buddha statue. It was spring time and the sakura tree were blooming at that time. We can also enter the inner part of the statue but the line was long so we skipped it. After taking some pictures we moved on to other temples in Kamakura.
An impressive sight,"The second biggest Buddha in Japan is pretty impressive, with the temple surrounding it equally welcoming. Get there before 4:30pm so you can actually go inside the Buddha to see how it's pieced together. If you want to earn the sight, take the Daibutsu ""hiking"" trail - it's an easy 3km along a forest path, passing a handful of shrines. Start from Kita-Kamakura station."
Praying ,It is little far from tokyo and have to use at least 3 and half hours to visit there from tokyo. You can see many people who are not Buddhists but they visit as sight seeing. Souvenir shop selling small statues is always crowded but you have to buy because you could not be bought nowhere in Japan.
Magnificent Great Buddha,A trip to Kamakura is never complete without a visit to the Great Buddha. We took a cab from Kamakura Station there for about 1000¥. There are some Sakura trees in the compound and that makes it a beautiful setting for phototaking. Go early in the morning if you want to take pictures without a crowd photobombing your pics.
😮,Amazing. The Great Buddha is something that you wanna see once in your life.He is beautiful. You can see the Great Buddha in the garden where you see the shrine and just next a beautiful Buddhist temple.
Vacation ,An absolutely beautiful location and grounds. I so highly recommend this place  and it's great for all ages. The perfect picture spots and a great feel for Bhudism.  You could spent about two hour's here and then pick up the other Temples in the area. Between the three best spots in this area a day should cover it.
Little else,"Very odd going to a Buddha and there being no rules. We were allowed to wear what we wanted, turn our backs, take photos etc. Cherry blossoms here were lovely, but I’d seen them around other areas better. 200¥ to get in is reasonable for upkeep and provide toilet facilities etc. Three shops here is a little excessive!"
A beautiful way to spend the day...,"The trip out to Kamakura to see the Great Buddha is a must do!  We took a day trip from Tokyo (about an hour by train) to Kamakura, leaving early as to beat the crowd.  Once arriving at the train station we grabbed some breakfast (pastries and quiche) at Deli France, yummm!  We then walked to the park to see the Great Buddha, arriving around 8:30 a.m. Arriving early allowed us to get some great pictures and afforded us some peaceful time in the beautiful surroundings.  We then made our way back to town (a short walk) and visited the shops.  For lunch, we decided to go off the beaten path for a little food at a place called Hideyoshi, a Yakitori spot. It was delicious!  The day trip was a nice  get-a-way from the bustling city and allowed us to recharge our batteries.  :)"
So glad we went,"Kamakura is an easy day trip (about 40 minutes) from Tokyo. Once there, we just walked and followed the signs. Pretty easy walk, but quite a ways from the train station. DO NOT take the hiking trail if you are not in shape. Lots of hills and muddy much of the way. The Great Buddha is very impressive are the grounds surrounding it. There are a few gift shops to get some cheap souvenirs and light snacks. The town in Kamakura has a lot of shops and restaurants."
A day trip from Tokyo,"Bored with Tokyo and want to do a day trip close by. Recommend Kamakura! It is only an hour from Tokyo and we felt we were in a countryside. Different ambience.We asked the hotel for assistance on how to get there. So you should do the same, most hotel staff are friendly and the Japanese are extremely helpful! Always hold your map with you and if you think you are lost, pull out your map and someone will ask if you need help or simply approach someone who looks like they will speak some English. If they think they gave you the wrong directions, they will ran back and redirect you ( happened to us!)Anyway, to Kamakura, you will have to take the JR train . We stayed at Andaz Tokyo Hyatt and from there it was 800 yen by train to get to Kamakura. Once there, we took a bus ( fare to be paid when you alight and not when you board the bus!). Ask the driver to tell us to get off when we arrived at the Great Buddha. Easy and don’t waste $$$ on joining any day tours."
Don’t miss the great Buddha,"Lovely, so impressive.  There is a small gelato shop just before you reach the Great Buddha where President Obama stopped for green tea ice cream."
Very impressive and great surroundings,Not being a Buddhist this didn't mean as much as to a practitioner.But it is a very impressive brass statue and set in excellent grounds.You can go inside for 20 yen which seems pointless as I was told there is nothing there
I'll give it a five because you can ENTER THE BUDDHA.,"Pretty touristy, but on one side you can go to Kamakura, and on the other Enoshima, and take the Eno-den to get to both places. It's worth the trip."
"Impressive statue, beautiful surroundings.","It is very easy to reach the statue from the train station. If you arrived from Fujisawa taking the Enoshima Electric Railway, just get off Haze station and follow the crowds.The Great Buddha is located inside a monastery, and just past the gate you can see this impressive statue. It is impressive not only but its size but because it stayed intact even after a flood and an earthquake.You can go inside the Buddha if you pay a very symbolic amount in yen. Inside the statue you can learn about how it was constructed with cast iron molds. Very impressive and interesting.Please be mindful and respectful because it is a place of worship and many people go there to pray. A place to not be missed if you are in the area."
The Great Buddha,A must see. Allow yourself some time. It is a national treasure. Constructed of the Daibutsu  began in 1252. Lots of people taking photos and coaches everywhere. Outside there is a little market with lots to see and buy. Kamakura is a trendy suburb and lots of trendy shops to visit if you have the time.
Daibutsu,One of the many sites you can and must visit in Kamakura. Try not to go in the middle of the day when so many tourists and locals are around. Beautiful buddha and surroundings.
Very impressive!,"If you have a day to spent, I'd recommend going to Kamakura. It's a beautiful city and especially the Buddha is a must see."
Great attraction to see,Great attraction to see. Kamakura was my favourite day trip from Tokyo and this was one of the main things to see here. It was awesome to see up close. So many temples around there to explore.
An impressive buddah to see for a very reasonable price,"It  may be a little smaller than the great buddah in Nara, but the entrance fee was cheap and worth a look in the area.  Easily accessbile by train from Tokyo.  I was quite impressed with this daibutsu as on our clear day, beautifully framed by the hills and sky.  Interesting to read the history of the great buddah and why it now stands out in the open.Not only was it reasonable to enter the precinct but for a  few yen more the children and grandchildren could enter into the buddah itself.  A bit of a fun experience for them and also to see the buddah's sandals."
AWESOME Sight,"When you first come into the area where you can see the Great Buddha, it is breathtaking.  The structure is massive.  There are roofed areas around three sides where you can see even if it is raining ... which it was on our visit.  Of course, there are always little souvenir shops.  There isn't much more to this site than the Great Buddha, so it doesn't require a great deal of time.  There are clean restrooms available.  Definitely worth the visit."
Crowd place,"After 10 minutes walk from Hasadara temple and can see with amazing background with giant Buddha statue. But,   not too big place for sightseeing, although that is a one of reason to come to Kamakura. Must see."
Nice great Buddha,It is a nice little stop for you visite to the town Kamakura. The buddha is huge and has huge slippers. It is a bit bussy but worth the small admision you have to pay to get in.
Awesome,"I didn’t think much of this in the past thinking it was just another Buddha statue, but experiencing it in person was truly awesome.  The shrine was simple but serene, the grounds well kept.  Perhaps I was lucky to be visiting on a day that didn’t have an overwhelming amount of tourists.  I am glad I made the trip."
The Buddha at Kamakura,It is a quiet and pieceful place. The reason it is popular is because the Buddha is built in year 1252.  We came on Thursday and there are not so many people. You can feel the wind blowing leaves falling down from the trees.
Sedate complex.,"The statue itself is very impressive and the surrounding buildings and gardens are worth spending time in too. Even though it was quite busy when we went, there was a calm atmosphere the entire time. Well worth the 200 Yen entrance fee."
A must visit!,"I went to Tokyo in 2016 and planned to visit the Great Buddha of Kamakura (Daibutsu) in Kotokuin temple, unfortunately, there was some renovation going on and the temple was closed for months.I went back to Tokyo once again in 2017, this time the temple opened as normal and we could visit Daibutsu.It was a clear day, so it was very lovely there.Worth visiting!After that we walked to Hasedera temple. Along the way, there were lovely shops along the street. Recommended to have a look along the street too!"
Simple but stunning,"This huge Buddha and its surrounding grounds are a must visit on any trip to Kamakura. This simple hollow ""statue"" is stunning in it's serene beauty and size."
Worth visiting,A must-visit attraction that's unlike the usual sights in Tokyo. About an hour's train ride away. Go here if you want photo op with daibutsu or giant Buddha. The surroundings are also very refreshing.
Nice spot,Came here with a friend and was glad I did. Peaceful area (aside from the tourists) with a nice garden to the rear that you can wander around. Worth a visit
A must while visiting Tokyo,"About 66 miles from Tokyo Kamakura is a must while visiting Tokyo. The city is full of Shinto Shrines and Buddhist Temples. One of the main attractions is the Great Buddha, even if you are not buddhist the site compels you to fell awe at the magnitude of the sculpture. As all tourist sites the place is full of people, however, is still peaceful. Even though you can do this visit on your own if you are staying in Tokyo it would be recommended to hire one of the many tourist agencies, they take you to various Shrines and Temples including the Great Buddha. If you want the place to yourself staying in Kamakura would be the best bet, tour buses start coming in from 10:00 AM on."
Self-guided tour through samurai hiking trails to Buddha,"After reading about some guided tours from northern Kamakura down through the hiking trails to the Buddha, we decided to just try and do it on our own. We were very happy we did because the peace and quiet of doing it as a couple was wonderful. Finishing our hike with the Buddha felt slightly triumphant. We didn't go inside of the Buddha, but it felt like a nice way to finish the day. We went in July and probably got there about mid-day but it wasn't ridiculously crowded, although busy. Very beautiful and impressive up-close. Kamakura was a very fun day trip for us outside of visiting Tokyo--I highly recommend it."
Visit early in the morning ,Visit the statue early in the morning at 8am as there will be a less crowd. You can get the best experience as later onwards tourist buses will keep on arriving making it crowded. For an extra 20yen you can go inside the statue.
A peaceful respite away from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo,"About 65 kms southwest of Tokyo, can be visited in a half day.  A peaceful and tranquil garden offers sanctuary to marvel at this wonderful image of Gautama.  Not to be missed !"
A very graceful landmark,This is a must-see in Kamakura.  On the day we arrived a bit late and missed going into the belly of the Buddha but it doesn't really matter. Just seeing it from the outside gives you a serene feeling.  The shop closes at 4:45 p.m. so if you want to pick up a souvenir do it quick!
Spend one full day in Kamakura,"Great Buddha is a must-go-to visit in Kamakura.  It is an easy 7-8 minutes walk from the station Hase on the Enoden local line.  The Buddha has a very peaceful and beautiful presence and you will enjoy visiting.  However, it gets very crowded, so start early.  There are many other temples and shrines to visit in this area.  For more on Kamakura area, visit ""hiddenjapanguide""."
Must visit ,This is one of the stops we made when visiting Kamakura. A long walk from the station with so many things to see and buy. Catered at least two hours for this spot.
"excellent day trip from Tokyo, but start early","easy access from Shinjuku station (shonan-shinjuku line) 59 minutes. Go early, as the Daibutsu and temple get very crowded with tour buses. You can catch a bus from the train station, but we walked, it is about 20 minutes. That is if you don't stop at the many shops along the way.  go to the tourist information at the train station, before you do anything. There are great hiking around the town, once you have seen the Great Buddha, and leave the tourist areas.They have maps of the area, and also the buses you need to take to get to the start of the trail.If you just want to see the temple and the Great  Buddha, 1 to 2 hours is enough, lunch around the train station is good, great selection of restaurants and tea houses."
Great day trip from Tokyo,"I took a trip from Tokyo to see the giant buddha and Hase-dera. It was very easy to get to  there by train + tram. The giant buddha was very impressive, also thought it was cool that for a small fee you can go inside the buddha. Would definitely recommend visiting!"
Well worth visiting,"The main attraction of this temple is the Daibutsu (Great Buddha), an almost 50-foot high bronze statue built in the 13th century. You can go into the interior of the statue which gives a good sense of how it was constructed."
Well worth the trip,We took a trip from Tokyo as we wanted to see the giant Buddha. It was great that we were able to pay a small fee more to go inside the Buddha statue; my son really enjoyed the experience. We were lucky to have beautiful winter weather and I didn’t feel it was too crowded. We were easily able to get there from the station with a pram. We walked back to the station via the beach ... there was a small protest about the distance from our older child5.
Buddha... So big!,"So iconic of Kamakura, definitely worth a visit... Or 2! This is our visit, with different groups each time. You may like to hang around and people-watch a bit, see how some attempt to take interesting pics with the big Buddha :p"
Big Buddha ,Buddhism is the main religion of Japan and was introduced by the Chinese. This big Amida Buddha statue is made of bronze back in 1952 replacing the previous wooden statue and its also designated as one of the National Treasure of Japan.
Authentic and Unique,"The town of Kamakura is a very authentic beach town only an hour and some change outside of the the hustle and bustle of Tokyo.There are a few great shrines and temples, but none more interesting and impressive that the Great Buddha. Made all the more unique by the fact that you can literally walk into his belly.A worthwhile visit to this town and this marvel."
The Buddha is the landmark.,"I went to Kamakura to visit the temple with Buddha.The temple was very busy and crowded due to the weekend.But I still think the temple is a very nice attraction.The Buddha is in the center and you can enter the Buddha.The entry is almost in the back.The whole temple is full of trees,the air is quite fresh.You don’t need to be hurry up here.Just take a seat for a while and drink a cup of coffee.I like here so much.It is worthy visiting the Buddha and the temple."
"Great, but not the greatest","Home to the second greatest Daibutsu (Buddha statue) in the whole Japan, this temple offers much less than other famous temples throughout the country.The main attraction is located just a few meters after the main gate, in a large garden. This massive bronze statue representing a sitting Buddha, really ancient and impressive. It gives the entire area solemn and magnificent vibes. Entrance fees, even inside the statue, are ridiculously cheap...so don't miss it for any reason!You will have some good memories, as long as none of the rest is pretty much interesting."
Big Buddha Statue,Kamakura is famous for the big Buddha. It was still impressive during my visit although it was a slight drizzle. There was plenty of people cause I visited late in the afternoon.
So beautiful!!,Definitely worth a visit. It’s so massive and the surrounding area is gorgeous! Spend that extra 20 yen and have a peek inside.
Our first buddha statue,"Very lovely area,  the whole city is wonderful.  We were lucky enough to have our friend drive us. To this city,  We were able to see many different shrines and temples.  This is our first big buddha statues and we were able to go inside."
Most impressive Buddha we have seen while travelling Asia,"Kamakura itself is a beautiful, peaceful place with lots of quaint shops and food stalls. The Buddha is within small gardens and is incredibly impressive. It towers over the area. For a tiny fee you can go inside the Buddha and see the internal structure. This has been one of the most impressive Buddhas we have seen while travelling Asia. It is a must see!"
Strongly Recommended!,"If you are in tokyo and want to spend time in a beautiful town next to the city this is the best option, the town is small but very beautiful, there is a lot of restaurants and shops. And the temple its just amazing! if you go in the morning is better because there would be less people and you would be able to take good pictures, in summer in the afternoon always rains so do not forget to bring an umbrella."
Very Huge Buddha,The buddha is very huge with many tourists surrounding it. Wonder how they manage to build the statue. The biggest status I ever met. Glad I went.
A monumental and majestic Buddha that must visit,"It'is a historic bronze statue.The scene looked a little smaller than imagined, but no reduction in it's solemn and majestic feeling.You can pay 10 yen into the Buddha inside, but I think you should be a little disappointed, since there was nothing special.We visited this temple in winter, so the sakura beside the Buddha was not yet bloomed. Although we didn't see the beautiful scenery like postcards, it was still very worth to visit this great Buddha."
More Than A Statue!,"While it is just a statue per se, it has the feeling of so much more. You feel the rich history just standing in front. It is truly an amazing sight and it really gives you that ""far away from home"" feeling. This statue dates from about 1242. I have been many places with newer Buddhas that feel like they were thrown together as another tourist attraction. This isn't so. The area of Kamakura is rich in history so coming here is not just the Buddha but it is so worth it."
The Great Buddha,"A monumental outdoor bronze Buddha. Still the same as in the movie Around the world in 80 days by Jules Verne in 1956.The Buddha is 11.4 meters in height, 2nd tallest in Japan!The statue was cast in 1252 and now in open air since 1495. You can go inside for 20yen.It’s magnificent! Must go!"
"Kamakura, a place to dream!","Kamakura meets all what an expertise tourist or beginner is looking for in the same place; Surrounded by beautiful restaurants, parks, and long streets; Kamakura also offers you lakes, mountains and the sea, everything by walk. Now, the Great Buddha placed in a small temple is the ideal place to take a breath and see the majestic temple in front of a beautiful mountain, the pathway to reach this temple is surrounded by trees and nice people."
Awsome statue,"The Great Buddha statue stands at 11.3 meters high and weighs 121 tons. It took 10 years to cast this amazing statue. The work began back in 1252. It is hard to believe they had equipment capable of casting statue of this size at that time.On either side of the statue stand two most beautiful sculptures of Lotus flowers with several leafs, buds and a fully open bloom.The gardens around the Great Buddha are modest so the main attraction is the statue."
Greatest Kamakura attraction (crowded !),"Great Budda - Amida Nyorai called Daibutsu. Poor bloke, he’s empty inside, so people „Enter him” from the basement."
A metal statue of Buddha,"My wife and I had seen the Great wooden statue of Buddha at Todaji Temple in Nara, the week before visiting this place. We had also seen the enormous Buddha statue in Phuket, Thailand last year."
Largest Buddha in Japan,Impressive statue.  Story has it that it has survived 3 structures that were built to protect it.  So they figured that Buddha chose to be outdoors.  He has been open to the elements for 300 years.  For an extra 10 Yen you can go inside.  The inside was nothing to write home about but it was 10 Yen.
