Vacation ,I’m not sure I’ll be back here or not.  The weekends are out of hand and the loud cars racing up and down Ft Lauderdale Blvd and all the Homeless people begging for money make the place feel unsafe .
Good Beach,"We are at the Westin Ft. Lauderdale.   The beach is nice and cleaned daily.  We stayed at the Marriott Hollywood in 2018 and noticed the beach there was better, also larger."
Awesome,"This was my first time staying in the lovely fort Lauderdale, my hotel was right across the street from the beach. The beach was clean, and the sand very soft."
Great place to spend the day!,"Coming from the PNW, this beach is a treasure! Large expanse of sand, engaged lifeguards, plenty of space to play, sunbathe, picnic, body surf. Bathroom and outdoor shower clean and big enough that I didn’t have to wait. Lots of cheap parking."
First time here.. Beautiful Beach,"First time in Fort Lauderdale and this is definitely wayyyy better than Miami Beach! The vibe is pretty good. There are lots of restaurants along the side the beach as well as small mom and pop shops. This beach has a younger vibe to it but still great for anyone! Family, friends, and even couples. Parking is $10-25 depending where you park. There is a $10 parking for 3 hours in the Marriott hotel garage. The beach is cleaned daily and looks well kept. Cannot wait to return soon (;"
Decent beach,"The beach was decent, nice and clean with shower facilities to rinse off the sand and salt water. The water wasn't the clearest but I know this isn't a good beach in the  Caribbean either."
Awesome day at the beach.,"Beach was super clean! Safe distancing was taking place. Note, there are a few homeless people hanging around, but they are few and far between. Nothing like similar beaches in Southern California. I would choose SOFLO over SOCAL for a day at the beach anytime."
Beautiful Beach within walking distance from the Gallery Double Tree,"The beach was nice, emerald  green, had life guards on duty, and had numerous shops, restaurants, bars, and tattoos paroles."
Lazy day on the sand,"The Beach was amazing, wasn't to crowded. It wasn't really hot, breezy and the water was at the perfect temperature. The Beach is my favorite place in the world."
Getting my beach fix on!,"My husband and I wanted a quick getaway with a nice beach. Southwest made it a no-brainer to hit Fort Lauderdale for the weekend. The beach and the water were great! Not too many people, although the weekend tends to be busier. Many people brought their own chairs and umbrellas but the hotel we stayed with provided chairs daily with our hotel stay. Umbrella not included though. It’s $25/day to rent the umbrella, $15 for chairs."
Awesome Beach,We stayed at the Sonesta right across from the beach..just want to say Rafael and Jaxon were so accommodating and so pleasant. Took care of us every time we came to beach! Made our experience here memorable. Thx guys! Def will back.
Beach,"The beach was always clean. The views are beautiful. Masks are not required on the beach, unlike other beaches."
Plenty of social distancing,"Just a few blocks north of Las Olas Blvd., you’ll have plenty of social distanced beach and ocean fun. The weekend was bit more crowded, but still lots of space on the beach to stay away from other beach goers. Enjoy."
Great food and beverage along with a wonderful experience. ,"What a great experience dining at Lona Cocina on FTL beach. The entire resturant team as well as the GM, Danny Estevez, made it a wonderful evening. Very causal and comfortable environment. The food and beverage was fabulous and the atmosphere perfect. I highly recommend."
Beautiful beach,"Amazing beach! Pelican beach resort has a private beach, they supply beach chairs, umbrella, towels."
Abrasive sands and abrasive locale,It is so sad that such a nice beach is associated with utterly disgraceful locale with so few parking.
Beautiful Fort Lauderdale Beaches!,"I absolutely love Fort Lauderdale Beach!! Sooo beautiful, wide and clean!! We live in a paradise!! If you are looking for a quieter part than hang out between Sunrise and Oakland Park;)"
"Rowdy and filthy on weekends, better on weekdays ","Visiting this beach on a Sunday afternoon or evening is not recommended. Monday morning, however, brings an entirely more pleasant experience."
Beautiful ,"Quite empty,  very pretty, lifeguards seem attentive umbrellas $25 beach chairs $25 in less supplied by your hotel, on Very noisy streetBeach is clean"
Nice ,Nice ! Beautiful beach strongly recommend.  Way more quiet than Miami Beach ! The vibe is super nice much more chill
Paradise,"Beautiful beach first time in Fort Lauderdale and loved it. Not to many people and water was great, had a little spot on the sand and relaxed and was able to catch the beautiful view of all the boats and jet skis"
Highly recommended,"I highly recommend this activity in Fort Lauderdale. The stretch of beach is just out of this world and large enough to accommodate a ton of people without ever feeling crammed or pushed. The beach is very organized with life guards all over the place. Before arriving at the beach, you have the accommodation of public toilets and showers along with restaurants providing great beach food (burgers, hot dogs, refreshments, etc.)The sands are perfect, and the water is wonderful. The place is very accommodating of kids.I highly recommend going there equipped with your own umbrellas, beach chairs and coolers filled with snacks and refreshments. Spend north of two hours and just enjoy it. It is a great experience ***Please like this review if you find it helpful.

Awesome,"I came with my daughter and boyfriend , my family absolutely loved every bit of the beach. The sand was very soft and clean the ocean itself was nice. This beach is more for teens and adult a get away not for young children there was allot of string bikinis."
Love it,Beaches are clean and plenty of lifeguards on duty during the day . Lots to see and do in the area. Plenty of places to eat beachside.
A total disaster and very rude manager,I you order very simple things. A burger that’s not  overcooked.  Sounds simple enough to me. Are usually go in before 5 PM to get rare prime rib has not happened in the last five visits. There is also an unusually high amount of turnover even before COVID-19. The wait staff works hard and they should be proud of what they serve. It’s really a shame
Jacksonene,"Jacksonene was very nice and helped us with everything we needed. (I hope I spelled his name right if I didn’t, I am very sorry)"
Great beach,Like a big swimming pool and very clean!  Everyone was distancing and no masks needed.  Beautiful area.
Beach ,Great week on the beach and really liked the BeachPlace location. We would recommend for any family.
Chair rentals,Jacksene (the beach guy) was so welcoming and made our experience so great! Go see him! You won’t regret it.
Beautiful ,I enjoy the beach clean blue and peaceful ... pretty place   I White sand warm water  it was not crowded
Beach Open! Go Away Covid-19!,"Thank goodness our beach is open again!  Have traveled to 45 nations on 5 continents and still find our Fort Lauderdale Beach to be one of the best in the world. If you are visiting and driving, park right along the beach just north of Sunrise Boulevard along A1A. Parking is reasonable, there are showers at every entrance to the beach and 20 lifeguard stations. The beach is clean, the surrounds well maintained, and the locals and tourists are friendly and helpful. Our very own Fort Lauderdale Mounted Police are often seen riding their beautiful horses along the sidewalk, interacting with visitors and locals and ensuring that our beaches are safe and fun. You will find our beach to be family friendly and simply beautiful!  Come join us and bring your snorkeling and diving gear, or rent from one of the many shops in the vicinity. Parasailing and jet skiing opportunities are available, reasonable and great fun!"
If you go to Fort Lauderdale beach you do not need to go to Caribbean!,"We have just recently visited Ft Lauderdale beach. The park is very clean and the water is so clear. It feels like we were in the Caribbean! Different shades of blue and green, just gorgeous."
Great sidewalks to walk up and down the beach.  ,"Great sidewalks to walk up and down the beach.  Nice shop, nice hotels and nice places to eat.  Can best to walk from the Fort Lauderdale Beach Park to Sunrise Blvd and back again."
Amazing experience!,This was my first time in Florida. My first time seeing the ocean. And my first time walking in real sand( we don’t have sand in Ohio lol) Fort Lauderdale beach was absolutely stunning! Perfectly socially distanced groups and everyone seemed to be following all guidelines pertaining to the global pandemic. Not that that even mattered while I was there I was at the friggin ocean ;) the restaurants and shops nearby were awesome and made it really easy to do things without having to hop in the car every time we went somewhere because everything was walking distance.
Excellent swimming beach,My wife talked me into going in wonderful clean salt water.  Water temperature 80'sF.  Wonderful to cool off from 95 degree air temperature.  No rip tide.
Great!!,Had a great time staying at the Conrad and staying directly across where there was a beach. We we met a very nice worker named Aoella who set us up with this really nice beach bed. Can’t wait to return!
Good Beach,"Good place to relax, clear sand and water. Parking can be  astruggle especially if not staying near the beach. Many godo options on places to eat."
Fort Lauderdale Beach,It’s always clean!  Not overly crowded !  Just a beautiful beach!  Fort Lauderdale is my favorite place!!  The restaurants are wonderful!  Walk every morning!  Path all along the ocean is my favorites!!
The Ft Lauderdale Strip,"The Ft Lauderdale Strip is still a fun and amazing walk after all of these years. Many restaurants and bars to visit, not to mention the beautiful beaches and views."
Beautiful,Picture perfect. Close to everything you want. Perfect get away trip for couples and also enough to do for families also.
Great & Beautiful,"I love the beach.It was just great. A place that has something for everyone. Swiming, playing in the sand, relaxing and much more."
Nice,"This area of the beach was had clear water, the sand was soft and squeezed between the toes (comfortable)"
Beautiful Unspoiled Beach,We loved looking out over the beach from our hotel balcony and enjoyed walking along the beach on a recent vacation.  We’ll definitely go back!
Love love love ,The best part about this is that it’s not Miami! It was calmer and still so beautiful and has tons of restaurants in walking distance!
People watching with a great view of the Ocean,"this is a people watchers dream. bicyclists, walkers, skate board riders, jogger, in-line skaters all make a run through this area of Fort lauderdale beach. take your time and sit on the wall next to A1A eating an icecream or get a spot at the Elbow Room. you wont regret being there!"
Beach Holiday,"A very chilled boardwalk, with moderate resturants.. Ie not fancy but good food. Lovely beaches for the whole family. Good night time entertainment at times. Definitely go down to the pier at the very end.. Great restaurant on the quay, over the water"
loved it,super close to the hotel I stayed at. Super convenient location because it was close enough to local places.
Lively and entertaining,"Great beach! Spent about 3 hours on a weekday afternoon. Walk along the beach shore, a game of frisbee on the white sand, relaxing under an umbrella on a beach chair/towel - it's all wonderful here. Cycling on the beach boulevard is also a must - make sure you hit the most popular party joint ""Rock bar"""
BEAUTIFUL WEATHER,Water and weather was beautiful! We were there during spring break and it was crowded but everyone was low key and it was very relaxing.
Sean’s Batchelor Party Weekend ,Excellent time with family & friends celebrating Sean’s upcoming wedding.Day at the beach & dinner as well.
 Excellent beach,Stayed a block away from the beach. The beach was clean and very nice. Will come back. I thought the water was very clean .
nice clean beach,nice clean beach - plenty of activities and very few homeless. the city keeps it up real nice. good for walking and people watching.
Spring a Break in Fort Lauderdale,"Had I known it was going to be Spring Break here I wouldn’t have booked coming here at this time. My review is not a fair review because of that. The streets are crowded with teenagers and the ocean front restaurants are overcrowded with teenagers too. There are police and security people everywhere. Having said that, we found a great restaurant called Casablaca which we highly recommend. This restaurant is more popular with non-teenagers and the food and service is wonderful!!!Coconuts Restaurant tonight which was recommended to us. Also our accommodation at the Marriott Park Place is outstanding!"
Freaking awesome,Fun time. Great beach and lots and lots of options.  There are so many restaurants that you will eat somewhere different every meal.
Before cruise getaway,We stayed two days before our cruise departure! We enjoyed walking along the beautiful beach and stopping at the bars and restaurants!! So much to variety to chose from! Never disappointed.
Yacht Music Weekend in Ft. Lauderdale,"What a wonderful time I had in Ft. Lauderdale.  Even though it poured rain the whole 3 days I was there, the music made everything better. When the rain let up for a little while, I walked across the street to a hotel on the ocean that had a Tiki Bar. I sat and watched the angry ocean and the waves come thundering in. The Tiki Bar had some of the BEST music playing, which with the cold beverage, and being able to watch sports, ice hockey, basketball, golf, and more, it made for a perfect end to my day. I recommend the Tiki Bar, and the ocean. What a perfect combination!"
Beach Day,Had a great day walking the beach. Warm sand cool breeze. Lots of resturants open to eat at. Bicycle rental available. Lets not forget the shopping.
There's nothing like wearing a bathing suit in March,"Fort Lauderdale Beach is a fun place to visit - especially in the winter if you're from a colder part of the U.S. like me.  The weather was perfect, and sitting on a beach chair in the ocean breeze revitalized me.  The town has lots of fun bars and restaurants and is very walkable.  The beach itself isn't what I would call pristine - there are many nicer beaches - but it was a great place to visit and I'll be back."
A good beach with lots to do.,Great beach!Good sand and surf.Lots to do around the beach.The restaurants were plentiful and very good.Parking can be a challenge.We enjoyed our stay.
Nice beach,"Stopped by here for the afternoon. Big, clean beach. Has a lot of restaurants and shops along the strip."
Sun in February rocks,"Love the beach, love Ft Laud!  Fun place with lots of shops, restaurants, and hang outs.  Touristy but not over the top.  One of our favorite spots."
Relaxing Day At The Beach,"There were quite a few people at the beach because we were there on a Saturday but still the beach is fantastic with the sand, bright sun and calming waves from the Atlantic Ocean. If you not staying at one of the hotels along the strip the parking spaces are difficult to find and so you will have to park in one of the paid parking lots. But plenty of restaurants and shops if you choose a break from the beach."
Beautiful beach,Beautiful beach with crystal clear shimmering water. Lots of shops and places to eat. The beach is very long a good couple of miles. Not very crowded. Very clean.
Nice place!,Very cool place to hang out. Loved the shopping and food. Cars cruising the strip are neat also. Go for and visit.
A fun place to visit,"Ft. Lauderdale has a lot to offer, food, entertainment, and a great beach.  Easy to get in and out of the airport, plenty of places to stay, and always nice to see green grass and palm trees."
Great beach.,"This beach is very long, very wide and very clean. It’s a great beach to walk and no rocks. Water is clean and unlike Aruba no smell from all the boats and jet skis.  Most hotels are across a busy street which is unique but not a big issue. There is also a walkway between the beach and street with lots of good people watching"
VERY CLEAN,"This was a very nice beach, clean and nicely kept. You can rent chairs and an umbrella there but not sure of the price as we didn't do it."
Not special,No shops No foodNo drinksNo activityNothing!!!!Only see and sand.Better go to Hollywoodbeach.Xxxxxx
Pristine Perfection!,"I've fallen in love! This beach was absolutely perfect. Clear water. Clean. Gritty sand - not the soft white sands of say, Destin. However,the surrounding area beat out anything I've seen on other FL beaches. From Destin, West Palm, Miami, this is my new FAVORITE!"
Best Beach,"Beat beach for site seeing, swimming, volleyball or just relaxing. Great restaurants and hotel bars."
Beautiful Safe Beach ,"My husband and I had a flight issue and had to spend an extra day in Ft. Lauderdale.  We had planned one day after a cruise and we spent the day on Hollywood Beach and thought it was fabulous so when we had the flight issue and found we were spending a second day I thought we would go back to Hollywood Beach.  My husband suggested Ft. Lauderdale Beach.  I was pleasantly surprised it wasn’t the beach I remembered from college spring break decades early.  It was clean, safe and fun for all ages.  Great restaurants, we rented chairs and an umbrella.  You can also rent bikes.  I highly recommend."
Terrific beach. Tricky parking. ,Terrific beach. Tricky parking. I would say in between Hollywood and South Beach. No doubt the place to visit if you’re staying here.
Nice,We really enjoyed our time in Fort Lauderdale before our up coming cruise. So much to do. Very nice area.
Fun in sun,"Great time in Ft Lauderdale. 80 degrees, and sunshine! Definitely a place to go to find warmer weather."
Beautiful ,"The Fort Lauderdale Beach is beautiful and should be clean with trash cans and recycling around. Still this doesn’t stop disrespectful tourists from littering...... just be careful where you step. The reason why I gave it a 3/5 was the beach is not really one for walking. Due to the tides the shore is pretty sloped. You definitely need to pay attention to the lifeguard’s flags especially with children. There can be powerful riptides (red) and dangerous ocean creatures (sting rays/jellies). Just be mindful of these. If the purple flag is up you can still swim, just be aware you are in the jellies and stingrays home. There are foot washes/showers at nearly every entry/exit that you can use to wash up."
The beach is fantastic!,"We stayed at the Sonesta which faces the beach and its part of the beach is less crowded as elsewhere. The beach is very wide with beautiful sand and there are very few algae that are removed daily. Florida water is crystal clear. When the sun is shining, what more can you ask for?"
beautiful walkway all along the beach,great restaurants and bars along the walkway ..very hood police presence and patrols..terrific beach and hotels..
It was beautiful!,We sat and watched the ocean several times from the tiki Bar. It was not warm enough for beach weather but was beautiful!
Florida 2020,it was n excellent and fun activity we did it with our teens and they just loved it so much we could have done another one if we had more time but we had to go back home to MN we will be back!
Plenty to see + Sand & Sea ,"Wide divided cement paver path for bikers and walkers running parallel to the beach and ocean shoreline.  Attractive sea wall separates the sand from the wide path.  True sense of community strolling, walking, pedaling and running the path in the two designated lanes.  We wanted a little Florida beach feel as we had a long wait for airplane departure after cruise ship return.   A variety of shops to explore, restaurants and ice cream shops kept us busy.  If returning to the area for similar purposes, I would definitely book an accommodations property near Fort Lauderdale Beach and try out the various bike rentals for a longer exploring distance."
Beautiful Clean Beach on the Atlantic Ocean ,"The Beaches in FT Lauderdale are clean and well taken care of. In the summer, the water is warm and mostly calm. There are lifeguards and chair, bike rentals nearby. Nice boardwalk too"
Beautiful ,"The beach was a little difficult to get to from our hotel as all the hotels on the beach did not allow access through their property. Once we got there it was stunning,  white sand that was respectfully clean. Visiting the beach is a must regardless of location."
Easy to access and expansive,"One of the nicer Atlantic coast beaches, in part due to how easy it is to access (ample parking and several beachheads), its length, and its proximity to hotels, restaurants, as well as a lovely and long sidewalk. Great for walkers. Ample foot and body washes to wash off the sand."
Awesome beach,"The water was fairly warm and cleaned. We swam in the ocean only one day, however walked along in several times. It’s a beautiful beach and would recommend it for all."
"Good beach, a bit windy in January","The Fort Lauderdale Beach is an extension of the Las Olas Beach. Beach chairs an umbrellas to rent, showers by the street, and plenty of shops, restaurants and bars just across Las Olas Blvd. A bit windy and cold to get in the water this January, but still a nice walk."
Nice clean beach,This is a nice clean beach with soft sand. Beach has amenities. Restaurants are nearby. A great beach for a swim or stroll.
Beautiful beaches but no bathrooms or places to eat,Was very disappointed because while the beaches were beautiful. There are no public facilities for changing or bathrooms at all at least on the mile or so we traveled. Unless you stay at a hotel nearby sort of stuck. Plan ahead if you go to the beach. They are beautiful just limited. Was really surprised having been to Miami Beach and south Miami Beach which does have public facilities on the public beaches.
Beach Review,Very quiet and relaing in the morning. The water was a little chilly but it was Februaryso it was to be expected. The water wasn't bad once you got in.
Nice clean beach,Good place to spend the day doing everything you want at a beach or absolutely nothing. Plenty of souvenir shops and restaurants and bars. The beach and surrounding area is clean and safe. I enjoyed my day.There is a lot of traffic but crossing between the hotels and businesses is not a problem. I suspect parking would be a challenge on busy days but I was there on a school day and in the middle of the week so it was fine. Be prepared to walk a long way if you want to take it all in.....or not.
Beautiful...,"What a wonderful stretch of beach. Lots of places to rent chairs. Public restrooms and water fountains in a few, strategic spots. Terrific walking paths and even a bit of a ""work out area"" that a lot of people were using."
Nice stroll ,Lovely beach front that was ideal for walking along. The beach was lovely and clean and water was not too cold
Very nice beach,"Ft. Lauderdale beach is a long stretch of beach area with many amenities on it. There's a big parking lot close by, reasonably priced.The beach is not so wide like the South Beach in Miami, which I like and has nice decorated entrances to it. You can find volleyball courts, kids playground, feet washing and restrooms. There are lifeguards stations along the beach. Renting chairs was pricey for a two hours stay so we found some tree shade.Many cafes and restaurants on the promenade."
Excellent beach - better than Miami,"The reviews don't lie. This place is great and we come every year. My review is a helpful warning to newbies to watch out for the jellyfish. The blue balloon like animals  that wash up on the beach tell you that you should not go into the water. If the winds are off the water and blowing at you on the sand, then they float in from way out. They sting and will ruin your vacation. They are up and down the coast. So when the wind blows off the land, they blow out to sea and its safe to swim. I've attached a photo to know what to look for."
B E A U T I F U L,"OMG, what a beautiful beach. We’re staying with friends right on the beach and loved walking at the water’s edge. Gorgeous blue water, powdery sand and a cloudless sky. Couldn’t ask for a more beautiful day at this glorious beach."
Ft. Lauderdale Beach,"Beautiful!! Water was cooler than expected. Steep shoreline at the water. Beach sand fine, white and clean. Loved have shade and picnic tables on the beach!! We did see a Manatee "" swim"" by. Impressive."
An American classic,"Just a special place. With iconic A1A bordering on the West and the Atlantic Ocean on the East this beach is a true gem. Warm ocean water, fairly course sand, warm breezes, lapping waves, beautiful sunrises, just a great beach. Need a break? Just cross the road to grab a bite to eat, or stop in one of the shops. Can’t wait to get back."
Enjoy the experience ,Always a treat to be by the beach. Little bits of shells inspire for our February visit. Nice places for towels and beverages too.
Nice clean beach,Beautiful place to visit without having to spend a fortune. Lots of vendors and restaurants to see. It's a great place to walk bike or jog.
It’s a nice beach ,Actually it’s one of my favorite beach in Florida. It’s quiet and clean. They have good restaurants around. Some parts of the beach are for “special people” only.
Casual & Fun,"A beautiful relaxed beach with white soft sand and wonderful waves in the ocean. A place to relax and enjoy nature. In addition, there are many wonderful stores and restaurants just a short walk from the beach."
Great beach - except spring break,We love our time in Ft Lauderdale. The beach is great - except when it’s spring break!   Beware end of February and Month of March!!!!  Hundreds of drunk/high college students.
Great place to hang out,"There’s a little bit of everything in Ft Lauderdale.  The food was great, the wind was wild and the beaches were beautiful."
Diving vaca,Sea experience  for diving followed byawalk down ft Lauderdale beach and lunch choices are many fron coconuts  to drunken  tacos
Day at the beach,Nice beach with a lot of nice areas around where you can walk around and grab something to each/drink. Is was very easy access to the beach.
Business ,Maria / front desk excellent service.  We were surprised by her efficiency and fantastic customer service.  Keep it up Maria Great Job
Anniversary Vacation,"It was beautiful, great time of year to go. People were friendly and the weather was perfect! I’m ready to go back!"
Nice clean beach,Within easy walking distance from cheap public parking as well as Greek Isles....a delightful lunch without the extended lines at dinner.  Wish there was snack bar close.
Fabulous way to spend a few days before a cruise,"Love this location for our pre cruises stays. Lovely beach, lots of restraints and as long as you don’t mind walking a great experience."
Beautiful!,"Beautiful, clean beach. Water was clean and there were lifeguards on duty each day. There are grills, exercise area, volleyball, kids playground, picnic tables, etc there. There is a bath house on site as well. The beach is large so it didn't feel crowded at all. I would definately recommend this beach!"
Nice Beach ,You can walk this beach for miles.  Tons of things to do like jet skis and kayaks. Sand is super soft and the water is nice.  Great place to walk
Family vacation,"Malcolm @ the front desk was amazing! Booking.com gave us the wrong room size and Malcolm didn’t skip a beat transferring us to their sister hotel and even helped carry our luggage down to that property. The price was even lower. He was super friendly, laughing and making us feel right at home. Hotel is cozy, quaint and clean. One block to the beach and a delicious restaurant on site. Our entire party would recommend this hotel and I would definitely stay here again."
OPEN SEWERS IN FORT LAUDERDALE,STRONG ADVISORY!Resident of Fort Lauderdale. Strong caution.  There are recurrent sewer line brraks in the city and we advise all visitors to be aware of the health risks associated with this widespread problem
Perfect get away,Lined with hotels and restaurants- fun place to chill - nice clean beaches with white sand - expansive boardwalk for jogging and a bike lane -
Beautiful Beach,"I only got to spend an hour or so on Fort Lauderdale Beach but it was so beautiful. I was staying at B Ocean Hotel, so we entered the beach near there, which had great seating areas and had volley ball posts if you wanted to play. Would love to visit this beach again soon."
What a Beach.,"Beautiful, just beautiful beach.  Just a short walk from the condo where we were staying near the Yacht Club.  This beach is wide and nice fine sands.  Hiways runs right alongside it.  gentle surf the days we were there.  We strolled it several times.  Watch some young people playing volley ball.  Admired the views and sea air.  Perused the ships offshore and the huge cruise ships.  What a wonderful beautiful place.  Gorgeous."
Beautiful way to end our trip,The beach was clean and we felt safe.  Spent the day riding waves and soaking up the sun.  Perfect way to end our trip to Ft Lauderdale
Beautiful,Absolutely loved this beach ! It was so clean and the lifeguards were on top of everything ! The showers were an added bonus
Clean & gorgeous,This is such a nice beach! We visited in Jan so no spring breakers which is very nice. Lots of places to walk close by for food &Drinks.
Beautiful,"Very beautiful, it was January so a little windy, but still beautiful beach and walkway!  The shops were wonderful and not over priced.  I would recommend visiting to anyone who makes it to this area!"
Great Beach!,Love the beaches here! You can run/walk for miles! Ran the beach every morning and walked home during the evening after dinner on the beach. Beautiful sunsets. Wide open spaces between the hotels/residences and the water.
Bad day,"I understand that this is a popular beach. But I have to review what I experienced.  We were there on two pretty windy days. The surf was rough and the trash was everywhere.  We saw multiple syringes in the sand. Made for walking around a bit concerning.  The purple flag was out and we found tons of jellyfish beached. I'm sure this is a normally nice beach, but not on the days we were there."
Nice beach...,"I had a little time to kill on a recent visit, so I headed to the beach for a nice stroll. The is a very nice, wide promenade on the beach side of the road plus lots of shops, bars and restaurants if you need a break. Busy place but still scenic."
Kathleen ,Ask for Kathleen she is 5 star we have been staying there for years make sure you don't deal with Bowwow
Very nice beach,I love this beach. My wife and I loved long walks on this beach. I would love to return to this beach again on our next cruise in and out of Ft. Lauderdale.
It's a Beach,What more can you say.  In January I am in a t shirt and incredibly comfortable.   The beach is well maintained with lifeguards on duty.Love Fort Lauderdale Beach.
Awesome beach and an awesome area,Awesome beach and an awesome area.  Tons of interesting activities and site in the area.  Many of the hotel include beach chairs with the resort fee.  Only negative is A1A separates most of the hotels and the beach so you have to deal with the busy road when going to the beach from the hotel.  Only exception was the Westin that has a bridge across A1A and the hotels on the far south.
Trash / Needle Beach,"My wife, 2 daughters (4 and 6), and I visited the area over Christmas, and put simply, the beaches are TOTALLY unacceptable. I have traveled to many corners of the globe, and the beaches here are the worst. A) There was a ridiculous level of trash, including lighters, inhalers, pens, nail polish bottles, AND we found 2 hypodermic needles within 6 ft of the water line; B) The county doesn't seem to give a damn. I raised this issue with life guards, beach officials, and Marriott hotel stuff, and they shrugged me off. Sending a beach sweeper down in the morning is pathetically inadequate. You need to send pick-up crews twice a day at least. Watch out, and think again about choosing this locale if traveling with young children and wanting to use the beach."
Not crowded,Showed up early and no one was there. Walked the beach for a while. Took pictures. Basically just hung out.
Vacation ,"Excellent beach, is crowded and the chairs get folded early!  People walk too and from and don’t obey signals kids walking in and out of carsExcellent food options plenty of space to spread out and relax"
Rent the Bikes,We rented the local bikes to cruise around and see the area. It was super easy and fun. We even made it over to Publix and bought there healthy =) fried chicken and had a picnics on the beach. Just super!
Gorgeous Beach,We visit Fort Lauderdale annually in January just for the beach. The water is warm at 77F. Could spend all day in the water. It was quite windy this year with red and warning flags which limited our ability to swim but it was great just get away from the cold Canadian winter.  Beach is clean and well maintained.
Best place to people watch,"Very convenient beach, very diverse crowd, lots of restaurants and bars nearby. Plenty of parking. One of our favorite beaches anywhere in the world"
Great 2020,enjoyed our week stay in Fort Lauderdale ... Visiting the beach was great. Nice and clean and enjoyed our walks.
Spring Break Beach,Ya have heard about . . It is a great beach . . Walk the beach one way then walk back on the boulevard . . Great street scene too!
Pre cruise,"Beautiful Olas beach, White sandy beach beautiful green waters, lifeguards and restaurants across the roadPlenty of sunbeds and they had jet ski's"
Beautiful beach; clean and unobstructed with buildings.,We walked along the surf and enjoyed every minute of the waves on our feet.  Plenty of places to sit and clean off your feet when you have had enough sand and surf.
Nice/Clean Beach,"What a nice beach. We went out to hang out and see why the locals go to the beach everyday. Besides the great weather, the environment is welcoming and friendly. The wide open spaces are just awesome. The day we went there were a lot of people out, yet the beach was spacious and relaxing with people doing their own things."
Nice busy beach,Nice clean beach no bathroomsLots of parking but in season it gets way to packed on the beach and lots of places to eat near by
Very clean ,We went as a family with our 17 month old daughter. The beaches are very clean and well looked after. Great that they have showers and food washing stations at most entrance points. Flet very safe too.
Very nice as usual,Fort Lauderdale Beach is always well kept and very nice. The new park at Las Olas and A1A is a beautiful place to walk and be at.
Great Beach Area,Wonderful place for walking and people watching. My husband even got some youngsters to play football catch with him. Great day!
Beautiful beaches ,Beaches were groomed in morning cleaning up debris from ocean wash up. Plenty of restaurants right across the street to hop back and forth.
Great. Warm.,"The sand is not super soft and the water is not cristalina, however the beach is clean and most importantly for me coming from the cold....water is WARM. Good ambience."
Continuous Beach,The city does a nice job of maintaining beautiful sand beaches.  There is a walking area and the stretch of beach is continuous.  Plenty of places to grab a drink (lots of 2 for 1 deals)
No fireworks at Fort Lauderdale Beach,We spend New Years waiting for firework at Fort Lauderdale beach... and looks like Fort Myers rocks...
Overall a good experience,The beach is nice and well taken care of. Lifeguards are great. Would get five stars if it were not for the extra rude people at the beach chair rentals.
Disappointing Bahia Mar,"VERY disappointing hotel...everyone there experiencing the awful elevator debacle that, we’ve been told a has been ongoing since at least July. Two of four elevators “ worked” and I say that facetiously because half of the time those two acted up, leaving guests waiting for anywhere from 5 minutes to 10-15 often. With 14 floors, this became a big problem. The hotel workers’ service elevator was broken so there they are trying to board with guests...not their fault. They should all standup and walk out. The ice machine on our floor and the next up were broken the entire time we were there from 25th-30th. Scuba diving and life saving classes going on IN THE MAIN POOL the first three mornings we were there...very annoying and we told them that should be held BEFORE the pool opens. Then little annoyances abound...no newspapers in the hotel, no complimentary coffee EVER in lobby( yes coffee makers in room provided with coffee) but water in rooms was never cold and the hot water was SCALDING unexpectedly. Main thing: fix the damned elevators. You’re losing customers by the minute."
Not too much talent around,"The beach itself is very nice, not insanely crowded either. However, not too much talent around besides the occasional minor skimping around in a bikini that wouldn’t fit an 8 year old. Overall had a great time, room for improvement though."
Surfing trip,Unfortunately very hard to find parking.When you find it is expensive . 10$ for 2 hours.The beach is clean and beautiful but try to stay in hotel very close to the beach to avoid driving.
Pre Cruise Visit!,Beautiful Beach! The waves were high so no swimming for us. It’s the perfect beach for walking and running. The other side of street has shops and restaurants and bars.
Beautiful beach with lots to do,"The beach is easily accessible and parking is abundant, but be prepared to pay. There are basketball and volleyball courts, a playground, several public restrooms, picnic tables, in addition to miles of clean beautiful beach. The opposite side of the road has many places for souvenir shopping and dining. Lots to do with a beautiful view!"
Great lobsta,"Small but sweet, succulent lobster. Always super busy on lobster deal days, key lime pie is the real deal and excellent. Kelly actually waits on tables and is great. This is a must go place."
Fun on the beach,"Now that they have built up the beach area with a brand new plaza along with an amphitheater, this is the place to hang out and enjoy some lavish events and with the beach rite next door, it's the perfect place to sun, drink, and have lots of fun"
Needed a warm place to get away to,"We have been to Ft Lauderdale Beach many times in the past number of years. The city keeps it clean every day and every 100 yds there are life guards looking out for your safety. There are bars and restaurants across from the beach for drinks and food. There is always a lot to do and look at while sitting on the beach. A nice sidewalk that skaters, bikers, walkers and all sorts close by. The water was extremely clean when we were there."
Nice place to stroll,Chairs available to rent. Showers to rinse your feet. Stores across the street here and there to purchase refreshments. Parking here and there in lots. And of course there's the surf to enjoy. Mid-week there's ample room. Suspect that weekends see more people.
A beach from far from the madding crowds ,"A very relaxed classy area ,chilled beaches and not over crowded if you want peace and tranquility .Great place for a coastal run and the inter coastal is one to do via private taxi /boat .A vast array of restaurants and bars .A very safe feeling .Enjoy !"
Beautiful,"I never get tired of seeing & playing in the Atlantic Ocean. This particular stretch of beach is particularly inviting. The beach is deep, the sand is soft, & the water is warm. Beach chairs & umbrellas are available for rent, but no alcohol or pets are allowed on the beach. Bars/restaurants & stores are plentiful just across Highway A1A. Such a beautiful place to spend a day or an evening."
Beautiful,Very clean beach.  One of the nicest that I have been to in a while.  I did not see much liter which is always a plus.
Beautiful,"White sand, Vibrant blue ocean, places near for libation, umbrellas available to rent, what more do you need?"
Very good,This is an excellent beach which stretches as far as the eye can see.  Not too crowded - just right with guard towers every few hundred metres.
Clean beach,This beach has a clean rest room right on the beach.  It is kept clean as well as the beach.  Picnic tables are available to.  Pay to park.  1.75 an hour.
Beach ,"Very nice, clean beach. Plenty of space to spread out. Lounges, umbrellas to rent. Variety of shops and restaurants in the area to chose from."
"Clean, wide open","Great beach,clean, lots of room to roam. We liked it being accessible from different areas. Nice homes to look at and dream."

Clean and quiet,This is a clean and well maintained beach. There is a lot of access to food drinks and fun close to the well groomed beach. Their were not many homeless bothering you for money
Best Beach in South Florida,Most amazing beautiful beach. Not crowded with lots of bars/restaurants nearby as well as affordable boutique hotels from North Beach Village. Different vibe from Miami Beach for sure.
Nice beach,"Its always fun to stop by any fort Lauderdale beach, the sand is soft and white, and the water is clean"
Lots of space in Nov/Dec,"Great each to relax, take a dip in the water, red a book, and watch the cruise ships go buy. Chairs and umbrellas are expensive, so bring your own. Sand has a lot of broken shells, so bring proper footwear"
Vacation,"Beautiful beaches , variety  of restaurants and retail stores.   Always Happy Hour   Transportation never a problem"
Beautiful ,Fort Lauderdale is a great spot with tons of things to see and do. You won’t get bored unless you choose to.
Stop over before Cruise,Beautiful stunning beachVery cleanWater sometimes  has high waves but other days calmLots of room to sun bathe
Nice beach,It's nice beach with a few good shops and restaurants near by. Had a great time there. Would go back again.
Post Cruise,Excellent beach.  Clean. Palm trees. Close to eateries.  Sunbeds and parasols available if you want them
Walk on the beach,"Great sunny day for a 2 mile walk on the beach, from central beach to The Ritz. Not too crowded, clean and nice and sandy. Good exercise and much needed vitamin D. Great that there are showerpoints to wash the sand off. We walked back on the boulevard,  but the beach was far better"
Nice,This is a very nice stretch of sand with hotels and restaurants across the street. We stayed one block away and enjoyed several evenings here.
Beautiful beach,Lots of soft sand and beach for miles. Lots of people and extremely popular area .  Lots of fun shops and restaurants in area
Place to be,"Nice, not so crowded and wide sandy long Beach, with a lot of nice restaurants and bars along the street"
Clean Beach with fun shops.,Hung out on the beach went swimming and shopped. Nice clean beach with easy parking and right across the street from the beach!
Romantic date ,"Best service! Had a great time with Claudia as our server!!!! She’s helped us pick the best food, loved it!"
Perfect white sand,"A great way to spend the day before heading back to the airport to catch a late flight. Clean bathrooms, great places to grab food and drinks"
Angela is the BEST house keeper ,"The best place for children and family love all restaurants,  bars , coffee shop, spa and salon in hotel"
Great Beach,"Great Beach with great views, great warm water, clean water and big waves. Liked this beach because it was clean and warm."
Terrific beach with outstanding lifeguard coverage,"Loved the access and lifeguard protection. Highly professional. Beach is super clean, plenty of room and expansive."
Great place for a boardwalk stroll,The range of shops and restaurants make this one of my favourite quick stops prior to a flight back home (post cruise)
Fun at the beach.,"Fort Lauderdale beach is the best. Nice waves for the grandsons. Clean beach, the boys body surfed for hours and had a great time."
Beautiful beach,"Really nice beach, clean. certain hotels will allow you to rent or use their umbrellas and chairs as needed. But they will take them up at about 5 or 6 o clock."
Awesome ,"Who would believe how wonderful a beach could be in November.   This beach rocks!  Great sand, warm water, and tons of sea shells!!!  Awesome!"
Stunning beach ,"30 seconds walk away from the hotel. I fell in love with this beautiful sandy beach. I love that there were so many turtle nests scattered along the beach, all were well protected and sign posted to avoid damage. The beach is very clean, no unwanted waste in sight!"
"Good beach, little busy",Went here to kill an afternoon. The road that runs against the water is a bit busy so if you want something less vehicular go to Hollywood beach. Nice sand and lots of restaurant options
Friends were in town.,"We had some family friends that were staying at the beach for a few days , so we drove down to spend a couple of days with them while they were here on vacation."
Best beach in all of Florida,It is no secret that Fort Lauderdale beach has been consistently voted one of the nicest beaches in all of Florida. It is beautiful white sand and rarely will you see trash on it. Many of the local residents will go out on the weekends to clean up whatever the city workers missed. The water is always warm..about 80°...and both couples and families enjoy being out there. A must try.
What a dull area,"Not much to do. Food establishments are narrow on choice and less than average. The area is worn on many spots and everything needs a coat of paint. Come on, Florida, acquire sone culture. There is nothing of significance to do. I will not be returning to this dull area."
Hot and Fun,"What can I say, it's home.  Grew up there and make sure we take all relatives and friend who come to town to visit.  No matter what time of the year."
Miles of sun,"This beach seems to go on forever, with a wide sidewalk in case you want to stay out of the sand. Plenty of lifeguard stations - good thing- the surf can be rough. Many restaurants and hotels across the street so you can find shade or a bite to eat most places."
While we took a day trip,"Good lunch specials that surprised us with presentation, quality, taste, quantity. Great atmosphere, breeze., covered open air patio, good views of ocean. Our waiter provided us with exceptional service, friendly and knowledablewe raved about two swordfish entrees, the fish and chips"
Beautiful and calm,This is a beautiful beach. Relaxing and very calm during the week. Lots of restaurants and entertainment around.
Clean beach,"I went for a walk early in the morning and there was a crew power washing the walkway and the benches. I really enjoyed my run. The view was the best, of course!"
paradise on the beach,I love the very clean white beach with a lot of space and such a beautiful op coming SUN the clouds are so beautiful. just feel and see it by yourself
Beautiful Beach,The beach was relaxing and well maintained. The water absolutely beautiful. This will be my new spot for a quick get away.
Great celebration,Six friends spent a week at the beach to celebrate turning 70.  We had a great time and plan to return.  The beach is beautiful and well groomed daily.  The area itself is clean and attractive.  We were able to easily enjoy restaurants in the area using the free electric car service. What a great friendly place!
Nice ride,The water taxi was right outside our Gallery by Doubletree Hilton. Very convenient and nice. We took it to the boat show and it was a great ride.
Beautiful Beach,"Very walkable beach.  We walked for about an hour, and took in the beautiful views.  There was a fair amount of wind that day, so the waves and breakers were more stunning.  So glad we walked a bit of this beach."
Not impressed,"Maybe it’s because I live on Cape Cod where there are some of the most beautiful beaches in the world but, I was very unimpressed with Fort Lauderdale beach.  It was dirty, and noisy, and the road very close to the beach with lots of traffic whizzing by :("
Fantastic trip to Florida,Amazing.......can't wait to come back. The beaches are beautiful....there's plenty of great bars and restaurants. Local transport system is great ...we used it to visit other places along the coast.
The perfect beach,"I've been going to this beach for 20 years now. It's peaceful, clean, convenient with lots of parking available. The ocean is tame and transparent. If you go South of Sunrise Blvd there are many ocean view places where one can have something to eat, a fancy dinner, a tropical cocktail or just a simple snack."
Nice beach,Very nice clean beach...on a rainy day it was fantastic ...water is nice and sand is clean...really like the beach here
Love Fort Lauderdale ,We love the Fort Lauderdale and Pompano beach area! Very nice beach and shops and restaurants. Come here!
Beautiful long beach,"Enjoyed being on this beautiful beach, so long and goes forever. Water was cooler than I like so didn't swim."
Magical,"Beautiful blue sky, white sands, clear water, what more do we want?  Certainly a nice place to relax and take the stress of work away......"
Beach Time,Laying in the sun in October when back home has bear freezing temperatures!  Duh! Who wouldn’t give 5 stars?
nice beach,"nice beach ,  clean ,  clear water.  Landshark restaurant was great and with a view of the beach.  great service"
Awesome ,Nice beach. Go and see the sunrise. Perfect for a walk and you have stores and restaurants on the front.
Relaxing,"Great beach to chill out and relax, especially if you go down the beach away from the hustle and bustle of the main area."
Beach trip,My friends and I went to Fort Lauderdale beach after Carnival.  It's a tradition we have started 4 years ago after jou'vert.  It was a wonderful time just laying on the beach.
Beach walk,Nice area to walk on the beach. Close to mall. Gorgeous beach. Lots of ocean rescue support bases. Not much in terms of restaurants/bars at certain areas.
Sunny day walk on the beach,"Good location to swim or sit in the sun.  Water was warm, clear, and inviting.  Showers available at entry locations.  A few days earlier, jelly fish were present so be careful.  Life guards on duty."
Curry fix,We had a great meal and staff were really good. We will be back. Curry was amazing service was really good too.
"Clean, beautiful beach",We vacationed here and were so excited about the beach. It was clean and well maintained.  There are life guards and patrol vehicles.  I spoke to them because I was curious about the flag posting on the life guard stand.  We had some rough water and jelly fish being washed on shore.  The staff I spoke to were experienced and helpful.  We will happily return to this beach.
Such an awesome scene!,"Water, weather everything perfect. There were even baby sea turtles waiting to hatch! Not too many people good water temp"
Lovely morning,My wife and I hired bicycles and rode down the beachfront to take in the stunning setting on a beautiful morning. The weather was perfect and the sea was flat.
Ft. Lauderdale Beach Today,"Ft. Lauderdale is fun place to visit and stay.  The boulevard is classic, wide road and across the street is the sandy beach and bright blue water."
Impressed ,Arrived early and much to our delight they let us check in early.  It was 12:30. The clerk was nice and professional. We had our keys within 15 minutes. Got the 18th floor facing the ocean. Room was clean and well stocked. Large balcony with table and chairs. All personnel we have encountered have been friendly.  No resort fees and free parking. More than pleased.  This is our 5th trip to Fort Lauderdale. We have stayed at 4 other resorts and I do believe we have found our favorite. The beach is 1 block away. There are several good restaurants and a7-11 just steps away. Publix is a short drive. The room is a little dated but it is nice and clean. We will be back.
Hotel/Bar area,"Recommend Bar/Restaurant, hotel not so much. The pictures of the hotel were very deceiving. The room smelled very musty, grounds not very clean. Staff was pleasant"
Great beach to visit,This beautiful beach has easy access and plenty of restaurants nearby to choose from. My family and I really loved it.
Beautiful Beach,Love coming here every Fall and Winters.The proximity to the airport and hotels is a cant beat and the beaches are clean and maintained.
Clean beach,"Fort Lauderdale is one of the best beaches in Florida. The beach is clean, the water is clean, there are life guards, and the sea turtles nest here."
Cheesecake Factory ,We had a great time made a meal of appetizers and soft drinks.The food is very consistent from location to location
Love this place!,"So many things to do and see! So much history also! Live music, amazing restaurants, and oh the sunshine!"
Day at the beach with parents,"Beach was OK. Definitely seemed safe, with several lifeguard outposts. There are outdoor showers to wash off which was nice, but no bathrooms. Public parking was reasonably priced. The sand was a little dirty, but not too bad. It was alright overall."
Beautiful,"We really enjoyed our visit here. The water was clean, warm and beautiful! I was impressed with the multitude of activities going on, boating, jet skis, kite flying, para surfing, and more. I liked that there were lounge chairs available. I noticed no surfers out."
Beautiful beach 🏖,"We were staying across the street at the W. You can walk across the street and they will set you up with beach chairs, towels and an umbrella.  Jake set up our chairs,  He had a great personality.  Very courteous and funny."
Beautiful beach but watch for jellyfish! ,"Beautiful beach, clear water, warm, a perfect set up for jellyfish! We saw tons of them. Luckily we both only got one small sting. I attached a photo of 2 that we saw washed up on the beach. I still wouldn’t hesitate to go back."
Beautiful beach,"We are staying across the street at one of the hotels. The beach is peaceful, especially for a walk at dusk. Tons of restaurants and shops to visit too. During our stay, there are a lot of jellyfish and a pretty good riptide going on. However, enjoyed laying on the beach enjoying the sun."
Vaca,"I love love love this resort. Kudos to the staff our room was clean everything was near us. Great place right in front of Ocean, stores, restaurants and wonderful people and staff. I would most definitely return back.*Diana"
Crowded and not clean,"Great place for the youth and the generation that need to hang out at the beach. To be honest, we could see that there is room for everyone at this beach.Just one thing: Bring your f..... plastic and waist with you! It looks like..Try st. Augustine beach."
Boardwalk Empire!,"Ft Lauderdale Beach is delightful. It’s October and so fewer people, but what a great place! The boardwalk is simply divine. Walking at night is safe and friendly. One of my favorite places!"
"So much fun, clean safe and beautiful!","Although I’ve been here several times, every time we go I discover something new and exciting. Something charming that keeps calling me back. The beach itself goes on for miles, and the boardwalk is clean, inviting and always so fun to walk for hours at a time.There is so much to see and do but you can’t pack it all in an afternoon, so many cute shops, delicious restaurants, beautiful hotels. Spending time on the beach, getting your tan on or swimming in the ocean is fun and obviously why one goes to the beach. However, I find Fort Lauderdale beach to be as interesting of a spot to people watch as it is to suntan and build Sandcastle‘s!The crowds are eclectic, from true motorcycle riders groups of Harley Davidson‘s, to the locals out and about jogging, to the typically tourist family playing on the beach, to the nouveau riche cruising around in their Lamborghinis, it’s really a melting pot and so much great energy and good vibes just hanging out!"
The perfect view anyday of the week,"I have been visiting Ft. Lauderdale beach for the past few years. There is so much to do in this area. Food, shop,spa,music,drinks with some locals and some tourists or as myself solo. You can exercise to water sports or just take it all in just with a seat and people watch.. One of my favorite things to do. Parking is a breeze and walking distance to the beach is a hop skip and jump, it's not over populated on and off season. There is no right or wrong time to go. One of my favorite beaches in south Florida."
Florida Public Beach ,We played at the beach across from the Marriott's BeachPlace Towers. There weren't many services and not very clean. Would have to walk across street to hotel or mall to get food and use restroom. Early mornings were less crowded and the water warm. It's a beach and we enjoyed it.
Famous Beach,One of the most famous beaches in the world. White sand and clean beach. Las Olas Boulevard runs along the beach. Many fine restaurants on the beach. A must visit beach.  Closed at night.
Clean beach,"Weather conditions made the beach difficult to swim in when we were in town.  It was extremely windy, with sand whipping at your legs when you walked by.  There were warnings not to swim in the ocean due to sea lice.  But sitting at the beach beats a day at work any time!"
Beach,Such an Amazing experience so clean and refreshing No foul play in area. Water so refreshing and sand so clean and No trash on grounds. Very satisfying.
Great Location,"I stayed here for a few days on a business trip as I was working at the Miami Dolphins. What I can say is the location of this hotel is great.Right on the beach which is fantastic, water is very warm and beach is very well maintained.Also there's a promenade where you can walk or jog along.Opposite is numerous bars and restaurants.Just underneath the hotel is a Bubba Gump seafood restaurant which is very nice.The rooms are spacious and clean and all needed amenities are provided.Staff were very friendly too.Overall a great experience and stay at this hotel."
Needed more time!!! ,"Unfortunately the waters were too rough for us to enjoy snorkeling, but we were able to enjoy other local eateries, nearby beaches, river boat tour, and more!!! We recommend the food on the Las Olas strip.  The food on the beach isn’t very good and we tried several of their restaurants.  The shops on the Las Olas strip are beautiful and unique; it is a bit pricy, but worth admiring the art work especially the Turkish shop that sells beautiful lamps and purses. We can’t wait to come back and explore more.  Maybe one day we could turn our vacationing here into our every day lives??? 😃🤷🏼‍♀️"
Wonderful spot on the ocean,"This is a wonderful beach- if you like family oriented, and low key spots. It’s not a place to show off but it’s a great spot to ocean bathe and just relax on the beach. Love it"
Beautiful ,"The beach is beautiful and very clean. The atmosphere is great for solo travelers, couples, and families with small children."
"Nice wide beach, nice sand and water.",Waves were wonderful in Sept. Beach and traffic was empty in Sept. Plenty of parking and beach space. Loved it.
Nice beach,Visited just before Dorian. It was quiet. Very pleasant beach though with good transport links. Limited choice of budget food. Interesting to see the turtle nests marked off.
Vacation ,Iris is exceptional!!!! She went above and beyond!!! Her customer service is Excellent!! I’ve already told family and friends.
Fort Lauderdale Our Sant Tropez!,"The main virtue of the Fort Lauderdale Beach, it is within walking distance of the town center, eliminating the hassle of getting around! Friendly and a happy place to enjoy time, everybody finds nice things to do here!"
Nice beach! ,Really nice beach and fun environment that’s not near as crazy as some places (PCB). Nice area with locals who are friendly. Watch for sea turtle beds!
Nice walk on the beach. ,"I have been to many public beaches as I have traveled, many leave a lot to be desired. This beach was clean, well kept, and safe. Super spacious with multiple volley ball pits and picnic tables. You have access to a bar on the beach located at the B Ocean Resort."
Heear,Awesome. Dimitrii is an ambassador for fort lauderdale. He really cares about people personable and all around an amazing and interesting person to talk to.
Dirty ,The beach was just dirty. The area itself isn’t well Kept and the beach is most certainly not. Go elsewhere.
Nice Beach with white clean sand and warm water!,"At summer the water is very calm, clean and warm. Happy people everywhere and amazing sun! It was great to stay there for a week swimming every day."
Ft Lauderdale Manatee Experience,Ft Lauderdale beach is clean and beautiful. My husband saw a Manatee 7 ft from the shore. Crystal blue water and lots to do and see beachside. Only gripe would be beach chair rentals for $18 a chair. Our hotel didn’t provide them. Not sure if others do. All in all a great spot with luxury to see. The harbor holds yachts and homes for lots of celebrities. Go to Coconuts and you might spot one! Great restaurant harbor side.
Beautifully Relaxing,"The water, the sand, the beach were amazingly calm and smooth. It was the best I have experienced since we have been coming to Fort Lauderdale. The threat of Hurricane Dorian was coming but the weather (and random rain on three days) was surprising great and HOT! Love it here!"
Beautiful,Beautiful beach and a lot of amenities. We hope to come back again someday. Hopefully we can stay longer.
Good vacation spot! We will return.,"Good sandy beach, clean and 84F warm water. Good to swim and have fun. Very humid but when you’re in the water you don’t care. A good vacation spot. Several restaurants with music in the evening. Good choices for dinner."
Beautiful,"This is a must see, beach is beautiful,  flat, easy access. We stopped and did not have our suits, big mistake. FYI, you need to pay to park."
Beautiful!,"The beach is very clean and there are a lot of bars and stores across the street from the beach. I do recommend bringing your on beach chairs and umbrellas if you can since it can be expensive to rent them there, especially for the whole family!"
Best Beach In Soflo,"Forgot south beach, Fort Lauderdale Beach lis where it’s at. South Beach has a lot of stuff going on all around you but when it comes to the actual beach I really feel Fort Lauderdale Beach is way nicer. Different types of crowds, not as busy. But it all depends on what your in town to do. We live here and I have been to most the beaches and this will always be my go to on the weekends."
Recreation,Winter fort Lauderdale beach to the picnic area it was a great time they have grills provided and picnic tables sand volleyball court and beautiful views took some amazing pictures definitely will go back.
Angel is a great bartender!,I usually have a smoothie for breakfast but I didn't see a smoothie listed on the breakfast menu at the Hilton Fort Lauderdale Beach Resort. I asked Angel if he would prepare one for me and he was happy to accommodate. Angel is friendly and professional and full of great personality. He is always super friendly and made our stay at the hotel that much more enjoyable. Angel is an outstanding employee. Give him a raise!
Great views and too many cars,The beach borders a very busy street and there is no line of restaurants to block them out. I don’t like this layout style for a beach. The beach itself is beautiful and has a great sunrise view. Well maintained and somewhere I go often
"Amazing, Beautiful, Family oriented..... loved it!","This is a great Beach! The water is clear and has great energy.... Family oriented.....Great activities, boating, Para sailing, restaurants with great food, shops  and a fun atmosphere. Definitely will visit again over and over again."
Lovely Beach,"I would highly recommend this wonderful beach. It’s surrounded by a wealth of cafes, restaurants and shops and you will not be short of things to do. Absolutely wonderful and relaxing beach. You will not be disappointed!"
Beautiful beach!,"We stayed on the beach and visited in the evening and morning.  If you drove there, you would have been stuck in the Sunday afternoon traffic, but the beach was clean and full of activity.  Will definitely be back for a longer stay."
Love it!,Love the beach. We never want to leave! The lifeguards run and swim and work out in the morning. That is nice to see. We had manatees visit us while we were in the water. Amazing! They were close enough to touch! (But we did not do that) very clean beach.
Relaxing,Great calmbeach with jetskis andvery clean and restaurants nearby. Much better than Miami for sure. Definitely coming back. Good for families andyoung ppl as well
Beautiful - Better Than South Beach!,"I am a 30yr Floridian, having lived on both the east and west coasts of Florida. I have always thought South Beach Miami was the better of the east coast scene but after recently visiting Ft Lauderdale Beach I have completely changed my mind! Ft Lauderdale Beach is clean, has great beach with pretty water, awesome variety of restaurants and shops with a much less touristy feel that South Beach has now. We recently stayed at The  W on Ft Lauderdale Beach and would highly recommend!"
Terramar beach in front of Conrad in Fort Lauderdale,"Great beach conveniently located in front of our hotel. A little seaweed the first day sunday aug. 4th abd then none for the whole week! Cingrats for the turtle egg preservation as well as the precautions taken to facilitate nesting like the low lights at night. Special mention to Adler, the nice, cordial and helpful beach boy that helped us everyday get confortable and settle us under our unbrella. Suggestion for the Conrad: provide 3 free chairs instead of 2 if we are a family of 3! Not all kids like to sit in the sand all day, especially not at 11 years old..."
Beautiful beaches!,My daughter and I agreed this is now going to an annual visit for us!!! Thank you Fort Lauderdale! So much fun.
Nice Beach,"Nice beach with lots of access to shopping, dining and more. Even on a packed Saturday afternoon there is plenty of room to enjoy the ocean."
Warm and clear water. Less crowded. Nice beach.,"The water seems better than Miami beach. It is less crowded and at this time of the year in July, no sea grass as in South Beach Miami. It was a new experience for us to swim just across a busy street as A1A yet feel private in a way. It was comfortable and relaxing  to stay under the sun with umbrella (own)  and beach chairs and towels supplied by our hotel."
Relaxing & Calm,"We came here for a quick getaway and really enjoyed the beach, the water isn’t rough, it’s clean, and has a nice boardwalk.  Good for kids and families.  I would love to come back here."
Messy,"The beach had a lot of seaweed this year on the sure due to the storms it was difficult to take a walk on the beach- olas blvd was a nice place to walk but there was a lot of homeless on the beach sleeping under the picnic tables. At night if you go for a walk they hang out where people walk by which is uncomfortable when they start saying things to you as you go by- it’s unfortunate they are in that situation, but they make a spectacle of themselves to draw attention. During my visit there was a lot of construction, felt dirty and noisy.  Not a good visit."
Not impressed,I love the beach and was disappointed that the water was dirty. It was not crowded. I have been to better oceans and hated this one was below my expectation.
Good beach,"Good beach.. few restaurants near by.. parking might be a problem on weekends, and its paid..  we paid around 10 $ for 2 hours..  nice beach though.. not as good as miami, but kids would love it.. few shops around  for sovenier etc .. overall a good beach.."
A nice beach with a strip of high end hotels,This beach is in front of the Strip of nice hotels ranging from three to five stars.    We stayed at the Beach Marriott Towers which is right next to The Ritz Carlton and part of the Bonvoy Marriott Chain.   We would actually go hang out at The Ritz Lobby too.    The beach is nice and has sun chairs for a fee.    Two chairs and one Umbrella is 61$ cash or 65$ credit card; not cheap.    We checked with a few locations and everybody charged the same price.   It is a bit expensive I recommend you bring your own umbrella and chairs if you don’t want to pay.    The beach is nice with a long pedestrian walk for joggers or a side bike lane next to the side walk.    If you are looking for bikes to rent for a fee there is a bike station right next to the W Hotel which is about three blocks away from Las Olas Boulevard.
Ft.Lauderdale Beach,Honestly one of the best beaches in South Florida. Clean. Friendly. Diverse. Not too crowded but never solitary either. This beach has all the elements that you wish Miami Beach had in regards to relaxation and finally feeling like a getaway.
Perfect!,"The sand and water are awesome! It's truly paradise! Great for walking, swimming, and enjoying the beautiful view."
Seaweed ,"We were there a couple of days, seaweed everywhere. Must be the time of year. Next I will need to check before we go."
Loved it!!,Michela in accounting and laura at the bar were phenomenal!!!!The room was spacious and nice.I will be back in the future!!!
Clean and well maintained beach,"Awesome beach. Lots to see and do. There is jet skies to rent. Also, parasailing and shopping galore."
Very Nice Beach,"This beach is amazing, the warm clear waters, the noise level is controlled allowing you to take in all that nature has to offer. The beachgoers could relax, enjoy the sun and read, meditate or just sleep."
Love my beach!!,"As a south Florida native, I’ve been coming here my entire life. It’s a great beach with lots of nightlife, restaurants, shops, water activities, and more. Lifeguards are always staffed, the beach is clean, and the water is nice. Over the last decade we’ve been hit by some serious hurricanes, and sadly, the city has not been restoring the beach to the length it once was, so were rapidly losing sand. This doesn’t stop the fun or the people from coming. Driving down a1a in this area is a must."
Great beach,"The beach was great.  Unfortunaytely, due to weather systems elsewhere, it had a great deal of seaweed.  -It didn't intrfere with our ocean/beach adventure."
Lovely beach ,"Good clean beach, just a lot of seaweed the fist 2-3 meters in the water.The beach are spacing means they are room for playing with the kidsAs all places,  sun beds are expensive"
Cool,Walked this at night after dinner & it was pretty nice.  Miami Beach is better but this was neat to see.
Lots of issues right now,Traffic is too close to this beach and the seaweed is out of control. Heaven help us if one of those cargo ships would have an accident on the lineup to docks. Seeing them so close to shore interrupts the view.
Dale Beach,"So I'm mostly comparing this beach to the Keys since I did both in a week. Dale Beach is a much nicer beach than the Keys. Period! Because of the hurricane, etc. The beaches in the Keys are mostly rocks! Something that is not being told. We went to three different beaches and literally NO SAND at all. Just stones, rocks and pebbles. Oh, and the water is NOT blue. More like the other B, brown."
always a beach day,"This is a really nice beach!Can be crowded at times of the year, especially spring break!Very clean and the water is mostly pretty clear. The walk ways are wonderful to take that evening stroll along the beach to listen to the waves. Please be careful of the turtle nests. they are usually marked with tape and a sign but you might be the lucky one to come upon one of these gals laying eggs.The road is right there and parking is done at the many parking lots.The bars along the beach are fun to hangout and listen to live music."
Beach was ikay,The beach was just okay to me. The sand was not thick as I like it for a beach. We did drive over to South Beach in Miami which was only like a 35-40 minute ride with traffic. If you are traveling to Fort Lauderdale I suggest you do both beaches for the experience. I would visit again because beach was more relaxing than South Beach in Miami!!
Great place,Eight and a half miles of public beach.  Life guards are on duty. Parking available for a fee. Right now there are protected turtle egg nests.
Beautiful !! ,White powdery sand and warm clear water. Had a great time with my family. Different restaurants in walking distance.
Good beach,This beach is good. White sands but a little steep for older individuals who have walking troubles. All others would enjoy. Water is clear so you could see to your feet. Temperature was perfect
Beach ,"Great beach ..people , restaurants , all great stores . I come here all the time just for restaurants , beach views or for walk whenever I visit fort Lauderdale."
Prepare For Meters,"Fort Lauderdale beach nerwwen 17th St and Sunrise is busier, the parking isn't easy, but there is shade, The beach north of Sunrise is easier in all ways, though the meters are watching guard here. too. Bring refreshments because crossing A!A ro get somerging can be a nightmare in each direction.If you are at the beautiful Hugh Taylor Birch park there is an underpass, grossly smelly, to the beach."
Family trip,"Great beach nice quiet and good to have fun with family. Nice places to eat and have a great family time, even with teenagers."
