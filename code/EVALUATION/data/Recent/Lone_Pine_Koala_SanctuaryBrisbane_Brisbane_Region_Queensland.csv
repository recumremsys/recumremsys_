Fun morning,"Great place to take the grandkids.  We enjoyed the great variety of animals, including heaps of koalas.  Seeing the wombat being walked on a lead was funny.  We watched the bird and sheepdog show, which were entertaining.  Not many kangaroos or emus were interested in feeding, hiding out in their safe zones.  The platypus chasing yabbies was fun to watch."
Amazing experience,"I instantly fell in love with the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary. Don't be fooled by the name - you'll find a wombat there, platypus, a field of kangaroos and, of course, koalas. The animals are treated with so much respect and you can tell they're loved and cared for dearly (and their holding areas are enormous and really well provisioned - the animals lack for nothing, which is amazing to see). We got to feed the kangaroos and got some amazing footage of koalas eating, climbing and just being all-around adorable. It was such a good experience and I absolutely recommend. Your entry fee goes towards supporting an excellent cause!"
Unfortunate first impression at the ticket gate,"I went to Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary to celebrate my 10 year wedding anniversary with my husband. I had pre-booked our tickets with “Experience Oz” - a very reputable company. Upon arriving at the gate I presented our printed ticket voucher to the young man who then informed us that our tickets were not valid? I asked why they weren’t valid and he said that Experience Oz should not be selling tickets to their park. He refused us entry until we paid AGAIN for more tickets. I rang Experience Oz who were very accommodating and friendly and offered us a refund of the tickets. The lady from Experience Oz was very perplexed as to why we were being refused entry, as she said that she had indeed spoke to a representative from Lone Pine who had allowed Experience Oz to sell tickets to the park. She said that for some reason whoever was working at the park on Saturday must not have been informed of the agreement Experience Oz had to sell the tickets, so it was an internal communication error by the staff at Lone Pine. Another customer at the park also had the same issue and was instructed to buy more tickets at the gate. I am very disappointed that Lone Pine did not accept the tickets I had bought. As a customer, this internal communication error was not my fault. I feel that I shouldn’t have been penalised for a misunderstanding on your part. Experience Oz is a very reputable company whom I have bought many products from over the years. Never have I ever had an issue with a venue rejecting a pre-paid voucher from this company. I think in this instance, Lone Pine should have honoured my tickets and then taken this issue up with Experience Oz themselves to chase up their payment, not put the innocent customer in the predicament of having to pay twice until their refund was processed (which will take several days). As a business owner, this really is your issue to sort out, not your customer’s. It is disappointing that this happened and it really started our experience off on a sour note. The park itself is worth going to. The layout is great and the animals were wonderful. And I had very much looked forward to visiting for the first time, but it was just a shame that we couldn’t enjoy the day as much as we had hoped, due to this experience."
Excellent visit ,Lone pine continues to be a great place to visit with young kids who love the interaction with the kangaroos feeding. Unfortunately the reptile house and the platypus house were closed due to covid but still plenty to do and we even got to stroke a dingo out for a walk.
Little Aussie Gem,"Had the best time. Visited on a Saturday morning, so not too busy. Friendly staff and facilities were lovely and clean.Saw a wide variety of animals and was great being able to hold a koala and get photos taken.Well worth a visit. Great for families."
Just amazing,Excellent!!!! Worth it 100%. It was an amazing experience. We had an amazing day there. Staff was incredibly friendly.
Hold a koala - great family day out,Fantastic family day out and we got to hold a koala. This sanctuary has a range of Australian animals and we had a great time wandering among the wallabies and kangaroos. This wan't long after the bush fires so we were pleased to help support their efforts in looking after koalas.
Fun way to spend a few hours and enjoy Aussie wildlife.,"Great way to spend a few hours. Walking in the Kangaroo enclosure, feeding them by hand. Awesome experience. So many Koalas. Sadly due to Covid 19 we could not get a photo with a Koala. Many birds and other animals."
A really enjoyable day!,"I loved seeing the koalas and all the other animals, especially the kangaroos and wallabies who I spent ages with and fell even more in love with (managed to get the perfect selfie with a kangaroo!). I had previously been to Bungalow Bay Koala Village on Magnetic Island which was a real disappointment so I was really glad I came here. There were quite a lot of koalas to see and I paid to hold a koala which was a great experience (I had also done this at Magnetic Island but it was extremely rushed/unprofessional and a let down with not so great photographs) - I was very pleased with the phone photos that a staff member took for me and also liked my professional photo. I managed to catch some of the sheepdog show which looked fun and fed the lorikeets (a bit crazy!). I would come here again in future."
Fun time,"We stopped in Brisbane on a cruise. I wanted to see Koalas so we went to the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary. Very nice--had a fun time. Got our picture taken with one.They also have Kangarros Emus, etc . Fun feeding them."
Koala koala koala,The sanctuary is reachable by public bus and is worth a visit. As the name suggests there is plenty of koala to see. These fluffy animals are not alone at the sanctuary where there is much to see and do also with other Australian animals. The touch a koala experience is a must!
Nice place to visit,"We had a good time visiting, and it is an interesting place to see koalas and Kangaroos.  It took us about 2 hours to visit and I would say don't go there for more than half a day.We saw that advertised for a picture of you while holding a koala.  They charge 25$ for this, which is quite expensive.  Then when we got there,  in the brochure it was changed  for a picture where you path a koala, for the same price.  We thought it was really opportunistic of them, as they already charge 40$ to get in and that the Australian Zoo let you do it for free.  We liked our visit to the koala Sanctuary, but if you have only the time to visit one place, I highly recommend you make the drive to the Australia Zoo, which is way better in every way."
Great day out,"Visited this place with my family the children loved it so did I. There are lots of koalas to photograph or just to watch.You can pay $25 to hold a koala and you get your photo taken then collect your photo before you leave, staff are very good they will take extra pics for you on your phones which was nice this meant we could all get in together and have a family pic.They have a kangeroo padock where you can feed and stroke the kangeroo's although non really wanted the food it was a lovely experience."
Koalas and so much more!,"We ended up in Brisbane because of an unplanned travel change. We'd heard the Lone Tree Sanctuary was wonderful and ended up taking the river boat there and taxied home. I would recommend the river trip to the sanctuary. It was a relaxing and scenic way to see this part of the river. We would have taken it back, but it doesn't run late in the day so your options are limited to bus, taxi or Uber.The sanctuary was by far the best for koala observation. They have 100 plus koalas and you will always find some that are quite active and very close for great pictures. You do have a paid opportunity to hold koalas, but the line is crazy long. We visited the koala sanctuary on Hamilton Island and held the koalas there. There were a lot less people and it was less hectic there. That said if you get a chance to hold a koala sometime do it.  The koalas were great, but our favorite part of Lone Tree was the open Kangaroo field. You walk into this open prairie and there are kangaroos everywhere. You can pet them, sit with them, feed them and watch them run. It's really spectacular and unique. The sanctuary also allows you to see almost every Australian animal you can think of. Dingos, snakes, herding dogs, lizards - they have so many and the viewing arrangements are very good. you can actually see the animals unlike some places where they are hidden in some den or are at the far side of the pen.Kudos to Lone Tree. This is a great place to visit and if we only had time for one thing in Brisbane this would be it."
Wondrerful experience. A must do in Brisbane region,"It was our third visit there, as many times as we travel to Australia from Greece. It is a small but lovely and well-kept animal shelter. Of course the magnificent koalas and kangaroos have their place of honor, but there are many other animals, such as tasmanian devil, dingoes, birds, reptiles, jungle and farm animals, alligators etc. Baby Koalas were our favorite! Nice demonstrations and shows are given by schedule. Visitors will find in the sanctuary cafes, restaurants and souvenir shops. The ticket price is law (family tickets available) and can be prepaid online. Easy access by your own car, taxi, boat or bus. Public bus stops just in front of the entrance. It is a pleasant experience for all ages. Families with children must visit the place for an unforgettable day of joy. Thanks mates... see u next time!"
Well worth a visit,"Took the boat trip to the sanctuary, koalas everywhere, Dingos, Tazzy Devils, area for getting up close to Roos and Wallabies and my own favourite, Platypus."
"Brilliant, loved this Sanctuary","Looked forward for weeks to visiting here and absolutely loved it. We had seen there is a boat which takes you there and back from One of the pontoons on the river but we decided to make our own way there instead. I’m glad we did because this gave us greater flexibility. We went mid afternoon which I think may be quieter than the morning. We got our discounted entrance tickets from the tourist information in Brisbane and then took the bus. There are 2 bus routes that go here from the city, they are about every hour but it’s not far to get to. We loved the open aspect for the Kangaroos, they have a safe haven to sit away from tourists. The koalas are the main attraction. There are lots of them to see and various shows throughout the day. I wasn’t keen on seeing people hold them but did enjoy seeing them well cared for and I thought the sanctuary was well kept and had a good selection of native animals."
Well woth a visit,"The day we visited here it poured with rain but it did not stop us from having a great day. We donned our rain macs and off we went. There are loads of koala's here and they are spead all over the park and are so so cute. It was so good to see, many of them were very active while we were there which was great. There were also a lot of young ones. We got the oppotunity to pat a koala and also to have a photograph taken with one which was irresistable. We also went into the kangaroo, wallaby and emu enclosure which was great being up close with them. We also had the opportunity to feed them. There are also dingo's and exotic birds and other species there too, so plenty to see and do. The rain did not stop us from enjoying our day. Excellent place to visit for young and old. Well worth the visit."
Koala's everywhere! A very incredible park to spend the day!,We took the river cruise from the library first thing in the morning. It was a beautiful boat ride up.The park was wonderful. Try to catch all the shows throughout the day.We started with feeding the lorikeets. The dog show was fabulous. Bird show was fantastic. Beware eating lunch... Lizzards and large birds would love to share what ever you eat. A really great day to search every corner of the park to find another amazing animal! Sitting with the kangaroo's was my favorite part of the day. I think we went 3 different times.The koala population will make anyone smile. Lots of them and you can get very up close and personal with them.
An Amazing Experience!!!,"We loved our trip to Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary!! The first plus of many, is that it was reachable by public transit.From the moment we walked into the Sanctuary, we were enthralled by all the lovely animals. The Sanctuary paths were well marked, and easy to understand when reading the map. We very much enjoyed the kangaroo/wallaby feeding area so don't forget to bring a few dollars to buy some food from the General Store within the Sanctuary. We appreciate that the animals have such a large, natural environment to roam around in and lots of places for shade! We did get our photo taken with a koala after inquiring whether or not they were following Australia's animal rights rules, which I was ensured they were. The staff was VERY good about caring for them and making sure they did not get stressed out in the process. It was done quickly and efficiently, and our pictures were included in the price and ready at the General Store very quickly after they were taken. All throughout the park, near the areas where you could feed or hold an animal, they had hand washing stations and hand sanitation stations. I was impressed by this and commend them.  The General Store had many souvenirs, refreshments and indoor and outdoor seating areas. We were very happy that the fountain drinks being served, were served with bamboo straws and biodegradable ""plastic"" cups. Very impressed!We loved our visit to Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary and highly recommend it to everyone!"
Great! ,It's a great possibility to see the Australian animals! You can also take a photo with a koala or feed kangaroos. Just be careful when you it your pommes outside. The turkeys aren't shy springing on the table to catch one😂.
Bucket List,This place is absolutely amazing. The staff is knowledgeable and super friendly. You can hold koalas (for additional money) and also feed kangaroos. If this is on your bucket list then here's the place to do it! Definitely a highlight of my trip even though it was a last-minute addition. I'm so happy I was able to stop by and help support their efforts!
seeing koala bears and kangaroos,visited this attraction on 8th March 2020 paid entry with debit card (swipe) very simple even with a UK card. Quite a bit of walking but well worth it.
Loved it ,Koalas everywhere. This was a great day. Very relaxed place. Walking through fields with wallabies and kangaroos resting. Some feeding from your hand. Then there was the Koala picture. Our tour left before this happened so we stayed and got a cab back to Brisbane. Worth every penny
Koala Heaven,"We decided to visit this sanctuary as we had heard so much about it, and we were not disappointed it was an excellent day.Caught the bus out of Brisbane centre and within 50 minutes we arrived at the Sanctuary.Plenty of different animals but there are Koalas everywhere on the site, you can get to touch them and get photographs using your camera, or pay $25 Dollars to have them take a photograph with you holding the Koala.Brilliant day which for a family big or small would be an excellent day out."
Furbaby Sanctuary,"You catch a ride in the small or big boat on the river. It is only a short ride and quiet enjoyable even in winter. They have spare blankets if you are feeling too cold. The sanctuary itself is great, they have a multitude of koalas of all ages (babies included) ,they had a Tassie devil and a lace monitor with it''s head stuck in the grass. Farm animals as well and a sheep dog show. You can also feed the animals at certain times of the day."
A wonderful day out,"This is just a lovely place to visit. Lots of Koalas in trees, eating and sleeping. Opportunities to have photos taken touching or cuddling  a Koala. Hand feeding Kangaroos is another great experience. A bush turkey shared our lunch table as water dragons wandered over our feet! It was a very hot and humid day so many of the animals were enjoying a siesta. We can thoroughly recommend a visit here."
Great little place,Went here with my son. loved the animal interaction and the staff were very knowledgeable. Ok for a quick visit not an all dayer though.
Koala haven,My wife and I spent most of the day visiting the Koala Sanctuary. They have many opportunities to see Australian wildlife. We mingled with Kangaroos and fed them. Saw serpents native to Australia.  There was an opportunity to handle a boa but not for us. The highlight of the day for my wife was when she held a Koala.
great value day out,we went here on feb 22nd as part of our wedding anniversary celebrations. was well worth paying the extra $30 to hold a koala bear.was no rush and the bond between the keeper and the bear was fantastic! had some grest photos taken including loads in the kangaroo enclosure. was amazing to see them jumping about naturally among us and even better when they came over for some food!being on holiday from the UK was our first time seeing these beautiful animals.all in all a great day out with the added bonus of bo one trying to upsell you anythimg once in the park. food and drink was reasonably priced too.
Loved this experience in Brisbane,"Lone Pine was fantastic, we didn't realize how close up you get to get with the animals. We loved the kangaroos, koalas and wallabies the most however the entire facility was great. The animals all seemed well cared for and happy as they aren't really in cages rather free to roam. I wish I could have a pet koala after this tour, they have got to be the sweetest animal! Thank you for this great experience in Brisbane."
Excellent. Informative. Interactive day.,"What a terrific day!  Our spontaneous visit to the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary turned out to be the highlight of our brief stay in Brisbane. An interactive experience with koalas, kangaroos, wallabies, emus and a python (at the snake-keeper’s talk) made for a memorable afternoon. Our 8 year old was delighted at the opportunity to interact with the animals and snuggle a Koala. Many thanks to staff who accommodated us first for our Koala pic so we could catch our flight. All staff we met were friendly and knowledgeable. We attended a couple of informative talks on koalas and snakes.  The sheep dog show was also good. We brought a picnic and enjoyed lunching among the koalas and all the friendly lizards."
great adventure,"Very friendly staff, taking care of wildlife animels in an excellent way. You can get in contact with some of the animals which is a great experience, feed kangaroos, hold a koala, get to know new species. Godd program for small and adult allso."
Highlight of Australian visit,Spent the better part of a very hot day here and it was an amazing experience. the relaxed environment and the ability to get up close with local wildlife was a memorable experience.
Delightful and Important environment to contribute to the existence of Australian Koalas,"Clean, respectful viewing set up for a transparent look at the health and habits of Koalas.  I love taking overseas guests there to see Australian Animals in well kept environments.  Beautiful location on the Western side of Brisbane River. Plenty of opportunities to get up close and personal with some of the animals.  Somewhere to eat and drink with plenty of toilets and hygiene stations."
Lovely ,Went on the mirimar cruise which includes entry into lone pine. A wonderful way to spend a few hours. Lovely seeing the koalas and kangaroos in an environment that was ideal. Every so often you come across a lizard who are quite happy to pose for pics. Staff work really hard. Cannot fault the place so well worth a visit
Great place,Beautiful place to see wildlife. I didn’t get a chance to hold the koalas but still got a picture. The kangaroos were so cute and so friendly. Saw a few emus as well. There are a lot of animals. A little expensive but really cool. Worth it !
If anything close to Brisbane,"Getting close and on hand with Australian wild life. You can get  here by river boat, bus or organized tour. We were so fortunate to have Oz family to guide us here, we would say a MUST if in Brisbane."
Relaxing & informative day,A very intersting and informative well spent day.  A must for all families to do.  Staff very knowledgeable and helpful.  Plenty of animals to see and talks/feedings happening throughout the day.  Well done Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary.
Part of river cruise,"Small but a large number of exhibits, including Dingos, crocs. Look out for the many lizards that are free to roam. The snake and hold  Koala are expensive for what you get, one photo. Having said that a nice experince seeing the various indiginous animal of Austraila"
Very nice to visit,The sanctuary is very nice to visit and you can see that they are taking great care of the animals. A must see when you’re in Brisbane.
A great day out,"Situated just 25 mins by car outside Brisbane, this place is worth a visitYou get to see all local animals specific to Australia- An excellent day out, petting and feeding the kangaroos and admiring the cute koalas. Do try and listen to the free tours that regularly run through the day"
Enjoyable day out.,Great for adults and kids alike. 100s of koalas plus a multitude of other Australian animals. A very enjoyable day out. Student discount too. The talks are very informative and professional by the staff.
Adorable koalas,"What a wonderful retreat in the city! The sanctuary is extremely well maintained & the animals have room to freely move about. Excellent educational center, easy for kids to interact with.By far, the koalas were the most adorable of all the animals! You have the ability to hold them, for a small additional fee.Great way to spend half a day from the hustle & bustle of the city."
A must visit attraction,If you want to guarantee learning about this wonderful country and the wildlife from Koalas to Kangaroos to Dingoes to Wallabies to countless birds and time is a constraint the Sanctuary has it all.
Bucket list ✔️,I held a koala 🐨 I fed a kangaroo 🦘 Staff were super duper friendly. Definitely a really amazing experience.
Great little place. ,We called up as it’s closer to the city than Australia Zoo. Plus it offers the chance to hold a Koala.
Great place to get up and close with the animals,"Great place to visit and come up close with the Koalas, Kangaroo and Wallaby.  A word of advice take the Koala express to get there and hold a koala.  It is so worth it ."
Wonderful place to visit,This is a beautiful zoo.  If Koala's are your thing... this is the place to be.  SO many koalas.  Really love the flight show with the birds and also the sheep dog show.
Must Visit When in Brisbane!,Loved seeing the koalas and kangaroos. Be aware that they charge you an additional fee to hold a koala. I also liked the area they had the kangaroos because you can walk right up to them and feed them.
Great for the kids!,"Great place to bring the family.  Close enough to town and we really got lucky as the place was basically empty.  Kids absolutely loved it, loved feeding and petting the animals without them being scared. (both the kids and animals)  Manageable size"
Great day trip and an opportunity to hold a koala!,"Paid for the behind-the-scenes koala experience and was a wonderful time. It was also nice to go feed the barn animals and kangaroos. We drove ourselves and there was plenty of parking. Out of the other sanctuaries/zoos I visited, I probably liked this one the best in terms of how the animals were treated/their housing situations."
It was ok....,"If you are visiting multiple cities, you dont need to hit a animal preserve in every city....in my opinion. This was the last city we were in and by then I was animal preserved out.  We took the tour river shuttle to Lone Pines and it was a taped tour. It wasnt that engaging. There were long stretches of either nothing or residences, not much to say then. On the way home there was an express boat by the same company and when we asked if we could take that instead, there was an upcharge, even though there were empty seats. An hour or two is plenty at the preserve and I would suggest packing your own lunch, there arent many choices and they are expensive."
Great place,"Fun for the whole family. We had a blast. I've never been so close to koala and kangaroo. This place has plenty of locations to sit, drink coffee, and enjoy the animals. It is very clean and well organized."
Day Trip,"This is a beautiful sanctuary with a variety of animals. I did the day trip with the boat ride. The ride went for an hour one way and was enjoyable. On board there is a little cafe that sells food, drinks and alcohol. During the ride they provide you with information and history of the area. The boat drops you off at 11:10 and leaves at 2:15. This is plenty of time to see everything and you can chose to have lunch on the boat to save time.At the park it has a cafe and is reasonably priced. There is plenty of areas to sit down and eat.There are lots of koalas and you can get your photo with one for an extra price.You can walk around the kangaroo area and feed them ($2 a bag). Highly recommend this park, great Australian experience with animals."
Authentic and honest wildlife park,"Had a great day at Lone Pine. With some steps around it was slightly difficult with a double pram, but a nicely compact and diverse range of animals and experiences, for something mostly know just for koalas. Seeing wombats, platypus, birds, reptiles, tassie devils along with the koalas and kangaroo was a great treat. The barn was a good chance to hold chicks and guinea pigs with the kids, and enjoy the sheep herding display. Koalas are pretty much everywhere though, so was nice sharing the dining area with them too, where you could see some sleeping, while others seemed very active.4 hours was a good amount of time to be there to see everything, and not feel too pushed to get around to do so. There is a really nice down to earth feel to the place. It’s not too showy and allows the people to choose their own adventure, with many shows happening multiple times each day. I’m sure on weekends and school holidays the compact nature of the sanctuary could make it seem crowded when it is busier, but there is a nice laid back feel to it all, and for me makes it a good representation of Australia for overseas visitors."
Brisbane River Koala Express to Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary Day Trip,"The Finance Manager (wife) and I booked the Brisbane River Koala Express to Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary Day Trip from Perth because it looked interesting. Wel you could have knocked our socks off as it was a truly memorable experience. We boarded the boat outside the Cultural Centre and travelled up river to the sanctuary. you can either go up to the open top deck or stay below. Being whimps and not wanting to have our hairdos spoilt or getting sunburnt, before we got to the Sanctuary, we stayed below and listened to a very enlightening presentation on the history of the Brisbane River and its environs (big wor for surrounding area along the river). It was a very plaesant cruise. On reaching the Koala Sanctuary jetty we disembarked to climb the snall hill to the Sanctuary itself. Our Captain, in his jovial manner, reminded us to be back on time as we would have to find another way back because he left on time. Well as you can see we made back on time for the trip back. On entering the Sanctuary we had a choice of multiple things to do, however as the weather had been extremely hot the koala holding sessions were cancelled as it was too stresful on the koalas. We didn't mind as the koalas health was more important than us holding them for our own gratification (another big word for the day). Anyway there is heaps to do in the Sanctuary. Did I mention it is the oldest koala sanctuary in the world. The bloke who started the Sanctuary in the 1920s was way ahead of the modern conservationists and it is a credit to his dreams that it is still going strong today. My wife and I wandered around the park and looked at koalas, wallabies, kangaroos, wonbats, Tasmanian Devils and a multitude (another big word for the day, a record) of native animals on display. What impressed us was that the old koalas have their own retirement village - they don't even have to jump through hoops to get into it. That was pretty awesome, us oldies looking at those oldies. After our little wander around the park we decided it was time for a ""smoko"" (we don't actually smoke - Aussie term for having a break that goes back pre Y Gen) and went and had some lunch and a coffee in the Sanctuary's cafe area. Well you should see it; they have a covered area the size of two netball/basketball courts with fenced off sections that had pretend trees in them. These were located around the tables and seating area for visitors to enjoy looking at the koalas while they had their refreshments. We have never seen so many koalas in one spot in our life; they exactly native to Western Australia. The staff were constantly caring for the koalas and we were priveleged to see them bring in fresh branches of leaves for the kaolas to eat, clean and disinfect the the pretend trees and and rake and clean the faeces and urine from the ground below. The whole area was absolutely spotless and did not smell. To help visitors there are talks about koals a and information boards around the Sanctuary. It was a very informative and relaxing day just enjoying the opportunity to wander around. Then like any visit it was time to leave; we didn't want have to thumb a boat ride or swim back to the starting point so we made sure we were back at the jetty in time to go back. We finished our return cruise back with a beer and winw and just sat back and enjoyed the trip back to the Cultural Centre jetty. It was really an awesome experience. We would recommend it to all our friends and overseas visitors travelling to Brisbane to do the Brisbane River Koala Express to Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary Day Trip. You won't be disappointed."
Great experience ,My wife and I visited Lone Pine as part of our visit to Brisbane and it was a most enjoyable experience. We headed up river on the Koala Express and passed the many beautiful houses on the banks of the Brisbane River. The wildlife at Lone Pine is exceptional and there are lots of the star attraction “Koala’s” !The staff are friendly and very informative. There are lots of other animals at the sanctuary to enjoy. Great way to spend a morning whilst in the lovely city of Brisbane. Great ice cream to be enjoyed at the shop.
Close up experience with Koalas and Kangaroos!,Had a fun experience. Lots of Koalas and Kangaroos.  Had the opportunity to hold a Koala and feed the kangaroos.  Lots of informative information about all of the animals. Very well run.
THE BEST place on Earth!!!,"I LOVED the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary!!! Not only can you see most of Australian’s indigenous animals... you can get up close and personal with them. I also like that by visiting we helped them in their conservation efforts. In wake of all the wild fires, it was moving to see that these animals are safe, and being cared for so well.The Koalas are the main attraction but the kangaroos are a close second as you can interact with both species.The staff at the sanctuary are attentive, knowledgeable and caring toward the animals and are more than happy to pass on their knowledge. I can’t wait to GO BACK to Lone Pine!!!!"
Lovely afternoon,The boat trip to the sanctuary was pleasant and our guide was informative. I learned quite a bit about the area.  The reserve itself was also a wonderful learning experience. From feeding the wallabies to getting up close to a koala were experiences to remember.  I was also impressed with the care these animals are receiving.  Very nice park and worth the trip!
Lone pine,What a wonderful way to be close to Koala's and Kangaroos . We did a cruise up the river and spent 3 hours in  lone pine. Its a must for  children. You can have your photo taken  with a Koala and  snakes
Cruise port stop,Visited this site 33 years ago when it was a small park like setting with only koalas but back then you could hold and pet them all you wanted with a caretaker near.  Now it's a little different but so many other animals there to see.  Well worth the short trip by bus #445 to visit.  Got our tickets at the tourist information office in the walking mall near Queen street for quite a discount and changed money to AUD nearby at a window kiosk exchange.  We only paid $22AUD each for tickets.  We took an uber back to our port bus...very easy.
An Enjoyable Highlight.,"We visited Lone Pine for a day during our visit to Australia over the Christmas period for 8 weeks. It was good value for money and provided a different experience to Australia Zoo where we had visited 5 years ago during our previous trip. The sheep dog demonstration was extremely good. It was also heartening to see clearly the care with which the animals are looked after. Sadly our day was little marred by the sheer discourtesy of other tourists, buried in theoir mobile phones and playing loud music from them. So buried in fact they had no spatial awareness around them and barging into others without so much as an apology. That makes life even more difficult for those of us who are not so good on our legs these days. And in such a beautiful place it is beyond my comprehension that a piece of plastic holds such a fascination. Like I said its a beautiful place, well kept just beware of your fellow ill mannnered tourists."
A complete Wildlife experience ,"I spent a full day trip with the platinum formula and got back a really nice experience. The very well prepared park guide Megan supported by the team of vets, trainers and keepers brought me around each corner of the park, illustrating, explaining and letting me interact with the real daily animal cares activities. I got the chance to live a day as park member and I learn a lot about the native Australian mammals, birds and reptiles. I felt the sanctuary as an important milestone in terms of education and conservation of the unique wildlife of Australia."
So many adorable koalas!! ,If you have a limited time in the area and want to see a koala as well as other animals native to Australia this is definitely worth the visit. We booked in advance the Wild Encounter which give you a more up close and personal experience with the koalas which also saves us from having to stand in line and take our chances with getting to hold a koala. Super informative and we were able to get through all we wanted to see in under 3 hours.
Lovely experience,"I learned so much about koalas! You can easily tell that they are well taken care of, as the other animals. I love that there is no pressure on the animals and that if they don’t want to interact with people.I recommend it and ask all to help with donations so the sanctuary can continue rescuing animals ♥️"
Great day out at Lone Pine,"Very good family outing. Staff and facilities excellent, good food venue, great bird show and plenty of hands on with Koalas and Kangaroos  All family loved it"
So many koalas!,There is no better place to see so many koalas and get up close to kangaroos.  It’s small so it is easy to do in half a day and see everything.  My only complaint is the cuddle/photo with a koala is way to quick. Probably 20 seconds of holding a koala.  The photographer didn’t even attempt to get a good picture with koala looking. Just rushed and snapped one picture. That was disappointing.
Definitely visit ,"This area is absolutely beautiful.  I would recommend taking the river cruise from the downtown area over to the sanctuary. It is beautiful and you see beautiful homes on the water as you get to the sanctuary.In this sanctuary you will see all types of indigenous species to Australia. Not just koalas!  However, the highlight is to touch a koala and you can touch a koala for free. He can also of course get in line and pay to hold the koala during certain times, which I would also recommend if you’ve never done it.On top of everything, it’s a wonderful place to support and they have amazing ice cream cones."
Great experience.,Would highly recommend this place. We went with 2 families and the kids really enjoyed being able to see and touch the koalas but there are heaps of other animals there as well. Food was reasonably priced and ok for a theme park type place and we took our Tesla and they have free charging which was an added bonus.
Special Cuddling Day,First stop after landing in Australia(17 Hours)   I cuddle Babies in Childrens Hospital in the states and this was a very special Cuddle for me..  Loved the one on one Kangaroos experience.  Everyone was super nice.
Brisbane,Very interesting this Lone Pine Sanctuary.Animals are very cute and this is best place for them.We love this day.
See Koalas and Kangaroos up close,In our 2 week road trip we had not seen kangaroos or koalas so chose to come hereWell laid out and lots of things happening throughout the dayEnjoyed the raptor showSaw a duck billed platypus at the second visit during the dayClearly caring staff and volunteersLoved seeing the koalas and able to walk through kangaroo enclosure
Australian Wildlife,"A trip no tourist will want to miss, when in Brisbane, is the excursion out to the Lone Pine Sanctuary about 12km southwest of the city. The most attractive way to get there is by  a cruise on the river Brisbane, which takes about 75 minutes and which is interesting in its own way. The tour by Mirimar Cruises gives you 3 hours at the Sanctuary.The main attraction by far are the Koala's, of which trere are about 130 here. Most visitors will buy an extra ticket (25 AUD, on top of the entrance fee of 42 AUD) for one of two photo sessions per day - at 12.30 and 14.30. There is quite a queue for this and one has to count with a wait of about 30 minutes till one's turn. It is quite an experience though to hold one of those cuddly furry creatures of at least 12kg and with a very strong smell of eucalyptus.There is plenty of other Australian fauna to be seen here, at least theoretically, since many of them are nocturnal or into hiding. At least one can read about them on information boards. Besides the animals there is also a restaurant and a shop here."
Great place to see our native animals,"We took our overseas visitors to this park so they could see some of our native animals. You can see native animals and particularly koalas up close. Good commentary by staff at feeding times. Free range area where you can feed kangaroos, wallabies and emus. Food available for sale at the cafe."
Mrs,"Great day, my grandchildren really enjoyed getting close to the animals. The staff were extremely helpful and obviously passionate about the animals welfare."
Hand feeding kangaroos and stroking koala,"What a great day out! A really informative river cruise taking 75 minutes from central Brisbane up to Lone Pine.At lone pine there are a number of animals to see and also interact with - Dingo, lots of Koala, wombats, Kangeroos and Tasmanian Devils as well as reptiles and birds. The highlight though is the feeding of kangeroos $2 bag of food, and stroking a koala - free!Not a very big place so only need the 3 hours that you get there on the boat."
A must do,Absolutely loved this place ! A real memory maker.  Buy the Roo food for $2-00 & spend ages cuddling & feeding them food. Used the boat transfer from Brisbane.  Really lovely.  Highly recommend.
Kids loved it,"Our grand daughter loved her photo with the Koala but the highlight for her was feeding the kangaroos in the paddock. She felt very safe and the food is plentiful for them. We had to buy our 2 grandchildren a cuddly kangaroo as we left !!,"
Great fun,Love this place. Plenty of animals. Many which you can interact with. Pay for holding snakes & koalas. I managed the whole park in 3hrs.
Fabulous,"If you want to see Australian animals up close, this is the place to visit and you won’t be disappointed. Koalas, kangaroos, wombats, platypus, echidna, dingoes, Tassie devils, cassowary and emus are just some of the animals you will see. Arriving by ferry its just a short climb up the stairs and through the gates for this wonderful experience. It was a thrill to be able to pat the kangaroos."
Family Outing,We were there on a hot day over Christmas.A lot of animals were asleep which was disappointing for our grandchildren.But there were plenty of koalas and kangaroos to see.The platypus exhibit was the highlight as they were very active while the children were watching.A great place for overseas visitors to get a glimpse of Australian animals.
Great place for family tour,"You can hold koala for pictures, you can touch semi-wild kangaroo and emu in the huge yard. And you can see a lot of unique animals in Australia here, even platypus."
Not a bad day out ,It’s closer than travelling to Brisbane - a sound place to take kids but slightly underwhelming - it’s a place you would go once and hard pressed to find reason to go again.
Cuddle a Koala,"This is one of the oldest Koala sanctuary, but if you love animals especially koalas you will love the Lone pine, one of the few places where you can still cuddle a koala. It is only half a day trip but worth it."
The best of Oz in one place,"I I have always been fascinated by the wide range of animals that are in Australia. I was quite excited when I found out that lone Pine was the only facility in the country that cared for exclusively Australian animals. My original question was for a facility that allowed people to hold a koala, as was my wife’s desire. Once I investigated this I realized that Lonepine not only was the best facility for viewing and holding koalas but they had a real mission to protect the koalas, not just display them. Then I realized that for a fairly reasonable fee we could make the day of it and have a private tour that would access the entire facility. This included opportunities to meet and greet dingoes (my favorite), a show consisting of raptors of all types, feeding Platapods and Tasmanian Devils and more!We were escorted by Meghan, a personable and extremely knowledgeable cultural liaison who made our day fly by. We saw the backstage workings of all the exhibits and participated in preparing daily meals for some of the animals. The best bonus was that we had photographs taken with quite a few of the exotic animals. It was quite an experience and we cannot recommend it highly enough"
"What a fantastic place, the animals were amazing.","If you want to do something different then come here, we enjoyed it tremendously. The animals were so funny and had no fear when being handled. We thought it would be an hour's visit but we stayed nearly all day and loved it."
Lovely visit,We had a great family day out and really loved it. Will be coming back and bringing/ telling friends.
Excellent,We enjoyed cuddling the koalas. We had booked before we got there and everything ran to time. The bears are cute and the staff knowledgeable
Perfect family/friends outing,"Animals are well cared for and the grounds are lush and green. We hand fed the sheep and kangaroos who were relaxed under the shade of trees. We watched the lorikeets enjoy a feed. Perfect day out for families, plenty of parking, buy tickets online to save, souvenir shops and cafe available. A+"
Great day,Myself and my husband went to the scantuary just before Christmas. We went down by boat and back on the bus. We had a fantastic day up close with the animals we loved it. Would highly recommend it. The staff are fantastic.
KOALAS!!,Loved it here. Friendly staff and you get to cuddle a koala bear. Highly recommend for a day/ half day trip with family
Day site seeing must do,Awesome awesome experience great way to spend some time. You don’t need a lot of time to get around and see all the animals up close. I highly recommend.
Fabulous kola sanctuary,"We caught the bus from city centre, really easy.We pre-booked tickets on line which was cheaper.Although the kola experience was sold out.Loads of Kola's and kangaroos to look at. Place felt clean and well organised.Would recommend for all ages.You can feed kangaroos which is fun."
Koala's galore,Great day out at the koala sanctuary - very hot but still managed to see lots of koalas and Australian animals. Educational and fun for all ages. Opportunity to get up close with a koala too. Extremely hot day and disappointed there were not many water fountains/places to fill bottles.Worth getting the boat up the river to see a different view of Brisbane and it's suburbs.
Don't miss Lone Pine Sanctuary,"Visitors and residents alike should not miss Lone Pine Sanctuary. Located so close to Brisbane and accessible by a pleasant ferry ride from Brisbane City, Lone Pine features a delightful environment with an abundant selection of Australian flora,fauna and Australian wildlife."
Animal Sanctuary Brisbane,This sanctuary was so well organised it was a pleasure to visit.  The staff were friendly and lovely with the animals especially the Koala's.  Plenty for all and lots of organised displays - the Owl and Hawks display with them flying free was fabulous and very informative.  We travelled to a few sanctuaries on our visit and this was by far the best one to visit.  Easy travel on a boat down the river to reach it from the town.
A lot more that just Kolalas,Lone Pine Sanctuary was a delight to visit. The animals all appeared healthy and happy and there was a lot to see.Our only disappointment was that the timings of ‘contact’ experiences were not good in respect of our river transportation. We did however enjoy the day
Great facility,We had a great time getting to see the variety of animals being very well cared for. Highly recommend
Exhibit highlights,"Returning to Brisbane as a visitor compared to once being a resident, I found Lone Pine Koala Sactuary exhibits absolutely amazing.  Naturally many improvements have been made over the years and we took advantage of the scheduled information sessions on offer.  These presentations were great (except for the absolute rudeness of patrons in the reptile talk) and staff were very knowledgeable and approachable.  Highly recommend a visit."
Amazing place to see the famous Australians animals. Particularly the Koalas.,Amazing ! Perfect place to take time to see the most of famous Australian’s animals like Koalas Kangourou Wambat Tasmanian Devils Dingo. I realized à think on my bucket list to see And take a Koalas.
Fun day with the kids,The park was fun. The animals seem to be well cared for. The prices were reasonable. I loved the bird show and sheep dog shows.
Bucket List event completed,"This is a must..... really good day out, much more than just Koalas.... but to be fair seeing them was enough. Highly recommended to do it with the boat cruise, absolutely stunning views"
Get up close to koalas,"A well run sanctuary of Koalas where you can get your photograph taken up close or even holding one.   Plenty of Wallabies and kangaroos roaming around as well as farm animals, birds, dingos, platypus and plenty more.  A fun and interesting day out for the family young and old."
Koalas !!! :-),"If you love Koalas, Kangaroos and many other Australian marsupials, reptiles and birds, then it's a great day out to visit the Lone Pine Sanctuary in Brisbane. Always good to support places like this to help the wildlife especially at the moment with such devastation going on further down the coast due to the fires.Easy to get to by road but you can also get the fast or slow boat down the river from South Bank but all in all it's time well spent and very informative if you speak to the keepers too."
A Local Gem and a Favourite for Kids,"Lone Pine is brilliant, nice and local so perfect for the annual pass and then able to head in and out as we please. Animals on offer are great, and the shows were informative. Keep up the brilliant work!"
OS visitors,"Great place to take OS visitors...so many koalas, kangaroos and we were lucky enough to see the keepers feeding the platypus, a treat for my visitors"
Don't need a whole day to see this place.,If you are planning a whole day to see this place its not necessary because its small. They do charge extra to get pictures with the Koalas and let you hold them for only a short time. This is a good place to see Koalas interact with each other and watch how they go crazy for their eucalyptus then fall asleep.
Huge place with loads to see,"As a couple I thought it was well worth the money for a good few hours of getting to be up close with various animals. Yes the queue of touching a koala is long but it goes fast the only thing for me was we went a few days ago and the women holding the koala has such a face on her it ruined our pictures so we weren't best pleased with that considering the man before was really happy talking to everyone and smiling for photos to. Animals are well looked after well fed well watered and well cared for. Keepers we seen walking around had a really amazing bond with the koalas and had time to talk to us about a few of them which made it better personally for me. Loads more events going on around also with other animals e.g farm animals, bird show, talks. Food is priced reasonably."
Excellent day out,Really enjoyed our visit. Lots of families having an enjoyable time.Easy to get around and food wasn’t too pricey.Loved patting the koala.Only complaint is that water stations are needed.
Feeding kangaroos and holding koalas,"We were surprised Lone Pine Koala sanctuary had so many other native Australian species but the platypus was definitely a highlight besides the kangaroos and koalas.The free-range area where you can hand feed kangaroos and wallabies is really cool and definitely worth spending some time doing. The ""hold a koala"" experience is absolutely worth doing, buy your ticket early as they do limit the number of these they do a day.We made a whole day of it here, taking our time seeing all the animals, and it was really worth it."
A great way to spend a 6-hour layover in Brisbane.,"This is a great way to spend two or three hours... whether you are a child or an old guy like me. For an extra $25 you can hold a koala, but feeding the kangaroos and wallabies is part of the admission price. As a visitor I was able to buy my ticket at the airport train station. It then takes about 90 minutes to go from Brisbane airport to the Lone Pine Sanctuary via train and connecting bus."
A MUST while in Brisbane!,"This is a 20 minute Uber ride or you can take the boat to the sanctuary. If I had the time, I would have taken the boat. I would highly recommend getting there 10-15 min. prior to when they open  and wait in line. Walk down to the Koala main area and buy tickets (starting at 9:30am) to hold a koala. It is a $25 fee on top of the entrance fee but well worth it in my opinion. You can spend an entire day here. I can't say enough good things about. It was a highlight of my trip."
Prettt underwhelming,"A lot of Koalas as expected.   The queues for photos with Koalas were massive.  Not much information on Koalas, expected a lot more of an information centre, didn’t see any baby Koalas.  If you’ve been to Australia Zoo wouldn’t bother with this, kids were more interested in the wild lizards.  Raptor show was also pretty underwhelming, they walked so fast with the raptors no one could take a photo of them."
Lone Pine - Beautiful place for the family,"Lone Pine is situated at Fig Tree Pocket, approximately 10 minutes from the City.  Here is where you will find lots of Koala's to cuddle and get a picture taken with them.  There are also other animals including the one we like the working dogs rounding up the sheep.  These dogs are very talented and it quite amazing to watch the dogs.  You can usually pat the dogs after also they are friendly.  The birds of prey are also excellent and amazing to watch.  There are also ponies to see, baby chickens, guinea pigs and the Big Pig!  Don't miss it if you come to Brisbane."
Great place to get close and personal with Ausralia's unique wildlife.,"Lone Pine is on the edge of Brisbane city. Public transport bus even goes past the reserve. You can see and hold Koala bears, feed kangaroos and watch sheep dogs at work and see many Australian animal in open areas. Food and drinks are available."
Heart warming & Delightful,"I loved how the staff were so passionate about Koala Preservation & their dedication to protecting the Koala Species. I went to one of the talks in the research building to hear all about Koalas and it was great to speak to one of the experts afterwards. The Sanctuary feels very much like a zoo the way it’s layes out - it’s quite easy to navigate & is suitable for families with small children. You can even hold a Koala & stroke one too, as well as experience other animals too such as snakes & feed Kangaroos etc. It’s quite a small place & parking is slightly scarce depending on what time you arrive. The car parks huge but it was packed when we got there so perhaps go when it first opens to avoid any parking issues. It was also surprisingly busy too & full or tourists more than we would have liked - as we were hoping it would be slightly less commercial. However it’s not a bad thing considering all the admission money all goes back into supporting the Sanctuary’s work & protecting Koalas. It’s a great little day out for a morning or afternoon visit. We stopped here as we drove through Brisbane on our road trip to break the journey up & it was a great way to stretch our legs too & grab a much needed coffee & of course see some beautiful Koalas. Also - tip, if you’re desperate for a coffee / snack or cold drink at lunchtime - avoid going to the main cafe as it will be heaving & overcrowded. Go to the one situated in the car park just outside the main entrance in a little wooden shack & you’ll get what you need quicker. I hope whoever reads this found this helpful,  Enjoy - the Koalas are adorable."
Wonderful experience ,My wife and I visited but should point out we did not hold the koala’s as we both agreed that seemed a little unfair on the bears. I would say however that this is a lovely park with plenty of animals on show and you can get close to a number of the big animals you want to see in Australia. It was a great day however the lunch options could be a little better as it was all very beige food but that’s being picky.
Good,"I caught the Miramar fast cruise to Lone Pine and that was a most enjoyable trip. Overall I enjoyed the koala sanctuary, however there was not as much animal interaction as I had hoped and everything costs extra. I knew that going in, but still I was a little disappointed at the prices. I did have a one on one with a blind in one eye emu though and that melted my heart. She leaned her head right into my chest and allowed me to scratch her head and neck, she was gorgeous. I spent quite a bit of time patting her. Feeding time with the koalas was great and staff were really responsive to questions. The raptor show was good, but once again you have to pay to hold one. I enjoyed the interaction with the black and white cockatoos, it would have been nice to have entry into their enclosures though. I don’t begrudge the payments as I know it goes back into the park, but it would be nice if everything wasn’t so expensive. I do recommend it, but if it’s the only time you might get to go there, make sure you have plenty on your credit card."
Sharing is caring ,"Had an fun day at the sanctuary with the family, feeding the young kangaroos was hilarious and by our visit the park raises money to rescue as rehabilitate abused or hurt animals. Good job guys"
Out of the city but worth the trip,"This was such a great trip, we were in Australia for two weeks and it really finished off the holiday on a high, it’s too small for an all day visit however there’s plenty to see, make sure you check out the shows and demonstrations esp the birds of prey and the $2 kangaroo feed is an absolute must-do here in addition to cuddle a koala"
Amazing Platinum Tour,"We took the Platinum Tour, and it was quite an action-packed day!  It seemed to us that each tour varies a bit in terms of what you to in between the major attractions, like holding a koala, and it probably varies based on what needs to be done around the sanctuary.  For example, we started our day by hanging out with an awesome rainbow bird and giving her some practice at flying!  The whole tour feels very much like you're ""behind the scenes"" a lot of the time, and often we were literally in staff-only areas accompanied by our fabulous guide.We got to do a lot of neat encounters that would not be possible visiting on our own, like creating a scavenger hunt with fruit for the cassowary and hanging out in the enclosure with the dingos.  We also got to go into a koala enclosure and get really close for awesome photos, although we made sure not to interrupt their sleepy time!  For all of the encounters and photos that were open to the public, we got right in and our, and it was all very seamless.  In some instances we were mixed in with everyone else, but our tour guide had the secret tips on where to find the animals - protip: visit the kangaroos in the fields to the right of the raptor show, as they are a lot less traveled by visitors.The tour also included great perks like tea and a morning snack, lunch, and photos and souvenirs waiting for us at the end.Definitely recommended for an unforgettable day!"
"Great place but long, unnecessary waits",Great place with loads to do. I bought a ticket in the morning for “hold a koala” Scheduled for the afternoon. When it came to it there was an enormous queue and I waited for over an hour. If I could have got a refund on my ticket I would have. I absolutely understand why time with the koalas goes at the koalas pace... so why on earth do you sell so many tickets??? Or just warn people when they’re buying them that the wait is long. Ruined an otherwise lovely day
See all the animals,"Great place to see the Koalas, Platypus and Kangaroos. For an extra fee you get a photo of you holding a Koala. Bus ride from the city center drops you off right by the door."
Great day,Very good service.We enjoyed the ride and the visit of lone pine.Very welcoming staff.Do not hesitate to take the boat to lone pine and enjoy the river landscape.
Wonderful place don’t miss it,Picked by our cruise line. I can imagine it’s more crowded than one would like at certain times. Do the Koala experience with photos-well worth it. Luncheon service looked good. Feeding kangaroos was a bust-just take some pictures. The zoo is limited. Go to birds of prey  live show.
Koalas,This is a great place to visit if you want to meet the natives. Lots of koalas and kangaroos. You can get there by catching a local bus number 445 and only costs 6 dollars.
"Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary should be on your Brisbane, Australia to-do-list",This is the place to go to learn about a wide array of wildlife in Australia.  It has a large number of Koalas and you can get your picture taken holding one for a $25 donation.
A must see when in Brisbane,A wonderful way to get up close to Australia’s unique wildlife especially when they are so endangered
Meet Kangeroos !!,"You get to sit with the kangeroos, what more do you need.  A great little place. We visited when we arrived in Brisbane and we were not disappoited.  It was an extremly hot day so most of th animals were hiding from the sun and too hot and bothred to be fed, but we sat with the kangeroos, saw the koala's and th other animals. I was very happy. Take a pinic with you as there are some some lovey areas near the entrance by the river when you can sit and relax. Arive early if you want to book up for chats and meet and greet."
Amazing ,"Very pretty zoo, and of good size, there are tons to see, and very close to town. The day we went no shows were happening but i am pretty sure there are some happening usually. Take some comfy shoes and make sure to buy kangaroo food before visiting them if you want them to surround you, they are very cute and nice and they let you touch them like its the best thing ever they can get."
Get up close to Koalas ,"A really fun place for kids (and adults!) to visit. Feed the kangaroos, cuddle a koala. A perfect introduction to iconic Australian animals."
"True love, Time stops","It doesn't matter if you are child or adult , you will fall in love with little beautiful an amazing koalas hugging their mothers. You can visit almost all kind of local species in one place"
An unforgettable experience ,"My fiancé and I started off our honeymoon in Brisbane and the only reason we flew into Brisbane from Boston was to experience Lone Pine Sanctuary and trust me, it did not disappoint. We purchased the Diamond Tour which I highly highly recommend, and spent 6 hours interacting and learning about Australia’s animals. The tour not only gave us “back stage” access to animals feeding areas but also gave us a full VIP experience by letting us interact with and hold Koalas, snakes, birds and dingos without waiting in line. The photo team who took our pictures at every animal encounter was awesome, I can’t wait to frame the pictures when I get home! The tour also included morning tea and lunch which was much needed as we did so much walking and so much learning. It was an incredibly unique experience to say the least. I can’t thank our tour guide Megan enough for kicking off our honeymoon with so much fun!! Megan was super knowledgeable and answered literally every question we had. She’s also hilarious and cracked a lot of jokes which made the day even better. Thank you times a million, Megan and Lone Pine, we will never forget this experience!"
Lone Pine Sanctuary,We visited Lone Pine on our own. We took a Uber back to the place where we were staying. Lone Pine was awesome. You can touch the koalas for free. Just get in line early. We also touched and fed the kangaroos. So much to see and experience here. Highlight of trip.
Great place to see Australian wildlife up close,"We spent several hours petting koalas, emus and kangaroos and learning about various species of Australian wildlife"
So many koalas...,"Up close to 130 koalas hanging out in eucalyptus laden posts and branches. Very cute. Platypus, birds, kangaroos, crocodiles, lizards, snakes, frogs, wombats, bats, farm animals, dingoes... lots of weird and wonderful native Australian critters. I enjoyed seeing them all. I was looking forward to stroking a koala but the queue to do that had close to 200 people... there were 130 koalas, and only one for the photo and stroke opportunity. Why not have 10 koalas available to minimize queues and spread the load. I didn't understand that, but did enjoy the park on the whole, and it is helping save koalas which is a very good thing."
So cute,The sanctuary is filled with koalas and kangaroos. You can pet the kangaroos and feed them with food bought on premise. You can pay extra to have a koalA experience such as holding them but book in advance as it sells out
"Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary , poor...",We visited the Sanctuary with relos from the UK in 2019. It is 10 yrs since we first visited the Sanctuary to find the only thing that had changed was the volume of people going through the turnstiles We counted 10 coaches in the car park plus a full car park.The cages for the birds are very small and other animals  also in confined space.I would not advise anybody to visit this place. They need to think about using  some of there money for obtaining more land and making bigger cages....
Sleeping the Life .,Our friend from the states who is staying with us for a while. Wanted to see the koalas 🐨 & this was a great place to see the dreamers as cute as they are beautiful. She loved it we had a great time .
Great Tourist Attraction,"We stayed 3 nights in Brisbane. Looked at packages to visit here, but decided just to use the local bus. We had a great time, seeing the koala bears and the kangaroos up close. No problem queuing to get in, but queuing to get back on the bus was a bit of a shambles."
Lacking in animals,"To start when we arrived on the bus (infrequent) we waited in a long queue which split into further queues and moved very slow. The staff were trying to get people in. $1 for a map!The sanctuary itself contained quite a few small koalas some could be photographed for free others were accessible only by paying $25 and queuing for a long time. Before 12pm tickets were totally sold out. The largest koala sanctuary in the world is the claim, I doubt it.As far as other animals we saw some birds, a chicken, three dingoes, a cassowarry and briefly one platypus. Very disappointing especially for $42!Lone Pine should look to the Cleland Wildlife Park and other great parks and sanctuaries in South Australia where people can see far more animals in a better environment at a more affordable cost."
Koala Experience,"If you are looking for a great place to see Koala’s, this is it! Location is not far from Brisbane main city and  staff are friendly. Very busy on weekends and holidays. You can purchase tickets on line for discount prices. Lots of Koala’s to view. You can get very close to them and pay extra to hold them. Also have other Australian animals like birds or prey and dog shows. However, Koala’s are the main attraction. Recommend coming when they are being fed, around 1pm, as they are very active. Great day out and would recommend for families."
Great Day Out,Lots to see and you can interact with the Kangaroos as well.Well worth a visit to see the animals of the outback!
Experience of a Lifetime 🐨❤️🇦🇺,"I absolutely loved being here! I spent all day here.. watching and learning about the koalas.. and holding one was a lifelong dream come true. The keepers and handlers were all very sweet and knowledgeable! I was very impressed w my guide, Megan! The kangaroo walkabout was soo awesome as well! The grounds were very clean and well maintained. I would love to come back!"
Great Day for the kids,"Visited Lone Pine with 6 children under 8, two of them in prams. It was a fun and educational day out for all the children with something to see for everyone. Plenty of sitting areas to enjoy a packed lunchbox, or you can purchase from the cafe. Lots of walking involved to cover the entire park, so plenty of water for all is a necessity. Excellent variety of animals and birds to see, with interesting displays. Older kids loved the snake house displays. Kangaroos roaming freely in their enclosure, which you can walk around in, was a highlight for all. Up close with the kangaroos and lots of great photo opportunities.  Hats are a must, as it can be very hot in the open areas in the warmer months.....we visited in September and it was warm then. Highly recommend a visit to Lone Pine for the whole family. Young and old."
Best day ever ,"If you like wild life then this is the place to go. It’s not only about Koalas which are amazing creatures. Watch out for the lizards as they are we’ll camouflaged and are happy to pose for a photo. Tanzanian devils were trying to stay in the shade as we’re the wombats so didn’t see much of them. Apparently there’s some disease spreading amongst the devils so try and see them whilst you can. The Kangaroos were very friendly and you can buy feed to give them though I think they were over fed on the day we went.  Emus wandering about which can be a bit intimidating but the just leave you alone. The parrots were funny popping out to say hello. The Cockatoos seemed fed up but the are caged. The platypus was busy swimming about. Snakes, frogs and lizards were difficult to spot due to camouflage but fun looking for them. Watching the Koalas eat was funny the seem to spring to life for a short time then fall asleep in whatever position they’re in. The talk was very informative. The cafe was far too busy and queues very long; I suggest you go there first whilst everyone else wander around then go wander. We opted for slow cruise rather than express; you could buy food and drink on that and is away to avoid the cafe at load pines; I was glad to see proper plates and cups rather than disposable. Crew all very friendly."
Touching koalas and kangaroos ,"It was an enjoyable and fun experience, as we got to touch the koalas for free and take pictures with it. The entrance fee was a fare price.  The whole zoo is also very well managed.   Highly recommended as one of the top spot especially if you visit Brisbane with little kids."
Awesome.,Really good day out. Only marking it down as cashier overcharged us as two adults and two children instead of a family rate. Cashier in the gift shop did rectify the mistake when we queried it’s but shouldn’t have happened. Site is lovely and animals well cared for.
Day Trip,Very Fun and enjoyable trip. Highly recommended to go early if you want to cuddle the koala. Kangaroo Feeding is also a fun activity.
Great place did not hold koala ,We went xmas day but obviously limited staff. Great place but would have been nice to hold a Koala.  Not the fault of the sanctuary but many rude visitors who break rules and push in.  It's a shame someone has to wave their feet into the tasmanian devils would have  been interesting had they got bitten. Also disappointing had to pay for kangaroo food. Overall though great place and loved the birds
Lone Pube Koala sanctuary,"Although the weather wasn't great, the sanctuary was awesome! I didn't think we would see so many different animals. The kangaroo exhibit was unreal. Great experience and amazing time!"
Best place to see koalas,"We've been to other places in Sydney to see Koalas and kangaroos but Lone Pine koala Sanctuary is by far the best place. For AUD25, you can hold a koala and get your own picture. Or you may touch the koala for free during certain time slots. They're so cute! We spent a few hours in there. Worth every penny! Would definitely go back."
Pretty Neat,"Our flight to Fiji got cancelled, so we were looking for something to do in Brisbane.  The Koala Sanctuary was only a 20 minute drive from our hotel near the airport.  There are so many Koalas, but there are plenty of other animals to see also.  There was a rapture show, but the lorikeet feeding at 4pm was probably the best event of the day."
Koalas + Kangaroos + Emu = A Wonderful Day!,"When I knew i was visiting Australia for Christmas, I hoped there would be an opportunity to see some of the native animals.What a wonderful place Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary is!The animals all look happy and some can be stroked, so a real ""up close"" experience.I learnt a lot about the animals and didn't want to leave. The only thing I would say is to arrive early so you get to hold a koala and see all the feeding times if you want to!!!I would love to go back on my next visit to Australia. I will be arriving early!"
Great outing in Brisbane on Christmas day,"Memorable visit amidst koalas, kangaroos and other nature. Well organized sessions. Will recommend for any age."
Lone Pine,"Amazing experience, a MUST DO if you are anywhere near Brisbane. Koalas everywhere, additional fee to hold a koala. Lots of other exhibits too. They don't advertise the kangaroo experience, it's PHENOMENAL! Kangaroos roaming everywhere, feed them, it is unbelievable. Well run and clean, lots to see, and a once-in-a-lifetime."
What an incredible experience,"Lone pine was simply spectacular. We were staying in Brisbane on holiday and decided to go on Christmas Day as it was luckily open. The weather wasnt great and it rained for a lot of the time we were there but we still had the most incredible day. The koala interaction was amazing!! We paid $25 to hold the most adorable koala and it also included a photo to take home. So reasonable and so worth it! They also have free options too. Feeding the kangaroos in the field was mind blowing and something I will never forget. The staff were fantastic, so helpful and friendly. They really care so much about these animals and the animals are so well cared for. We got to see the dingos, platypus and wombats too which was awesome. I can’t rate this place high enough and was so sad to leave. The best day of our trip by far."
Great way to spend a leisure day out,"Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary was a delightful place to spend a leisure day out with the family. It’s not very big but our family spent a good 4 hours there. The photo opportunity with the koalas is not to be missed and there were only 2 sessions each day. We were only allowed to gently touch their backs and the koalas were constantly rotated to ensure they are not stressed by visitors. The keepers did somewhat rush us during our photo taking partly due to the long queue behind us, so we did not get a great shot (the koala looked the other way in our photos 😂). But it was all good anyway. We did take our time in the free-roaming animal enclosure where we got to mingle with kangaroos and emus. It was a spacious enclosure so we took a pleasant walk around it. The Raptor Show was fantastic as we got to come up close with many kinds of predator birds some of which flew just inches above our heads. Our only disappointment was the limited range of food and beverage available at the sanctuary. To our knowledge, there was only a small cafeteria which was within a gift shop and the queue was way too long. Good to know the sanctuary provided free wifi. Overall, we enjoyed our trip to this sanctuary and will recommend to other families. And we encourage you to stop by the nearby Indooroopily Shopping Mall after your outing for a good early dinner and perhaps some shopping."
the most amazing day,"I was born and bred in Brisbane but have lived overseas for 20+ years now, but whenever I come back to Brisbane I make a point of revisitng Lone Pine. I was with friends this time so we paid extra for the Wild Koala Encounter. There were six of us with a Lone Pine guide talking to us about the koalas and their care. We got to go into one of the koala enclosures and jump the queue for our photos holding a koala. Definitely worth the money. Great to see all the other Aussie fauna too. Lone Pine really is a special place and I applaud the work they do. Don't miss it."
Worth a visit,Worth a visit. You get to feed the roos and close encounter with koala. Place is not as big as expected. May take only around 3 hours.
Great times ,Did it all: held a koala. Petted a kangaroo. Drank Australien wine.  Typical tourist; loved it.  Turned a layover into an adventure
Koalas are good ,Good for Koala only. Koala are more and other animals were not many. The raptor show was good and many kangaroos feeding was good.
Overpriced,"Awful experience.Overpriced and overcrowded.Have been to a few similar places, none nearly as expensive. Long queues, avoid if at all possible.Large selection of koalas in small cages"
"Green, Animals and Curiosity ",Great place for everyone. Ideal for locals and tourists. It’s a short trip from the city and takes less time than going to the bigger parks. My favourite is the platypus enclosure as it’s a fish tank so you get to see them ;). Kangaroo enclosure is the best I have seen. Tips are to get there early for the feeding and membership cards give discounts in the park.
Day at Lone pine,A great day out. A very well kept zoo with lots of space to mingle with koalas and Roos. Food area is very nice and has reasonable choices for lunch or snack. Thoroughly recommend.
Behind the Scenes Tour,"I visited the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary with two friends, and we booked the Behind the Scenes tour. The park is beautiful, and our guide, Megan, provided an amazing look at the animals. We helped prepare food for some birds and the platapus. We got up close with some dingos, birds of prey and kangaroos, and we had pictures taken with a variety of animals, including koalas.  The tour was two hours long, which provided a great overview of the park and the animals and gave us some behind the scenes information. Megan was incredibly knowledgeable, answering all of our questions and giving detailed information on how the park works and how the animals are handled.  I was especially impressed to hear how well the park treats the animals, not forcing the koalas into picture taking if they aren’t comfortable.The tour was worth the price, given how much information we were given, along with the up close access to the animals. It also includes copies of the pictures, which you would normally have to purchase.  It also allowed us time to wander the park on our own afterwards."
Fabulous place,"Friends who live in Brisbane took us here as we were visiting from the UK. What a fantastic day we had. So many Australian animals... kangaroos you can feed. Koalas up close. Wombats, dingos, everything was there all in one place. Even met the legend John Barrowman (British entertainer) in the queue whilst waiting to have a photo taken with a koala - made my day ! Well worth a bit if you're in the area."
Lovely afternoon at Sanctuary ,"Spent a hot afternoon in shady sanctuary by the Brisbane river. Cool breezes off river while we wander around the animals. Koalas  kangaroos, wallabies and lots of birds ."
"Great day out, close to the city",I had a friend from Brasil staying and she wanted to see the local wildlife. Unfortunately it was during a heatwave so the weather was uncomfortable but we still had a great time. Most of the animals were pretty quiet on the day - trying to keep cool - but still we got to see lots of koalas and kangaroos (the open kangaroo range was awesome for patting them) and saw two platypus which was amazing. They were really active! Overall a great day out only 15 minutes from the city. Highly recommended!
Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary,A great place to spend the day with kids.Lot of native animals. Can watch animal shows (i.e.sheep dog show). Can feed animals.
"Flight of birds not very long, no really gift shop",Flight of the birds very short and they do not tell u at the start that the birds will be eating live rodents in front of u. Also no really gift shop only a general shop.
Hug a Koala,"You can hold a Koala by yourself there, and taking photos with them! Also many lizards were walking on the street, just like theres their home and fear nothing. You can also feed Kangaroos here."
Great place to see Koalas!,"We went to Lone Pine as a shore excursion from the ship.  When we got there, we made a beeline for the ""hold the koala"" area, so I could get a picture with a koala.  There are also many other animals at Lone Pine such as emus, kangaroos, and wallabys.  This is a must see in the Brisbane area."
Must see !!!!!!,If you visit Brisbane this place should be the number one stop on the list! The cost is $42 for a single person and discounts for families. If you want to hold a koala it cost $25. A bag of food for the kangaroos is $2.. Make sure go to the far end of the field where there is lots of kangaroos sitting in the shade. We mainly went to see the koalas and there were lots of them! Highly recommend!
Wonderful Sanctuary worth supporting!,Worth a 30 minute ride from Brisbane. This sanctuary has a large number of rescued animals including a significant amount of koalas. There are also many open areas where kangaroos run free and bright colored lorakeets congregate regularly. Your visit will support their effort to care for these wonderful animals.
Koalas and Kangaroos ,My husband and I visited Lone Pine Koala sanctuary on my 50th birthday.  I came to Brisbane specifically to visit this sanctuary and the park did not disappoint.   All the staff were exceptionally friendly and very knowledgeable of all the animals.   It was a dream come true to hold a koala and feed the kangaroos. This was the best gift ever!!!!   Thank you Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary for the opportunity to check mark a box off my bucket list!Lisa
What a treat,Our cruise ship docked for a day in Brisbane and we met friends who took us on a tour of Brisbane and then to the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary.  It was the first time that my husband and I had seen koalas in the flesh and to actually stroke one was such a treat.  There was so much wildlife there that we have only seen on television.  We even fed the roos!  Well worth a visit.
So many Koalas!! And other Australian animals,we had a great trip on the Koala express boat to the sanctuary . The staff are knowledgable and friendly and I really felt they put the animals first . I saw a platapus for the first time ever and baby dingos !!
"Not longer a koala sanctuary, but a zoo.","The setting of Lone Pine is truly gorgeous, and it features many koalas which you can get quite close to. But as we were told by a member of staff, Lone Pine doesn’t actually take in any koalas from the wild for rescue / rehab - but breeds them on site. This makes the place a zoo for entertainment rather than a sanctuary for koalas. The reason, or so we were told, was to avoid infectious diseases from getting on site. It does however take in other animals, the kangaroo / wallaby area is fabulous - the animals have plenty of room to run around and get away from the crowds. Holding koalas is illegal in many states now for animal welfare reasons - but not in Queensland. Great news for Lone Pine - but it did make me quite uncomfortable seeing them being held like teddy bears for photos here, albeit for short durations and cyclical. The bird enclosures were very small, and the flying fox bats also looked very depressed in their fairly small cage. We had a much nicer experience at the Koala Hospital in Port Macquarie, here koalas have lots of space and are genuinely in a sanctuary. If you’re interested, the guidelines on what makes an appropriate sanctuary are, you can find these in numerous places online."
Fantastic wildlife and not just koalas,"This Sanctuary, to us, seemed really well run. Lots of animals, many endangered, could be seen. Entry tickets are fairly priced. You can hold a koala if you want (extra $25/30) and are willing to queue a bit - that experience was really well-managed I thought, with a fast-moving queue."
Perfect place to face your fears ,"We got there as soon as the rain started to fall. But there is a nice waiting area outside with usb charging ports and wicker chairs that was covered so we were able to stay dry. Once inside the park, we were sad to find we had gotten there too late to hold the Koalas. But we were still able to get very close for pictures. They are hanging out all around the park. We were even able to roam around d with kangaroos. I was able to pet an older male kangaroo and some young ones too. Lots of animals we didn’t expect to see including the Tasmanian devil and pladypus. We got to hear the kookaburra’s laugh - which was quite the experience! The staff was very knowledgeable, friendly and helpful!"
Tranquil animal bonding ,Loved it. But; it wasn’t a cheap day. Admission was about AUD40/pax; a small bag of kangaroo food (to feed the Roos) was AUD2; food and drink in the cafe was expensive as were souvenirs. Having said that; enjoyed every minute of it. Took the bus there from South Brisbane; catch it from the Cultural Centre; comes hourly. Takes about 45min to get there for less than AUD5/pax. Park is fairly large; but animal density isn’t high. Saw the koalas; you can line up to take a free photo with them; but the koala cuddle is an extra charge and limited in number/day. Kangaroo enclosure was lovely. Spent the longest there. There was a lonely platypus; a few wombats and a Tasmanian devil. There are enclosures for farm animals and birds. That’s about it. Still; I enjoyed it
More than what was expected!,"First of all, I always read the bad reviews first, and I found much complaints about the pictures taken with the koalas, but had you had a “back scene” tour they would have understood why.We took the Adult Sanctuary Experience which cost $310.00 Australian ($209.00 US). Now you may think that is too much money, but BELIEVE ME, it isn’t! For what you get, it really isn’t.Now mind you, this is a 5 star rating because of circumstances. The tours are small and take 6 people, but me and my partner were the only ones signed up, so essentially we were given a private tour, and by the greatest tour guide ever, KAYLA!KAYLA Was friendly, knowledgeable, upbeat, liked her job, and overall great company on the tour. She treated us like kings and gave us more than what was outlined in the tour.For $209 US we.....Fed and interacted with the kangaroos and emusHad reserved front seats for the “live” Raptor showTook pictures with a raptor or owl individually (their camera)Took pictures with a raptor or owl together (our camera, this was a total extra!)Up close and personal in one of the koala pensTook pictures holding a koala individually (their camera)Took pictures holding a koala together (our camera, this was a total extra)Up close and personal with a python individually (their camera)Up close and personal with a python together (our camera, this was a total extra!)Preparing meal for dingo puppies, then feeding them Witnessing the feeding of baby rescued bats (this was a total extra!)Helping Kayla feed and train a lorikeetPreparing meal for the platypuses, then feeding themFeeding the Tasmanian DevilAMAZING, YES?BTW Kayla, you were correct about backtracking to the kangaroos, we went to see the kangaroos after leaving you, and witnessed a full on jumping parade of kangaroos from one end of the park to the other, it was amazing! And, we were able to be in a mob of them, feeding them)."
Definitely worth a visit,"If you want to get up close and personal with a Koala, Lone Pine is definitely worth a visit. Get there when it opens to avoid queues to hold and have a picture taken with one, the staff will take some on your phone too as well as a professional one which we really appreciated. You can see lots of other animals native to Australia and they all appeared well taken care of. The staff were very friendly and helpful! I'm so glad we visited and will go again for more Koala cuddles when we're next in Brisbane!"
Young German backpackers very impressed,I took two young German backpackers to the Lone PIne Sanctuary because they especially wanted to see Australian animals. It was their first outing on arrival in Brisbane. Of special interest to them and to me was the platypus foraging in the water under conditions.of darkness. Only once previously have i seen a platypus in captivity and never in the wild.
Great place!! Love all the animals there!,So many koalas and kangaroos!! It felt like it's own kind of heaven (if heaven smelled a little like animal poop). All the koalas were so cute and I waited in line to hold one. Then the kangaroo feeding park was so much fun. Loved that you could spend as much or as little time as you wanted in there. Definitely had some fun things for you to see!
Must see,This is one of the cutest places on earth. Koalas so close to see and even take a photo for a charge. Make sure you get in queue well time in advance as can be limited numbers. Also other interesting animals to see and the park itself is beautiful. Spent around 3 hours and loved it.
Great morning out,We had a lovely morning here. It's not a huge park so you won't want to spend all day here but its perfect for a morning or afternoon. The animals are really well looked after and the zookeepers are friendly. We paid extra to hold a koala which was a great experience and we didn't feel like they were being mistreated at all which you can find with some tourist attractions. If the koalas were even slightly stressed then the keepers would take them back to their enclosure. We also went and fed the kangaroos which was great fun. This was one of the highlights of our trip to Brisbane so I would definitely recommend.
A good trip out along the river,"A good trip out along the river for the whole family. Cuddle a Koala, more the cuddly Koala than us and of course you have to feed the Kangeroo. Don't you?Nice relaxing trip some walking is a nesseccesity."
Easy way to see koalas,Free entry and plenty of parking at a nice park setting. Good way to see koalas! Educational self tour
Great family day out,"Really well set up, in a lovely setting by the river. A good variety of animals, the Platypus was my favourite, that kept the whole family entertained. We will return soon."
Wonderful ,"We got off the plane from Vancouver and went straight to Lone Pine. We enjoyed the bird show, feeding the kangaroos and looking at all the beautiful animals they have there. My only recommendation would be to buy a ticket for a photo with a koala as soon as you get in. We tried to buy a ticket once we were done our walk around and the tickets were sold out for the day."
Lovely day out ,"We got the Mirimar cruise to the Sanctuary which was lovely as we got to do some sightseeing at the same time. The sanctuary was lovely, and there are lots of chances to learn about the animals as well as stroke/hold Koalas and feed kangaroos. If you want to hold a koala go straight to the desk, we were too late for the first booking."
Lovely three hours spent here!,We went on the Miramar cruise to the sanctuary and wondered if 3 hours would be enough but it was just right for us. On entering the parking everything was well signposted. The kangeroo enclosure was our favourite as they were all so tame and following buying some kangeroo food in the main store they were feeding out your hands. Loved watching the koalas too although as it was the middle of the day they were mostly asleep. Also the wombat and dingo were asleep too. Would have been nice seeing all the birds but not in a caged environment 😩 and able to fly aroundGreat experience and would highly recommend.
great way to get your kangaroo and koala fix,"Coming to Australia for the first time, animal lovers will want to see kangaroos and koalas. This stop checks those boxes, and you even get to pet a kangaroo and take a picture with a koala.There are other variety of animals as well. For me, 2-3 hours was enough to go through the exhibits.  I'm not a huge zoo fan, so I thought this was a good alternative to spending all day at the Australia Zoo."
I was impressed with this sanctuary.,"Went to the sanctuary via a metro bus for a fraction of the cost of a ferry.  It was an extremely warm day so wanted to come and go when I wanted so was more suited to the bus.I explored all of the sanctuary but was amazed at so many koalas in different areas never ever seen that before in zoos.The platypus house was also impressive as were the barn animals, dog show, birds and those water monitors could not get over how large they were.The park itself was clean always someone sweeping no shortage of staff for sure.My tip would be to go as soon as the doors open to beat the crowds.Toilets again always clean and tidy.Seating in cafe was plentiful and a large gift shop area.I paid when I arrived did the transaction with a credit card very express service."
Lovely day within nature,"If you want to spend an exciting day having the chance to touch some kangaroo and hold a lovely koala, this is the place for you.This Sanctuary is looking after several species, including birds and some reptiles.Highly recommended."
Koala Heaven,"If you need a full Koala experience. This is the place. You learn about them, you can pat one or even have your picture taken with them. Walk around and join in the talks about Raptor’s or sheep herding, and enjoy all that Lone Pine has to offer. We took a cruise up the river to hear a commentary of the region and history. This is one of my favorite wildlife experiences."
Wonderful day - koala heaven,"As I was in Brisbane on a business trip and had a spare day, I visited the Lone Pine Koala sanctuary.  I Took the koala express ( 35 minutes on the boat) which was well organised and staff are great.The sanctuary is great, loved holding a koala and feeding/stroking the kangoeroes.There are alsAn absolute MUST DO when in Brisbane. you won’t be disappointed 🐨"
Must-do for my Overseas Guests,"Took my visitor from China and she loved it! Taking my overseas visitors there from now on. Such a brilliant introduction to not only our unique wildlife, but also to Australian culture. The staff were very friendly and their animal presentation talks were so informative and entertaining. At no point did we feel it was too long or boring. I am Australian and have seen all these animals in the wild, but I learnt so much from the animal keepers talks and have grown so much in appreciation for these amazing creatures! You can get up close to all the animals, even the platypus! We arrived there midday and and got to all the animal presentations on the day's schedule. It's the only wildlife centre that I know of around greater Brisbane region where you can have your photo taken with a koala (the keeper holds it) and you can touch it, for free! We lined up for about 15 minutes but was so worth it for my guest as a unique experience. Thank you Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary for all you do in caring for our wildlife! I came away with a great appreciation!"
Koala time,"Visited Lone Pine on 15th October 2019 to fulfil a bucket list moment of holding a koala.  What a wonderful place, being close up to native Australian animals was just amazing and created some great memories."
"Overpriced, animals are visibly tired of all the petting","Overpriced, quite a small place. To start from, each and every minimum element including a map will cost additional money. The sanctuary does not have irrigation system so you will well feel the drought in QLD. For goats and sheep no a single piece of grass in their paddocks. Animals look exhausted because of all the patting and close contact with people - please see the photos attached. Opportunity to take a photo with koala will cost additional $20 and is run in sessions so if you are late, you are late. At the same time koalas do not look happy because of this close contact with hundreds of people. The concept is outdated,  there are plenty of other modern zois/sanctuaries in Australia where animals are well cared for. Disappointed, I  believe our country could do better."
Fantastic Experience!,"The Koala Sanctuary was one of the best animal experiences we've ever enjoyed! The staff here are very attentive toward all the animals and they really look after them. We were very pleased to know that for the koala holding experience, they only let each koala out for half hour a day so as not to frustrate them. The koalas here are so happy! We found that if you plan ahead and get there early then you will have no trouble getting to hold a koala, as understandably it's a very popular attraction.We didn't mind paying the (very small!) extra fee for a beautiful photo print-out, knowing that all the money goes to preserving the koala sanctuary! :)What you get for the entry fee is fantastic value; the Kangaroo area was especially a highlight and its good to see they too have their own private area for when they're sick of us humans!It took us about 2-3 hours to wonder through the park with a snack break in the middle.  Plan ahead and get there early so you can enjoy the park before the onslaught of tourist busses arrive, if you do this you will love your experience here."
Excellent for our overseas visitors,Our visitors enjoyed the close contact with kangaroos and emus. Highlight was seeing platypuses clearly in their tank.
"Informative, engaging, easy to navigate","Spent about 2.5 hours here (excluding photo taking, as I do not believe in man handling these beautiful animals). Park is small and shady with many trees and spots for you to rest. Koala keeper talk was informative, learnt a few new interesting Koala facts! The marsupials look happy and content, the kangaroos in the free range were pretty lazy, I think they are too used to being fed all day long. A little concerning though, to see small children chasing the poor kangaroos and getting a little too hansy with them, please educate your kids!"
The best!,If you really want to get to know something about the koalas - that's the best place. Go for the private encounter. It's so worth it! One of the best things I've experienced in Australia. Thank you!
Did what it said on the label,"An enjoyable afternoon, a couple of hours  sufficient with different shows at different times you can fill more time. Oh and the crocodile is real mean"
"Koalas, Roos, and Emus, Oh My!","The Sanctuary is definitely worth the trip and it is really Cool to see so many native Australian animals in on location. The Koala experience where my wife held a Koala and received a photo for like 20 AUD was great—and as a bonus, although “extras” couldn’t hold one, the staff was letting other family members get in the pictures they were taking with our personal cameras. So in addition to the one framed paid for photo, we got about 5-10 more on our phone with both of us in picture. The “open range” with the Roos, wallabies, and emus was very cool, and having them come right up and eat from your hand is a once in a lifetime experience. Note: to buy feed for this section, go into the little shop at bottom of hill next to the Koala Experience and by a bag for 2AUD. If you use the little gym all machines you will pay more for less and have to bag it yourself.The reason for 4 of 5 is because the total price for 2 adults and the Koala Experience was ~115 AUD, but the sanctuary itself is relatively small, and if you were to just walk through it in a zoo fashion, it would be less than an hour. For the money, make sure you take your time, cuddle with a Koala, feed the Roos, and sit in on all shows and feedings!!"
I love it there,"The World's First and larger sanctuary for koalas is the place, you can""t miss. It's the place you can get closer to nature.There are many Australia's animals like kangaroos, dingos, birds, snakes etc., but for me the most important koalas. You can enjoy Wi-fi and share pictures from hand-feed kangaroos or lorikeets. You can hold koala in your hands too."
How much can a Koala Bare?,The Koalas at the sanctuary are so well looked after that they don't appear to have too much to bare at all.   WELL WORTH A VISIT
Great Zoo for the Whole Family,"Lone pine showcases Australian animals and is a great outing for all including those with young families. If you are a local consider an annual pass and get $1 water, kids juice, 50c kangaroo food and 20% off adult food. Well worth it."
Beautiful! ,We arrived on the bus - about an hour from Brisbane centre. Lone Pine has its own bus stop and is the end of the line so you can’t miss it! Lots of different animals as well as koalas. Our little boy absolutely loved feeding the kangaroos! We spent a whole day here!
Koalas Everywhere,"If you want to get up close and personal with a Koala Bear, or 10, this is the place to go.Great opportunity to see them in the trees, also great to take some selfies with them."
Wildlife at your fingertips,"You wont find this is Britain! Such a magical day at Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary. Left to wander around at our own pace, taking in all of the wildlife and then we found the kangaroos!!! hand feeding then, hugging them and stroking their young ones. I could have spent all day here. My kids haven't stopped talking about it. Deffo a must if visiting the area"
Average,If you want to see only kangaroos and koalas then it's ok. Otherwise there are very few animals. Not really worth the time and money. Other zoo's like Taroonga in Sydney are much better.
Great day out,"If you are a first time visitor to Australia, like I was, then this is a real treat.You get to see the wildlife close up, the staff are helpful and the layout of the place is excellent.I thought the raptor show was easily the best I've ever seen (included in the entry price).Downside? None, this is very good"
Lovely Sanctuary,"I was in Brissy for two days, and was looking for something to do or visit. I came across this sanctuary on TripAdvisor. Slightly cheaper if you're lucky.I brought my parents with me and luckily the weather was okay. My parents loved this place! And I did too. We were precisely excited to see the Koalas and Kangaroos. They have a photo session for free if you want to take photos with the Koalas, using your own device. Or if you want them printed out, they offer that service too, with payment of course.The Kangaroos were on a different side of the sanctuary, you are free to walk around. The site does offer a AUD2 Kangaroo food which you can get from the shop just nearby the Koala phototaking compound.This sanctuary's quite good if you plan on visiting with family or friends. I would definitely recommend! Not only they have those, they also have cages of birds, wombats, and platypus. Even the amphibians. And Aussies cutest, opportunistic predator - The Dingo! 😍"
Koala Closeup,I visited Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary two weeks ago and the whole day spent there was wonderful.  I had always wanted to hold a koala and to experience this was wonderful.My recommendation would be if you want to hold a koala to get there for when the Sanctuary opens as the queue can be quite long.  To feed kangaroos was memorable. The sheep dog demonstration was great to watch.
Family Visit to Lone Pine Sanctuary,"If your wanting to visit a place in Brisbane to see Australian wildlife you can do no better than visit the Lone pine Sanctuary, I took my relatives from overseas and they really enjoyed the day, its affordable and entertaining.The setting is perfect, you would not believe your in Brisbane.Recognised by the Guinness Book of World Records, Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary is the world's first and largest koala sanctuary. With over 90 years of experience, Lone Pine is home to 130 koalas and over 70 species of other native Australian animals.Have a great day"
"Great experience, great value!","Had a wonderful time at Lone pine Koala Sanctuary - we were able to meet a Koala and see the bird and Kettle dog shows, while wandering the park and feed some roo's and wallaby's! Loved it, and would recommend!"
So exciting!,"We enjoyed the vibe of the sanctuary and how it focuses on the koalas health and safety rather than the visitors, which is why it is quite small. The grounds are lovely for family picnics and bbq's but if you are expecting a lot of interactivity, this isn't the place for you. However, it is a lovely place for a wander and to see some koalas. Watch out for the spiders though!"
Great day out!,"My friend and I had a lovely time from beginning to end. The river cruise was relaxing and informative. upon arrival at the sanctuary there was ample time to explore everything, plenty of opportunities for photos of koalas, kangaroos (including patting them), emus and other wildlife. Lots of shady spaces and a decent cafe. We opted not to get our photo with the koala so I can’t comment on how that may impact on time."
Great place,"Visited with two young girls , had the best time . Loads of animals to see up close . Chance to hold a koala or snake. Feed the kangaroos. So worth a visit."
Soo cute ,We really enjoyed our visit to the sanctuary. It’s a great option for a day out with friends . We’ll be back .
Value for money,"We were able to see Koalas awake, and semi active, I guess they don't get any more active than that, also Wombats and dingoes.  The tourist shop was not as overpriced as we are used to seeing."
Good place for a few hours,"My sister and I visited here when we were up in Brisbane on holiday.The park is well set up and has a good range of exhibits. There are additional charges to take part in the koala holding times (this was $25 extra), it seemed fairly well set up for a quiet day in the park (it was a midweek day not in school holiday time) staff members made it clear that once you had bought the koala holding ticket you would have to join the queue and wait until it was your turn (this is in a shaded location). We started to queue about 10 minutes before the koala holding was due to commence, staff members will take photos with your phone as well as the professional photo that is included in the package price.We did also choose to feed the kangaroos, which at $2 for a bag of food was a fair attraction.We felt that the place would benefit from having more drinking water points around site (perhaps they just weren’t well signposted, but we didn’t find any).A good couple of hours there for us, probably not big enough to be a whole day attraction."
Disappointing,"We did the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary and Cruise. The cruise was the best part of this day trip. Gorgeous 70 minute cruise along the river to Fig Tree Pocket. This was great as it travels in the opposite direction of all other cruises and the free City Hopper, so you see a different aspect of Brisbane. There’s food and drink on board and an interesting commentary. Disembarking at the Koala Sanctuary there are very steep, uneven steps up to the entrance, so be aware if arriving by boat. The Sanctuary itself was super disappointing. We thought there would be kangaroos just roaming around and other animals to see and pet but it is very sad and empty looking. There were two pigs in an empty pen, four goats in a fenced off area, a pen with chickens in, and a few sheep. Once you go through the kangaroo feeding area - it appears to be just a huge empty field - as you walk to the back corner you will find the kangaroo rest area which is fenced off. While you can see and feed the kangaroos close to the fence, this is not what is promised or imagined.  Also, the koalas are kept in individual little concrete huts with a single tree to climb. We found it very disappointing. Would not recommend. If you have the time, visit Australia Zoo or if travelling to Sydney visit Taronga Zoo or even Symbio Wildlife Park."
Great place,"Took my 5 year old grandson as a birthday treat. He loved it. It was busy plenty of tourist buses. There was ample parking. Entering is by pre purchase ticket or choosing from family combination computerized and paying credit card or you can pay at a counter. Animal enclosures are very well maintained. The walking pathways are very good easy walks around the park. The open area with emus, wallabies and Kangaroos is very big and plenty of Roos wanting to be fed. Pick up food as you go through the entry. The animal exhibits are relatively small but they are quite good and all reasonably close to each other. It is well signed. We had a storm during our visit and they have the disposable raincoats for sale as well as umbrellas and vast range of tourist products.  Plenty of eateries available as well.  There are live shows which, time your day right,  and the kids will have a ball.  You can make it as long or as short a day as you like. Pack a back pack and enjoy your visit."
My guest from overseas loved the park,I had visitors over from China. This was there first time in Australia so we had finished our business about 12:30 as they had never seen a Koala or Kangaroo before I took them to Lone Pine. Being so close to the City meant I could get them to there afternoon flight. They LIVED the park getting to hold a Koala and pat a kangaroo was the highlight of there Australian trip
Very fascinating and fun,We highly recommend visiting Lone Pine. You can walk among kangaroos and wallabies; hold a koala; view many Australian wildlife. You can easily spend the whole day here.
A life time experience,"We had great time with close encounter with all resident of Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary. Ver well laid out with very friendly, knowledgeable staff."
Cute Koalas & Kangaroos!,A must visit with interstate or especially international friends.  A definite highlight for them.The Koalas are adorable!Although the best was being in a field with kangaroos.  We petted them & hugged them!
Great for kids,"My partner and I took my partner's 5 year old grandson to Lone Pine for the day during school holidays. We drove there and found good parking. It was easy to navigate around the various displays, which showed a good variey of native Australian animals. The lines to hold or have pictures taken with koalas were long, so we did not participate; they may be shorter during school term. We especially enjoyed the raptor flying demonstration, the sheepdog demonstration and the open area with emus and wallabies and kangaroos. Because they are shy/nocturnal, there were a number of animals we could not see well: Tasmanian devils, wombats and dingoes. The cafe served good, cafe-style food quite quickly.Overall it was a very enjoyable day for both 5 and 60 year olds."
Great photos with the Koala's,Took our 2yearold granddaughter to this Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary and although it was raining we had a fantastic timeseeing all the Koalas
Never seen so many koala’s,"It was like a dream becoming reality. So many koala’s in one place is unbelievably for Europeans like us. The animals are very well taken care of and it was one of the best koala experiences in Queensland, in our opinion. The koala photo experience was also very enjoyable. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The other animals (kangeroo’s, wallaby’s, tropical birds etc) were also very nice to see from closeby."
Touch the Kangaroos :),"Nice place to touch the Koala and Kangaroos.We love the Koala`s they are so sweet. Pet the Kangaroos and seelots of other animals who life in the wild.Go, see amazing birds and the show with the eagels its great!!"
Excellent for young children and close to Brisbane City,Koalas kangaroos and Australian animals including snakes within 7 - 8 KMs from Brisbane City. The bird and sheep dog shows are great and prices quite reasonable. Excellent for very young and older children. Plenty of rest rooms and great cafe to boot. There are a fair few local birds too. Through not as large as Currumbin Sanctuary and Australia Zoo it is a great day out with kids
Great fun but super hot and humid!,"I went with Mirimar cruises and it was such a great experience. I highly recommend going on the boat tour to Lone Pine. The sights are amazing and breeze was great.  Mind you that the line to get a picture with Koalas can be quite long. Also, make sure you get the right link to your photo. I got the wrong one twice and wasted lots of time getting a digital copy of my picture. All in all, it was lots of fun and it is certainly a place not to be missed!"
Absolutely Amazing ,Lone Pine is amazing. You get to cuddle a koala and feed kangaroos. But I recommend feeding the goats in the barn area as well (they are always hungry)They have improved the sanctuary with new signs and upgraded many of the enclosures and they were building new stuff as we were there as well. Such a happy place to visit.
Fun and educational for kids and those new to Australian animals,"If you are tight on time and want to see a good selection of unique Australian animals, including marsupials, birds, reptiles and monotremes in the one overall location with not too much difficulty and fuss, then Lone Pine is a possible answer. Easy enough to drive to with plenty of parking, or take a public bus. The raptor and sheep dog shows are also well done. So it is much more than just koalas but there are plenty of them up close too and you can stand in line for a photo if you are of a mind."
Koala holding,We had a great morning there. The price of $100.00  to enter plus$100. for photos with holding a Koala. Got to see other animals we don't see in NZ. Cost about $36.00 for taxi one way.Money wise for 4 people it was worth it.
Fantastic ,"A great place to bring visitors. They can feed the kangaroos, hold a koala, watch a birds of prey show, and have a great outdoor Australian experience. Love this place."
japanese visitor,"We went early morning when the animals were active before the heat of the day makes the animals drowsy.It was lovely to see the kangaroos roaming about & you can feed them if you wish, it was a great experience and my guest loved the Koalas"
a great family day out,this was our first trip to Lone Pine with our 2yo granddaughter it it was a great day with plenty to keep young and old occupiedmake sure your there for the morning bird feed followed by the birds of prey and farm yard nurserythen take your time to walk the rest of the sanctuary and enjoy a late lunch before you leave
3Hour Sanctuary Highlights Tour,"Knowing that I may not make it back to Australia, I decided to purchase a behind the scenes Sanctuary Highlights tour for the 4 people in our group, 2 of which live in Brisbane. We all enjoyed it and highly recommend as it is well worth the extra money. It includes admission, photos holding a koala (which are not always available to regular visitors and are an additional fee), behind the scenes tour and feeding the various animals, and front row seats to the Raptor Show. Also it included food to hand feed the kangaroos and emus who are very tame and in a huge enclosure with plenty of room to roam around. The koalas are their specialty but there are many other native Australians there such as Tasmanian devils, wombats, flying foxes (a large fruit bat), dingo, platypuses and My favorite Cassowary bird.But you can never get enough Koala cuteness!!!Our guide Kayla was extremely informative and knew all the answers to our numerous questions. And they really look out for the animals’ welfare which is one reason getting a photo holding a koala is not always available. Only koalas that tolerate being touched by humans qualify and only a limited time per day. Lone Pine Sanctuary is a must see if you’re in or near Brisbane Australia!"
Great day out,"We took the grandchildren for a day out. Easy to manage a pram though it was difficult to see many of the animals from it. Great range of Australian animals to see.  Youngest loved to feed and touch the free range kangaroos. They enjoyed the bird show as well as the sheep dog.  Take your own picnic as plenty of places to eat. Cafe has limited choices but provides large seating area. Buy tickets online outside the entrance. Good value. Access by car, council bus or the river from the city centre."
Excellent ,Visited the sanctity to see some Australian wildlife and it exceeded our expectations. It’s not a huge place and can be done in 1/2 day trip.Staff are friendly and informative.Koalas and kangaroo are plentiful.
Lovely place ,We love this place. Lots of koalas and kangaroos that you can get up close to. The place has a relaxed vibe that makes you feel at ease.
Wow!,We loved our visit at the sanctuary!We saw plenty of koala and even got to pet the kangaroos. Good variety of animal!Worth the drive
Simply the best,This place is simply the best.  We’ve never seen so many well cared for koalas and other animals in one place.  All animals are healthy and active.  Recommend this place for a day trip.
Much More than Just Koalas,"To get there I used the package with MirimarII 1000 am sailing upriver from Brisbane on a 75 minute voyage  passing wonderful riverbank houses to the Sanctuary,They provide a great commentary on everything you see on this cruise.When you get off the boat at the Sanctuary Pier be aware there is  quite a steep climb from the river up to the main entrance.Once inside the Sanctuary there is FREE WiFi throughout and everything is clearly signposted.Koalas tend to sleep 20 out of 24 hours each day so don't expect much movement from them. You do have the opportunity to cuddle a Koala around noon but there tends to be a long line of people who want to do this.The sanctuary is MUCH more than koalas . You have the chance to get up close to kangaroos and emus AND hand feed them. There is a great variety of Australian Wildlife from Wombats to Tasmanian Devils, Duck-Billed Platypus to a couple of fresh water crocks. It is well worth a full day at the Sanctuary.  If you chose the river cruise option the return journey is a 2.15pm  - that would have given you 3 hours in the park.  If you chose to return to Brisbane earlier or later there is a regular bus service every 15 mins or so to the city and it takes around 30 mins - cost approx $6 one way for the bus."
Nice little plae,Visited lone pine with a friend. Reasonably priced. Had a nice walk around. Everything we’ll sign posted. Great place for a photo with Koalas and Kangaroos for the general tourist! Think the photo with koalas was around $25.
Great Park,"Liked this park. And if you haven’t seen koalas before, then you are in for a special treat. They also cute kangaroos. Not ,any, but we found them and hand fed them. Cute."
Sanctuary Highlights Tour a real treat!,"Our family took the Sanctuary Highlights Tour in September, and it was one of the highlights of our whole Australia trip.  Megan was a wonderful guide, knowledgable and always hustling ahead to smooth out every step or our adventure.  We all have fabulous professional pictures of us with koalas, raptors, and snakes, as well as tons of our own.  There are so many interesting birds and animals, and three hours was just the right time.  We took the Mirimar cruise boat there, and taxied home.  Great experience, highly recommended.  Also, check out the live koala cam on their website whenever you need a mood boost!"
Morning visit ,"Took a bus from the city, only 30 minutes.Well worth the visit, even for a middle aged couple!!. Great to get up close to an array of indigenous Australian animals.Informative and fun day. The only draw back were the ques to have pics taken with the Koalas were lengthy."
Second time visit,"Our first visit was nearly 10 years ago.So we wanted to go again, we are glad we did.Lots to see and do, take in the 'bird show' and the 'shep dog show'.Relax at the food area.Overall a very enjoyable few hours spent here."
Must see,"Beautiful sanctuary for the animals. Lots of photo opportunities for those who haven't seen any koalas, kangaroos and dingos."
Worth the money!,"Although it is pricy to get in, with additional prices once inside to hold koalas, the experience was definitely worth it. Staff were very nice and friendly and seems like they treat their animals well and care about their well being as well as customer enjoyment. You can spend an easy 2-3 hours here"
"Great, but could be improved","Still a great visit, but not easy with an elderly woman. The kids had a great time but if it were a bit more interactive we would have enjoyed it more. Personally I loved it but the kids weren't as interested as I had hoped."
For Animal Lovers,"This is not a zoo; it is a sanctuary for Australian animals that cannot be taken back to the wild. Lots of animals including foxbats, wombats, platipus and yes, koalas and kangaroos. Wîorth going again and again."
Great for family trip!,Had a great time visiting Lone Pine with my family and especially my auntie has never seen koala & kangaroo so that was a great day!
Best family outing in Brisbane,Masses of space for children to run around freely amongst animals and not be aware they are in the middle of the city Marvellous venue for overseas guests to appreciate and be up close and personal with Australian wildlife Ideal for families as it is easy to bring your own picnic
Animals were great to see and seemed well cared for.,We spent a couple of hours here today and it was a lot of fun. The sanctuary was set up well and had lots of seating areas. There seemed to be a lot of things for kids to do and good interactive areas. I liked watching the raptor birds of prey demostration. I will be coming back with my children.
Well organised and safe for animals,"We went to Lone Pine with a free bus from our hostel, Bunk. It was a small group and a nice way to meet peaople too. The animals are well looked after and they offer Koala photos for a price. These should be included in the price i think. Overall we loved our day at Lone PIne!"
Best Zoo I've ever been to!,"This was BY FAR the best zoo I have ever been to.  The animals are super active and the way they have set it up allows you to see everything very well.  There are no screens or windows blocking the koalas, so you feel like you are actually with them versus it being a cage.  The Koalas were very alert and they had so many babies, it was wonderful!  The Kangaroos are was fantastic and it was wonderful to be able to pet them and feed them.  The birds were also really neat, especially the daily keeper talks, animal feedings and shows.  The platypus was swimming so fast that I couldn't even take a picture!We pre-booked the koala hold, as we didn't want to risk not having the opportunity to hold them the day of.  We were in off season so we could have lined up and got a hold in.  Note that they only take credit card for the holds - no cash.  There is a small shop for food, which was good enough but don't expect a lot of options (or cheap pricing).  You can bring your own food for lunch/snacks if you want.    I didn't find a want filling station anywhere.  The bathrooms were clean and well kept.  We spent the entire day there which allowed us time to do all the shows and take in the animals.  It is small compared to most zoos so you could do it in a couple hours if you wanted to.  It was also very accessible for strollers and wheelchairs.Overall I would highly recommend going to this sanctuary.  If I lived closer I would have definitely bought an annual pass!"
Good day out,"Adult or child it doesn't matter, it's a really enjoyable day. Established in 1927 it is the world's first koala sanctuary. Easy to walk around, cuddle a koala have your photo taken (this is very popular so you may have to wait a while), pat and feed the many kangaroos or perhaps an emu, spot the platypus, look over the walls at the lizards, wander through the barn - plenty to do for everyone. A cafe to grab something to eat or drink look at the photos of the many celebrities who have visited, a souvenir shop as you would expect. Easy to get to if you don't have a car - public transport or even the ferry."
Loved it. ,"This is a great place to spend about 3 hours unless you have kids with you. Definitely a must to take a picture hugging the Koala. Also if you can rather take the Ferry going it would be great, thoroughly enjoy the commentary along the way. This is a definite must see when going to Brisbane"
Check out the friendly water dragons,"Lots of sleepy koalas and very greedy kangaroosThis is a great place to bring overseas visitors for d closeup with some of Australia’s iconic wildlifeHand feed an emu or a kangaroo, have your photograph taken with a koala"
Lone pine kola visit,Lovely to see Kolas they were looked very content & had an opportunity to get up close to kangaroos also
Good day out,"Super day out. We had not seen any koalas on our trip, so this was very exciting to visit and we enjoyed our visit very much. The boat ride was also very easy from the cbd...well southbank area. Payment was also very easy."
2019,Took the lonely pines boat tour up to the sanctuary. The boat takes about 90 minutes each way and the commentary on the way to the sanctuary gives a great account of Brisbane’s history and is very interesting. Once at the sanctuary there was plenty of animals to see. The chance to cuddle a koala and feed some of the animals.  The animals on display look very well looked after and there were clear improvement works on going. Activity prices on site were reasonable and the gift shop was good also. Would definitely return to visit on my next trip to Brisbane.
Educational outing with small children,Lone Pine is a good outdoor event that is educational and entertaining. Small and older children can enjoy seeing and interacting with some of our native and domestic animals.  Every time we visit we learn something new. Good areas to buy a meal or bring your own picnic lunch too. It is a little expensive but seen as a treat or annual pass brings value.
Nice couple of hours,"Travelled here by bus from bus station which costs around $11 each way for 2 people, it’s takes about 45 minutes. We spent a nice couple of hours here. Very calm and enjoyable. The koalas are beautiful and well cared for. The children that were visiting we’re all very well behaved and it was lovely seeing them enjoy themselves."
Lovely,The kids had a great time there and we enjoyed it too. They really do a great service to these animals. Lovely place
Very enjoyable day out,"I went on this trip with Miramar Cruises and had a package deal of boat + entry to the park. The cruise to and from the park was as enjoyable as the sanctuary itself and really added to my knowledge about Brisbane.Many people are keen to get a photo of them holding a Koala - but be warned, this is an additional $25 on top of the entry fee - even if you don't want a photo taken.  There are SO many Koala's there to look at, including some with joey's which were really lovely to see.I also really enjoyed seeing a Tasmanian Devil as I'd never seen one before, and getting close to the Kangaroos / Wallabies and emus.  (I'd been on a road trip in Western Australia and only saw one Kangaroo from a distance, so would have felt cheated not to have seen more than that!).There is a coffee / snack shop, also toilets and a WiFi hotspot and charging station which was overlooking the kangaroo park, which I thought was great given how much we all rely on the camera's on our phones.All in all a really enjoyable day - I was there in Australian winter - I imagine in summer it could get quite busy and would be much hotter - I'm glad I saw it at a low peak time."
Fun day,Its main thing is the koalas. But there is plenty to see about Australian animals. Having 2 young kids they both enjoyed the day loved it all. You can pay and feed kangaroos and emus. They have a kiosk for food. You can bring your own if needed. A fun day out.
Australian mammal at the best sanctuary ,Came here in a Monday and it does feel like a popular place with many groups of school children and tourist alike. The animals seem well take care. The Roos are not all hungry for food especially those alone by themselves so we went to find those Roos in big groups . Easily covered entire place in 2 hours. Ample parking.
Leisurely trip to the Sanctuary,"We traveled on the Mirramar II, up the Brisbane river, to the sanctuary. We listened to the informative narrative on the way and had a nice coffee and fresh scones for morning tea, as we critiqued the style and design of the mansions along the river! The boat was comfortable and the prices were very reasonable. A bit disappointed that we missed  a couple of the shows at the park, due to the arrival time of the boat.Was great to see the koalas up close at the undercovered area and the staff were very knowledgeable about the koalas habits etc. Didn't bother with a photo. The queue was enormous. The kangaroos and emus were very approachable and there is a nice range of other animals and birds to see."
Amazing day!!,"We took the Mirimar Koala Express cruise boat to the koala sanctuary which took about 40 min from south Brisbane. The cost included return boat fare and entrance into the park. We easily booked online. Soooo many koala bears you won’t be disappointed with the opportunity to watch and enjoy these beautiful bears.  I didn’t have to wait longer than a few minutes to hold a bear and have photos taken. Wonderful to watch them eat, sleep and hop around the trees. Absolutely loved the kangaroo park.  So many happy Roos to watch, pet, and feed. You can purchase kangaroo snacks and enjoy feeding these beautiful animals. We also enjoyed seeing other animals native to Australia. Gorgeous birds, fun reptiles and we really had a ball watching the platypus swim in his pond. Several bathrooms on site as well as a coffee/cafe/snack bar where you can get a beverage or little nibble. We had a grand time."
" A place to get in touch with Koalas, Emus kangaroos","This is a privately owned little zoo a 40 min bus ride away from the CBD. A lot of groups are brought to the sanctuary. Nice to take your kids, but although interesting for adults. The main attraction are the koalas. They have their special places with tree stumps decorated with eucalyptus branches to sit on, feed and sleep. If you wait patiently in line for perhaps 1 hour you mayhave your photo taken kuddling a koala(25$). There is an open range where kangaroos and emus walk or lay around. Little bags with special food are sold in the general store. Alas some visitors do not respect the animals. The kangaroos are very sweet and patient. When they want to get away from the many visitors they retreat into a fenced in area which is off-limit to human visitors. There is a small reptile house. One can observe sheep dogs working a small herd of sheep(very interesting)"
Great showplace of Aussie animals and birds,"My husband and I took our American friend who was visiting Brisbane for the weekend.  The visit to the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary was a wonderful place to show off a wide variety of Australian animals and birds, with the opportunity to feed and pet some of them.  We also attended the Raptor Show and Sheep Dog trial. We all thoroughly enjoyed the day."
Fun for Adults as well as Children,"As an American I would call this a zoo, but from the name I expected mostly koalas, but it’s much more.  So many unique animals to Australia that we don’t see in the US.  We didn’t get a picture with a koala, but that seemed pretty popular.  The koalas were very close in their enclosures.  It was amazing to walk among the kangaroos and wallabies.  You can buy food to feed them like many children were.  It was amazing to see platypus, Tasmanian devils, dingoes,  kookaburras, to name a few.  This was probably top on my list of things to see around Brisbane."
Great way to experience Australian wildlife,"On our first full day in Australia, our visit here gave us a great introduction and appreciation for the animals of Australia, which are very different than those native to the US. Have been to many zoos, but had never seen a cassowary, wombat, platypus, or Tasmanian devil (among other unique animals) until visiting here. It was clean, easy to find our way around, and we were able to see it all in a few hours. Glad we went!"
Lots of koalas!,"The park was just the right size, not too big and not too small. Better to go there when it's just opened in the morning to avoid large crowds and long queues to take pics with the koala."
Its great !,You can go to this place and experince about the wild life in Australia. You can feed Kangaroos and even hold a Koala in your hands - Entry ticket of 40$.
Kuddly Koalas,What an amazing place. My first trip to Australia and I got to cuddle a koala. The staff were friendly and explained all about their animals. The whole park was interesting.
Great for visitors and locals,"Had a friend visit from overseas so this was one of the sites we decided to go to as they have a variety of animals to see. We arrived about 30 mins before the 11-11.30AM FREE 'Meet a Koala' activity so went over and lined up. Here you can get up close but NOT hold the Koala. You can take pics and gently touch it. This was a great alternative to the other activity where you can pay to hold the animal and get photos. Good for a budget. I like that Lone Pine gives that option. Get there early to line up as the line got quite long very quickly and there is only 30 mins for this to run.Liked seeing the other native animals like wombats, platypus and dingo. Lots of shade but bring a hat and sunscreen anyway. I grew up west of Brisbane and don't remember going here before. It took me a while but i'm glad i did. Will definitely bring other visitors in the future."
Relaxing environment,"We took a cruise down the Brisbane river and arrived at the jetty to the sanctuary. There were several steep steps to the entrance but were warmly greeted by one of the staff members. We were given a map and advised of the talk times if we were interested. We bought some Kangaroo feed from the shop and wandered into the area where you could feed them. We then watched the bird show, which was vey interactive. Afterwards we went to see the Koalas, the smell of eucalyptus was wonderful. We enjoyed watching them but didn’t choose to queue to pay to hold one. After spending a very pleasant three hours we boarded our cruise back to the city"
Great day out with kids,"We were pleasantly surprised by Lone Pine. After reading a lot on the forums between Australia Zoo, Currumbin and Lone Pine we thought it best and easiest to go here from our hotel in Brisbane to be able to see some of the Australian wildlife. We took an Uber there and it was very easy ($25 each way). Our kids loved the interaction with the koala and also seeing so many of them of all sizes and ages. Their favorite part was feeding the kangaroos. We spent about 3 hours there (had only planned an hour or so). The place is very well kept and the staff is really nice and helpful. There is enough to spend half a day there depending on how old your kids are, I would highly recommend it."
Excellent Visit,A great way to get up close with marsupials on Brisbane and a good use of half a day (we could have spent longer).  Lots of koalas with many awake and both wallabies and roos in an open enclosure.  Unusually for these sort of be venues food and drink was reasonably priced. Busy on a late August Saturday.
Great day ,"We found lone pine to be an amazing day out. We took the bus from Queen street, the cheapest way to get there. A great value day out with a family ticket costing $88. You can get up close with the koalas and the kangaroos in fact with most of the animals during the day. Our teenage kids had great day holding the koalas feeding the kangaroos."
Great place for both children and adults,Our family visited this sanctuary and we were so glad that we did. We purchased a day pass and we were able to attend various demonstrations and shows involving herding dogs and birds of prey. The sanctuary is easy to navigate although there are areas with steps. The high point of our visit was the actual holding of a koala bear. There was an extra charge for this activity but we thought it well worth it. The sanctuary had a very friendly and helpful staff. It is well worth a visit!
Worth the trip if on the go,"Tickets:   Can be purchase online, at the counter, or via kiosk.  Really simple and accepts Visa/MasterCard. Price:  The price is a little expensive when compared to other zoos in the Pacific; however, it’s not unreasonable.   Entertainment:  I really enjoyed the sanctuary.  It’s peaceful and I was even able to hold a koala.   Yes, it’s $25 extra, but worth the memory.  Food:  Did not try any.  Access:  The Sanctuary is easy to travel to via bus, taxi, or ride share."
Worth making a trip specifically for the sanctuary,"My trip to Brisbane was kind of spontaneous and unplanned, just so I could visit this Sanctuary. It was absolutely worth it! For those of you buying bus tickets to get to the sanctuary on your own, you can pay cash on the bus. Don't make the mistake I did of trying to buy round trip fair via machine, as the tickets have a time limit..."
Bizarre system for Koala Hug activity,"After buying a day pass you are expected to cough up more money if you want to hug a koala. However, if you wish to do this you may as well throw your ticket in the bin as you won't get to do any of the other activities in the sanctuary.This is because you cannot book a time slot and the staff are very vague about when each session takes place. You have to queue for in excess of an hour to try and get tickets and you are not guaranteed to get any, in which case you have to do it all over again.When I asked why it wasn't possible to book for a later session I was told that customers would wander off and forget their timeslot. What a load of rubbish.So here I am telling your prospective customers how poor that policy is."
Same as the rest.,"Same as the other Koala parks that are all up the coast. Only this one was more expensive than the rest..You can see the Koala, pet Kangaroos and all sorts of other Aussie animals.For $20 get a photo with a whole range of animals. There are better parks with less crowds and cost as well less."
Day Trip,"I went here quite a while ago, the trip was amazing. The bushwalks were nice and relaxing. I would go there again. The trip was a great day."
Great place to visits some Roo's and Koala's,Very nice place to visit to see Koala's and Kangaroos.  There is a long wait to have your picture taken with the Koalas so plan accordingly.  Very cool demonstration of herding dogs working sheep.  Don't miss it.
