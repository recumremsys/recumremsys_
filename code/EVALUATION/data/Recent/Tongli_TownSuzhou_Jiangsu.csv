"Over hype, Touristy","Took the metro train here and then took a 10 min ride on a  tricycle bike to Tongli from the station. The driver just dropped us near the town and not at the entrance and we had to walk and asked for directions to reach the entrance. Actually, there was a cheap bus service from the station to Tongli which we took when we had to return to the station.  You had to pay an entrance fee to enter this town, more like a village. Not so cheap. Crowded with tourists. Very commercial old town and not so authentic. We had the feeling it was all geared for the tourist. Found a better old water town in Shanghai which was more laid back and entrance was free."
F A B U L O U S!!! ,must see visually in order to appreciate the fascinating breath taking views there is; It was indeed a once in a lifetime opportunity that I am greatly honoured to experienced such great journey
Wonderful stroll for a day or two in Tongli,"Tongli Gu Zhen is a scenic and nice place to hang out. We stayed the night in one of the old buildings which is modified to become an inn. The host are pleasant. me and wife had a night stroll and it's safe. Our travel date is 4th-5th Jan and its winter time. Some of the lighting may not be fully turned on as the locals call it the ""low peak"" period. However the main light attractions at night are still very delightful to watch. woke up in the 2nd morning and the breakfast shops are awesome. There are variety of food to choose from even for lunch. The buildings are nicely designed. Definitely worth the time there!"
Good for a day out ,"Tongli is a nice place to spend a day, you can just wonder along the canals, have some beers, browse the local merchants and have some nice food. Summer is definitely better than winter."
"Worth the trip, do a boat cruise",We loved our day here.  We had a leisurely trip down the river on a boat and walked around the town.  We enjoyed our local food and there were lots of great photo opportunities.  We didn't bother paying extra to see the fisherman use the birds to catch fish but this is available should you wish to.
Scenic place,Nice scenic place to visit. Would have been better if no rain and good weather. Entrance fee is RMB88 inclusive of shuttle from Tongli Subway terminal
Difficult to find from bus station,We had some difficulty finding the water town. We purchased entrance tickets from the ticket office at the bus station but the directions we were given there were worse than useless. Fortunately a helpful local person took pity on us and helped us get to the water town area.
Picturesque Place,"The hotel concierge recommended to visit Tongli which does not disappoint.It's less crowded and commercialized relatively as compared to the more well known Zhou Zhuang.  It's accessible by subway and Didi cars.I found it to be easily navigated within small town (thanks to the abundant signage and maps).  Nice to see the canals and the bridges.  There are a few nice gardens hidden throughout the town too.It's a nice place to hang around for few hours, taking photos and have a cup of coffee by the canal."
Nice walk with lots of interesting places for photos ,Visited Tongli in the low season and glad I was able to walk around without being afraid of being pushed into the waters.The waters here are much cleaner than the one I saw in Wuzhen but that was more lively. Perhaps due to the low season.Tongli is great with many different and artistic alleys for photos; or even just a leisure walk around.Many restaurants place their dining tables along the banks and some are really territorial - you can’t stand there to take pictures without paying to sit there. So just cautious. It’s a good relaxing feeling to sit and have your meals by the banks too.
Quite commercialised these days,"Getting there from Suzhou is quite easy because of the subway system; there will be four lines although line 3 is still not operational at time of writing. Probably the most useful is line 4 which runs through Gusu (old Suzhou) from the railway station in the North to Panmen in the South, and beyond. Take line 4 southwards to Tongli, the terminal station. Cost is 6 RMB. Take exit 2, following the signs (albeit in Chinese) to the bus to the Tongli old town. Anyway, up the escalator of exit 2 go along the sheltered corridor for about 20 m to the bus stop for bus #725; the place looks like a car park. The fare (no change is given) is 1 RMB, and it is about 4 stops to the old town. Frequency is 5-15 min. Entrance to the old town is across the road, at the junction just before the bus stop (right turn in heading towards the junction). Entrance fee is 100 RMB.The old town is now very commercialised and totally unlike what it was like in our last visit more than a decade back. Still, it makes a decent walk, especially the Tuisi garden. With a 1000 years' history, i guess one must at least visit it. There is also a stage at the central square where opera performances are given at specific times."
Parts are very picturesque,"I can't comment on ease of access or costs, as this was visited as part of a group tour, but It is a beautiful little town and worth the visit.  When we were there it was not particularly crowded.  It's a nice town to simply wander, and there were interesting shops selling quite unusual souvenirs (eg. cut-paper decorations).Tuisi Garden was also interesting and beautiful, although the house and garden is not nearly as old as the gardens of Suzhou.This to me was more interesting, better preserved and more beautiful than the canal area of nearby Suzhou."
A cultural heritage,"One can feel and see Ancient China here. It will make one appreciate how people lived here before and even up to now. Though it’s quite far from the Suzhuo main train station but it’s worth the visit. Went  here for a good one day visit  but I guess to explore it deeper one have to stay 2days or so.And the lunch we had in a shop tended by older people was real gool. And just incase you are travelling from Shanghai and need to be back on the same day,  better buy your bullet train tickets two way in advance. Enjoy and be captivated by this scenic and culture rich  water town."
delicious,"Delicious old ancient chinese town,you can feel like Marco Polo reaching China.The town is crossed by canals that give to the town an aspect of far east Venice."
Visit ancient China,Take a boat ride down the ancient canals to see the real old China.  This beautiful village is very crowded and be alert to motorcycles that share the walkways.
Interesting Town,This is worth a visit even though its rather touristy. Lots of canals and people still living within the town.  Easy to get to from Suzhou.  Take the metro to the end of the line at Tongli.  Then the 725 bus for 1 RMB to the town about 20 minutes.
"Contrived, touristy place","A “watertown” close to Suzhou.  It was a pleasant enough place with canals filled with dirty water and plenty of stone bridges.  Somehow it felt contrived and too touristy.  We visited a 19th century merchant’s  house and garden.  It was notable only for its size and certainly not for any attractiveness or comfort.We had a boat ride on the restaurant-lined canals and I was appalled to see a restaurant worker fill a pail with the fetid canal water and take it back into the restaurant.  Its purpose was unknown, but whatever it was would have been unacceptable."
Interesting town,"Great place to visit. People still living like they did many years ago, it’s very touristy though but worth a visit."
Beautiful!,"A subway ride from Suzhou centre, Tongli is a heritage site with some beautiful hidden spaces offering tranquility and space to think! Also a range of food options and bars on the periphery.The ‘Venice of the East’ is well worth a visit and if travelling independently, be sure to pick up entry tickets and the shuttle bus from Tongli subway station."
Walk through town,A simple but elegant stroll through the barrow laneways and street of the nice city. With a little experience of the old China.
Wonderful spot,"We went here with our guide for a few hours.  Its less touristy than the ""other"" water town and was very nice.  Some shops and restaurants along the canals, but some great old houses that you can tour with your ticket that show the daily life.  Some incredible tucked away gardens as well.  Take a boat ride to get a real feel for the area."
Take me to Tongli!,"This wonderful water town is a bit outside of Suzhou, but worth the 25 minute ride to it's traditional streets. Chinese opera is performed live in the square. The colorful costumes and beautiful setting make for lovely memories. Around the corner from the square is the entrance to a beautiful Garden. A must do in Tongli, this garden is small but delightfully picturesque. One other must see are The Water boats that traverse the ""streets"". A great way to see Tongli while you float under lovely trees and bridges (some of which are named for Luck and Health). There is a meat dish served in Tongli called ""Pork Shank for the Number One Scholar"". It was one of the Best things I have ever eaten.  Seriously not to be missed.  Pearls sellers line the streets but I thought the best buy were the embroidered shoes.  Very comfortable and absolutely beautiful designs, you can find many sellers of these comfy, pretty, shoes. Just keep an out for the prices so you wont be disappointed to see the same shoes for a few dollars less after you round the corner."
Afternoon trip to Tongli ,"One of the best water towns surrounding Suzhou. Plenty to do, we did pottery marking and had a lovely boat trip."
Hidden gem.,"Great place to experience a bit of traditional China. A restored 'village' still inhabited by locals who go about their daily life whilst others make a living from the tourists who want to take a traditional.boat along the canals or eat locally produced food. Plenty of canal side eating and drinking places with the place being prettily lut up at night.Small shops selling crafts and typical Chinese artefacts are also there in plenty. Old walled gardens within the village are peaceful havens as is the building and its gardens, once a girls school.Theatre productions within the village are also availble frequently.Really lovely place for an overnight stop."
same concept with Pinjiang road....,"This town Located 18 km from Suzhou City, the concept is same like Pinjiang road.to many restaurant , so i think Pinjiang road more comfortable to visit"
Cute Water Town close to Shanghai,"Tongli is a cute water town that can be visited as a half day trip from Shanghai. There are several ways to get here from Shanghai - bus, train and metro, or as part of a tour group. We went by ourselves and caught a fast train out from the main Shanghai train station to Suzou. From Suzou train station we caught the metro for about 24 stops (!) to Tongli. At the Tongli metro station we purchased our water town tickets from the tourist service centre (RMB88 - this is cheaper than buying at the water town entrance) which included a free tourist bus (a 10 minute journey) to the water town carpark. It was a 5 minute walk from the car park to the old town's north entrance at Yongan Bridge. Considering we started our day with a metro ride to the train station in Shanghai, it's quite a journey to reach Tongli and we spent about 3 hours getting there!On the way back we caught an express bus from Tongli bus station (a 20 minute walk from the water town) to the main Shanghai bus station. This was cheaper and faster, taking around 2 hours through stop-start traffic in Shanghai.  Entrance to the old town requires a ticket (RMB100 if bought at the entrance) which covers entrance to eight buildings and gardens. If you're visiting in August it's very hot so either pace yourself to cover these sites or pick a few of them. We visited Gengle Hall, Pearl Tower, Taihu Water Conservancy Pavilion, Chongben Hall and Tuisi Garden. Pearl Tower and Gengle Hall were my favourites, and Tuisi Gardens were also nice.  The tree-lined canals were beautiful. There is an impressive number of clean, well maintained toilets throughout the town and lots of restaurants and stores."
One of the 3 Water Towns surrounding Suzhou - Must visit,"This one is closest from Suzou city center to visit comparing to the other 2.  The subway line ends here from Suzhou downtown so it's nice!  Caution, there is a fee to enter for tourist.  Reserve about 2~4 hours here, depending on what you like to see, taking photos and dine here or not.  Lots of interesting to see.  The ticket also allows you to visit several ""museum, old mansion, etc.""  It's worth it!  I would have uploaded the photos but in this review section, it does not allow me too.  IThere is an option but need to start all over."
Nothing special,Another watertown(which are nice!) but if you have seen one you have seen them all.Nice restaurants located along the water and easy to walk around with enough bridges to cross to the other side
Street Scenes and Artisans,"You can really get a ""feel"" of this water town as you walk in and stroll the streets with crafts to witness from clothes, indigo dyed fabric (well, that is what I was interested in), ceramics and on to architecture and people.  There is a charm and intimacy as one sees daily living in what is also a well served tourist town."
Worth the trip,"Spent a long time researching the different ‘water towns’ and I’m certain I made the right choice. Took a bullet train from Shanghai to Suzhou which in itself was an amazing experience. Walked straight to the metro and took the 45 minute journey to Tongli station. We were blessed enough to be approached by a local who had lived in Australia and recommend we take a taxi (only 20RMB) as it’s quicker and easier.The town itself is easy to navigate and had many gardens and museums to discover. Highly recommend the retreat & Reflection Garden, The Pearl Tower and Gengle Hall. While you’re there make sure to try the famous Taiwanese bubble tea chain ‘The Alley’ which randomly had a store here.Due to a translation confusion with the taxi driver on the way back, he ended up taking us all the way to the Suzhou train station which ended up only being 180RMB (blessing in disguise to skip the 45 min subway back after walking) Visited on a week day to avoid the crowds and it was well worth it."
Very interesting Venice of China Visit,"Tongli is (akin to Venice)  like an open-air museum. In most museums, the writing is Chinese only, but already strolling around is quite a treat."
Venice of China,"Suzhou is famous for its water town, and tongli water town is one of it. It is very convenient as it can be accessed via metro line 4, Tongli station, just 45mins ride from Suzhou station. Just at the exit of the station, you may take city bus to the site, very convenient. If you would like to try local food, you must try there as they are very different compare to city like shanghai. Entrance fee is RMB100."
Nice town but be careful with your money,"I took metro line 4 until Tongli (for me 7 yuan and around 50 min from Beseita). In Tongli metro station I went in direction of exit 2. Just before is a tourist desk; You can get your ticket there for 88 yuan. Person behind the desk does not speak english but gives you a page with explanation in Chinese and English. You go up and then outside you go left (you see an arrow with '725'). I think there are 2 busses, the 725 and a tourist bus (stopping just a little further from the 725, it's only signed in chinese so not clear). I just arrived before the tourist bus was about to leave so I jumped right in (they see your ticket so they know you want the tourist bus). That one is free with your ticket and drops you off in the north parking lot. There are buses back every half hour or so until 17:30. It's not so clear, but just make sure you are there 5 minutes before the half hour, there will be a bus and the driver will know you want to go back to the subway.When I had lunch I had a bit less nice experience: I had a check of 58 yuan, I gave a bill of 50 and 10 yuan, they did not give change and when I asked and insisted they said I gave only 55 (bill of 50 and bill of 5)... I think it's a trick they might try more regularly with foreign tourists, beware! It's not about the 2 yuan, but it's the principle.It's a nice town. With the little map you can find your way, and there is some english in the places you can visit with the ticket (scan everytime at the entrance). On Monday in June it was nice, not too busy. I only saw one other non-asian tourist. Clean (free) toilets around town."
Beautiful old town ,"Compare to chow zhong, I thing tong li is slightly better.  You can find a very organized website to introduce chow zhong , but tongli is less commercial with less tourist group.  You can still enjoy walking around this old town."
Water town reachable by subway from suzhou,"Approx. 1h subway ride & another 10-15m by public bus (no need to take the private one, no added value in it). Entrance ticket is 100Rmb (if bought at spot, next to KFC) or around 80 if you’ll buy online. Decent place which was not too much overcrowded even during public holidays (Dragon boat festival). Take left turn immediately after the ticket check & once you cross the first bridge - to circle the place completely. Place itself is a typical old town with all houses changed into the restaurants & shopping places - but still keeps a bit of atmosphere. If you haven’t visited other water towns - this is a good choice. Count with approx. 3-4h in the place + travel."
A nice ancient town,The ancient town is close to Suzhou.You can take the metro to Tongli. That is quite cheap and convenient.Do not expect the locals can speak English.The town is beautiful and big.Compare to the other ancient towns.There are many hostels coffee shops and local restaurants.I don’t think the western tourists can enjoy the food here due to the lack of nice western meal restaurants.Everything is quite good. But the entry guard was quite impolite and they suspected everyone did not want to buy the ticket.Buy the ticket in advance is a good choice.Tongli is good for a one day tour.
old ancient water town,"I travelled to here solo by taxi and was immediately approached  by a trishaw rider who offer me to take the ride for cny60 , I try his service and amazing he was friendly and very patient taking me to various stops and explain history like a tourist guide, he also waited for me to have my lunch and the journey takes about 2.5 hours riding, highly recommended if you are there which save a lot of walking on uneven roads, the scene of this old town is amazing, well preserved bridges & old houses with people still living there, also lots of eatery and shops"
Interesting but rushed,We went with a tour group and was rushed through the crowds of people. Very crowded  and made the whole experience less than expected. The town was nice and worth seeing but plan on going on a slow day so you can relax and take in all it has to offer.
Beautifull and quiet.,"I'm very happy we went here, it was so quiet and our boat trip was so beautifull. With all the bridges and the reflections on the water!"
A must visit excursion when in Suzhou.  You won't regret it.,"You can easily spend 3-4 hours walking around Tongli Town.  A totally different experience that makes you feel like you're in another time in the past.Take your time to just walk around and take pictures and enjoy the sights.  Have a meal or a drink (tea or otherwise).  Lots of places to eat, snack, drink or shop.The water surrounding it is not just a moat, its actually (I believe) connected canals.Easy to get to.  We took the Metro (I believe Line 4)  from Suzhou.  Tongli is the last stop.  Then exit and take a shuttle, bus or taxi (all with signs).  Bring you passport/ID.  If you're over 60, you can get in for 1/2 price."
Great experience,This is a visit worth making and invites overnight guests which we found out later. Its quite unique and offers another side to life in China. It is a most pleasant place and like a little oasis from a busy city
Beautiful ,"We took the metro number 4 line from our hotel in Suzhou to Tongli which took about 50 min. At Tongli Station, go to number 2 exit and you will find the number 725 bus. It costs 1 yuan to use the bus. There is no English around so it was a little tricky. After 10 minutes, the bus driver told us to get off at the 4th stop when everyone else got off. The entrance is in the middle of the town. It looks like you can take the bus to the end of the line and get off there as well but the entrance is further away from everything. After you get off, go across the street and you will be able to buy your ticket at the tourist information for 100 yuan. The cost of the ticket includes the entrance to the different houses and gardens and you will need to show it at each place so don’t lose it. You can get a map at the tourist information but it’s not completely accurate because it does not show you where the exact entrance to some of the places so we had to wander around a bit. If you want to take a gondola ride, it costs 90 yuan for one boat for a total of 6 people. It was worth it and very relaxing. The lady who managed our boat, asked us if we wanted her to sing. She had a list of songs in Chinese. I think it was 20 yuan for 2 songs. We decided we liked the peace and quiet so we declined. The gondola ride was about 30 min. We didn’t have to wait in line because it was early in the morning. We spent almost 5 hours wandering around the town. We had a nice lunch but we’re disappointed that the bottles of beer that we ordered were not cold. They told us but opened them before we could decline. It looked like there were tickets for the town for sale at the metro exit but we weren’t sure so we didn’t buy them. Apparently there are fake tickets being sold so you should probably just buy them at the ticket office at the town."
So glad we came here,We did this trip ourselves .. Came by metro from Suzhou ... Stay on metro till last stop in Tongli and take a shuttle bus to the old town...( about 15mins ) The tourist information desk in the metro station sold me a ticket but told me to buy my husbands ticket at the town entrance ( he has just turned 60) as it would be half price...good advice!! really enjoyed wandering about the canals and small streets and the entrance ticket lets you go into lots of lovely and interesting gardens and buildings.. However the map we were given was a bit confusing and we ended up exiting in the opposite direction from where we went in ....could have been a disaster as we speak no Chinese.. We didn't manage to find the shuttle bus back but we  did eventually locate the local bus station and for 1 yuan each got back to the metro station.. All ended well! Well worth the effort.. A great place to visit...much quieter and for us more rewarding than the Humble Administrators Garden in Suzhou.
Just okay,"I expected Tongli to be a quaint, little town with classic (if not ancient) Chinese architecture, where the locals just live like they have been for centuries. What I experienced was shops after shops after shops with hordes of tourists. The design was old but it looks made quite recently. There are houses and bridges that look old, but not enough to spend couple of hours from Shanghai to. It's clean though. Locals are nice and restaurants (as expected) are overpriced. I was more excited with the experience of taking the train and bus from Shanghai via Suzhou by myself without any clue of Mandarin."
Nice water town,"Worth a trip from any of the nearby cities of Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Shanghai.The main strips are quite touristy, but take a few turns and then you're in the resident areas. Really neat. I enjoyed seeing the place lit up at night, especially the small bar strip that is to your right when entering through the main gate, and the lanterns along the canals.We got there in the evening and stayed for two nights, one and a half days. Being able to walk around in the morning before the day-tourists come is highly recommended! If you're on a short timeline...I guess you come come for a spin over the afternoon. It's quite a long metro ride from Suzhou, however, and then a short bus ride after (though there is also a little shuttle-train thing during business hours). Could probably see it in an afternoon. More enjoyable if you're not rushing!Tip: if you come after 5pm, entry is free into the tourist area. During the day, you have to pay the entrance fee. However, if you want to see any of the sights or get a tour guide, you still have to pay the entrance fee. So we just didn't wind up getting a tour guide or going into any of the sights.Just like with any place in China, ppl (especially the restaurant owners) will call out to you to stop for a meal. It's not meant to hassle anyone - everyone just needs to hustle to make a living."
Old Canal Town,"Tongli developed around the ancient canals connecting the cities of China.  It is a small enclave bisected by many small canals.  It is both an interesting step back into old China, and an area full of shops and kitsch.  It is more enjoyable if one gets off the streets packed with shops and explores the more residential back streets   One can take a canal boat ride (which we didn't).This was on our tour of Suzhou on the way to Shanghai. It was worth a stop."
Pretty water town...a must visit,"Having visited Zhujiajiao Water Town, I found Tongli to be much more pleasant and intimate. It’s smaller, less busy and less commercial. There are still shops and restaurants but minus the trinkets stuff. We traveled there from Suzhou by taxi. It takes about 30-45mins and costs RMB150. We went just after lunch and spent about 3 hours taking in the sights and having tea by the canal. Pearl Tower Gardens within the Town is worth a visit too."
The old water canal,"If you understand that some of these build water channels are more than 1000 years old you will certainly get feeling  of the flair this little town have. Strol away from the busy part and walk the small path ways of the residential area where many little guest houses are located. Also very good to take a boat ride which you can explore the area from the boat, many locations to take good pictures."
Venice in China 🇨🇳 ,Quite a nice day trip. The water village is a great little bit of heritage. Well looked after. Very pleasant day of walking around and inspecting historic sights. Plenty of little cafes and coffee shops to enjoy.
Very nice water town. ,Tongli Town is a very nice water town with nice restaurants and shops to keep you amused. There are quite a few buildings to visit and it is also a base where movies are made. Overall a very pleasant way to spend a day.
"Amazing, Beautiful","You need to spend a day walking around the Tongli Water Town. It is so peaceful and picturesque. We saw the old governor's home, shopped, ate lunch, took a boat ride. It was all so wonderful. We had a guide, which was so helpful because no one spoke english."
Visiting Tongli Town is very relaxing and....,Visiting Tongli Town is very relaxing and conforting time to see and view the gardens and canals of the ancient Chinese city.
Worth it for a day,Sunday spring visit. Not too crowded. Very much worth the trip. By metro line 4 (over 1 hour) or taxi 30 mins.  Easy to get there. Entrance at South Gate costs 100RMB: Expensive for my taste. The people are exceptionally nice but you can come across a few hustlers as this place is a mega tourist destination. Prices are a little excessive in some places so be observant. Lots of curious restaurants and shopping. Superb gardens and ancient compounds to visit. Take a Chinese style gondola ride. You’ll not regret. Stay away from the illy or hagendas ice-cream stands. Very expensive. Excellent day trip from either Shanghai or Suzhou.
Suzhou and Tongli expedition ,"I went to Suzhou and Tongli on a one day trip booked with China Highligths. Booking online was very easy, and everything organized upon request. My guide was Sophie Lee, speaking very good english, professional and with good knowledge about those places.Humble Administrator Garden is definitly a place to visit for all those appreciating nature and garden architecture. It’s classified by UNESCO, and well preserved.Tongli is a very interesting water village, less commercial and crowded then other water villages near to Shanghai.And lunch organized by Sophie in a local restaurant (YangYang) was quite pleasant, need to try crab soup!All in all an excellent day! Thank you Sophie!"
Small Town China,"Tongli is a village in the Suzhou area.  Easily accessible from Shanghai or Suzhou, it makes a great day trip.  The buildings and waterways have been reconstructed to create a prosperous village as it might have been 100 years ago.  There are homes stores, temples, and other buildings.  There is also to local delicacy, stinky tofu, which smells horrible, butt tastes divine (similar to Limburger cheese).  Local residents are eager, but not pushy.  And it is usually not too crowded."
Excellent Lunar New Year Celebration,"The last two days of Lunar New Year brings fortune gods blessing and lion/dragon dances.  We loved it!  The town is great to walk around, try different foods, see amazing pieces of history and really take in a different view of Chinese culture."
Tongli(同里) Must visit place in China,"After visitng hot spots where Crazily crowded, time to experience very warm and small local town with full of delicious food Never get tired od walking around the town, experience local people's life style, try delicious local food, feeling of warm welcome by town rather than being treated as tourists"
Nice ancient water town but hot in August,"Thanks to reviewers here so we took subway Line 4 to Tongli Station, followed the sign ""to Tongli Ancient Town"" to walk to an exit, saw a counter inside subway station selling ticket for 80 or 88RMB (ticket showed 100RMB) including round trip bus. The lady was so nice. She asked if I wanted to go immediately. I said yes so she called the walkie talkie, quickly walked with us outside the station, made an effort to locate the bus for us. Thank you so much. So we got on the new, clean, air-con (very cool) bus and arrived at Tongli.The place was peaceful for a leisure walk. Heard local people sang a song at restaurant tables and people could tip her if they wish to. We also ate there and price was not expensive compared with eating downtown Suzhou. They had menu with price listed clearly and they were happy to talk to us.In some gates, they had signage saying if walking through it, ticket was considered used and if we wanted to go back inside, we had to buy new ticket. So we knew and continued to walk inside.As it was so hot, we decided to end our visit sooner than planned, found our way back to where the bus stopped. Remember to take the photo of the bus so you can locate your bus. It came every 30 minutes."
Little Venice of China,"This was a very cool boat ride. I am not sure exactly how the paddle works, but it was very cool to take it through the little town. It seems like that was one of the only things to do there. We also had time to walk around and got to watch some ginger /toffee type candy being made. It really looked a lot like toffee, but was more of an ""air"" type candy.Apparently if you are gong to buy pearls this is the place. I looked at some, but really do not need any - so buy passed them.There are lots of neat little shops here and if you have not gotten gifts for those on your list - this would be great place to do so.The boat ride was REALLY neat!"
Must  Visit,"A water town 1-1/2 to 2 hra from Shanghai, a visit is worth your while.  Leave you in awe. Serene,peaceful, ancient, and a diff kind of tour."
Quaint quiet water town,"Unlike its more popular cousins Zhujiajiao and Zhouchuang, Tongli is quieter but just as nice. The picturesque water town is a little further than the rest but is easily accessible by MRT. We took about an hour to reach it from Suzhou.What really struck us about this place are the friendly vendor and service staff at the attractions. Somehow, they us feel so welcome."
Unexpected Charming Town,It is fun to walk around the town and to explore. Plenty of restaurants and shops to visit. A unique experience while touring China.
A historical place,This is a very pretty and quiet place. Travelling on a boat is fantastic.There are many small shops and guset house along the river. It would be a good idea to stay in the guest house of one night.
Skip if not culture/history fan,"Half the shops were closed , maybe because of the season and it’s December. Clean/ unique in its own way. If you are looking for a water town with its much original decor / environment retained with some elements of history and culture this can be a place to consider. (Advises to engage a tour guide if you are interested to know more about history and culture). I prefer Pingjiang Road located in central Suzhou. Feels about the same if you’re not into old artifacts and history of the place. Bumped into a surprisly good and reasonably priced restaurant called 酒坛子饭桶 (surprisly not listed on TripAdvisor) near the entrance of the place. Extremely tasty Suzhou cuisine ! It’s a 5/5 I recommend to drop by if you’re round the corner ."
Beautiful water town in china  ,"Beautiful water town like a Venice of china.. still petty and not so commercialised as compare to Zhou Zhuang. Less crowded compare to other place and enjoy the stroll on the old Ming and Qing style shopping street. You can take a river cruise and can be unique. However, I prefer the Zhou Zhuan better as more scenic and have more waterways! Not so expensive to spend on foods and souvenirs."
Venice of China,Very cool place built along several canals. Lots of shopping and eating places. Wander the alleys for some of the best bargains. Take a boat ride to get a unique perspective. Would be a cool place to stay for a couple of days.
Lovely old and authentic Water Town,"Tongli Water Town, although very 'touristy', still has people living and working next to the canals. You see locals, washing clothes (and some food) in the water, as you pass by on a very reasonably price boat trip around the waterways.A great place to wander around, contemplating that parts of this place, hasn't changed over many years.Photo opportunities at every turn!"
Tongli Water Town,"Shops, restaurants and homes along the canal makes this a nice place to take a stroll. It is a short visit that doesn't require a lot of walking.Our guide, Ocean helped us find a restaurant for lunch."
Very old,Historic old water town. Quite scenic and very old. Charming to watch the boats navigate the canals. Could be a Chinese Venice or Amsterdam. Well worth a visit.
Pretty water town near Suzhao city,"We drove to Tongli water town from Shanghai (about 1hr 30mins) and came with an English speaking guide.  We chose it because it is less crowded, people still live there and it is one of the oldest of the water towns that you can visit in Jiangsu province, close to Shanghai.  We noticed that there were only a small number of foreigners visiting on this day.  It's interesting, pretty and there are lots of little 'niche' museums and workshops to visit.  We stayed for about 2.5 hours including a delicious lunch which our guide ordered for us."
Great to visit,"Tongli is a long way out of Shanghai but well worth the visit. it is another ancient town but so different and is a little ""Venice of the east"" complete with gondolas.There are no vehicles in the old town with the walkways running beside the canals and it all creates a most peaceful scene. Lots of restaurants to cater for lunch on the long trip."
Time travelling into the past,We visited this lovely water town on the way to Suzhou. It makes you feel like a time traveler into the past. The very first restaurant that you see is a hundred years old. You can go up to the upstairs to listen the ancient Chinese musical playing while enjoying your food.
Pretty little town with easy metro access for DIY visit,"After fighting with masses of tourists in China for the past two weeks, I arrived early at Tongli at 10am (left Suzhou around 8:30) and was happy that there wasn’t such a big crowd (end-October). The tourists did arrive but it was still ok. The town is definitely old and quaint but the attractions could do with a coat of paint. Since I’ve been traveling for two weeks, it wasn’t really anything new. This was especially so because I couldn’t understand much and could mostly only appreciate the beautiful architecture. At each attraction, there is an information board explaining the significance of the attraction.If you’re in Suzhou, getting there is easy with the metro. The entrance ticket, if bought at the tourist service costs 88 RMB instead of 100 RMB. This includes free shuttle to and fro. On arrival at Tongli metro, from platform look for exit 10. Once you exit the turnstiles, right in front of you is the Tongli Tourist Service (you’re still underground in the metro station). I bought my ticket there and they gave me a pamphlet in English. The lady didn’t speak English but I said “Tongli men piao” meaning entrance ticket. You will be told where to catch the bus but just in case they’re too busy and you don’t understand, walk to the opposite end of the subway hall to Exit 2 and take the escalator up to the road. There should be a coach there. They depart every half hour. It’s a direct service. The coach drops you off at the North Parking Lot entrance. To get back to the metro, go back to the parking lot and look for the bus with no. 4 (= Subway line 4) displayed on the window and ask. It’ll be parked with many other tourist buses. Departures are every 30 minutes on the hour and at half-past.As for the visit in Tongli, just follow the map.I didn’t have lunch there but there are several western coffee places and a western restaurant was indicated on the map. Otherwise join the locals."
Another lovely water town,Very similar to the other water towns we have visited around Shanghai. Nice for a day out. 100rmb to enter and visit all the attractions. Only thing that put us off were a few idiots who need to look after animals better. There was a very sad pet shop with an idiotic owner who clearly did not know anything about animal welfare.
"Beautiful, interesting place if you have time!","We took a half day trip with a tour guide to this water town outside Shanghai.  I had done some research to choose a water town to visit, and Tongli seemed like it would be less touristy than some of the others.  We went on a Monday, which was great.  The crowds were not bad at all. The boat ride along the canals was very nice, and learning about the water towns in general was interesting.  Yes, the towns cater to tourists, but I think it's worth a trip to see a unique setting and lifestyle.  If very pressured for time in Shanghai, I would skip it.  (we had 3 total days there, so about 2 in the city and one in Tongli)."
Super water town,"While a little touristy, Tongli is easily accessible from Suzhou using the metro. Ignore the tat and people offering to take you on a tour of the town on their bikes. Head out on foot and enjoy exploring. Just be careful not to eat at the restaurants that wash their dishes in the river. It isn't clean. We ate at a lovely vegetarian restaurant near Gengle Hall. The interior is awe inspiring and the noodles were delicious. Tongli has plenty to look at and is a good way to while away half a day."
Delightful little town with a Michelin quality restaurant,"Tongli is a bijou little town, crisscrossed by canals, and a perfect place to escape the hustle and bustle of nearby Shanghai. Step aboard one of the wooden boats and your oarsman will take you through the quiet canals, under the stone bridges and past the cormorant fisherman. The shops have a fine selection of local arts and crafts, and it is fun bargaining with the friendly owners. And for lunch? What better place to eat than at Fennel, a wonderful restaurant serving the most delicious food, presented to Michelin star quality. Visit the town for this restaurant alone..."
Old part of the city,"Old area, with old buildings to visit.  Communist China history.Lots of restaurants, however I question the sanitary level.  Most you sit along what looks like a dirty canal to eat.  I’ll pass.  Tourist oriented.  Odd smells from the food served."
99% touristic,"As strange as it may sound I do not recommend going to Tongli Town instead of spending more time in Suzhou or Shanghai. Although you MUST visit a garden during your stay in China, you will find much better places in Suzhou. Tongli Town was full of similar shops, expensive cafes and restaurants, and all the town had a ""decadent"" ambiance. Please don't get me wrong, it is a nice place to visit but not a place to spend almost a full day. If you are in Suzhou, you can just go to the end of the 4 Metro Line and then a bus will take you to Tongli (and can take you back to the metro at the end of the day)."
A total tourist town,Unfortunately what was once probably a beautiful ancient Canal town has now been converted into a Disney carnival theme park.It is totally full off souvenir shops Iva price restaurants and other tourist venues. We are so disappointed that we came here.The whole town smells of BBQ duck intestines. In hindsight we should have just hired a driver for a day trip to some Canal towns that nobody has ever heard of.
A step back to the past,"Amazing beautiful.  It really is worth 100 rmb.  The place offers a lot of gift shops, restaurants, and snack vendors.  It also offers boat ride for 90 rmb per boat.  The best part is a costumes dress up picture offer by tongli vendors . The picture can be ported digitally to your phone."
Worth the visit,"I will let the photos do the talking. On that note, I would recommend reaching there early in the morning to avoid the crowds, as the tourists, particularly the tour groups, start coming in droves after 12pm. Making a day trip from Shanghai to Tongli is totally doable, as there are frequent high speed and normal trains from Shanghai to Suzhou Railway Station, and from there, you can take the metro (Line 4) all the way to Tongli station (last station). There are clear signs (in Chinese unfortunately) at the Tongli station which directs you to the bus station, from which you can take the No. 725 bus, or the No.4 bus. The No.4 bus is operated by a tour company, which offers a ¥12 discount on the Tongli entrance ticket, so instead of ¥100, you are paying ¥88. You will be given a voucher, which you can then exchange for the ticket at the tourist center once you reach Tongli North Parking Lot. The ticket allows you to enter all the 10 attractions at Tongli. Make the trip, it is worth it!"
What a contrast to Beijing,"It is advertised as the venice of the orient/east.  It's truly pretty.  If you have been to Hoi An in Vietnam, there is some similarity with the water and the proliferation of red lanterns.  After lunch, we meandered around the small shops, obligatory boat ride down the canals, and just sat and watched the world go by.  After the business and pollution of Beijing, I felt that we had stepped back in to a little bit of China of old.  Highly recommend"
Tongli Town,"We took the 6:47 G trains from Shanghai, it took 33minutes to reach Suzhuobhei station. We had breakfast at Starbucks. Was reading prior departure to take the bus to Tongli but since we couldn’t locate the bus though there was a bus station, went there to ask where’s the bus bound for Tongli but we were told to take the Metro. Ask the police patrolling, said the same, take the metro. We took the metro and it took around 40 minutes to reach Tongli, very cheap. In fairness the train, station, surrounding was clean. When we reached Tongli station, we walked to the nearby bus station and took the bus to Tongli Town, as there were obviously tourists like us, we knew we didn’t got lost. About 3 rounds, we saw the sign “ ancient village”, and the bus driver said something in chinese that we kinda understood we reached our destination. It’s very easy to move around this town, just look up for the signs. The locals were very nice."
Beautiful water town - still quite authentic,"Very recommendable old chinese water town great atmosphere, still many old building which aren't so perfect mixed with very well restored buildings. Many good restaurants with reasonable pricing.Best time is in the morning from 06:00 to 10:00 - its very quiet and only locals busy arranging their day.👍🏻😎"
Just beautiful. A top choice among the water towns,"WOW, what a beautiful place! Tongli is beautiful, relatively unmodernized, and surprisingly devoid of hordes of tourists. I'll attach some photos and let those images speak for themselves. Before our visit, we had considered visiting some of the other water towns including Zhujiajiao. Jolin, our tour guide through Travel China Guide, was able to quickly describe these other towns and explain why Tongli is her preferred choice of water towns to visit for considerations including its beauty and its relative quiet due to the fact that it is more difficult get to for many tourists. From Shanghai, you have to go to Suzhou first before catching a bus to Tongli making a trip to Tongli much for difficult than going to Zhujiajiao without a car which we had on our tour.  There are direct buses from Shanghai to Zhujiajiao. Having been in Tongli and comparing my experiences with images of other water towns now after returning from China, I have to agree with Jolin 100%. I'm sure Zhujiajiao is nice, but my experience in Tongli was out-of-this-world extraordinary along with the fact that it felt like we shared the town with just a few other tourists during our visit. Compared to Zhouzhuang, I've read that Tongli is quieter with fewer tourists. The Retreat & Reflection Garden (Tuìsī Yuán) in Tongli is also very nice as well and noted as a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site, though at a smaller scale than the Humble Administrator's Garden in Suzhou."
Nice but too touristy,"The Tongli Town in the afternoon is quite bustling with people and quite touristy to say the least. Its surely quite popular, but we preferred the Xitang ancient water village in comparison."
Similar to which in italy,This water town in suzhou is wonderful old city  with canals and water ways ...many  smal bridges many historic sites and many side ways with shops..Take the bout tour  for 90 rmb Take cycle tour for 5 stops by every historic spot and walk its nice to walk as well..you can eat and drink every where there . I recommend this water town and its totally safe .
A lovely water town but don’t go in the summer,I highly recommend this water town as it has many different historic buildings. I however recommend that if you visit in the summer bring water as the heat can be quite extreme if you come from a cool climate. There are a number of different restaurants with both Chinese dishes as well as European. I also recommend you take the boat tour.
We Enjoyed Ourselves,"We took the Metro to Tongli station and went to Exit 10 as others have said. What we did not know was that Tongli Water Town offers a senior discount. The lady at the booth asked our ages and one of us qualified. We bought one 88RMB ticket and took the free bus to the ticket office. We showed ID and paid 50RMB for a senior ticket. The town was very quiet for a Saturday morning. We took our time walking around the sites. Lots of restaurants without a lot of guests. Although it was hot, it was a great way to spend the morning."
Very quiet place during the weekday.,There's definitely shops with good price items. Nice looking Garden too. The Bridges are nice place to take photos.
Hot but well worthwhile from Suzhou,"Easy to get to, now that they have extended the subway line to Tongli - just buy the Tongli day ticket (at 12% discount) in the Tongli station near the station’s exit 10 and use that to get the free shuttle bus to the town where you exchange it for the town entrance fee which gets you into all the sites. Tongli is a quiet, walkable, compact, and well signposted water town, where many of the people live in traditional homes. It’s less touristy than the sites in Suzhou. For a great vegetarian lunch, in a quiet air conditioned setting, try Taimuting (泰睦庭）next to the Guangle site on the west side of the old town."
Recommended one day trip,"Contrary to Suzhou, where Pingjiang Lu is basically the only place where you can still see the old water channels, the ancient town of Tongli has preserved the full water channel system, and this makes the town and excellent place for a one day getaway (e.g., if you're staying in Suzhou, or even in Shanghai).We got there using the metro (take line 4 till the end of the line, about 1h from Suzhou), and then bought the discounted 88 CNY voucher ticket directly in the metro station (close to exit 10). With the voucher, a free shuttle bus is connecting the metro station to the ancient town every 30 mins. In Tongli you have to exchange the voucher with the ancient town ticket (which otherwise costs 100 CNY)."
Nice getaway,"First of all, definite recommendation if you have time to spare and want to get out of the city. It is very convenient to get to from Suzhou  with subway line 4, all the way to the final stop (30-60 min from Suzhou, depending on starting point, 6-7rmb). But do NOT leave the subway station. Walk towards exit 10, there you find a Tongli Tourist Info and Ticket counter. This is legit, buy a reduced ticket for 88rmb (instead of 100 at the gate), including shuttle bus directly to the entrance and back, leaving every 30min. They spoke English, walked me to the shuttle bus, the bus driver even exchanged their voucher for the actual ticket for me at the gate.I received a map of town, wich is also posted within the village. There are signs in English as well and it is easy to navigate. You can spend anywhere from 1-5 hours. Many restaurants have English menus now. Also, some souvenirs are cheaper than in Suzhou's main tourist streets (e.g. 500ml handmade rice wine, 15%, 65-80rmb)"
Itinerary to get there,"Really nice place to visit !I went on a saturday and it was not crowded at all, more quiet than the humble administrator garden :pNot really easy to get there when you dont exactly know so I am sharing the itinerary:From suzhou railway station take the subway line 4 to final station Tongli. (around 1h)Then take exit 10 and search for the bus station on right street, bus 725 (dont cross any sidewalk its on the same ""block"")Its like 3-4 stations. Name of the get off station: shipailou.Then you can walk directly to Tongli watertown, it cost 100rmb to enter but you have access to all the ""attractions"" to visit (some are not really interesting though..)The boat tour is really nice, it cost 90 for one boat.Lost of little shops and restaurants. We spend around 3-4 taking our time and having a coffee break.I really recommend, its refreshing :)"
Amazing views in Tongli town and Suzhou,"Visited both Suzhou and Tongli town. As a solo traveler, I took a morning high speed train from shanghai and had previously booked Jeff to drive me around. jeff picked me up at the Suzhou station and then we visiting Tongli town, Humble Administrators Garden, Pingjiang Street and Tiger Hill. We enjoyed a white milk tea (see picture) that was simply refreshing and delicious. Jeff is a local to Suzhou, knows English and took care of me as if I was his friend from long before. jeff can be reached at: wechat: 18626211664, or via email at 309834760@qq.com. I highly recommend Suzhou and Tongli town.  Great trip overall."
"Great little village on water, not to miss ","Togli has nothing to do with Venice for the exception that it develops a part on water. Nevertheless the little town is worth half a day trip. It’s around 45 minutes from Suzhou by car. When you arrive you cross a modern bridge and you are in. Walk around the little streets, make some good pics, have a tea at the tea house at the beginning of the village where around 2,30 pm you can also enjoy a traditional concert. At a certain point you arrive where there are three bridges in triangle , cross them all! One is for longevity, one is for happiness and one is for healthy. Do not forget !"
It is a must in Suzhou,We spent an amazing day in Tongli. Went there on a rainy day so it was not crowded. Really enjoyed a boat tour on canals and delicious local food. It is accessible by metro. You need to take tickets to enter the old town area. Entrance fee is 100 yuan.
"Tongli,Xitang ",We spent an amazing memorable day in rural water towns: picturesque views and experiences full of unusual moments for western travellers. Melody gave this trip a nice personal touch. Highly recommend!
Underwhelming,"After living in China for such a long time, I FINALLY made it to Tongli. Many of my Chinese friends insisted that I go. You will soon learn that many of these ""historic"" cities are all the same."
4 hours visit,We went on a week day ( avoid weekends due to crowds and crowds in China are real crowds) the place is outstanding you can go by line 4 train but we took a hotelcar. I advise you to use a rickshaw once you are there to be able to see everything without being overtired mostly if it is in the summer with the heat. It cost 80 but we negotiated to 60 and finally paid the 80 due to the great service our rickshaw driver gave us. It is an experience you should not miss a real water town with history and many extraordinary spots
"Too crowded, too many shops but...","Beautiful place. The brst advice is to take one night in a waterside hotel. Bring your own food and drinks and enjoy the beauty after 6 pm, when the masses leave. Never go on weekends. Vompleteky overcrowded, and those who know China might be able to imagine the noise. But evening and night until 8 am quiet, romantic place"
Overrated JiangNan style old town with water channels,"The old part of the town has admission fee till evening, but it's free after 5 or 5:30pm. I think it should be better to go at evening as those restaurants at the sides of water channel will light up lanterns that adds some beauty. If the weather is hot and humid, sitting outside and along the water channels may be uncomfortable, especially when mosquitos are flying around. Didn't eat there as all the restaurants looked similar. The pebble roads there are quite uneven and narrow in general that ones should watch their steps. Absolutely no high heels for women. Overall, it is silmilar to other old towns with water channels around Suzhou and its surroundings. BTW, for driving visitors, be care of the scam for kind of valet parking as non-Suzhou license cars are not allow to drive in the old town area. There are free car parks before the old town area."
Quaint and pretty,"Easily accessible from Suzhou via the metro system although it will take well over 2 hours from centre of town. Once you arrive there is a tour desk but you may also take a taxi or Didi from the terminal subway station. We traveled there on a rainy day and the expectation was that this may dampen our spirits but in between there were dry periods to take pictures or travel on the boats should we have been so inclined. We were busy exploring shops, cafes and restaurants. Everyone was friendly and most importantly, they didn't have 'foreigner prices' even though items did not have prices labeled on them and it was quite a touristy place. It felt welcoming and I plan to return for another visit in the future just for the atmosphere."
A little too quiet and serene for us,"My 2GFs and I loved this place!  We almost opted for another canal town, but I am glad we did it after a long day touring Suzhou with our amazing tour guide Sunny who drove us in his car from Shanghai and helped us to purchase the entry tickets in advance to dodge the long queue at the entrance.There are about a dozen of halls and little gardens within the town that are included in the price of admission. I found the museums very interesting, giving a view of life in ancient China. There was a museum of only ancient beds and wedding.There were a few ancient wealthy merchant homes that were very impressive and had beautiful gardens usually built around a pond. There are shops and artisans and restaurants offering basically the same menu. There was a Chinese opera going on (free) in the town square. We spent 3 hours browsing the town before we hit the road back to Shanghai. I'd gladly go again, or recommend it to a friend."
Lovely,We went on an excursion to Tongli as part of our Shanghai visit. This is a town known as the Venice of the East and it certainly lives up to its name. Very narrow sidewalks and very pretty canals. We took a nice gondola ride on the canals. The open square in the center of town offered lots of opportunities to window shop.
Transport to Tongli,It was really easy to get to from Suzhou. Line 4 metro . Then bus 725. There are signs once you get out of Tongli metro to bus stop 725. Bus is 2 dollars .
Nice place to spend several hours,"It’s overrated to call this the Venice of China,  but it is a pleasant old village with pretty canals.  Be sure to watch out for the ticket booth, or you’ll have to backtrack a fair distance to get back to it.  The area is larger than it first appears, with a shopping district.  Lots of photo opportunities, and places to eat."
More than meets the eye,"Many say that this is a (Chinese) tourist trap and I have read reviews about dilapidated and molded wall houses. We did not visit Tongli in a tour group for 3 hours but actually stayed there for 3 days and there is much more to it than what these reviews claim. There are many 'character' hotels which are restored mansions with their gardens and small lakes or simple houses with traditional Chinese design and furniture where the tourist can relax and enjoy genuine hospitality. There are many of these places one of which is the Moon Shine Inn where we stayed - just outside the ticket zone close to the North Bus stop. The ticket-zoned town is what you would expect from a tourist village but in the morning and late afternoon before and after all the tourist buses have left it is a heaven of relaxation. Especially in Tuisi Yuan (the Retreat and Reflection Garden).The people who run the restaurants bars, tea/coffee shops and other shops are friendly and not pushy to tourists - especially the young people are amazingly polite! Our hotel offered lunch and dinner ala carte but it is quite pricey and you can find decent food in most of the restaurants around the old city. Local specialties to try are the 'three whites', silverfish, whitefish and white shrimp from the nearby Taihu Lake, WanShan style pork knuckles and rose cakes.  Xiangge Jiulou (Shanger Restaurant) on Mingqing Street offers its menu in English but if Chinese language is not a problem for you, ask the tourist office for the Jiutanzi Fantong restaurant and you will be treated with excellent local cuisine at a very reasonable price: one steamed silverfish, one 'soft-fried' pork (with chillies and nuts), one dish with wood-ear mushrooms and sliced root vegetables, one dish of shredded potatoes with chillies and 3 bowls - not cups- of 'mi huan tang' ('lose your mind') rice wine costed us less than 100 RMB  - approx £12.Coffees are quite pricey in Tongli so, if you really need your caffeine dose be prepared to spend at least 40 RMB - approx £5!!Don't miss the river boat cruise. It is nothing less than Venice or Amsterdam lasts approx 20 minutes and costs 90 RMB per boat (1-6 persons sharing)."
A great day trip from Suzhou,"You need a few hours to enjoy Tongli and the lovely rivers. It costs 100 to get in the old part and after that all sights are free.Please note that the sex museum which is mentioned in the Lonely Planet is now permanently closed.From Suzhou, you take the metro to the end of the line and then there is a frequent bus that takes you to the centre of town."
Nice traditional town,You can get to this area by bus. But be warned it’s not a short walk from the bus stop. We didn’t know and when we asked we were just to walk around the corner and all the way down the street. We were about 25 mins into our walk before we found an entrance into the town. We later found out that a car of sorts is offered but it’s based on whether or not others come as well and fill it up. If you decide to go to the old town of Tongli wait for the cart to fill up or catch a taxi to the actual town. It’s a cute traditional Chinese water village it makes it more interesting because the locals still live in the area. Worth a visit.
An ancient water town and quite charming,"During my China trip I was visiting 2 water towns. One was Tongli, the other Nanxun.  Both are listed as ""least"" commercial compared to the bigger and more built up ancient towns in the Sozhou area. Both towns are very different, both beautiful, but have a different flavor. One has wooden houses/buildings, the other stone. I recommend to visit both kinds. Tongli is not as terrible as a previous tourist stated. Many houses are surprisingly nice. I even stayed in one of them, the Best South Boutique Inn which was completely charming. No dusty rooms or rotten wood! Probably at least as well kept as old homes in England! The canals are rather clean so were the restaurants. Mornings and evenings without the large tourist crowds present, you can experience the thoroughly picturesque  lay-out of Tongli with its stone walkways and bridges. Of course there are souvenier shops, but there also are incredibly beautiful corners, like the Tuisi Garden, a World Heritige Sight. Also visit the old mansion which are open to the public.They are huge and beautiful, in good condition."
More a eating place than an old town,"Tongli is one of the old water villages in Suzhou and perhaps is the one nearest to the city centre.  If you take a car the trip will take around one hour.Quite like many old heritages in China it is too commercialised.  With a little bit of imagination, you can have an idea how beautiful the village was like in ancient time.  But in reality it is full of small shops and it loses all the charm a heritage should be like.If you buy a ticket you are allowed to enter a few big wealthy people's homes.  On the day of visit these houses were full of noisy crowds.It is therefore advisable to go on weekdays, and perhaps the earlier you go, the less the chance you will encounter the noisy crowds."
Tour,Exvellent place to visit. Take a boat ride. Visit the garden in the centre. Have lunch. Experience the smbience. Not crowded.
Could Be Much More Charming,"Visited Tongli two weeks ago from Suzhou. Take metro line 4 to the Tongli Station (terminal station). Follow the crowd through the exit. At the back of the station, take bus 725 (you will not miss it as you'll see a long line or a large crowd). The 4th stop is the Tongli scenic area. Bus ticket was 1CNY, but will be 2CNY if AC is on. Get off the bus and walk back a little, then cross the street at the traffic signal, you will see the ticket office (near KFC).  The entrance fee is 100CNY.Lots of shops and restaurants line the street to the old town.  Use an online map for general direction.  The old town is in a very sad condition - cafes and restaurants along the canals look dirty and unappetizing, mold ubiquitous on white-washed walls, dusty rooms in the gardens and halls, faded painting, rotten wood and beams on ancient structures...  If no maintenance or restoration is done soon, the old town will no longer be able to attract tourists in a few decades.  Tongli should seriously consider investing quickly and heavily in renovating the main attractions to make them truly charming and presentable.  If you've been to the Cotswolds in England, you know that old doesn't have to be dilapidated or dirty or unkempt.I loved the Pearl Tower (the rear garden was delightful) and Tuisi Garden.  And I look forward to seeing them again in the future in a much better condition."
Water village,This is not the best water village in this area but easy to access from Suzhou. Can make a boat tour (30mn and 90 Rmb whatever number of persons). Dining alongside the canal in evening is nice.
A bit chaotic and a bit grubby,Maybe my expectations were too high as it is described as  a Venice type place with buildings on the water. People do live there and apparently Chinese go there for birthdays and celebrations because it is certainly different but the buildings need cleaning up. White buildings look bad with black mould. There are lots of small food places and things to buy towards the outside. Scooters were honking constantly trying to drive through pedestrians The water tour is short but interesting because you can see into houses and cafes. Try not to go there on a Sunday by motorway from Shanghai as it could take 3 hours not one and a half. Check for festivals like the Tomb sweeping festival when even more people are on the road. We had lunch at the Nanyuan Tea House which is a historic building on the edge just to the right of the entrance. It was average food but there is a reasonable toilet outside. It is very dark on the first floor but upstairs is much lighter with a number of large groups eating there.
Beautifull,"A must see when you’re in Suzhou, however be aware of very large groups of chinese visitors ! Best is to visit on a monday or tuesday, early morning . Do take a canal boat tour ! It’s certainly not the venice of the east, but still very nice to see."
Fabulous ,"Another great garden each section you go through archways, you need to take a guide to give you the history the houses were built to give the impression that they are in water on little islands the view from one of the balconies is spectacular as the photograph shows, well worth a visit."
"Historical town, well looked after, but can be oh so crowded at weekend","Water towns are a great feature of this part of China; canals with bridges, little streets branching left and right, history laid out and cared for, occasional public opera performances, street food and boat trips.  Excellent traditional gardens and old preserved houses.  And pedestrianised (except for local scooters, care!).  Go in the week if possible; less street food, maybe, but you won't be dodging quite as many crowds."
Not used potential of this very nice place / ruined by locals and turists too,"We were quite looking forward to come to Tong Li historic town BUT...  hearing all the time laud klaxons, jumping to the side because of crazy drivers, seeing all that mess on the ground was quite disappointing and ruing the trip. I am not sure whether it is needed to sell all that commercial ""crap"" for kids there / everywhere. It would be great place to visit with not many and not expensive changes... There was very nice ART stuff there to see or buy (some even hand made directly on the place). Total impression was less than average and if we knew the reality we would not go there..."
Incredible old town.,"Beautiful canals lined with old houses. Fantastic place to walk and explore. The houses have very old roofs but several walls have been repaired with cement.  Cobbled streets with large cobble stones, old growth trees that hang over the canals, beautiful wooden boats and the smell of food greet the average traveler. It is s center for silk with many stores selling silk products."
Beautiful water town near Suzhou,"One of the many water towns near Suzhou. We took a bus from Suzhou North Train station. About 1.5 hour. Day trip (2-3 hours). Town is small. Commercialized but still quiet (we visited in Dec) enough to walk around and enjoy. White buildings, black roofs, bridges over canals that criss-cross the small town. You can take a cruise on a small boat. Interesting local tradition of walking the three bridges during festive occasions.Note: from the bus stop, it is still a considerable walking distance (about 30 min) to the water town. Saw some bus ferries on our way back."
Commercialised.  Lost the ancient feel,"Made a mistake and booked hotel car for 4 hours at rmb1,000 !!! There are taxis available even though it seems remote and about 1 hour drive from the city.  Arrived early at 11am and most shops have just opened. Wondered around and had some fun wearing traditional costumes featured in popular TV drama series.  It is only 10rmb but costume.  Lunch at a restaurant popular for bucket rice. Not bad actually. Finally found a spot where I could fly my drone. Didnt take boat ride. The whole town has lost her ancient feel due to too many modern retailers even though the buildings seem old.   Nonetheless, I enjoyed the short trip there."
Good but not fantastic... ,"TongLi old town is a nice day trip destination from Suzhou albeit it's getting touristy. Go early to have a peaceful and leisurely stroll around the water town or stay overnight in one of the inn or hotel to enjoy the night views without the crowd. Good photography spots when you go early before the crowds stream in. Enjoy a home cooked style meal at one of the many small eateries by the river taking in the serenity and watching the water boat go by... Worth a visit before it gets too commercialized.For those trying to get there by public transport from Suzhou city, take the Metro line 4 to TongLi station, leave via Exit 2 and walk to the bus stand for service 725. Alight at Shi Pai Lou stop and follow the signage into the old town."
A must visit town,"TongLi is an ancient town, which located in the northeast of WuJiang District, in SuZhou city. It has 1000 years’ history as it was built in the Song Dynasty. There are 3 stone bridges connect the town and cross three rivers. The bridges were built in different times and has its own history and name. Fortunately, some of the architectures in the town managed to survive and well kept till today. So we can see how the residents made a living in those days, particularly those ‘rich’ inhabitants’ lifestyle. It is a town has its own culture. If you have time, it will be ideal to stay in a hostel run by the local for one night to visit the town in more depth. Now visitors can take metro to the station “TongLi” and then take a taxi or the public bus to get there. The entrance fee is RMB100 per head. We managed to get the cheaper price RMB80 per person by booking on the XieCheng App."
Quick visit,Came here for a few hours. Walked through a garden and took a cruise through the town. Plenty of places that offer pictures in traditional Chinese clothing along the canals. Fun visit.
More hype... ok place,"Nothing spectacular, gardens are average, narrow water canals. Didn't take a boat ride. Food options are also not great"
Awesome,Well worth visiting this water town. We took a boat tour around the canals and under the bridges...and we all thoroughly enjoyed the tour. I could have taken the boat tour several more times and seen new things each time. At the end of the morning we ate lunch at the NanYuan tea house.
A very charming Watertown,One of the highlights of our visit to Shanghai was going to this beautiful small Watertown  . There are about seven of these listed to bea able to visit . This even though it was fairly busy is listed as being quiet and less commercial than the others . Really enjoed our walk along the canals and through some of the old special houses .
Water Tickles the Toes of the Town,"Tongli was unquestionably one of the unexpected highlights of our recent trip to China. We'd read about it in a guide, but were still taken by surprise at the timeless charm of this ancient hamlet nestled between bridges and cuddled along canals. We came on a Sunday and so had to brave the crowd, but found ample compensation in strolling along canals and a performance of Chinese opera performed on the town square."
Authentic water town,"Unlike many Chinese water towns this is neither fabricated nor merely just one big open air museum. It is, however, a huge tourist destination, both for the growing Chinese middle classes and the occasional foreigner. A 40 min uber ride from central Suzhou, or about an hour or so on the subway, you can make this a day trip if you’re in Suzhou but will more likely need to stay overnight if you’re coming from Shanghai. Several places of interest, a nice little gondola style boat tour and no shortage of places to eat and drink. Being early November the crowds were minimal and the weather acceptable, though if you come here during high summer expect it to be oppressively hot and very crowded."
Knowing old China,If you like to know about classical oriental country life then this is an opportunity for you. Located at a driving distance from Shanghai you can enjoy the whole day and drive back to Shanghai hotel. My recommendation though is you must allot at least a day and stay in the vicinity where a plenty of high quality hotels are available.. You will have nice understanding about the old time Chinese living while you can enjoy great food at the close by down town street. You can spend memorable time in boat riding in narrow canals which are spanned over head by numbers of stone-made bridges. Overall it will provide you a half a day enjoyable time and then the night in the vicinity will make the memory colorful.
Interesting place,"Apparently, this has been kept just as how it was years ago.  Interesting little streets with shops/restaurants.  You must take a water ride and the canals to get the full experience."
Picturesque,"Tongli is a small water village of ancient architecture a and arched bridges. A cansal boat ride enables you to see the sights from water level but a walk round the narrow streets enables you to get up close. Understandably very touristy so a visit early morning or late afternoon held avoid the crowds. Our entrance ticket included access to 9 different areas including the Pearl Tower,Tuisi Garden,Luoxing Island and Chongben Hall. To be presented on entry. Many places to eat and drink to watch the world go by."
Tongli,A beautiful village.  You must take a boat ride through the serene and historic canals that link many rivers in this architectural masterpiece.  Beautiful people.
Ancient town,"about an hour ride from suzhou center by subway - blue line 4ancient town with water canals, a lot of chinese restaurants and gift shopsuitable also for families with kidsSince I saw better water town I great it only 3 stars"
local architecture,Generally viewed from the water the architecture was interesting insight into an earlier era of development.
A bit 'touristy' but even the locals love it,"Small village which sits astride a maze of canals.  Water focused rural life was probably not quite as smart as this, but definitely worth a visit and maybe a ride down a canal.  Keep your eyes open for cormorant fishermen."
Subway-connected historic town,"Very beautiful old town; an overnight stay is best to avoid the crowds. We took the brand new subway line from central Suzhou to Tongli station. From there we took the official tourism shuttle bus to the old town's north entrance; the cost was 80-100RMB including admission to all attractions. It's important to figure out where in town your hotel is so you can plan which entrance to head to; we stayed at DeXin CaoTang on the north side; it would have been a huge pain to have entered Tongli from the south side, which is where the regular buses drop people off. It's a pedestrian town so be prepared to lug bags around. We left by noon on our second day because too many other tourists were coming in."
Chinese Chioggia,"I’ve spent in this beautiful and peaceful 水城 a lovely day, the structure of this water small town reminds me of Chioggia, a maritime city in Italy, there are plenty small shops of food,souvenirs,books and also several small hotels along the canals, as well also restaurants. This place is one of the less touristic water towns around Suzhou (just 45 minutes by subway and then 4 bus stops) and it is also quite close to Shanghai, maybe half an hour, where you can lose yourself in the maze of little and narrow shambles and take pictures of the natural beauty around you. There are also many wooden boats always full of tourists, following the infos on the signposts a few scenic places can be found. People can go there  preferably during springtime or in autumn, but always remember that the place is teemed of people during the National Week."
Do not miss ,Thanks to my Chinese colleague who propose me to visit this very nice place. It was absolutely full of enjoyment two days in Tongli. A friendly place where you can find a lot of interesting things. I missed to have a tour on channels and this will be my reason to visit another time
Quaint historic town,"Though we had a guide with us, we did not learn much about the town's history. Instead we learned more about how it is today.We took a short gondola ride, which was very peaceful, though it was sad to see the ospreys tied to the docked boat. (Our guide told us the birds used to be tied up around their necks.) It was also sad to see the depressed state of some of the residents living along the canals, most of them senior citizens.Out on the town's main drag, it was more lively with shops and food stalls. There were colorful umbrellas and souvenirs, roast pork, and candy making demonstrations to contrast the small, quiet alleys. I suspect those who consider Tongli ""touristy"" and ""commercialized"" did not venture far from the main road.It was a nice, but short visit; I would have liked more time in Tongli Town, perhaps 2-3 hours. I would opt out of eating at any restaurants there, however. We saw too many rice dishes getting their start in canal water..."
A must-see water town,"A quaint little water town 40 minutes outside of Suzhou offers a glimpse into the old China. Definitely worth a visit, or even to stay if you prefer a more quiet setting with a Venetian style atmosphere that Suzhou does not offer in a hurry. Definitely make time to indulge in some local food alongside one of the riverside canals and cross the famous 3 bridges. Beware that there is charge for the town, but it does include the entrance costs to most of the attractions worth visiting too."
Love Tongli,"Went to Tongli on the metro and bus from Suzhou and Im so glad I made the trek.  Real old China, preserved in a great way.  Tourism traps with boats etc then same time a woman doing her washing in the canal.  Really felt emotional pull here although the map/directions once you buy the ticket are a bit of a mystery.  Train/bus is a pain tho. Walked back to train from Tongli but took a good hour in high heat!"
Underwhelmed,"We were very underwhelmed by this town.  It has some quaint things to see, but is really touristy with lots of people wanting to sell you food or bike you around.  It's not clear unless you are with a guide.  We weren't.  They give you a very small map if you ask. There is some construction going on so you can turn down a little street to find that.  I bought an inedible ice cream for $18.  The canals are very dirty and having been to Venice, I probably would not have the same expectations. We missed booking a tour so caught the train, subway and taxi too and from.  We managed well having had our concierge write the addresses for the town, Togli station, and Suzhou station to show taxi and to find on subway.  Subway is excellent even in Suzhou and ticket machines are in english as well.  The town just felt too touristy for us.Use Cash like in most places."
Pretty ancient town,"We took line 4 on the metro from Suzhou Industrial Park, many stops but a good/cheap journey. We couldn't work out the buses to the old town once there so opted for a taxi which was very cheap. Tickets to enter the old town are 100Y each which includes entry to museums and gardens. It was quiet on a weekday, lovely to walk around. There are numerous maps dotted around. We had coffee and also lunch by the canal. There are public toilets and those we used were clean. An enjoyable visit"
Attractive old town,"Billed as China's Venice, this attractive old town with its waterways and gardens is really quite attractive.  Now very much a tourist town attracting large numbers of Chinese visitors, it manages to avoid the absolute tackiness of many tourist destinations. There are canal boats to be hired, gardens to visit, museums, shops and cafes - yes you can get a decent cup of Illy coffee.  Very enjoyable.  Don't miss the Pearl garden- delightful."
Velence in China,"Nice old town, maybe 1000 years... lot of canals, boat trip is funny. You can find lot of restaurants."
Very nice little town.,TongLi is a quaint little town with labyrinth type street and tons of character. The people of this little ancient Venice-type city are very friendly. There are tons of little gems here to be found just hunt for Easter eggs and you'll find them.
lot of fun,"We had a nice time walking around this little tourist town.  Lots of little shops and cafes. Don't miss taking a boat ride. It is a lot of fun.It is a full day outing from Shanghai , through a lot of traffic but I am glad that we did it."
Gem of Suzhou,"The place is undoubtedly a Gem in Suzhou. Nice quiet and calm alleys, soveniers shops, restaurants, coffee shops can be found here. The walk along the canals will surely refresh you. One can also take a boat ride. The ride time is 30 minutes. The cost is 90 RMB for the boat and 6 persons can share one boat. The town entrance fees is 100 RMB which in my opinion is quite justified considering the place. For reaching the town, take line 4 to the Tongli Station. Exit through exit 9 (or simply follow chinese crowd). Just at the back of Station, there is Bus stop. Take Bus 725 from there. The 4th stop is the Tongli scenic area. Getoff the Bus and walk back a little, then Cross the road on the opposite side at the traffic signal, you will see the ticket office(Near KFC). It is not recommended to take taxis in front of subway."
Peaceful and wonderful place ,"Along the channels, gliding with a boat, in such a peaceful silence, we are glad to forget the noise of the cities we have been to in the other days. We had lunch in an one hundred years old tea house. All was perfect!"
Well-Preserved But Rather Commercialized,"Traditional village houses & willows by the canals, historic towers & mansions, cleverly-designed gardens – Tong Li ancient town offers enough to keep you here all day. My only regret is that the place is also rather commercialized & touristy – rows and rows of traditional houses have actually been turned into hotels, cafés or restaurants; merchants beckoning to sell you souvenirs at every corner… In a way, it’s not that different from other ancient towns in the province, like Wuzhen or Zhouzhuang. But yes, it’s still a nice escape from the bustling Shanghai or Suzhou -  a good break for the weekend & a nice side-trip from the big cities."
Pleasant,"Went with my friend as part of our China trip, we were staying in Suzhou so took the new metro line (4 I think it was - the dark blue one) all the way to the last stop which is tongli, cost us 7 rmb each. Think we were on the metro about an hour in total (including getting from our hotel area on the red line).When you come out of the metro station there are bus stops just behind. I took the information I found on here and we got on the 725 bus. This is now 2 rmb, but takes you to the town area. It's final stop is the bus station next to the east parking lot, but we jumped off a little before, on the main road. If you see the KFC and the large Chinese gates, get off. Much more pleasant way to walk upon entry to the old town area.Paid the 100 rmb entry fee and in we went. It was a nice little place, and we enjoyed walking along the streets adjacent to the water and over the bridges. We didn't do all the places you could get into on the ticket. We decided as a final stop to go and do the ferry over to the island. After walking out of the town and up a long street (which in over 40 degree heat felt like it went on forever) we finally arrived at the ferry terminal. As we entered there was no staff member which greeted you or told you what to do, there were about 7 other people sat down waiting so we sat down too. A ferry returned from the island and people got off, the staff member disappeared back into the office, and no loading of the ferry happened. The other people eventually just walked off. We waited around 30 mins, which should've been plenty of time even with them potentially only doing trips every 30 mins (what with unloading and loading etc), but there was no acknowledgment from anyone, and some staff were even laid out on the chairs sleeping.We were a little disappointed with this ending to our visit.We then walked the short distance to the bus station and got the 725 bus back to the metro line. Personally we'd say to visit if you had time in your schedule, but not somewhere we'd plan to visit again."
Really beautiful ancient town,"the architectures and town were historical and well preserved. Good thing of Tongli is it's much less commercial than Zhouzhuang but much more beautiful and elegant. Tuisiyuan is one of the most beautiful garden to visit. We visited in Feb and it was EXTREMELY COLD, we had to flee during the middle of the tour because I was almost fainting because of the chill in the bones, I've been to many northern countries but that was literally the COLDEST DAY of my life with drizzle rain."
The best side trip out of Shanghai.,"We really enjoyed our time in this town/area.  The canals are a great experience.  The gondola ride, to me, is better than in Venice (perhaps not as romantic).  But, there is so much going on, whether it's on the sides of the canals or in the market place.  Fortunately, we had wonderful weather.  But, watch out for the scooters when you're walking along the canals.  The walkways aren't very wide, and the paving stones are uneven."
Fabulous!,This is a stunning place to visit even in the summer heat. We loved the boat ride along the canals and the scenery is gorgeous. It's easy to get to and inexpensive. Definitely a must do on the list.
Beautiful small old town,"This place did not feel overly touristy and had it's own culture and night life. It was fun to walk around, enjoy the waterways, bridges, food. We only spent a night so did not get to venture far."
Very nice experience ! must see!,"1 hour drive from Suzhou and it is a bit touristy but a must to see. Take your time to walk around, take a boat trip, have a lunch in one of the resturants at the canals, visit some old historical houses and enjoy the ancient way of the people who are still living there.Avoid weekend can be very crowdy just take a weekday .If you like history it is Unesco heritage and enjoy but take your time strolling over the bridges and enjoy it can take a full day trip."
The UNESCO Heritage and Historical Town ,"It was a nice experience for my friends and myself. 2 hours far from Shanghai by the car, strongly recommendable place for the tourist."
Visit,"We visited Tongli on a day trip from Shanghai. We took a taxi from Suzhou railway station (100 RMB one way) in order to save time and energy for the watertown itself. We walked the streets plus visited most of the sights included in the entrance ticket. Our favourites were the pearl tower complex and gentle hall, the retreat garden perhaps was too crowded to enjoy the atmosphere. Definitely worth doing and also easy enough to do independently for a foreigner."
Nice day out,"It was an adventure getting there, and it's a bit touristy, but it's a nice day out and the 90yuan boat ride is worth it. The historic buildings and gardens we're worth the 100rmb admission to the town."
good,This place have chinese traditional house and road. you can feel chinese culture and beatiful house and road. also you can eat traditional chinese food.
A Hidden Gem,"This ancient water/ canal town is less famous compared to others, so it's less crowded & more quite. Worth to stay over night when tourists who do day trip left, so you can explore after dinner or in the early morning as well. Be sure to eat the famous pork knuckle in the restaurants, most of them were good, except the restaurant right in front of the three bridges, where it was not fresh & not well prepared & most expensive!"
Good experience for first timers to ancient town:),"Tongli is a water town renowned in Suzhou for it's canals and street culture. Depending on the season and holidays, it can get busy, however regulary it is relatively not busy and is nice for a meal and stroll on the canal if you like."
Too commercialized,"I was expecting to really see a ancient town.....well part of it does look old, but just did not seem to be what I have expected. I guess it is now too commercialized."
Hints of Old China,A mix of retail and people still living and working there. Good dining options. Very crowded. A gate guard tried to charge us to enter. Luckily one of our companions was Chinese and refused to pay which no one else was doing. Charming place all along canals.
Too pricey ,"It's an okay place to hangout and chill but I would say it's pricey for what you see in there... also, avoid going there on national holidays, unless people-watching is your thing..."
Laid-back atmosphere and beautiful views,"I chose Tongli as the least commercialized and the least crowded water town close to Suzhou. It wasn't the least crowded :) but the canals, boats and the atmosphere of the place was exciting, especially when we decided not to hurry around all the sights but have a lazy lunch in one of the cafes by the canal. It was worth it!!! There I totally enjoyed the relaxed meal and could experience the sense of the holiday. The bill wasn't that bid (about 120RMB for the two). The food was delicious!"
Lovely way to spend a day,"With the opening of Line 4 on the Suzhou Metro, this is now a fairly easy attraction to get to from Suzhou. Take line 4 all the way to Tongli, exit 2, and you can pay to get a bus into the ancient town. The 90 RMB bus fare covers the town's entry fee (normally 100 RMB, I believe) and gets you into several of the museums in the town. The town is very touristy, similar to Hoi An in Vietnam, but pleasant, nonetheless. I recommend going in the morning to beat the crowds. By early afternoon, the town was packed with people."
We were set back in time!,"We wanted to experience a smaller water-town. We stayed 2 days in Tongli, a beautiful, pitoresque chinese watertown. The athmosphere changes in night. Not many tourist actually stay inside this town. And it's all so quiet, but still beautifully lit with chinese lanterns. The channels, the buildings, the identic feel of the town. It's not difficult to imagine how life must have been here a 100 years ago. We are so happy we decided to visit and to stay a couple of night here!"
Sex Museum is Gone,"The Chinese Sex Museum is no longer in Tongli. The Tourist Administration representative from the Tonglin site says that it has been moved to Hainan. Tongli Town was nice, but if you are in Suzhou, you can get a similar experience in their old town. A new subway line has opened in Suzhou (Line 4)...last stop is Tongli. It cost me 7 rmb. Exit the Metro from exit 2 and take bus 725 for 1 rmb to the tourist site. 100 rmb to enter the old city region."
Kinda like an Asian version of Venice,"Tongli was the only one on my list of things to do in Suzhou when I did a rushed itinerary before arriving in China. With the newly opened subway line 4 in Suzhou, getting here is fairly easy. I took the subway line 4 to Tongli station (6 cny one way from Nanmen and the trip was around 40 mins) then there's a number 725 bus waiting outside the subway which goes to the Tongli bus stop (1 cny and it takes about 10 mins). When I got off the bus, there are signs to Tongli and I had to cross the road and turn right and walked a little bit to ticketing area. Ticket costs 100 cny (free for over 70's with identification card). It is a fair walk to Tongli entrance and there's a lot of people walking so you won't miss it. Tongli has a lot of old looking buildings and small bridges over the canals. The entrance to points of interests are included with the ticket cost. I like the Tuisi garden. There are lots of restaurants along the canals as well as souvenir shops, shops selling foods like traditional Suzhou biscuits, beef and pork jerky and ginger candies. You can also cruise along the canal for 90 cny which was fun (I found some people to share the boat with). I also saw a lot of artists painting around the town which was quite interesting to look at as I like art. It does look like an Asian version of Venice to me at least and worth visiting when in Suzhou."
It was just SO SO...,"Pros: The gardens are quiet on certain residences which give some photo opportunity In the first garden, you can get famous paper cut artwork at reasonable price and there is a great postcard cafe.Cons:The air in Suzhou is pretty polluted so I cannot enjoy the serene feel. There were too many restaurant touts and the boat ride at 90 RMB is pretty pricey. The pearl tower was a scam!!! It is quite hard to get a taxi to go back to the city centre so please book a taxi to wait for you."
Absolutely Beautiful !,We took a bussride to Tongli from Shanghai - although most guides do it from Suzhou . We were dropped along the motorway - which was a bit strange - and no one at the tourist center spoke a word of English - but hey we got a half price ticket for the city because we were over 60 - so it was only 50 RMB . the electric train to the main gate costs 5 RMB . The city itself with the canals the boats the many bridges is dreamlike beautiful . It was very quite the day we went and we had a tasty lunch along the canal with a splendid view for 7€ per person ! Many girls dress themselves in ancient costumes and have their pictures taken by professional photographers . I absolutely loved it .
Lovely Water Town,"We were on a tour of China that did not include a water town, and I really wanted to see one. So we skipped the regular tour in our second day in Shanghai and booked a private tour to Tongli.  It was well worth it. A little touristy but very pretty. It was not too crowded the day we went, and we lucked out with beautiful weather. The boat ride though town is a must do. We also visited some beautiful gardens in the town."
"Another ""water town"" to visit - it is worth it","This town, albeit smaller than its' more famous neighbour -  Zhouzhuang (we thought this town was too ""touristy"" and crowded), is still worth a visit if you are around Suzhou or Shanghai. The small bridges, canals, old buildings, shops, restaurants, lanterns, etc make for a very pleasant walk, even on a cloudy day."
"Personally, loved this little town!","Actually visited in January 2016. We took the train from Shanghai to Suzhou, then the bus from Suzhou to this little water town. Had been reading reviews at the time that it was smaller and less crowded than the other water towns. No regrets at all that we chose it, the highlight of our trip.The water town was small but really pretty and picturesque. We went there without any prior arrangements, and managed to stay at a nice and simple local-run boutique hotel for a fair price. You can also stay just outside the town itself, there are a few shop houses along the way which had rooms for rent.Not sure whether it was due to low season, but it wasn't crowded, and that was perfect. We wandered around the old streets, crossing bridges, visiting gardens, temples, and also exploring the small and interesting shops. Some craft were worth investing in.Souvenirs seemed much cheaper here than at the big cities too. Some shops made homemade ricewine using the traditional method. They usually allow you to taste and you can purchase some if you like it.Really enjoyed our 1 night stay there, but didn't manage to explore every shop. I think if you like a slow and laid back escape from the hustle and bustle of the nearby cities, you can even stay for 2 nights or more.Personally, compared to say the Humble Administrator's Garden in Suzhou, I very much prefer spending a night or two in one of the old water towns such as Tongli."
Pretty town,"Tongli is a cute town to wander through, but was a bit challenging for me to find. The ""tourist highlights"" pass was a complete waste of money, as the sites weren't really that exciting and there were limited English translations. The main attraction is definitely the town itself. A few other tips for getting there- the bus is in a bus station on the north side of Suzhou rail station on the second floor. Other things I read said the bus is ""in front of the rail station,"" so I wasn't expecting to have to go into another station. I also read that buses run every ~30 minutes, but it seemed to be less frequent than that (I had a long wait before the next bus). Tickets cost 8 RMB and you have an assigned seat on the bus. When you arrive in Tongli, try to purchase your return tickets before wandering into town so you can time your return and aren't stuck waiting for a while for the next bus at the end of the day. The tourist tram that takes you from the bus station into town requires a ticket (5 RMB) and it is separate from the ticket to see the sites (do not let them try to sell you the 100 RMB sites pass instead). If you don't take the tram, you can reach the town by walking for ~15 minutes. Once in town, I couldn't quite figure out where to go to ride one of the boats, which I was a bit disappointed in. Go in expecting to just wander around and have some tea by the river, and your journey will be relatively pleasant. If you want to try to find something specific, good luck."
First day in Suzhou ,"We travelled from Shanghai to Suzhou, and this was the first place that we stopped at.  It was a great place to start our Suzhou trip at!"
Interesting day trip from Suzhou,"Take the bus for 8 RMB from the upper level of the long distance bus station by Suzhou railway station. Journey is 1 hour and part goes beside Grand Canal. At Tongli go to Tourism Office beside the bus station to buy entry ticket for Old Town for 100 RMB (50 for over 65s) and 5 RMB ticket for electric car.  Old Town ticket includes entry to all the main places and a boat trip to island.  We didn't have time to do everything on a wet day in March. See other reviews for their opinions but highlight for us was Pearl Tower which is a lovely garden complex, comparable to those in Suzhou itself. Suggest you check return bus times when you arrive and maybe buy your return ticket then to ensure a seat. Last bus on our day was1940 but we took 1710 and journey took about 90 mins due to traffic."
Heaven!!!,"went there on a day tour and ended up staying 8 hoursthis place is super beautiful,, worth every minute,, the small narrow streets surrounded by canals of water,, the greenery all around, the small restaurants...the people sweet and welcoming!felt super amazing!! a real wonder!highly recommended!!"
Picturesque Water Town,"Relatively quiet compared to the other more popular water towns, but just.a s beautiful! Tagged as Venice of the East, this is a must visit place near Suzhou."
Worth the trip!,Took a bus from Suzhou to Tongli.  Wasnt able to figure out the small commuter tram to the town so I walked.  Great place to visit.  Took the water boat tour (was great and relaxing).  Lots of photo moments to share. I wish I had more time but the bus left Tongli at 3 to return to Suzhou.
Nice little old town,"About 45 minutes from Suzhou train station, this old town is quite nice worth 3-4 hours of sightseeing. The worst part is they do not have clear directions on how to walk from bus stop to the old town."
Venice of the East.,"Tong Li, is a beautiful area with numerous canals and bridges. It is an ancient water town with a vast amount of rural China culture, boat taxis, shops and restaurants. .I traveled from Shanghai to Tong Li (or Tongli) by car and spent the day touring, eating and drinking the local fare. The town is very low-key and has a peaceful and relaxing ambiance."
Won't Return,Was way too touristy. Crowded and expensive and out of the way. It's full of overpriced food and trinkets. Although it was pretty to walk around in.
Quaint old town,"This is a very serene and quaint 1,000 year old watertown.  Do not expect carefully manicured sidewalks and well planned tourist shopping streets.  We loved the old buildings, stone pavements, willow trees and bridge over rivers.  People are still washing rice by the river and drying vegetables and sausages on the streets.  If you like rustic and natural, this is the place to go.  The streets are not overly crowded, are clean enough and the combination of architecture and nature make for a nice morning walk.  We did not finish exploring all the streets but i don't think this town is very big and you can complete your tour of the town in half a day.  I agree with another reviewer that F&B choices are limited as this place is quite untouched by touristy makeovers.  There is a KFC and a Illy cafe.  There are also many local tea houses and restaurants by the rivers but they didn't seem too established.  In addition to the many local shops selling local food and souvenirs,  we found a quaint shop and cafes selling books, stationary and cute items like mugs and teas which was nice. There were locals asking if you would like a local home cooked meals for a fee.  But they were not bothering us too much.  Tongli is half an hour away from Suzhou by taxi.  As we didn't plan this ahead, we just grabbed a taxi from our hotel to the entrance of Tongli town.  You will have to pay an entrance fee of RMB100 at the main gate to enter the town.  After that, you can use the same ticket to enter a few attractions inside the town which are mainly traditional houses and gardens.  At the end of our tour, we walked back to the main street outside the gate and took a taxi back to Suzhou.  I can't remember the fare exactly but it is around RMB100 each way.I recommend anyone who want to experience some history to visit Tongli."
Nicest place in Suzhou,"If you are looking for a quiet and more authentic place you might want to go there. It must be crowded during national holidays but during winter it's fine, if you are lucky enough to avoid pollution on the day of your visit. Anyway, nothing close to Venice, so don't expect too much when people say Suzhou is the little Venice of China"
Tongli Town Time Travel,"Very interesting town which takes you back to a simpler time. We visited in December which was  very cold but nice and quiet, so allowed for peaceful walks and lots of exquisite photographs. Beautiful, friendly people who seem so happy living in this town and welcoming all these people into their home. The town is very clean with lots of facilities, food, drinks and the odd shop which is selling authentic crafts and art. Lots of the commercial shops selling everyday trinkets..."
Beautiful town,"I've not been to the other watertowns so I can't compare. But Tongli watertown (or ancient town as the sign says) was really beautiful. Getting there was easy. I just took a bus at the Suzhou Bus Station, which is next to the Suzhou Train Station. At the Tongli Bus Station, I went to the Tourist Information Centre (at the carpark) to get tickets for the sightseeing tram as well as entrance to the Tongli Watertown. The sightseeing car stopped just outside the watertown. At the entrance, you can explore the watertown either on foot or in a trishaw. The entrance ticket included free entrance to some of the attractions, which were mostly museums or homes of noteable people who used to live there. We took the trishaw, which was about RMB60. The first few homes we visited were great but after a while, it all started to look almost the same. Our rider brought us to the 3 bridges, where residents of the place would cross during auspicious events such as baby one month or weddings. A museum of all the different wedding outfit was rather interesting. Our rider even recommended a place where we would have lunch, which was rather nice although we later found out from our boatman that we were overcharged. After the trishaw ride, we took a ride on the gondola which was RMG90 for one gondola regardless of how many people were on it. We liked seeing Tongli Watertown from the waters. The boatman was also very knowledgeable and shared quite a bit about how the people in Tongli lived. For a bit extra, he would even sing songs that he composed.A very nice day out."
One of nice water towns near Suzhou,"A charming canal town not far from Suzhou and close to the Grand canal. Nice bridges, a lot of restaurants and shops"
"Gardens, canals and fascinating sights","We were impressed by Tongli. We visited two gardens, one old, the other quite recent, both impressive. The town is criss-crossed by small canals which add to the interest, especially up close and personal with the cormorant fishers."
"Ancient town, bridges, waterway.  How it used to be.","It was quite a surprising discovery from my visit to this ancient town.  You can still see the residents washing their clothes in the waterways, the old houses still intact.  Though most of the old ruins and building have been renovated, you can still see some old parts of it.  Definitely a different part of China to explore besides the ultra modern cities.  I was advised to visit this place first (Tonglu) before visiting other ancient towns such as Xitang as Xitang will be a different and better.  But being a 'virgin' to China's ancient towns, Tongli is an eye-opener. In order not to spoil the fun and adventure, Tongli has certainly provided a different side of China for my visit.  Will then visit Xitang in my future visits."
ancient water village famous for its equally ancient bridges which are still in use,"very beautiful water village but quite commercialized (which Chinese tourist spots aren't these days?), it is fame for its many ancient stone bridges connecting the entire village- many of which are still in excellent conditions and heavily used by the locals. i stayed overnight at a hotel there and it was great to sit by the (dirty) canal, and watched the locals chatting away, doing their own stuff when the tourists have left."
See a little bit of real China,"Whilst might think its a tourist place, the butcher, baker and clothing shops etc remind one that hundreds of families live and shop around the town oblivious of the bus parking area!The Tea House has safe food and drinks, as well as being a very old quaint building.If you have a day out of Shanghai its a good place to visit......and see embroidery and silk factories on way home."
"Interesting canal-filled village, but wouldn't suggest touching the water","This was a picturesque water village, with a sight-seeing gondola ride through the canals.  Great lunch upstairs at the tea house"
Wonderful example of a vibrant and functioning water town,This is a great location to see the life style of the traditional inhabitants.  It is known as the Venice of the East.  It has a canal which one can enjoy from boats for hire.  We strolled through the streets of the community and enjoyed the atmosphere of the town.  There are many restaurants at the canal side and it is a great place to watch the bots as they are sculled past under stone bridges under willows hanging over the water.
Interesting place,We visited 'the Venice of the East' on a wet day in October. It was fun to wander around and we had a lovely lunch outside watching the locals. Well worth a visit
A taster of a bygone age,"Everywhere in and around Suzhou is so built up, that this area allows a flavour of how,things used to be as does the centre of old Suzhou.  Tongli Town is a touristic area with many restaurants and little shops.  It was drizzly when we visited which meant there were few tourists, which was a bonus. Went on a canal boat trip and caught the little bus from the central car park."
"Different culture from Shanghai, peaceful day",Tongli  is known as the Venice of the East with its own version of gondolas as well as bicycle powered rickshaws.  Very peaceful.  Souvenir and regular markets.  This is a walking attraction.
Charming glimpse of old China,"This water town outside Shanghai, with it's canals and arched bridges is often referred to as the ""Venice of China."" While there are lots of tacky tourist traps, it's fun to walk around the narrow lanes and take a ride on the canals. The classical garden is quite beautiful, too."
One of must visit place in Suzhou.,"A great place to visit. Shopping and walk around.  Plane ti visit Tiger Hill in the morning or till afternoon, then take boat ride for RMB 55 to here."
A must see.,"One of the very best and still most authentic of the water towns. Ensure that on arrival in Tongli that you ask for the ancient town. (Tongli has a large modern city producing telecommunications software built around the old town.) You will be dropped off at the bus station and at the far side you will see a row of small electric cabs (look like large golf buggies) Take one of these, don't try and find the ancient town yourself -reading some of these reviews makes me realise that some people have ended up in the old town and not the ancient."
Interesting area,We did this as part of a tour.  There are some really beautiful spots such as the garden that is very similar to one in Shanghai.   Waterways with bridges are pretty.  There are also some Unesco buildings which were interesting to look at.  There are some good toilets here as well which is great for tourists.   There are a lot of shabby shops and tourist traps.  There are people wearing costumes that you need to pay if you want to take their picture.  I did enjoy walking around and looking at the sights here.  This areas was not crowded probably because there is a fee to get into this area.  Need to watch out for the scooters while walking around.
catch it before it changes.,"Lovely old world charm.  Quiet and tranquil especially the garden; could have sent a lot more time listening to the lingering flute playing in the background while taking a picture postcard photograph from any angle. Do take a boat ride to see the various houses along the canal, as well as the little workshops.  Visit the 1000 year old tea house as well.  buy souvenirs here the cheapest in china."
Must see ,It was a really nice day .. You will enjoy so many beautiful water gardens and old places and museums ... Wear your walking shoes cos u will be walking for whole day so be prepare 😜 you can find everything there ... Try to stay until it gets dark so you will see another beauty of the city and its fantastic .. U can find nice bars with local ppl so friendly 👍
Mixed feelings,Needed to stretch our imagination how this town was quaint and lived in the past.  Now it is a construction site and quite dirty.   The hokey shops and bad restaurants were a turn off. Took a 2hr drive from shanghai to see it.
A lovely old town with theme park overrtones,"This is a good opportunity to see a well preserved old town, albeit with the usual themed tourist attractions. Avoid the tourist restaurants at all costs if you enjoy Chinese food"
Not sure what to say ,"In some ways a fantastic place to visit. Lovely old town and not as mad with people as many other places. On the down side like many other Chinese placed its a building site. Buildings getting renovated, paths dug up etc etc and the endless rows of crappy gift shops and food stalls. Worth a visit but depends what you are looking for."
Fabulous day,"We took a bullet train to Suzhou then managed to find our way to the bus station to book a tourist bus to Tongli ancient water town,takes abut an hour ,then an electric car to Tongli .It was definitely worth the bus trip we did a 25 minute boat ride and the lady taking us around and under the bridges sang to us.We spent a lovely day having lunch and walking around the old streets.we did this trip on our own as it was easy to plan and much cheaper than taking a tour."
A beautiful ancient water town near Suzhou,"Tongli has a lot of character but is best visited in the winter. In the summer months there are so many tourists that you shuffle around and can't see or enjoy the scenery. In the winter it is empty, I've seen it coated in snow and it's truly stunning. One of the speciality dishes is pigs trotters, it might not sound good but it's delicious, the meat is so tender and falls of the bone. surrounding the old town are some very interesting side streets with lots of artisan shops and we picked up a few original paintings for an amazing price."
A must See,"We spent a whole day in this place and I can with certainty tell you that you will fall in love with it.  canals and sampans, little curious shops , restaurant bridges and a lot going on to photograph and see."
warm,"Our family visit the old town in July; it was too hot. The environment gives insight in the old days. Is it a must see town? most likely not. Traditional small shops, small mariage museum; all can be seen within some hours."
Beautiful place,"Definitely recommendable, it's just when it's 40° that it isn't that pleasant to walk. Nevertheless it was gorgeous! Would definitely recommend going there"
This was a beautiful place to see,"Wonderful, old world and relaxed. If you are heading to accommodation it would be worth while to purchase your drinks here."
Beautiful and well maintained,"We visited during November. The place has and old world charm and well maintained. It has an entry fee. Good to spend 3-4 hours here. There are cafes/eateries inside ,the prices are on the higher side. Best is to have a meal at McDonalds before entering the Tongli old town"
Chinese tourist trap,"Don't waste your time on this one. It is expensive, access is terrible and there are better and cheaper alternatives to view ancient Chinese culture and architecture."
Beautiful experience water town,I recently visited this charming water town with a group of primary school students. All students and staff remark on he memorable the visit to Tongli was.The water cruise was much better experience than those in Suzhou. The small town has much to offer in the way of things to see and buy.A must is the garden there... Small and compact but magnificent and houses an excellent paper cut centre.The shopping fur pearls is great. Inexpensive but very good quality.If your desperate there's a Starbucks.
Water Town Tongli,"Our tour stopped here for the day.I really enjoyed the ancient water-town. Went on a gondala up the canals which passes shops, temples and restaurants on either side it was very peaceful. The locals are friendly and not pushy. It was like stepping back in time, no rush."
Visit to true China,"Not yet a tourist Mecca, Tongli is a place you can go to visit and see traditional Chinese people working and living in a modest city setting, yet close to a large city. Home to just over 2000 people, the old 'Venice of the Orient' is a place of friendly people and artisans. It's about a 45 minute ride from Shanghai, but well worth the trip. Get tickets for the water taxi, and then wander around afterward to enjoy the day."
. . . old china in a nutshell. . .,"An amazing colorful place with a lot of variety of buildings, temples, streets, water channels, restaurants and places where traditional chinese art is sold. I enjoyed this place in all aspects. We first walked through it, then had a nice lunch and finally took a boat ride to get the full picture. Take your time and use the opportunity to understand old china in a nutshell"
ANCIENT WATER TOWN - TONGLI,"We went on a gondola ride through this Ancient water town in Tongli and thoroughly enjoyed the experience, it was a lovely way to see an old part of China where people still live today, the locals were very friendly and waved as we cruised past their house, great experience."
Spectacular Watertown - Amazing Serenity,Tongli is a beautiful water town about 1/2 hour taxi ride from Suzhou. There is a bus that takes one hour from the Suzhou train station as well. The town is characterized by stone bridges and well preserved ancient architecture. The gardens are magnificent. There's an admission fee to the old town with markers of where to visit. The Pearl Tower is breath taking - the serenity and calmness cannot be surpassed.  The Tuisi Garden was also magnificent. There's a boat ride well worthwhile to see some of the town's beauty. All in all it's worth the effort to get here from Suzhou.The entrance to the old town is through a main thoroughfare and you purchase tickets for the old town entry at the old city gate. There are ton';s of Chinese delicacies to buy. You can really get a feel of how people live by walking around the town.
Great place to see. Nice experience,Have been here with family today. Love this place! Recommend to survey on your ownto come here so you have more time. Don't trust any temporarily guides. Many guides tell you that you have free time and reasonable price. When you arrive location. They will ask for extra charge.
Nice watertown near Suzhou,"Tongli is pretty famous, so it gets its fair share of Chinese tourists. It's best to go on a weekday. We went on a beautiful Wednesday in March and were lucky that there weren't too many tourists around. We got a tour guide to take us around and with our size group it actually worked out cheaper since with a tour guide you only pay 40 rmb entrance fee. She took us to a couple of the main sights and a garden and told us a lot of interesting facts. Afterwards we walked along the canal and took a boat ride. The boat cost 90 rmb for 6 people. It only took like 10 minutes but was very nice. At the end there was a cormorant fisher and if you give him money he gets the birds to catch a couple of fish. I'm not a fan as it seems inhumane but other people paid him and we all got to see the demonstration. For lunch we went to the ancient Nanyuan tea house, which was worth it for the interesting old building alone. After lunch we sat on the small patio behind the tea house next to the canal and enjoyed the spring sunshine before we had to leave back to Suzhou. Altogether we spent about 5 hours in Tongli and everyone enjoyed themselves."
Water Town with Ancient Roots,"Ancient town backdated to 1000yr of history.. However, it gets touristy with time. Likes the architecture of the building..well preserved old town.."
Very interesting old city,"Like a lot of tourist destinations, Tongli had been restored, principally for tourism.  But, it is very interesting to walk the steets, and take a boat ride through the canals."
Fabulous little Water Town! Part of our 19 day tour!,"Initially I had some concerns about sending a significant amount of money to a company that was based in China and had no presence in the west, but these fears were completely unfounded.  Odyssey Tours were fabulous and our consultant  - Reinself Wei was exceptionally efficient, proactive and quick to respond to our every custom tour request!Tongli was one of my main reasons for visiting China.  I love the canals and hutongs and exploring them by boat - make sure you do a boat cruise here."
A must,Very close to Suzhou easy to Go work taxi great place but a bit too touristic due to many shops with souvenirs and they are quite costly so better only watch and buy somewhere else but a must to go through the old streets along the water good for 2 hours trip
Nice little historic town ,"Took a taxi from hotel which cost 75RMB from Suzhou. Very pretty even in the rain. Lots to see and the photo shops with costumes are a must! Boat ride was another way to see the town, which cost 90RMB for the boat. You can share the boat with others (6ppl max). Lots of cool little shops and food stalls. We got lost a few times, but that's the fun part."
Don't Miss It.  Stay a while.  Tour stop is too short.,Quaint little town.  Great shopping.  Good place to buy your silk comforters at 1/3 the price of the place on the tour.  Walk up and down little streets to see homes and shops.  Pretty lights at night.
Touristy but still nice,"The water town is similar to its counterpart in the other parts of suzhou and is fast becoming tourist hotspot. It is good for half a day, just walking through the small crowded streets or eating under the many tents that line the canals. I would recommend trying the finger food around the town rather than the cafes themselves.TIPS: try the ginger snack that can be found around the main square. And check out the cormorant (bird) fishing that is along one of the main canals. Be prepared for droves of tour buses, unless you are staying overnight. Taxi from hyatt suzhou to tonglin is RMB150, buggy into the main gate RMB5, ticket RMB100"
Authentic & charming water town,"Reaching this place was an adventure in itself, taking a train from Suzhou, an hour bus ride to Tongli and an electric cart to the city. Great place to walk around and explore. Not as crowded as you would expect. Tons of food options, I recommend you find a spot facing the canals and watch all the gondolas (?) go by. Check out a restaurant simply called ""Coffee"".. Very friendly, cleanest bathroom in possibly all of China and an awesome view. The garden was not very impressive when compared to the bigger ones in Suzhou."
A peaceful town,"it's really nice to visit Tongli when you avoid tourists, and it's so quite and peaceful when you walked into those small lanes and imagine how the residents used to live here in the past."
Day trip to Tongli from Suzhou,"About 45 minutes by car, just outside Suzhou, Tongli is a good day trip. You could see enough in about 4 or 5 hours if you don't mind a good walk. There are plenty of restaurants but mostly of mid range quality. It can be crowded during Chinese holidays so best go off-peak."
Wonderful old water village,This is definitely worth a side trip if you like old Chinese architecture and a glimpse of the past.  I would avoid weekends but Monday is a perfect time while things are still quite.  Just take aome time and wonder through the streets and aling the canals and I would recommend staying the night as the village has a very different feeling at night.
Water town that is changing,"Some parts were still as it were, many parts have changed. If one can accept modern life, shopping and entertainment in an ancient town, then it'll be a blast. If one was hoping for an ancient town that has retained its aura, be prepared to be dismayed. For me, it's a disappointment to say the least.Probably the Tuisi Garden offered some respite from the chaos outside and managed to get me to give this place an average score as a total package."
Fabulous water city and garden,"We had a great time walking around Tongli!  It was fun seeing the rickshaws, the shops were fun, food was great. The garden city was super fun to visit and so tranquil.  Got some fabulous pictures here!  The bridges and water ways were a lot of fun.If possible, going during the week.  The drive from Shanghai was super busy and we were stuck in a lot of gridlock with other locals driving out of town."
Great place to meander,We had a boat ride along the canals and also wandered along the alleyways. It is a pretty pocket of China away from the big cities and worth visiting and having a cup of tea in a traditional tea house.
Touristy water town,We made a quick afternoon visit to Tongli on a gray winter day. We were staying in Shanghai so we first took the train to Suzhou and then took the bus to Tongli. We had to reverse this journey as there do not seem to be buses directly to or from Shanghai. The entrance price to the tourist part of the town is steep (100 RMB) and allows you to enter an area full of shops and canal-side cafes. Before entering the tourist area we walked along a canal and stopped to talk to a lady washing large radishes in the canal thus giving us a taste of local life. Inside the tourist area we were almost the only tourists either Chinese or foreign. The entrance ticket allows the tourist to visit several historic sites within the tourist zone. We visited one old residence and that was enough.
Peaceful old town in Suzhou,"A quick visit ! Not so commercialize like other old town in China, still peaceful and good ! Some nice restaurant within this old town !"
Worth becoming a 'Gestalt',"Sitting alongside the canal at one of the many canalside restaurants, eating Hairy Crab (as it was the season for that: October) among other things, a few musicians passing by to play their instrument or sing their song, a restaurant owner that feels like: she wants to give you a good time - just a great feeling of peace and harmony. and at 21:00 hrs it all just stops!"
Water town,Great place to go and spend a day to get out of the city. There are many little shops and restaurants and everything is connected by water. Musts include taking a tour by boat and watching the birds catch fish
rustic and charming water town in the greater Shanghai area,"once you get past the first attractions and get off the beaten path, things settle down. it was a really nice place to visit. The old buildings, bridges and canals are all charming. they all have that rustic charm.lots of places to eat. hard to figure out which one is better than others. best for those who read Chinese."
So Different and Charming Compared to Shanghai,"A beautiful water city reminiscent of water cities from centuries ago.  This is one that has been persevered by the government for tourist/historic reasons.  There are three bridges form the center of this water town. Various gardens, shops, places to eat.  Delightful."
Pretty to visit but very much set up for the tourists.,"Tongli is one of the water towns near to Shanghai. When you arrive you park and get your ticket to get into the ""town"". That is the first indication that this visit is to tourist town. It's a bit like visiting Clovelly, very pretty and at one time it was a real village but now it's sole industry is organised tourism. The boat trip is charming and there are plenty of restaurants, however we decided not to bother with the restaurants when we saw the chefs aprons for one restaurant being washed in the canal. Quite fun as long as you are happy to spend the time getting there for a relatively short trip to a tourist destination."
Wonderful Water Village,"We choose this water village because it was a bit more off the beaten path. The tour included a stop at the Humble Administrator's Garden in Suzhou, which was lovely. We visited on a drizzly day just after the Golden Week national holiday and the village was almost deserted. The boat ride was very pleasant (as ridiculous as it might sound, it reminded me somewhat of San Antonio, with its narrow waterways, restaurants and shops lining the water and its touristy feel), stern-oared by a woman driver.The place was a bit of a drive from Shanghai, but we were happy with the result."
Nice watertown around Shanghai,"Tongli is a very nice water town around Shanghai (about 1h30 by car). The ticket includes all the entries of the park and mansions in the city. Don't forget to take the boat on the lake wich will bring you to a nice temple on the island,Note the Sex museum has been transfered to an other city. You can find a lot of local restaurant, meaning if you are a bit sensitive, I suggest you take a lunch pack."
A small historic Water Town in China,"Just an hour and a half from Shanghai by bus, Tongli is a well preserved historic village that was built on a canal approximately 1,000 years ago. The old white stucco 3 story houses with wooden trim with 49 bridges joining the seven islands is a great day trip from Shanghai (or 1/2 hour trip from Suzhou). Although several souvenir shops line the canal one does see a small bit of old China that is rapidly disappearing in the modern cities of China. It is called ""the Venice of Asia"" and you can enjoy a half hour canal trip. We felt 3 hours walking around the Watertown was more than adequate and thoroughly enjoyed the Retreat and Reflection Garden built by a retired official. Entry fee of 100 RMB allows you into the attractions of the town...the garden and residential homes etc. There are numerous restaurants and enjoyed a lovely lunch at the tea house restaurant."
Water Town,"Beautiful little town in the Suzhou Area. Very near Shanghai. The scenery is so idyllic and it feels like a perfect combination of old and new China. If you are nearby, must visit. Easy access by fast train to Suzhou from Hongqiao station in Shanghai(30min) and then a bus ride to Tongli.(1 hour) Great little cafes and restaurants, authentic crafts mixed with modern junky crafts. Stone paths and waterways. They call this the Venice of Asia."
Frequent Trips to Tongli Town,"I was staying in Tongli lake view hotel and there you find a historical tongli town just a walking distance away.It is a heaven for photographers, very good eateries. People are good. The town has an entry fee of 100 RMB. One can feel the traditional chinese cuture here. I was going here everyday after the working hours. After evening 5 PM there is no entry fees. If you are staying near the town and want to explore free of cost then this is the best time.However, you will not be able to see or get entry to any of the monumental attractions and the Chinese theoretical shows which all wind up by evening.You can cover the town by walk in one day spending enough time at various attractions,During weekend, you can see the Chinese people, especially girls and kids, wearing traditional dresses and taking pictures. There are a number of studios offering Chinese makeovers to girls and kids with as little as 10RMB.The shopping here is considerably cheaper than the shanghai. Here you find goods and savoniers much cheaper compared to Shanghai, Dont forget to buy silk dresses here,Knowing Little Chinese will help you in getting around, :)"
"Historic ""Water Town"", also named the ""Vevice of the East""","Located on the Yangtze River Delta, many villages and towns (Suzhou and Shanghai included) used the abundant water for irrigation and transportation. Thus many villages are built around a canal system. Tongli is one of these old cities located West from Shanghai, in Wujiang county, on the outskirts of Suzhou. It is known for a system of canals, it has been given the nickname ""Venice of the East"".This old city is half an hour away from Suzhou city and one and a half hour by bus from Shanghai. We visited it on 03 May.The place retains many of the features of an ancient Wu region town.There are 55 bridges in the town of Tongli. The most famous are the three bridges. They are Taiping, Jili, Changqing Bridges. They all represent blessing. When getting married, the birth of a child, celebrating birthday, people will walk across the three bridges to pray for the health and happiness.Very nice location, but, to be honest and in my opinion, very ""tourist"" oriented.Location and stones are ancient, but the place looks like all ""ecomuseum"" you can see in Europe, focused on the identity of a place, largely based on local participation and aiming to enhance the welfare and development of local communities.Local people do NOT live in TONGLI. They join the area every day for doing business, wearing traditional clothing.The positive point is that you may have an idea of the way people were living in the past. The bad point is that it is very touristic and business oriented. I have only visited TONGLI, but I am pretty sure that when you see one of these cities, you have visited all of them."
A nice change from the big cities,"Quaint and charming, a nice break from the big cities and crowds. We were there at sunset and enjoyed the atmosphere created by the reflections of the lanterns in the canals. Lots of opportunities to buy food or souvenirs and walking distance to the modern town with restaurants, a grocery store and a couple of bakeries."
Gorgeous ,"Really get in touch with Chinese traditional culture here and talk to the locals, lovely and heart warming. Very picturesque"
nice day trip from Shanghai,"Tongli is an easy day trip away from Shanghai and provides a nice contrast to the city life.  Tongli is a tiny water village with small alley ways, beautiful gardens and well-preserved houses.  The ticket includes entrance to all the gardens and houses and they are all worth it."
Charming but quiet,"Laid back charming part of history, an enclave of some peace and quiet among older buildings mixed with usual merchants selling everything u likely do not need.  quiet for a market area so enjoyable if u want a break from the big cities.The exploration of history interesting in buildings, so worth a stop if u have time."
A lovely place to wander around in peace,"Tonsil is known as the Venice of the East and whilst that might be an exaggeration it is a lovely canal town without lots of traffic.  There are many things to do in the town, several gardens to see and a couple of odd museums"
Small enclave representing the old China,"If it was in the hands of a French administrator would be a beauty! The enclave is nice, but not well kept and a bit dirty. It's getting crowded with restaurants and shops but of medium low quality. A boat ride on the channels is a must, like going with a Gondola in Venice, and is not to expensive. Few traditional tee houses remain.Don't go on Weekend it gets to crowded"
"Picturesque, pristine town near Suzhou","I love Tongli, particularly love watching its breathtaking, natural, quiet scenes and simple locals, interwoven with the rivers, lakes, stone bridges, and of course gardens with towers and hills, its present flowing from centuries ago. You would definitely have fun in Tongli if you were able to focus on the beautiful scenes at a relaxed, slow pace like the locals and not so much distracted by streams of tourists' groups led by their guides with microphones.Make sure you purchase your tickets online or at  the long-distance bus stations at a discount price in advance RATHER THAN buying them at Tongli. Also bring your photo ID with you if you're over sixty and ask for a senior price."
A traditional Chinese town,"Tongli is one of the most historical town to which i have ever been. Every step should you watch up because it may have been lain here  for 1000 years. There are lots of sweets like green dumplings, and some authentic delicious food like braised pork. The town is close to a Nature Park, it is only 20 mins to drive to the beautiful forest. They also have some pubs and bars."
Charming Town,"This is a quaint, little, cobble stoned town which is well worth a visit. The canal trip is beaut. The markets are interesting. There are some beaut little restaurants along the canal to have lunch and coffee and watch the boats go by.In the boats sit at the front for better views and photo opportunities."
A Pleasant but Underwhelming Town,"Situated on the floodplains of Southern Jiangsu, Tongli is one of several dozen old canal towns around the cities of Shanghai and Suzhou. Routinely featured in Chinese period dramas, it is very famous with locals. As a result, it tends to be flocked with tourists even midweek, and it is a true circus on weekends and public holidays.Tongli boasts a number of old mansions, gardens and courtyards, all of which can be visited on an inclusive ticket, which costs a steep 100 yuan. Apart from that you can wander along narrow canals which are crisscrossed here and there by humble stone bridges. Tourist gondolas float along them, carrying local tourists for a rather contrived experience. While the place retains a bit of period charm, little here dates back further than the late 19th century, making the claims of being an ancient city hyperbolic. The relentless commercialisation makes matters even worse. This is not one for the purists."
Old chinese canal town,Take a boat ride through the canals and see the scenery and the old tradiotional chinese houses. Very nice and relaxing
"Beautiful town, less crowded","I visited Tongli at the end of May 2105. I took bus from Suzhou long distance bus station (at the first floor upstairs where placed a special ticket booth to some tourism places) (fee from Suzhou to Tongli: 8 yuan). The bus was small and every seats was taken. The road was not really smooth, but it dues only around 45mns, so it was ok for me. At I arrived at Tongli bus station, I bought a ticket for the tourists information center (90 yuan) and a electric cart ticket (5 yuan) to the ancient town. The weather in May was quite good, not too hot, made me enjoyed my trip much better.From my point of view, Tongli is very beautiful in its way. I also visited Zhouzhang before, to me, Tongli is not as beautiful as Zhouzhang but it’s less crowded so much better for one who love to find some quiet moments and take nice pictures without too many uninvited actors/actresses . If you avoid the main routes, you can find many quiet corners with many interesting things to form a gorgeous album. Must visit places would be Tuisi garden and Pearl Tower. These 2 places are actually not really different from other ancient gardens in China – especially around Suzhou/Shanghai/Hangzhou areas, but if you come to Tongli, you should not miss them. A boat trip in Tongli is also nice, the fee is 90 yuan/boat, but if you go in group or you can find someone to share, you can have a nice boating trip with cheaper price (about 15 yuan, since a boat can carry 6 passengers). When I was there, there were trees all over the place which form a very nice shadow along the canals so the boat trip was really great, though quite short : )). Chongbeng house is also nice, though as I came there, some of the displays war under renovating.Lastly, if you intend to come back within the day, and you cannot move your feet after a long walking day, I suggest to return to the gate before 5pm, buy an electric cart ticket of 5 yuan to get back to the bus station. You also need to pay attention on times, since last bus to Suzhou is 9:30pm."
Interesting visit outside of Shanghai,There are several water towns and they make a very pleasant day trip from Shanghai. You can ride in the canals and view the buildings and bridges from the water. The buildings are charming. The local fish is very tasty and some very interesting artwork is available.
Very pretty old canal town,"We spent a lunchtime and afternoon in Tongli and really enjoyed the experience.  We had an excellent lunch at the Nan Yuan tea house and then enjoyed a walking tour of the town.  Not only was the place picturesque but you also get to see local business and life taking place on the streets and canal side.  Although it is very touristy there was no pressure from sales people and the range of souvenirs was not bad.  I think we were also lucky as there were not that many other tourists around as we visited on a Tuesday.  It was the one of the few places on our tour that was relaxed and chilled out - making a nice contrast with the busier highlights of the trip.  The scenery on the walking tour was fabulous - the canal, the bridges and the gardens (particularly the garden of retreat and reflection).  Well worth a visit and it does live up to the Venice of the East billing"
One of the most noteworthy water towns.,"Tongli, a town in Wujiang county, is over 1000 years old and has only recently been converted into a tourist attraction. The town has stone bridges and well-preserved ancient architecture, including private gardens, temples and houses. In ancient times, it was a favorite place for poets, painters, Confucian scholars and government officials. There are still many well-preserved buildings from the Ming and Qing Dynasties. The town still has many of the features of an ancient Wu region town. it has been given the nickname ""Venice of the East” by some overly exuberant advertising copywriter.    Located on the eastern shore of Taihu Lake, it is just 18 kilometers (11 miles) from Suzhou City. Taihu Lake is famous because of the weird porous stone masses recovered from the lake bed and used everywhere as natural decorative sculptures.    The 49 stone bridges, in a variety of styles, join the seven islands created by fifteen rivers and five lakes upon which Tongli stands. Each bridge has a poetic name. The most notables are Peace and Tranquility (Taiping) Bridge, Luck (Jili) Bridge and Lasting Celebration (Changqing) Bridge. These are known as Ternate Bridges as they cross three rivers at their confluence and form a natural ring road. Ternate Bridges are propitious symbols in the eyes of the local residents, who walk over them for good luck during weddings or birthday parties. Which we also did to ensure that we too will partake of any good luck floating around. The major part of the traffic is by boat, and tourists tend to start their visit by taking in a pleasure boat tour to get a relaxed overview of the town. There are many waterways and the main streets are, as can be expected, quite touristy with bars, restaurants, coffee houses, food shops, and tourist shops selling handicrafts, souvenirs, useful and useless trinkets. There is a shop, where you can be dressed and made up as a member of the Imperial Court, so you can walk in town with style.An interesting show is the scow with cormorants, with a rope around one of their legs attached to the boat.     For a fee the fisherman will drop the birds in the water, where they will dive to catch fish. But there is a ring around their neck just where the neck meets the body, and larger fish will get stuck there in their gullet.    The fisherman pulls the bird back on the scow and he then massages its neck upward, in that process disgorging the fish out of the bird. You can see in the picture the fish the man has just “caught”. An easy way to catch fish!   A notable attraction is the beautiful Retreat & Reflection Garden, once a private garden owned by Ren Lansheng. It was built in 1885-1887 during the Qing dynasty and it has been recognized with other classical Suzhou gardens as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Its other name is Tuisi Gardens, which means “resign and reflection,”    Ren Lansheng was an imperial officer of the third grade (which was pretty high), who was impeached and removed by the emperor after 30 years of service. So he went back to Suzhou where he built his residence with a beautiful adjoining garden. Here he was to retire and to reminisce about his military service. He was said to have spent 500,000 Liang (about 500 kg of silver) on the construction. From the name he gave the garden it was clear he was still loyal to the throne. But in less than one year after the garden was completed, he was summoned back by the emperor, who needed him for a special assignment. On this tour of duty he accidentally fell from his horse, fractured his hip, and died a few months later. He was only in his fifties, and he did not enjoy his garden very long. He was definitely not very lucky. http://travelswithhok.com/Water_Towns_and_Gardens_in_China/Entries/2015/3/16_II__Tongli_Water_Town_and_Tuisi_Garden.html"
Ancient Canal town- Venice of Suzhou,"Amazing ancient town of Tongli located about an hour 'interesting to see the city outer burbs and industrial areas' drive from Suzhou city center. This place is geared up for the visitor to be entertained by historic buildings & gardens, shops and food set in a maze of alleys crossing canals by old bridges and canals filled with old chinese wooden gondalas. A great experience with lots to see and do and eat. Extremely busy on weekends & public holidays but worth it."
Relax,"Without people I might have scored with 5 stars, unfortunately it wasn't. But it is something we cannot miss, to compare it to Venice is do much pretentious!"
Worth to visit around Shanghai,"Aprx one hour of driving to Tong-Li.It is really a small town similar image of Venice but very Chinese way town. First image was a smellie old Chinese Town. But when I ride a woman rowing boat and follow along the narrow water road, the scenic of peaceful town touch my heart. People actually living in the town sharing one bathroom with several families without change for a long long period. I do not recommend eating there, however sitting in cafe and enjoying the peace of few moment with espresso is not bad idea.I wnet there with private tour so I cannot give detailed price how much they charge for the boat ride but make sure have that boat ride chance.it was a memorable moment."
An enjoyable afternoon at Tongli Old Town.,"In Tongli old town, we visited residences from years gone by, with beautiful gardens & rockery.  There are a lot of interesting eateries & shops in every nook & cranny that you come across.  Although the people there don't speak English, there are very friendly.  We concluded the visit to ""old town"" with an enjoyable &  peaceful canal ride around it."
Venice of China,"Very wonderful small water town.  This is a typical place mostly for local people but very interesting to have tourists here from other part of the world.   Lots of old shops and local tiny restaurants and also if you want to experience of living in old part China, spend a night there.  They offer motel for about RMB 60 per night and you can experience their local foods which you can't have it in different part of China,  The down  side is all signs are in Chinese.  You either need to have a friend who can speak and read their language or else can't experience this.  Very unique in a way and also very beautiful.  One of the popular local food is the rounded sort of like a prata or naan with some stuff inside.  Talked to the local saying that it is a must if you come to this town.  They make is right in front of you and so fresh and delicious,  you also can do some town seeing by boating on canal.  Love this water town"
Good when you work out how to use the tickets,"Tongli is an interesting place, but we could have benefited from better guidance on how tickets work. Only a few places to eat with any English on the menu.  After 2 hours strolling,  you repeat yourself. Boat trips available but a bit of a procession. In every place, the vast proportion of tourists are Chinese, but easy to differentiate from the locals mainly by their attire, particularly the young who dress mainly Western.For a no vehicle town it was very noisy. Full of mopeds honking horn every few seconds.  People talking loudly from  before 6am. Every sound heard through gaps in Windows. Avoid public holidays as it is heaving. Need guidance on use of tickets to enter the various halls and garden attractions. Names often different on ticket to the signposts. At entry point, no English name to tell you which hall or garden it is. Plenty of toilets but no paper."
Do Not Miss This Gorgeous Old Town!,"From an unforgettable gondola ride down the narrow canal, to the rustic shops, this water town is not to be missed! Be warned, the locals sometimes do not want their photo taken without permission - be respectful. Look for the man with the cormorants on his boat - I paid a small amount to hole one on a pole and the lady on tour with me got to hold one of the birds on her hand! Amazing! A great place to wander for a couple hours for sure!"
Wonderful canal town,If you are in the Shanghai then try to visit Tongli. It is a wonderful old town criss-crossed by canals and located around 20 miles from Suzhou (which itself is only 30 minutes on the bullet train from Shanghai).
A town worth visiting,"It is a beautiful town along several canals.  It has retained its classical charm and it feels like you are walking around in the past.  There are many interesting shops and restaurants there; but we weren't there during lunch time, so we missed out.  We had to take a shuttle into the town, since cars are not allowed to drive through town."
A great place to visit in China,"One of the most memorable places I have visited in China (and I am going there every year since 20 years). A couple of practical information:1. Best transportation is from Suzhou railway station. Buses depart from the North side of the station, so take the ""North"" exit.It takes 1h to reach Tongli by bus and 45min. by taxi (we got a ride for 130 yuans). If you travel by bus, at the Tongli bus station you will get an electric cart (5Y) to bring you to the historical center. Otherwise walk about 35min.2. Entry fee is Y100 and it's definitely worth it - it opens you access to many historical sites. If you spend the night in Tongli, you get a 20% discount. The guard allowed my wife to get in the town and bring the hotel helper, who arranged for the discount.3. We spent 2 nights there. It was just right.4. Avoid weekends if possible, but if not it's still worth it.5. Try their specialties, such as the local version of carnitas.6. Ask for a map at the main square visitor center.7. Speak Chinese or travel with someone, who does."
watery town,"there is so many ancient water town around Zhejiang provience. You might find these water towns are almost the same, but they are not. Like Tongli town, it has it's own story, a beautiful lady was in love with a poor scholor, but been rejected by her rich snobbish parents. Finally the man got a high rank in the capital city and return Tongli to marry the lady. happy ending, always. in Tongli, you can watch a majestic show in the museum, Chinese style. you can also catch a boat to Luoxinzhou Island and ring a bell to make wishes."
"Cute gondola ride through ""Chinese Venice""",We visited Tongli on the way back to Shanghai from Suzhou.  Was a lovely little town.  The gondola ride was pleasant.  It was raining so they had the boats covered with rain blocks which was much appreciate.
Nice preserved water town,About 1.5 hrs drive from Pudong. The old water town is well preserved and clean.I was a little afraid to visit this 1000 years old water town on a Sunday but to my surprise it was not crowded and on top not to commercialized (yet).
Worth visiting,"Went for a day trip while we were staying in Suzhou. Was really nice to see a different side of China- it is so different to many areas in Suzhou, Shanghai and Beijing. There is a lot to do- we went on a boat ride on the canal which was really pleasant. Worth a visit"
Not Venice but still worth seeing if you are close by,"We were only in  Suzhou  a few days so we ended up having to choose between Tongli and the Grand Canal in Suzhou. After much deliberation and reading we chose to take a short day trip to Tongli. It was about a 45 minute drive (18 kilometers or so)  from our hotel in ancient town Suzhou give or take.  Granted it is not as grand and spectacular as Venice, but it is still a good option and sort of a poor man's Venice, so to speak, to use a poor analogy. This is understandable, as it doesn't have the massive Imperial history that Venice has. Venice was a country and Empire of a grand scale with great wealth, so they could make the city look spectacular.  But Tongli is a picturesque Chinese canal town.  I was and I am glad we chose to go to Tongli. I guess we picked a good day, as it did not seem that crowded. We were able to walk around unobstructed by large crowds, and enjoy observing local people living their daily lives on the canals. We stopped in a nice little coffee shop right on one of the canals and had a nice refreshment and visit with our guide. (We hired a guide to drive us there for about 600 RMB). I took lots of pictures but I have to admit of the three major historical bridges I don't know which is which even after doing research on the Internet. But regardless, they are still interesting and picturesque. Historical and architectural features are as follows: well preserved town with 1000 year history, 49 stone bridges (Tongli is called a town of bridges), built on 7 islands intersected by 15 canals,  arched roofs, lofty gables, stone bridges and green willows lining the banks, steps to the canals for the locals to wash their clothes, and pans, as well as get on boats easily. Three most notable bridges are Taiping (Peace and Tranquility) Bridge, Jili (Luck) Bridge and Changqing (Lasting Celebration) Bridge, collectively known as Ternate Bridges and are fortunate symbols in the eyes of the local residents and they walk over them for good luck during weddings or birthday parties.The oldest bridge in Tongli is Siben (Reflecting Origin) Bridge, which was built in the Song Dynasty (960-1279).For a detailed description and my major source of information, please see http://www.china.org.cn/english/travel/97638.htm"
A Stroll into History,"Tongli was one of three water towns I visited from Shanghai, the others being Suzhou and Zhouzhuang.  It was easily the quietest, most atmospheric, and enjoyable.   I took a local bus, a small adventure in itself, from Suzhou, and Tongli is well worth the trip.  Come during the week if you can, when it's less crowded.  Pay the small fee, get a map, and just stroll.  The waterways and bridges are well preserved, the shops are numerous and the souvenirs what they are.  Take some tea, eat some lunch, and just soak in the day.  Hop on a gondola and listen to the gondoleer sing.  Congratulations and welcome to the Song dynasty (ca. 11th C. AD)!"
"Tongli ""Venice in the east""","Tongli is water town with 49 stone bridges in i variety of styles whitch were build in Song and Qing Dynasty. Originaly named Futu, was renamed as Tongli in the first year of the Tang Dynasty. Tongli lies from  Suzhou city 18 km. Featured many bridges and running waters, delicate private gardens, architecture and so embroidery crafts, antique shops, you will have a commanding view of beauty of water village.  We conducted a ride down the river, visited the Tuisi Garden and walk in the scenic town."
"less comercialised, quite enjoyable.","Despite having a history of more than one thousand years, this water-town is well preserved and organised. The locals still stay in this town and seems like they integrate well with the tourists. Suggestion：visit Tuisiyuan (Tuisi Garden) first before visiting Zhenzhuta (Pearl Tower). It's better to have a tour guide to explain the different structures so that you can have a better understanding of these places."
One of Our Favourite Stops in China,"We stopped at Tongli for lunch and for some free time on our Nexus tour of China.  This was a lovely place to visit.  It was peaceful, historic and quite interesting.  There were a number of nice, small shops to purchase local goods or tourist items and the prices were fairly reasonable.  We took a ride on a Chinese gondola - highly recommended.  At about $16 Canadian, we could have taken 8 people but just had the two of us and our guide; still a great deal for a 20 minute ride.This is a 1,000 year-old water town built around canals and largely left untouched by recent events.  The town looks much like it did a thousand years ago and is maintained that way."
Enjoyable Tongli,"It took over two hours bus ride from Shanghai but Tongli was well worth it.  I was surprised that they charged an entrance fee to go into the village ... CNY 100.  Once inside, it reminded me of scenes from traditional Chinese paintings with arched bridges, canals, gondolas, cobbled stone walkways, tile-roofed houses, etc.  The whole place is really beautiful, just like 1,000 years old and doesn't reflect on any improvisation.  The gondola ride was enjoyable and is a nice way to orientate yourself before your walk around the water village.  The Tuisi garden is one of the highlights with ponds, pavilions, rockeries, and terraces.  We saw a couple of wedding photo sessions along the canals, numerous restaurants and shops, and there was a cormorant/osprey fishing skill show as well at the three bridges scenic spot.  More surprisingly, we saw a couple of well groomed, well behaved dogs in the area ... a Poodle and a Labrador Retriever !!"
Cute town,"Travelled by train to Suzhou, met our guide, looked around the old town and were then driven to Tongli. Lovely water town, far better than Suzhou. Wander along the streets and take a boat on the waterway. For a few yuan the boatman will sing chinese folk songs for you.One thing that I did like was lovely artist there. Go over the stone bridge at the entrance to Tongli. Travel about 50 metres and then you will need to turn right. On your left is a little shop where there is a man selling art work. Some monochrome and some in colour. He is a charming man. I wished we had had more time to spend there. We bought a picture about one metre by 50cm for about £10. For another £5 we could have had the frame but I did not see how I could get it on the plane. At the end on that street on the right was a tea shop."
A daytrip from Shanghai,Took a couple of hours to get there by rapid train and bus via Suzhou and the same back to Shanghai. Well worth the visit. For me this was a China highlight. I would definitely recommend a visit.
A worthwhile visit,"Tongli is a 1,000 year old water town built around canals and has largely been preserved to reflect the ancient ways of living. As in Suzhou, when homes need refurbishing, they maintain the 'look' of ancient homes. The actual town plan has not changed much and is still that of a thousand years ago. Surrounding the ancient town are the tourism areas. Local delicacy is pig's trotter coated in soy sauce and chewed as a snack.The homes often have a business downstairs and a home above, often with the same basic facilities that have existed for many years. We very much enjoyed just wandering around and taking hundreds of photos. Yes, it is touristy but it truly is worth a look just to observe life as it was lived in previous centuries."
Water town by Suzhou,"A busy and touristy water/canal town in China - one of many visited while here. It was worth the trip as there are the traditional structures, canals, boat people and small ally ways however most things were trinkety, touristy and of course - costly. Good weather for Suzhou, the day was clear and made the experience better as overall - much was the same as the other canal towns. Cobbled roads, cheesy trinket shops, people everywhere, food outlets crammed onto canals, overpriced shops and new 'old' Chinese structures. You have to park some distance away (and pay for that), then either catch the small shuttle train (at a price) and get driven to a drop-off near the town gate or walk. Then you buy an entry ticket!! We did buy our fireworks there - so I thought it was worth the visit!!!!!"
The Venice of the East,"Yes you have to pay to tour this town, but it's not the only town I found in China that I had to do the very same thing, (so that's not a turn off).  There is no way I would have been able to see this slice of life with out touring this 1000 year old area just on the outskirts of Suzhou.  When people travel, no matter were you go, Italy or China, one has to look though eyes of wonder and not as critical traveler, or why not just buy a documentary and save yourself the money and loss of sleep traveling to a country that has a time zone 15 hours ahead of what one is used to. I found I could not stop taking pictures, (of which I will pour through and delete probably half, or more of them in order to make our picture book on line) and everywhere I looked there was an touching moment. You see, this is (in spite of what people think)  home for these people and after the tourists go home, they have their real lives to tend to, just like any other city, (wash their clothes, cook their meals and tend to their children). They hate having their pictures taken, like they are in some fish bowl or something.Old community's are like old furniture, they have a patina and that is part of what I gravitated to."
Slightly disappointing,Accommodates to tourists but not particularly impressive! Be careful of the numerous motorbikes/bikes that 'share' the path with people.
It is a tourist trap,"I do not get so many people giving Tongli such a great review.  I expected Venice of the east.   What you have is an admission charge to get into Tongli town so you can walk through and area which is one shop after another selling trinkets.    Even in the canal area, there is shop after shop selling this stuff which takes away from any ambience.   It was not worth taking the trip from Shanghai to visit."
Less Crowded Water Town,"This is a good choice if you want to visit a typical water town.  It is less developed than touristy Zhouzhuang, but not completely dead.  It's a bit closer to Suzhou than Shanghai.  The entry price is a bit steep as are most tourist destinations in China at 100rmb, but this allows you to also visit 5-6 famous halls and homes of officials in the ancient times.  These are very impressive.You could spend the whole day and have drinks along the canals.  Great tourist shopping if that is your thing and it will leave you a real nice impression of old China.Highly recommended if you are near the Suzhou area."
Old Chinese classic water town very beautiful,"Very beautiful old classic Chinese by water town, it is really beautiful. But surrand with many tourest, many stores inside the town. do not go on hot summer, the food waste smells bad, but recommand to tour in spring, late fall and winter."
One of the 6 preserved old town South of Yangtze River...,"It takes about 2 hours drive from Shanghai over without traffic. What is different in this old town, one must see its: One Garden(退思园), Two old houses(嘉荫堂,崇本堂), and three bridges(太平桥、吉利桥和长庆桥). Like the other 5 preserved old town, there is a man made river running through the old town. Along the river, there are many places one can just sit down and order food.  It is the ideal place to rest and have a lunch of the local delicacy. Buy the ticket from the entrance building and do not confused by the local pretended not licensed tour guide.  Visit the garden 1st, then walk along the river to visit other attractions or follow the recommended route from the front door."
Picturesque Town,"This is the second watertown that I have visited since arriving to China (the first one being Zhujiajiao) and it is quite different. Tongli is much larger than I thought with attractions spread out throughout the town. The gardens in Tongli were beautiful and since I decided to go there on the hottest day this summer, the place was really quiet and peaceful. Luckily for us, there were quite a few coffee shops around the area (not as many as Zhujiajiao) so we were able to escape the heat after visiting each attraction. We bought our tickets from the bus station which I do not recommend. At first we thought it was more convenient but after arriving at Tongli, we realized that tourists who purchased their tickets at the entrance had prettier tickets (with colour and pictures) whereas our was a simple white ticket stub with fine print on the back. (The friend I went to Tongli with was working on a scrapbook of her travels in china...needless to say, she didn't bother adding the Tongli ticket stub to her book)Oh and just a heads up for those of you who are traveling to Tongli by bus, the bus station is GROSS. The place smelled like urine and there were puddles everywhere in the station! So my friend and I decided to wait outside instead. The worst part was that our bus was delayed so we had to line up in the tiny, stinky, humid and cramped station for half an hour before we could board the bus."
Something different in China,"I really liked this city, charming, romantic, beautiful, you need a hole day to see all the attractions in details, you can have nice pictures there, it is easy to get there by bus, but go to the station at 2nd floor you can buy the bus ticket and the city entrance ticket, don't buy with people selling tour package at the street of the station."
