You will be Amused at this park..,Wonderla has awesome rides  and water parks... It has many option for refreshments.. it has locker and shower facilities...Must visit for a day load of FUN...
Fun experience,"Enjoyed being there, loved boomerang and harakiri the most. Had been there in February. Their staff is very polite and helpful, I had misplaced my glares and they helped me find it"
An Indian amusement park with international standard rides,"On the last day of my trip to Bangalore with my family, we all went to Wondela as I  promised this to my daughter (11yrs old) earlier. We went in with normal tickets .But we able to got in maximum rides as there was not much rush on that day.All the rides were very good and can compare with any other international amusement parks. Some of the rides were very much child friendly, which my kids enjoyed a lot.Then we moved to water park there.We all enjoyed there and also took all the rides too.Then we took food in different restaurants inside the park. They were very much clean and the food were hygienic. Overall an great day spent at Wonderla with my family."
Birthday Surprise for my Fiance!!!,I visited Wonderla on 19/11/2019... My fiance is always excited about this amazing place & he had visited here many times but still he loves to come here... So I booked the tickets online & surprised him on his birthday... I'm glad I did that... Online booking was so easy.... Friendly & polite staff... Wide variety of Food & other shops... I feel the photos are little expensive to buy so we could buy only few which was beautiful .. Thanking the whole team for making our day special..
amazing  experience,This is  one of the most fun place to visit with friends and family. One of the most enjoyable park. Go only when weather is good.
Wonderla Visit,It's been three months since I've visited wonderla amusement park...I reached there with lot of enthusiasm but what did it bring to me? Now in the month of May I observed some unusual growths on my fingers and Toes.... Consulted dermatologistAnd I acquired HPV a viral infection... Disgusting isn't it?Yes... Though the water is coordinated or something still these possibilities? Yes I remember I got a cut on my toes in the water pool..I was bleeding... And there you go... that's where the things went wrong... I've been victimised to this HPV ...The  group of people please check the water quality... Though it is reverse osmosed or chlorinated.....We pay you so much and we get diseases...This must be reviewed soon as possible
Good one,This is one of the most enjoyable parks available on karnataka. Everyone who visit this place can enjoy delightfully.
fun place,GO with family or friends to have fun. Prefer a weekday if possible to avoid the crowd and enjoy properly.
adventure park,"a good day getaway adventure park with rides from water and other rides , has good rides and you can also enjoy wave pool also"
Best place to create beautiful and thrilling memories ,"Although crowded, the rides are truly worth the wait and excitement! Bonds family together. Food in the restaurant is very good as well. If you do not like waiting for too long Tuesday is the best day of the week to plan your trip to wonderla"
Games,It's gud & ok. Water games are fine.. except more games & food is worth for money. If we go as a gang it'll be gud to enjoy.
About Park,The park name says its wonderful. thank you wonderla we love it. And the best place for have a fun with friends and family.
Wonder trip,"It was a great experience today we enjoyed lot in wonderl@,it was spot for friends families.really enjoyed lot"
Fun day out with family & kids,"Excellent park..Overall very clean and the staff is also very helpfulWent on a weekday - the crowds are lesser. However, they close some of the water park activities when the crowds are lesser which may not be ideal...Food items / locker system etc. are quite nice and reasonable.overall , excellent experience..will visit again"
Wonderla a wonderful experience,"First of all we boarded a Volvo wonderla bus from majestic it costs 120 per person and then when we reached wonderla we presented the ticket and got 15% off on our ticket and the locker costs 280 100 rs is refundable when you return the watch. Water rides are fun watch out for wave pool it's cool you can enjoy with your partner too. Every rides are thrilling, a totally wonderful experience"
Fun with friends,It was not my first trip to wonderla..it is my favourite place here in bangalore..i have been there for like 5-6 times in 6 years..i love the water rides there..specially the wave pool..it is my favourite..
Discount may have been offered,I pulled out 11 of my friends to WonderLa and I was expecting a upgrade to fast-track for all of us.
Good,This amusement park is simply amazing and teenagers and children are definitely going to like it. I will like to give it full marks.
Nice ,The best place to visit during the weekend with family. Which helps to keep a way the stress especially for the employees and joyful place for children's
Long waiting hours for each ride. Could not play most of the rides. MUST EXTEND PLAY TIME BY MIN 3 HOURS,Long waiting hours for each ride. Could not play most of the rides. MUST EXTEND PLAY TIME BY MIN 3 HOURS
All day heavy crowd,Wonderla is crowded place but can be enjoyable for a day activity. There would be long queue to get in any rides that irritates. There is fast track option to get inside any rides by passing general queue which I don‚Äôt like. I would prefer occasionally but not always. Swimming pool with waves is best option to spend time if somebody wants to avoid long queue for rides.
Ferfect place,"Wonderla,banglore is one of of Indias best water park. Nice time spent. Thanks wonderla for giving this best experience"
Best place to enjoy ,"Many amusement park rides and water rides, Water fall , giant wheel, roller coaster thrilling Ride and many more things have enjoyed food is also good."
Best rides and good place for kids,The kids will really enjoy..The place has many rides and amusement park is easy to reach..Best picnic spot..
Nice,Good place everyone should visit at least once.. here family couples and kids everyone can enjoy here
Food quality & crowded,Food quality was not upto the mark.. and too much costly.. too much crowded. Couldn't play all the games in single day. Tickets are not affordable for common people.
Wonderla is wonderful,"Wave pool was good, big slides named branded kraits is also good. Food was also ok. Overall I must say wonderla is wonderfull"
Amazing wonderland ,This  place I frequently vist yearly once or twice and it amuses every time and the place is good and it's well maintained. You have both land and water games. The nice place to visit during summer
Wonderla trip,"Went to a trip with my office mates, Great place, good dry rides are available, had good fun time there.üòÄüòä"
Family visit,Some of your rides looks unsafe as requested the following safety measures to ensure the security of customer level to be upgraded. For example your roller coster and mixers. And your water rides also not having proper equipment as expected. Rather than that nice ambience and only the qauility for food which been served on restaurant also on average.
Too good to enjoy with your friends and family,"The rides are really good and unique. More fun Everytime. Well maintained too. Compared to other amusement parks, this one is the best."
Wonderla experience,Rooler coster was not working. Please increase the time of wonderla park also reduce the price itvseems to be little high . Run wonderla bus service from main road to wonderla
One day trip,It is wonderful.. We enjoyed a lot.. But we felt little in waiting for every ride.. The games are really awesome.. üòç
Good Experience,"Everything was good. One point to bring notice is that in games que, people jump on bars and don't follow any rules in coming in que's. So please keep some strong security boys to maintain it"
Good Experience,Unable to complete all the expected rides as there was huge crowd. Do manage crowd.Eventhough we went early we have to wait atleast 30minuts on average for most of ride.
Valentine's Day offer,"ExcellentVery helpful, supporting, drop us on main road .best arrangements of candle night dinner they treat us special guest .I hope  we come again  to meet you all.üòäüòéüëçüëçüëçüëç"
About expirience,"Most of the games are closed, so it was too boring.  I dont wish to come again.  Not worth for what amout paid."
Extraordinary water park,This is the extraordinary and amazing water park. The best possible way to enjoy. Every aspect will be thrilling and all the rides are joyful. Wonderla is a perfect mix of joy and water. Gee! Love the way they treat all the people and food is well served. Please don't expect more as it is a normal amusement park and can a small enjoyable one atleast.
Wonderla,wow Amassing place to visit enjoyed to core... very good infra & well organised  very good place to spend time my  4 years kid  enjoyed well
Wonderla,Fun moment on starting on wards ist new experience for us and water is fanastatic wonderla is best for cleanliness
Standards maintained,"I have been here multiple times over the last 2 decades and I can vouch for the fact that this park has maintained good standards over the years. The food is good and there is a huge variety of rides catering to different age groups. If trying every ride is on your agenda then get there as soon as the park opens and don't repeat rides. It gets very crowded in peak season, so fasttrack tickets help somewhat, but I have noticed not all rides follow the separate line for fasttrack. Staff are very helpful."
Study tour,"Excellent,it was nice time to spent in wanderla with my boys...it was awesome n nice place to visit in bangalora"
Majhi,"Nice place , enjoy a lot , but lack of time , i would like to go again for which i missed out , visited in 1st jan 2020"
"Wonderful games, enjoyed lot but not completed all games","Excellent all games, enjoyed lot, lot of funs, this is our 1st times visited and nice guiding & i love water games"
Fun but gets you thinking,Nice water park. Spacious. However the quality of the water is questionable!!The tower ride was superb. Some of the staff very helpful. Some indifferent. Drive from Bangalore to Wonderla was very nice. Made a pit stop for some local breakfast.
The best place you can ever visit is this in Bangalore,If you miss this place then there is nothing that you have visited. This is one of the best amusement parks ever visited till date
No cotton in water rides...,Staff will tell you to buy cloths from store which means promotion of there business.... I don't remember one the name of ride... automatic lock was loose....apart from this 4* out of 5.
AIG,It was a good experience. Everything was good. Only improvement area is food quality and option. Thanks
Awesome fast track service *****,Awesome fast track service always good serviceFood good Security is give the good respect Thanks you
Fastrack Ticket No Use,After getting fastrack ticket you will still have to wait the won't allow all the soon you go. Most of the rides are in maintains.
Nice experience,This was my second trip to wonderla. As usual it's awesome. Water game are awesome. Worth to enjoy a day.
A day with daughter & grandchildren,"As seniors we just enjoyed the company of kids, but my grandchildren enjoyed a lot. This is my 2nd visit with them. I love to watch them play & enjoy."
Good Entertainment for the whole family.,Good Entertainment for the whole family.An entire day can be spent enjoying all the rides.  You have a ride for every age group..Prices are a bit on the higher side.
A day at wonderla,Wonderla is a great amusement park providing entertainment for the whole family. There are multiple dry and wet rides. The entire famly enjoyed the wave pool.
Amazing place,"It was fun and specially for kids, however u need two days to cover the entire park. Overall it was really nice"
"Was an awesome experience, but the price for photoshoot was damn high","Was an awesome experience, but the price for photoshoot was damn high.The safety guy took pics in his camera and told to collect at main entrance bt the price was shocking"
Full fun,Awesome rides n tides. Spent every minute to cover up rides as much as possible but still few left. Had full fun. Well maintained place too.
Awesome time with family,Loved the whole time spent with the family at the resort and amusement park.Would refer everyone to visit at least once..
great place to visit,Thrill and wonder !!! The Overall wonderful place to visit but staff could be little kinder and gentle during water rides !!
What a childlike thrill and happiness,"We enjoyed so much! Every single ride and slide was absolutely amazing. The wave pool was brilliant. They had nice timings for kids, couples and ladies separate from gents, which was really nice on their part. Thinking of making our visits a monthly thing."
A day out,I have visited so many times but this was my best..... I love the staff ppl they were so friendly and helpful to everyone.... ‚ò∫
Excellent Park to Enjoy the Water Rids,"I visited the Wonderla last week on 15th JAN and it was very good, but some of the Kids rides were not opened because of less people were there and there is a rule that they are following , minimum 6 people should be there for a ride. Hence I will not suggest visiting     kids rides between 2-4PM as most of the people will be in Swimming pools and nobody will be available at these rides. If you are 2+2 also it will be a disadvantage to Enjoy Couple Water Rides until you have your kids are big to enjoy themselves. Waves Pool will not be there all the Hours in a day and it will operate 30mins for every 1 Hour. I enjoyed 2 times 30mins from 1.40PM and again 30mins from 2.40PM. Bottom Line is-If you want to play , all Water Rides then only you should Visit the Wonderla else, no Use of it. Kids food they will allow but for Elders we should buy in their restaurants where there pure Veg. Restaurant also available,"
It was awesome,All rides are sooo good ...we enjoyed soo much .In recoil rides ..we enjoyed soo much that was Awesome experience
No proper management... Watergames only available from 2.30 pm only...,No proper management... Watergames only available from 2.30 pm only...  No proper maintenance... Waste of my money...
Ms Akansha,It was wonderful experience in wonderla seriously!!!! I Will visit here again with friends and family .....
First time @Wonderla,Good one. If u r @Bangalore and you want to spend a day a good one just visit wonderLa. Away from city life and nice & adventurous
Great place for a group hangout,The water park is not that great but the amusement park is just too good with a lot of rides you cant complete in a day. The food options are good but overly crowded. Overall this is a must visit for a group of people.
Best Place with Family,Kids will love the rides. We had a very good time. Safety measures are upto the mark. We visited on November 2019.
Wonderla,Wonderla is always the best place for those thrill seekers...I love wonderla..Water games and high thrill rides are superb...
Best time we had with our team,We went as a group of 14 people and this is our third visit to wonderla. In Bangalore it is our first visit and is best among the rest of the parks. We had great fun and the memories will be there for long. Over all great and thrilling experience.
WOnderful,Surely not a 1 day trip to enjoy all the rides. You need to visit 2 times to experience all the rides. All the rides are so exciting specially the water rides. We missed out to some of the rides bcz of the time constraint hopefully will enjoy next time.Great place to visit with your family and friends.
Good experience overall,all rides are very good. We visited on 31st so there was an evening parade show as well which was good. Magician show was also very good.My family enjoyed water park rides more than dry park rides.And laser and fountain show was the best. I personally enjoyed it.Few suggestions:Spend more time in water park.dinner quality need improvement.Rest overall experience was very good. we enjoyed a lot.
It is great,Very good and enjoyed a lotDry rides and water rides both are available and very good also proper sanity and security maintained
Good Place with Family,its a good place for have fun with family and kids but the kids and water rides are limited if they increase these types rides for kids that will be awesome
Very dissopointed,Taking too much time for each and every ride.giving priority to fast track ticketsUnfortunately we don't know about this option.even they didn't explain about that advantage.
"Very good ,must try.",It is a very good place for friends family and for an adventure lover friendly place 1 Mas truly try this place and it is just amazing it has all kinds of rice which with water write
Nagaraju,Good keep continue the same we enjoyed a lot with all land rides and especially water rides. We spent the time very happily and hope wil meet u again in soon
Weekend in Wonderla,Wonderful experience.Paro is very nearly maintained. Staff are extremely helpful and always greet the visitors with a smile. Must visit
Awesome,"But the incharge persons can be much more kind...3D Ride movie is excellent. Good entertainment for the whole day. We came on Christmas season, all the extra events are cool."
DELIGHTFUL DAY,"Enjoyed all water rides. Request to provide extra wave rides, reduce speed of roller coaster, more RO purified drinking water facilities, additional dress changing rooms."
Wonder experience ! Took me back to school,"A great outdoor picnic for people of every age and groups of different types.I went with my best friend till being in some nostalgia and feel like school kid again.We didn‚Äôt take most of the land rides as they felt similar while water rides were ready interesting and fun.Land rides could be made more interesting.Roller coster recoil is the highlight of the park and is really a must.The staff is pleasant and opting for the fast track tickets is must if yu can it saves hell lot of time.We travelled by cab which was easily available but a better and cheaper alternative would eb to use bmtc volvo buses.Overall its a smooth experience with lovely staff.Every staff member is helpful and cheerful.Food options are plenty but only decent mot great.Park is well maintained and easy to access.I would love more innovative rides and better food options.Overall, if yu r in bangalore looking for what to do - head to wonderla (on fast track tickets preferably) and you won‚Äôt regret it!Have fun!"
"Great rides, water pool fab, reasonable priced food!","Great rides, water pool fab, reasonable priced food! must must visit. great attention to safety. fabulous park."
Lab for testing adrenaline drugs.,"All right let's do this. So, you heard about Wonderla Banglore and wanna go because you love rides and all. But, at the same time you're confused if this amusement park is good or not. Worth your time and money or not?It abso-freakin-lutely is. Simple as that.For the seekers of thrill this place is like a lab testing its newest adrenaline drug.We all know how much of a colossal pain in the neck waiting is, so take it from me, please get the FAST TRACK TICKET. It is worth your money. You'd think that many people will get that and ultimately rush there too so I'll just get the normal one and stay in queues for a while. Don't. Now, a huge round of applause for the crew of Wonderla. They have the solution to your every problem. And, they are hands down the most humble crew I've seen.I wish you have a nice trip. Toodles."
Good experience,Good experience lot of enjoyment given by wonder la but food is full costly not worth of money please take care wonder la manegent
Excellent experience,It was really excellent experience along with family. Pls visit during the weekdays to avoid the crowds. Worth visiting.
"It proved, its a woolala wonderla","Wow its a mind blowing, ultimate , superb, fantastic, power booster place. What a time i had here today. Would like to thank wonderla administration for such a fantastic process and arrangements. Food was superb. after having the lunch we thought it will be heavy n we wont be able to make other activities but it never let us to feel that n we ve became even more active after it. Quality n quantity both been taken care so good.  Keep it guys n will be returning soon for another great hospitality. Thank you :)"
Overall good place,Veg restaurants were all shut down. That was terrible. But otherwise people are helpful. The place has good parking and the rides are quite well designed.
Holiday of 2019,Great day filled will fun and enjoyment. A different kind of enjoyment. Great outdoor activities. Just awesome.
Very good nature and enjoyed games,Cleanliness of area and water hygiene to be ensure wash room and lockers area to be maintain properly.
3d adventure not there,"worst food for combo package with entrance ticket and dinners, resorts dont provide proper food for buffet they have separate food counter for 700 rupees buffet and combo dinner buffet.dont prefer this. Except above two the helper crew is very comfortable and help full.for each game they are helpful and suggested for next game."
WonderLa,Very nice and clean place. Staffs are very humble. Rides are safe and are well maintained. Procession which was arranged for Christmas celebration was a treat. Kids and we all enjoyed well.
Trip to Wonderla,"It is one of the most happening place in Bangalore. I visited the place with my wife and 2 kids on 24th Dec 2019. The  ticket was expensive. Around 1400 for adults and around 1200 for kids. After that,  we paid 180 rs for one locker. The rides were awesome. We enjoyed the whole day. My request to wonderla management to keep the ticket price within 1000 rs and locker charges not more than 50 rs.ThanksSohan"
Holidays,"Well Managed n Maintained Park.Great Ambience,Crowd Management is Great,Variety of Plays.Very helpful Staff.Wash rooms n Change rooms r clean,"
Nhhhi,Nice place to enjoy water rides are good one time visit place.one suggestion dont give too much importance for fast track people who will be waiting will get upset so just asap give equal importance thankyou good enjoyed lot
Great to be for wonderful enjoyment,"The best resort one can go for enjoyment in Bangalore. All dry rides and wet rides, just enjoy it.The service and the behaviour of the staffs are very nice and humble. With family or friends you will definitely enjoy it."
Awesome experience.. take a day off and is must visit,Awesome experience with various rides and a must visit place in Bangalore. Family or couple it's a place for all.
Good,Parking was osm locker is good facility but the price was to much high and food is good i was liked much music dance
Awesome place to relax and thrilling moments,Really nice place for family trip. Had a enjoyable and unforgettable moments . Staffs are so humble and i would recommend my friends and relatives to visit wonderla atleast once.
Wonderla Experience,Overall was ok.FastTrack ticket was not worth. They say will allow 25% of the members from fasttrack but they allow only 2 or 3 in a fasttrack entry.
Hassan,Super and amazaning Games. Really good expiereance.  I enjoyed lot in dry games. Its on memoriable day for me and my friends
Awesome experience,"Nice staff behaviour, friendly and helping nature staff , nice service by wanderla team , Christmas view is awesome, this is my 2nd visit and this time I found heater near water activities area, which was really helpful in winter to enjoy the water activity."
Wondrla review,Nice experience but costlyIn that food and locker price is too much my rating for this food and locker 2out of 5But entry fee is nice and it worth
Recoil and insanity were insane!,We were a group of 4 knowing each other since the beginning of this decade. I would say wonderla provided us the best experience to end this decade along with the friends i got in the beginning. The best of all the rides as per my experience were recoil and insanity!
One of the best Amusement parks in India,"Express pass: The express pass is available for a small premium. Go for it if budget is not a concern as there can be long queues, especially at the water rides.Amenities: Ample parking space, Restaurants inside, lockers on rent and ezpay wristbands to pay for stuff inside the park when you dont want to carry cash around the place.Rides: The rides are greta and are suitable for kids and adults. There is a lazy river, temperature-controlled wave pool and lots of slides in the water rides area. There is a rollercoaster as well.Safety: There are well trained staff members and the rides are well maintained. Overall a great place to spend a day with friends and family."
Very Cooperative Staff,I am a different abled person using crutches as my walking aid and it was one of my dream to have a roller coaster ride. I know its a personal call considering the physical condition and will power. But in the end and by the support of the staff I was able to complete few high thrill rides.They first provide me a wheel chair assistance and a guide to assist me. Furthermore the person who was assisting me make sure that I first decide if I am comfortable to take the ride or not. Which is appreciable.This is one of my good moments which I will cherish in my life and all this possible because of their co operative staff.
Nice,A lot of things are available into the wonderla so am very interested in rides experience so insane I visit to next time
Ooo la la wonder la,Kick ass place... Been there with friends..the more the merrier...  just awesome place... I wish they extend their timings a bit... No point having all those lightings if they close by 6 PM
Awesome experience with friends,What to write on this. It's just fabulous to play by becoming a small child over here. A place which allows us to forget what we gng through daily crisis things and lets you enjoy irrespective you want normal rides or the water ones. I explored almost 70% of the rides from both the areas and that has an unforgettable memory of that day in my mind.
Adventures rides for fun !!!,"Hey guys, its really nice place to have blast and more over if u like difficult and different rides, this one is best place. Have fun !!!"
Visit,Rides are good and thrilling(both land and water). Food and other items that you buy inside are very expensive.
Great rides but long queues,Each and every ride was thrilling in their own way and didn't ever fail to entertain but the queues were too long especially in a ride like rollercoaster which consumes an hour to complete the ride makes it difficult to experience all the rides within the park
Best in Bangalore ,"Not the biggest wonderla (compared to other locations ), but definitely best in Bangalore. Bit far from city centre."
Thrill and Fun filled park,One of the best amusement park where it is filed with full of fun and thrill rides. With friends this would become an added trip for a day.
Fun dayout,I visited wonderla in April that is during summer and it was the day spent well..It's fun to go around with friends and who can manage thriller rides..there are in total 10 thriller rides..My fav Outta them is insanity and Equinox..then we have water slides and rain dance too..We have to be there by 11:30 so that we can enjoy all the rides..and there is a proper lunch and snacks facilities provided..no outside food is allowed..
Wonderla Bangalore,"Hi there,There are lot of rides, even though on weekdays there is lot of wait time management should think of better way to manage the queues, all the time is spent in the lines for rides, Fastrack is an expensive affair for a group to enjoy."
A thrill ride lovers paradise,"If you love thrill rides, this is a must visit. The food options are pretty terrible, but the rides are so good, that you will forget to eat!"
Amazing wonderla!!,"Best place to fun with family and friends,lots of rides,pools for adults and kids, plan to visit during weekdays to avoid rush.very Well maintenance and friendly staff to remember safety procedures during rides."
AMazing Experience,"Awesome Amazing parkBad experience with Restaurant and Free bus.water riders are good ,as well land ride"
Unclean and unorganized,"Pool is very dirty, and also the dry rides and water rides organizer,crew are not helpful and rude. The mgmt has not done anything great to streamline the crowd. It's getting worse than before all they c is money by charging double the ticket price for fasttrack entry and remaining are not valued.Probably wonderla shld visit Sentosa island in Singapore and learn from them. Nothing but just money minded ppl run wonderla no cleanliness staff also is not trained water is unclean you will fall sick. Lockers are both men and women. Whr men misbehave with women and no one is bothered when u hv pool for women and men separate then lockers also should be separate."
My experience in wonderla ‚ù§,The  most  amazing and awesome amusement park ever seen everytime I visit feels like  visiting  again this  place ‚ù§‚ù§üî•
Food charges and quality,"Had booked food as well along advance tickets booking but the food served, treated by restaurant was not justified the amount charged."
Excellent!,"It was my first trip to amusement park by myself and I loved it! The rides are good, distributed evenly for all age groups from low thrill to super high thrill and also at a very decent price. My advice would be to take a fast pass so that you won‚Äôt waste time in the queues. The only small downside was the commute to park. The only transport buses to the park on weekdays are only from Majestic and knowing Bangalore getting to majestic from Outer Ring Road itself takes a lot of time! But all in all it‚Äôs a fun place to get away from monotonous life and have a gala time!"
.,It was an awesome experience. We covered almost all rides especially water rides. Water wave ride was the best.food quality was good.
Better than Disneyland,This is the third time i visited wonderla and it is getting better year by year. It has added more games for kids.
"It was great enjoyment whole day and fun filled and my baby and wife is so happy, I suggest to everyone visit in a 
Life",Only we are not aware of easy charge otherwise we would have food and lot other items anyhow while going out we got information from one of your staff thanks
Wonderland wondela,This place is always amazing every year I visit this place and its amuses with different watergames and I liked the way they have maintained.wow place to visit with deadbolt and friends
Awesome,"Everything is good, I had visited manty times, comparatively the crowd is increasing so better start the park earlier like atleast by 10.Thanks,Nanda"
Wonder place,"Superb place for one day enjoyment,bit crowd was more very long queues,if that can be shout off would be wonder place üëçüèª"
good,nice place to enjoy                food price is to high but no teasty                      weugfwqeybckqwhbfiuwdgcouhxu2heduiewhf78yfewufiiyf98hdjkcbjhh78CSACIHKJWEBFIGD89VY                                                                                               .
Excellent weekend getaway option!,"Wonderla is wonderfully managed and gets the basics of amusement park entertainment right! From the rides to the management to the cleanliness of the facilities, had nothing to complain about. The only possible area of improvement would be the clarity of instructions especially for the riskier rides (like Drop Pool). The lifeguards should be stricter about posture related instructions which would minimize chances of injury."
As The Name Suggests,"This is a place of wonder for people of all ages, and we went with our whole family after a long time. Wonderla is a combination of a Water Rides park and other massive number of rides that await you if you are a roller coaster enthusiastic person. I had my bit share of fun whereas kids just loved it. Food isn't that great, but they do serve a massive crowd during High volume seasons with a nice smile on their faces.Highly recommendable place to visit in Bengaluru."
Had Worst experience in wondrala.,Some Staff behaviors is the worst.No proper response.We are visiting second time to wondrala.Mostly this is the last time we will not come again.Due to few staff behaviors.And many thief's were there we have to be careful.
A happy team outing at Wonderla,We went for a team outing and had a really good experience. It has both land and water rides that were enjoyed by the team. Interstellar was an amazing experience.
Wonderla,An amazing place to realx and enjoy.its not too rush when we have gone .but little bit upset about the flash tower its not been much exicted than i seen it long back
Worst place,Worst place to visit..there s no enjoyment at all...land games are too scary....Food is very unhealthy..u ppl r .only money making people
Visit with family,"We were a group of 4 adults with 3 children. Everyone enjoyed the rides, sometimes taking multiple turns on rides (went on a weekday).The staff is very friendly and helpful.Would definitely recommend for people visiting Bangalore with family and friends."
Once in a lifetime fun,It was once in a lifetime fun for us..the rides expecially the roler coaster was amazing and even the wet rides gave me a wonderful experience
1 day Wonder la trip,"Excellent place with all amenities. Friendly staff. The only think is about the dry rides, which cannot be done once you are wet. We have to finish the dry rides first & then go to the water games. The Virtual reality movie timings are a bit confusing & we were not let in because our dresses were wet."
THE RIDES WEREN‚ÄôT SAFE. THE BELT CAME OFF DURING ONE OF THE RIDES. EMPLOYEES ARE VERY CARELESS AND THEY DON‚ÄôT CARE,The rides were not safe. The belt came off during one of the rides. It is complete reckless. EMPLOYEES ARE VERY CARELESS AND THEY DON‚ÄôT CARE
Love to visit Wonderla Again,"I just love everytime I Visit Wonderla. Each time i plan to enjoy all the rides inside the park but doesnt complete it due to my improper plan. LOL:) In the last 3 years, we have visited more than 10 times. And never get bored of the amusement here at Wonderla. Sure will catch all the amazing experience again..."
Family time at wonderla,Had lots of fun at wonderla.nice facilities at the Bangalore resort and great fun games at the park will visit again..
Swimming,Actually what was we think that was not there because there was our think of above and there very very nice place
Good Enough,We stayed there for a night. The food and room everything was good enough for the money we spent.Only problem was that there were some noisy neighbors were making noise in the corridor late at night and early in the morning so we could not sleep properly. So the doors or whatever in the rooms need to be improved to resist outside noise entering the room for a peaceful stay of the guests.
Awesome and thrilling experience,All the rides are pretty good and decent.Water rides and pool all are well maintained and clean. Staff behavior is very kind. It is worth spending a day in wonderla.
Some suggestions,"Water game staffs are very crude. Tel them we paid and came not free of cost. Other than everything good (especially canteen staff, all rides, Security, cleaning,)"
Excellent amusement park ,Visit this place on a sunny day üåû not on a rainy day. U don't need to worry about your money as u have the ezpay which allows u to pay from the watch u can put money in the watch and play unlimitedly. U can also buy lunch on their website and they serve excellent food.
Excellent,It was an Excellent. We enjoyed a lot. Specially my 4 years old daughter enjoyed lot in all Kid rides. All the staff were very polite. we also apprciate food quality and reasonable at mrp.
Not Worth It,I visited here on 29oct2019 and the we was 8 members and each ticket cost me about Rs. 1600/- including all taxes and trust me its not worth it cause the day we went its not a festive season its just the normal day and i said them that we don't want the amusement rides we just came to have some water rides thats it but they said you'll have to pay for complete rides which is there in the Wonderla..... And i found there is so much of garbage and some insect in the water and yes we didn't took the amusement rides apart from water rides but still we charged for that and then they will make you fool inside stating rent a locker from us which is cost 150bucks and the locker change room area is very unhygienic... Quite disappointed experience.
Wonderful and Thrilling!,A must visit place for adventure lovers! No other place like this from high Thrilling rides to exciting water Rides!...Locker system is very good and safe.
Weekend visit,Nice place to visit at Weekend for employees and great place to visit for all type of people like family and friends
Wonderla ride,Everything was good.... but I felt rolla coaster is a bit unsafe.. more safety measures need to upgraded.... kindly consider....
Really enjoyed the time in Wonderla with my kids,It was a awesome experience with my kids enjoying the most. I was not expecting this much varieties of rides for kid of 4 years old. Really enjoyed all the time spent.
Dr KUMAR ,Wonderful place to chill out with family.Well maintained and clean with good  and courteous attendants.
Fun Experience,"Though its spread across a huge area, with dry & water rides however its location was a bit on downside for me as we had travelled from EC-1, another concern is that its the only famous amusement park i have heard of so far in entire city. Rain dance & eating joints were attractive- fully enjoyed with friends."
Always been the best experience,This is my second visit to wonderla. Awesome experience as always. My niece enjoyed this time as well as my family.
Wonderla,"Very nice place to enjoy with your family,friends,spouse.The dry rides are adrenaline rush giving,while the water rides were relaxing.Must visit during holidays.At the end you will definitely cherish some memorable memories.And do look for laser and fountain show at the end of the day."
Feedback,More for age group of 20 to 30Could increase for 40 and aboveTimings could be from 9 am startCould be more water games
Rude wet games staff,Wet games staffs are treating customers like Devils. Please select the workers seeing from their backgrounds. Make sure they are not from slums
REGARDING WAVE POOL,Ridiculously crowded place with poor attention to safety. Its a water park¬†where everyone is fully dressed. Anyone wearing proper swimwear is stared at and ends up looking like a sore thumb.¬†¬†Worst....Very bad experience. .poor security ..poor maintenance of swings..negligence of staff.on report to staff they start fighting with us.than apologies.¬†¬†Need to take strike action they don't have humanity. I DON'T KNOW THAT SECURITY NAME
Good experience,Really a Good experience and value for money. I really enjoyed. Stuff is outstanding and very helpful.
Best üëçüíØ,100% worth the time to enjoy‚ù§ Must visit the time with friends are the best place to experience the thrill the rides water pools thrill rides are just wow üòç
Excellent,Good. But price is sky rocketing. They need to increase the timings from 11 AM to 9 AM. Further print out is not working when we booked tickets online. All rides are crowded.
Enjoyed whole day.,Entire day was fun at wonderla. Nice to spend time with family with lots of fun and thril rides. Enjoyed.
Fun with Friends,"I had a great time with my friends,enjoyed a lot. This place is very clean and well maintained. One should definitely take the Recoil. It was breath taking.Make sure you carry synthetic cloths, they will not allow otherwise to the water park, options are there in the park also."
Amazing day outing with family,"It was great fun as we visited during dasara holidays...Park decorations n lighting, park ambience was awesome..... its well maintained with safety and hygiene  aspects... we had a great day, kids enjoyed a lot..."
loving,this is so good to hear from you soon and I love this place so much for your time and consideration and I will
Wonderful Day outing experience,"We were 9 of us on a family outing and we couldn't have chosen a better place. The place is safe, clean, friendly and the rides are super thrilling. I was impressed with the way they have maintained the place and arena. Praise worthy. Their unwavering commitment to safety is impressive. Some the rides to look out for are1. The giant wheel on the clock tower2. The 360 degree rotation chair3. The wave pool4. The village lagoon. Overall a fun experience that cant missed with the family."
Nandan K N,Nice superb Iam excited and Iam going to visit wonderla again my friends and me were eagerly waiting for an opportunity to visit
Great fun place to spend a day ,"Having visited multiple times theme parks in Chennai, this one is definitely better but much costly than the ones here. Maybe here they need to raise little bit to have better maintenance and new rides. Rides seems to be fresh and not looking old.The recoil was a great centre piece of fun for youth and old also but big crowd as always. Paying fasttrack is an option but then the ticket price goes for a toss.Had food in Chillies and it was good lunch.Definitely worth visiting once."
Great place for kids,"The amusement park is quite big and requires a day for visiting it properly, A must place to bring kids."
Wonder-FUL-la !!,A great two days package trip with 2 night resort stay and 2 day park entry. The days we visited were not very crowded. The queues were less. Fast track is not needed on a less crowded day. Check before you get the fastsrack. You can use their eZ pay band and keep the belongings in the locker. The resort is kind of star categories. Park is clean nice. The rides are great. Young child less than 85 cm height can‚Äôt access many rides because of safety reasons.
Wonderla Visit,It is a very good place since the start of the park!! They have maintained the same standard since the beginning.Best place to hangout with any age group!Keep it up..
Outdated but Fun,"Wonderla Amusement Park looks like a fully equiped amusement park, but the rides are quite outdated and slow for modern western standards. We were visiting on a sunday and bought fast track tickets, which wouldnt have been needed. It costs double the price, and mostly we had to wait until they startup the machine. Nevertheless the water slides are quute fun and the fairy wheel provides good view. If you dont expect to much you surely spend a great day. Make sure yiu check out the rain disco. You will feel like in a bollywood movie üòÑ"
Wonderful place,"Wow.. Really excellent place, we can play here with our friends and family, we can swim we can play all kind of we had very good time with my friends"
Fun team outing amazing,"The place is amazing, water parks and all the amusement rides are very thrilling. The whole day team outing was amazing. Must visit."
A good amusement park,It's a good amusement park but it's not as big as imagica. The activities are just adequate enough that you can be done with every single one of them by the end of the day. Still a great way to spend sometime with your family and friends.
Good,"Wonderla amusement park, just few hours time pass , good for families , enjoy and relax few hours, superb"
Great water park,The wonderla amusement park is a must visit for kids and couples located on the mysore raod. It is quite busy on sundays though.
Full day Enjoyment,"I visited this place on 10th May 19. It's Friday a working day but there is a huge rush may be due to summer vacation starts. There are a lot of rides, Dry as well as wet rides. Try to go as soon as possible to enjoy maximum rides. Please avoid cotton dress for wet rides and brought synthetic dress for the same. Dress are also available at shops at wonder la.Gents are also allowed with synthetic shorts. lockers are available to keep your items. Water bottles are allowed and also available at different places. Some rides are restricted for kids. If you visit in same age group you can enjoy maximum but for family with kids has to compromise with some rides. Overall nice place to enjoy. If you see rush please purchase fast track tickets to get less waiting time and more enjoyment."
Pushpak team get-together!,It was a great experience at the wonderla resorts and amusement park!Great package and service offered by Mr Murugan.Really good quality and variety of food arranged.Mr Murugan arranged the best setup for 50+ members in a very short time.Great place and can spend the whole day peacefully will friends and family as well!We were one of the first team to use the volley ball court! It was great experience!
Must visit,One must visit this place if you need real enjoyment in bengaluru. Its ultimate to visit. Its amusing.
A little above average,So many fantastic rides are there but to navigate you they will give you paper map. Also water is so much infected that kids and sometimes adults too gets sick after water rides. But overall average place to visit.
sona,Worst experieance.i never recomend any one to visit this place.i never recomended any one to visit this place.
Nice place to spend weekend,"Nice place and crowded on most of the days, One can spend an entire day at this place and enjoy many rides."
Thrilled experience,All rides are daring and scary. The amusement park is really big. Over all I had a good experience. But it's waste for kids and elder ones who don't wish to play.
Best Amusement & Water Park,Good destination for adventure and thrillGood maintained ridesGood food optionsNice getaway for family
Big one,This amusement park is really very big. But plan in weekdays because it won't be too crowdy and the fares are less on weekdays
Mainak Bhowmick,"Its an awesome experience at wonderla, all the rides are superb, if you need to do some enjoyment please visit here with your friends best place to hang out, and even its neat and clean..."
Its Really Wonderla!!!,Very nice and enjoyable park with lots of thrilling and water park. Its difficult to cover all the thing within a day.
Great place to hangout with family amd friends.,"It was good to spend quality time with friends, enjoyed few activities like swimming pool, wave pool etc. They have food with good tastes to offer."
Must Visit,"Its a must visit place. Its well maintained, the service staff are polite and helpful. Neat and clean and not much crowd (maybe because we went in the midst of monsoons). Enjoyed all the rides and pools."
Wow,It was a first experience with friends to a amusement park and it was really fun. The rides were good and also they have good water rides. It caters to all age group. Food also was good. They have this express pass which gives you the liberty to skip long waiting queues. Decently priced and well maintained. Overall good experience
Was pleasently surprised,"I visited the park on Aug4 a sunday, and was expecting the worst in terms of crowds.. but was pleasently surprised  that the crowd was quite small, and my kids and I had a great time. I have visited other parks in the US, and those are all so much more crowded. maybe I just got lucky on a non-crowdy day..The rides are divided into water rides and dry rides. The water rides are all good fun and it seems most of the crowd goes there.however the dry rides are either way too extreme or just too tame.. It looks like most people just try it once, and then come out nauseas and shaken, and then realize it is not really enjoyable, and dont go again. Whereas on the water rides, we repeated many of them.It would have been nice to have a roller coaster that balanced the thrill of riding to midly provoking your fear."
Good,Wonderla  amusement is a water related activity and we enjoyed a lot with water games but it is little costly
Great time with friends,"Everything was excellent. The ambiance food, facilities & service was very good. I recommend this place to others"
Wonderla,This is one of the best amusement parks in Karnataka and you can bring your kids also. The roller coaster ride is very awesome and the pools are also maintained clean. There are many restaurant that serve good food inside but they are little bit costly the rain disco is amazing.
Wonderla wonder's,"Awesome experience and had lots of fun. Food is nice, hygienic place for food, not much expensive. You can get snacks at around 400 each. I mean good snacks.Talking about games, I will prefer to get the FAST TRACK option at the time of booking. IT WILL save you lot of time and you can have much fun.RECOIL WAS awesome and thrilling."
Fab place to revive yourself,"I had visited this place with my friends and colleagues. If you are adventurous, this is an awesome place to be. The rides are just super thrilling and then there is a section for water slides and water theme play area. Waterpark has a huge buildup area and has clean facilities for changing and bathing areas. They provide locker facilities too. One can buy swim costumes at a reasonable rate from the inside stores. If you are planning to go on a weekend, do prefer to buy a fast track pass, else you will end up waiting in the long queue. Food court has decent food quality and taste at reasonable price. A must goto place, if you are in bangalore for couple of days. The pleasant weather acts like a cherry on the cake. Torally loved the experience. Drawback/ Things to take care: If you coming by cab,then getting a cab back to town could be an issue. Do make arrangements before hand when planning to visit this place. We had asked the same cabdriver by which we came. to pick us in evening. We paid a little extra  to him but it saved us from pain to search for the cab in that area."
Epic enjoyment trips,I would probably say that the wonderla has many branches but I would probably say that it's  best here
Nice park,"Basically a water park. Bring your nylon clothes if possible. They enforce this requirement very strictly (fortunately). Otherwise can be purchased from the park (limited options available). Lockers are available.Some staff are friendly and try to give you positive experience, but most dont.We went on a Saturday, purchased fast track tickets. They have a system of 25% for fast track holders - which is not very useful if the queue is small (3 from the normal ticket queue gets a chance, then 1 from the fast track queue). Couple of times, we went for the normal queue which was faster.Quite green place with a lot of trees, however expected more -considering the location to be in Bangalore.Need more sign boards /maps at various locations inside the park.Took Uber to reach the park, had to take a taxi on the way back (Uber taxis were not available nearby). Public buses were available, but not sure about the departure timings.Food options were OK.Segway ride is available (extra charges apply)"
"Best amusement park, only problem is the crowd","Great rides. The park is big enough that it is difficult to cover all the rides .The best part is that water and amusement rides can be enjoyed with the same ticket , the price of which is very reasonable. I am saying this after comparison with Imagica, situated near Mumbai and Pune, where there is sepeearr entry for amusement and water , which makes it very costly.The fast track ticket is the best option if you want to beat the crowds. ,and believe me it is very crowded. So if you are willing to shell out a few extra bucks , go with the Fastrack option"
Fun Safe And A Great Way To Spend A Day With Family And Friends,"Went with my brother's family and my son.... Reached there in the afternoon... Still had a very good time. All rides seemed to be well maintained and the staff/ operators were very helpful... It was not a busy day, so that helped too...Enough rides for kids and toddlers too. However, the food outlets that we visited didn't seem to have any attractive options for kids... May be the management can look into that as that will help the parents a lot more.However they provided us with a pram for my son and that helped us a lot.... The photos were too expensive... They should give it for less... I am sure that they can still make a lot of money considering the number of people visiting...Toilets were clean... but can be cleaner... They have a resort too...When I called to check on the rates, it seemed tooooooo expensive... you do not need that to have a great time..I had visited the the Wonderla at Cochin long time back .. when it was Vega Land and this visit brought back fond memories..All the people were cheerful and very helpful...So a good place to go to have a fun time..Balu"
Best amusement park in India,"Wonderland is one of the best amusement park. Its not only for the kids it‚Äôs for all the agers. They have both games water and land games.people can enjoy any of the games. Highly recommend place to family, friends to enjoy over weekend."
Wonderla is a wonder,I suggest you everyone take care first enjoy unlimited I want to visit next month I hope it's really enjoy with my family my daughter is very happy
One of my best visit recent days ,It one of the beautiful memorable place for me especially the Bangalore branch is completely different
The roller coaster is thrilling if you are wiling to go for it,"This is  good place for kids to spend an entire day, there are many rides to choose from based on personal choice. Among the more relaxed options are the water sections, wave pool, giant wheel. You can rent clothes for the water rides, pool etc. There are only two concerns is the big rush/queue for the rides on weekend specifically in the first half of the day. Some of ride durations have been reduced so the thrill factor is reduced to an extent. The food choices have improved from my previous visits."
Why right hijabs not allowed?,I understand loose garments aren‚Äôt allowed for security reasons. Why not hijabs whith no loose ends and tightly stick to the head. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to blindly. It allowing all hijabs. I don‚Äôt get any reasonable reasons why this park denies this .i don‚Äôt see how this different than warring any dresses :-)
Wonderla- Indeed a wonder,"I have been to several amusement parks across the country & multiple times in few of them. Wonderla is one of the most amazing of the lot. It is not only very popular among the children & the youth but is a full family package. It has variety of rides & pools that are similar to most of the amusement parks throughout the country but some rides like RECOIL & DROP ZONE make it a class apart then the others. It is a good place to spend your day with the family away from Bengaluru's usual noisy environment. The food,the lockers & the management staff make it worth a rating of 5 STARS."
An Amazing place,"It was my second visit , still I had the excitement as I had during my first visit. Awesome experience this time.Could feel the quality of maintenance  everywhere. Water at wavepool, and other water games were clean and fresh. Had visited several Amusement parks in South India, but this is one of the best. Food quality has to be improved (but never spoiled stomach). Will be nice if they increase the timing may be from 10am to 6pm"
Amazing and Unforgettable Visit !,"I Have Been to Wonderla with my Friends. Without No Doubt. It's a must visit Place. I'm Sure you'll Bang All Day. It's An excellent Amusement Park with very good facilities. Helpful Crew out There, Good locker Facilities, Fresh Drinking water and Toilets at All Major Places. Many options of Food are Available and You can even Prebook them. The rides are Maintained Well. The water park is So Thrill out there it's Damn Good. Breathtaking Rides. Enjoyed with my Friends so Dammn Good. The Virtual Reality show of Adventures of chikku was also Amazing. I would Definitely this to everyone For a Visit !"
Very good and adventurous to spend full day there,Very good and adventurous to spend full day there. Enjoyed rides and water ganes. Be there at 11 and enjoy till evening 6 or 7
Office trip,We were very happy as a corporate employee having fun in the park we visit every year  we see something different on every visit...
Wonderla wonderful time,Had an wonderful time in this place with full family friends for the full day. The food the water games the crowd everything was perfect
Very crowded ,We visited in may 2019.The facilities are great but changing area is unhygienic. Very crowded on given days. The food available is also not good. Much hype place but mostly for youngsters.
Wonderla a must visit place..,i was not at all interested to visit this place..but just visited with family once coz of their likes..later it became the place visited to be again..what a place it is...... superb and fantastic place for all age kinds...but we should have dareness to face all types of games...all games are just superb..its worth playing once...may be more....
Good but too much,"Good place, have lot of activities to do.But have cons like,Too much people than the capacity.Too much rush for any ride.Will be hosted to get into a ride as it takes 15-20 mins for a ride. The biggest waiting period was 50mins to 1 hourHighly priced.Locker system will be availed by everyone which should be basically included in the huge ticket price.No outside food is allowed Less water in  poolBiggest problem is the staff behaviour is totally bad and disrespectful. They need ID proof for everyone as I have booked tickets online and my tickets was seperate for everyone. This is unacceptable when I go with my family for the activities. These cons are the positive side of the competitors available in Bangalore.Best thing is Wave pool which rush but still waves are high and big.Rollercoaster also is supperb."
Engaged with peoples every time.,The wonderla banagalore is very good amusement park with more than 100 rides.and this is having more rides than the wonderla cochin.good for spending time with family and friends.
Wonder time memories,"This is the place where any one can enjoy Amusement park with roller coasters, a ferris wheel & water rides, plus virtual reality experiences you can make some memories when you dance in rain setup and thunder waves"
Divine visit according to our young man,Our 8 year old is totally in love with Wonderla. His equation is Bangalore means going to Wonderla.Roller coaster and most important is the water rides..Getting him out of the park is a hopeless job. Thankfully there s an excellent bus service from there to MG Road..On weekend s it's impossible to get a cab.
"Perfect to have fun with friends, family and kids",I have been going to wonder la since 2006. It's an amazing park with thrill rides and one of the best water park in India.I went there after 8 years and love to see lot of changes. Place is still maintained. Thrill rides and roller coaster is a must try. Water in the pool is very clean. My kids had and me had a great fun. There are many rides for children who are below 5 years also. So it's a perfect place for all age group.Due to its popularity it's crowded even on the weekdays. So I would like to suggest you take a fast track ticket. It is expensive but it will save a lot of time. In a normal ticket u have to wait for min half and hour for any dry or wet ride. So if u are going there but fast track tickets because there are so many rides u can't cover if u waste time standing in queue.Must visit place.
International standards,"An excellent amusement park with very good facilities. Helpful staff, good locker facilities, drinking water and toilets in many places. Many options to eat are available and you can even prebook them. The rides are maintained well. The water park is also good. Thrilling rides. Enjoyed with my son and hubby. The VR show of adventurous of chikku was also good"
Wedding Anniversary Celebration,"With wide varieties of rides in a close proximity, you don't wanna walk a long but enjoy the fun.. Locker facility is good. Excess fare during holidays are the only issue. Fastrack tickets costs you ‚Çπ2,100/- for an adult and ‚Çπ. 1,900/- for a child which is too high to spend"
Best place for day outing,"This is very good amusement park. But I feel cost is very high. Cost has been increased from last year and it is now around 1500 INR. Unfortunately couple of  rides are not working. I hope those rides will be functional soon. Restaurants are good and we have other food options like Five start chicken, Pizzas and rolls etc.. Wonderla has rechargeable plastic bands where you can fill some amount and use it at all food points. We can ware these bands even in pools and water rides. No need to carry cash or cards along with you. Only thing which I don't like at wonderla is Photos. They take snaps without your knowledge or permission. I feel this is against law. If we want those photos, we have to pay 220 INR per copy. Here they show some marketing skills. They click multiple photos at single ride point and they will advise us to take all photos in soft copy for 960 INR, max of 50 photos will be there in one soft copy. Out of these 50 photos, probably only 3 or 4 photos will be good. Please note soft copy means, we have to download from my-snapps.com site. No CD or DVD or per drive copy. So be cautious in opting for photos. Overall Wondela is very good for day-outing and it is more worth for the people who can go for many dry and water rides."
Great attraction ,Definitely one of the best water parks I‚Äôve been in. Really good amusement park as well. Absolute fun.
Fun place for family,"This is a great place to spend time with family. Kids will really enjoy, adults who like thrilling rides too  have a fabulous time. If your kids are older, (10+) there's more to do. Best time to go is mid week or a weekday to beat the crowd. If weekend can't be avoided, then take express tickets to skip the long queues for the rides. Found everything to be safe."
Best Theme Park,"Visited multiple theme parks across the globe. I can vouch Wonderla as one among the best. Safety , quality of rides , staff attitude are all excellent"
Wonderla,Wonderla is one of the famous water game place in Bangalore. There is lot of water games that we can can enjoy a lot at reasonable price parking also there food facility also there. With childrens we can spend more and enjoy more.
Time well spent with family,"Time well spent with family. Has good options for all ages in terms of both land and water rides. You can spend a good amount of time in wave pool itself. As a family we liked the following rides - Rocking tug,  Crazy wagon, Termite rides, Dungeon ride, Sky wheel, The lagoon and Wave pool. Other rides have a longer wait time.Place is clean and well maintained. Liked the concept of the EZPay band which one can top up money and use through the park instead of carrying the wallet around. The storage locker facilities are good as well. One more thing to appreciate is that all juices, ice cream, biscuits etc., are sold at MRP price"
Place to enjoy,Good place to enjoy with family but entry ticket feel more where middle class people can't tolerate. Just enjoy with family and kids.
One among the best water parks ,"Wonderful Bangalore is huge amusement park with variety of rides, wave pool, rain disco, lazy river etc. This park attracts lots of people and students specially during summer season. I recommend to visit this palace on a week day because weekends this park will be jam packed with people."
this was a super weekend at wonderla,"a must visit place for a weekend, though i suggest to book resort for night stay and spend 2 days at wonderla, to enjoy fully. 1 full day for water rides and another full day for riller coaster rides etc... if you plan well (reach there sharp at 6 and stay full day) it'll be hectic and tiring..."
Too costly,This is very good place to spend one complete day with family and kids. But the prices are hiked like anything compared to earlier years at no extra facility. And don't forget their dress code changes now and then. If u have not taken correct dress then again you have to spend min 500 for each person for dress.
Huge park with a lot of rides,"It is great place for kids and adults for a day outing, they have dry and wet both types of rides.There are a couple of restaurants,ice cream shops etc, very well made but not well maintained park.During summer time when usage goes up because of vacations,water is not clean and has a odor to it."
Wonder day !,"We had a blast over here, this was my 2 nd visit here with my family, last was 5-6 year back, but now it is totally changed here, great feeling this time it had nasik ka dhol carnival at the end of December it was awesome everyone were enjoying so we were, we had taken photography also, 100rs that's it and a long term memory. One must have photos of the family together."
WonderLa losing its charm ,I last visited WonderLa theme park around 2014. I feel it‚Äôs losing it‚Äôs charm now.Quality is degraded from outside of the park and inside is no different. Management needs to step in to improve and maintain quality.
This awesome place for enjoyment.,"Hi viewers, this place is not only for youngsters, this for all. Lot of more games and really will enjoy for all the game. It's one of the best place for enjoyment.Do visit and enjoy lot more."
Crazy experience,It was a crazy enjoyment and fun with an games which was played in wonderla  It was a great experience
Crazy about wonderla,We had been with family we enjoyed a lot in the waterpark and all other games it was awesome and thrilling experience
Nice,Very good place for the whole family and kids. Well mannered staff.Best in South India. Rides are great. Worth the money.
Amazing Wonderla,I visit Wonderla last year but this year is very nice some changes are good really enjoyed with my friends in water aap canteen everything is fine
Bangalore's amusement park,"Visited Wonderla in December 2018 along with friends. Liked the dry rides most of which were well maintained and well staffed as well. Didnt venture into the water park, so not much to comment on that. Quite clean and well maintained. Few areas of improvement :-Few rides werent working when we went there.-The park closes in evening around 7, probably you can extend the time to 8 as many prefer to come little late to avoid the scorching sun.- need to have a longer and higher roller coaster as we see in some of the international parks, - i was looking for some First-aid help, couldnt figure out where its available, maybe make it more visible/ accessible- Lastly, i dunno why, but saw many employees protesting outside the main gate when we were coming out in the evening. Not sure what the issue was, but maybe something related to to HR. Overall a fun filled experience. would visit again."
Awesome experience,Omg what experience I had. Worth place. Can spend all time here really paisa vasool place. Thank you to the chairman who build this in Bangalore
Place to remember not just for product for their services,"Let me start by first thanking the promoters / owners for giving India wonderful holidays for our kids and families, wish something of this standard to come in other parts of India, so wish you good luck for it. Now coming to the best part of experience is not only the rides which no doubt are as good as international acclaimed one but more than that it is the hospitality which of people in park which matters more small example - my son 10 years old want to go a for one ride in which I was not interested & there was a big que so I was standing and waiting, one secuirty lady asked me what's the issue I told her waiting for my son ride, she asked if he has gone alone I said yes,she went out of the way and got my son from que & made him join fast track que, what a thought and training, three cheers to that ,but sorry for that lady that I did not ask her name. Second I found concept of wonderla resort to be superb only sad part is I stayed for one night only it is really good value for money and well thought off, I do not see any reason to go back to city after full day of adventure and games.Food is amazing and prices are extremely good. Overall best stay and expeirence for year 2018-19."
Fun filled!,"Recoil is the best...üòÇüòçit's a feeling of breath taking drug.....it's tht enjoyable ride. Same goes with maverick and y scream. Wave pool is the most time wasting water pool. Rain dance is just amazing, u should go there even if u don't like to dance cuz u automatically start enjoying thtüòçwonderla is wonderfully architectured.MUST VIST. life time experience."
best water theme park,"One of the best water theme park and rides, there is no time to repeat the rides, only once and there are so many rides"
Wonderla Amusement Park,We visited the Wonderla Amusement park on a weekday to avoid the weekend rush. We enjoyed the place and the rides. The entire set up is well maintained and the people manning the rides are also courteous and professional.
Kiran Vignan at Wondela,Very Good Amusement park for All Age groupWell maintained and Friendly staff. Food is also good. Perfect place for water games and Crazy Rides(For adults).
Best fun park,I love all the rides üòç. It was such a great day . Having more water rides .love the roller coaster ride. Food was amazing.
Very good experience and well maintained,We visited Wonderla along with out daughter . She had a good fun. We stayed in their resort which is comfortable and after tiring day it makes sense to stay in resort than drive back . Rides are good and water is well maintained . Overall good exp
Excellent. But price should be lowered.,"Excellent place. People of all ages can go but make sure your height is no too short otherwise its not adviced to go there :). All the rides are thrilling but its always crowded. If you wanna do all the rides in a day its adviced to take a fastrack ticket. The only problem with that ticket is that it's more than double the normal ticket. Otherwise, you can even stay in the resort."
Fun with family,Enjoyed a lot with my family. Though not a rush day I suggest buying FasTrack on weekends to bypass queue.
Wonderful Theme park,"The Name worder la itself reveal the park , wonderful park with lot of fun rides,thrill rides and even more water slides and rides are there.Spending whole day is not enough to cover all the play area.Restaurants are also there inside the park.Kids, family , couple , friends everyone love to visit the park.We visited this park 3times and planning to visit again.Must visit place in Bangalore"
Entertaiment,"Amusement park with risky rides,ideal for adults and people with strong heart.Children have lesses rides comparetely.early morning entry is best as the area n rides of this park is very big."
Amazing Place,"If you want to live once again your childhood then you must come at this place,so many kind of rides in here. You will feel better after visiting this place."
Wonderla and chill,Don't forget to go on RECOIL and always try the water rides first and then go for the land rides as they have long queues..
Best hospitality ,We visited wonderla with our 5 year old son. We chose a Monday so we can avoid crowds. The place is so well managed & clean. Staff is super courteous. They help you out of the way more than what is expected. Everyone is smiling always. Food joints are spic & span. Food is sooo reasonable & delicious. We would love to visit soon again.
Very entertaining,"Quite crowded, but extremely satisfying. Very disciplined staff. Complains, if any, are taken seriously and investigated by the park mangement. One of the park managers, Mr. Kushan, was very courteous and helpful when i made a complaint (it turned out to be standard park rules, after his investigation) Will certainly visit again. Great fun outing for the enrite family!"
Must visit for some fun with your friends!!!,"We heard a few positive reviews of this place but stayed a bit neutral. We got so positively surprised by this place! Wonderla offers an incredible fun experience for people of all ages. So whether you would like to spent time with your family, friends or a significant other, this place provides all sort of attractions!!Insight #1: Reach early as you really gonna spend a full day there (we reached 12.30pm and didn't even make to all the attractions)Insight #2: Buy a Fast Track pass. It's a bit more expensive but gives you a big advantage when there are lots of people waiting in the line.Insight #3: If possible go on Saturday (or during the week) but not on Sunday. It is crazily crowded that day."
Awesome Park must visit,It is a good place for families as well as friends. The new rollercoaster is the new attraction of this place. There whole lot of thing to be done at this place for everyone
Thrilling experience!!!,"I have given party to my friends here. They have rides for everyone. Be you are with kids or elders, all will enjoy being here. Few rides will definitely give Adrenal rush and worth trying!! Specially one with high drop!!"
Worth visiting,Enjoyable place !! Avoid weekends to avoid rush !! Fast tracks are best so that you can escape from long q !!
Enjoyed,"We went with family to wonder-la las week ... its a awesome water park, we are enjoyed with kids... They do provide the safety precautions."
Thank you very much Mr Shamil üëçüòä,I had visited Wonderla kochi on December  27th Nd. We had such a great experience in Wonderla especially the new Recoil. We wanted to preserve our memories there and we took the video in a pen drive. But unfortunately we lost that pen drive and we send mail to Wonderla asking to send the video through mail. As it was large in size they told us that it‚Äôs difficult to send by mail. The sales in charge there found our video by identifying us from our photos. He then send it us by wats app after reducing its size. It would have been a great loss for us if we couldn‚Äôt find it. Thanks a lot to Mr. Shamil for helping us out.
Just pure adrenaline Rush,The only place in India that deserves a water park status. This place is a must visit for anybody who like to feel the adrenaline rush. Though its a bit crowded on weekends and ticket prices dont help its definitely worth it at the end of the day. The new addition is the roller coaster which has long ques. The wave pool is good too and gravity drop is the best. Food is pathetic and the worst part is you cant carry any food from outside.
Lovely amusement & theme park,"One of the best in class see worldwide experience can be found here, USe the fast track option to get to rides faster."
It's wonderful,I visited this wonderland with my wife and my young children recently. We enjoyed a lot with all the things in this place. It is better than I expected.
Happening place and fun all the way,Well it's fun place to be when in Bangalore... Has both water and land rides.. Good food options as well inside.. There is also resort now next to it where u can stay and spend some quality time.... So go for it...
Wonderla ...,I went there with my wife and Kids .It was a nice experience .The rides in the park are comparable to any international theme park .Roller coaster is the latest addition and I enjoyed it thoroughly .A must visit place if you are adventurous.
Wonderla Amusement Park Review,i went with my family members last year.It was very nice place.Kids can enjoy whole day.Its located in Mysore road.we can go for outing one day.Its very beautiful place in bangalore.My daughter enjoyed lot..
Amazing,Enjoyed my visit to this place with friends. It was an awesome experience. Specially loved the lazy pool. Did not feel like leaving this place.
I don't recommend going in the water,"For non-Indians, and especially for kids, I think this water park is not up to standards for the quality and safety of the water. I would not go swimming there."
Good for family Amusement park outing,"Wonderla has lot of rides which you and your family members of all ages groups will enjoy. Only problem is that you cannot take home food with you and you canno teat it inside the park. If you want to eat your home food, you have to come outside the park entrance and have to eat. that's not humane thing. Otherwise the rides are good you have restaurants inside and you can spend 1 full day from 11 AM to 5 PM there."
Family Ga Ga & Boys Josh Unlimited.,Off Mysore the place is a whole day picnic for the family.2 family going is best.Senior Citizens must have a company - hire a girl - your house maid.
Great Amusement Park !,All water and land games are awesome.There are good number of restaurants and shops to buy clothes suitable for water rides at decent price.
Nice Day Out with Kids,"Its good one day time spent with kids, we went here to celebrate my daughters birthday along with other kids. Weekends it will be crowded plan accordingly. Water games starts at 12, dry games from 11. Play as much as dry games for 1hr and start water games at 12 it self, later do dry games you will not feel the rush."
Awesome place,Best place to visit with friends and kids. We enjoy a lot over there . All facilities are good and safe as well.
"Great rides, cozy stay options","Visited with a work team for a retreat weekend plan. We visited the park for a few rides. Managed very well by the Wonderla staff there, especially since they had to open up the rides section earlier for us as the bigger group.The rooms are well maintained and spic and span. Amaenities all in place. Rooms have a lovely view of the open spaces far away as well. The food was pretty good, the buffet spreads for all meals were quite good and delicious food at all times. Staff if courteous and polite and cooperative as well. They have a good pool, along with a bar and pub next to it for a city-feel is you miss it!"
Buy 1 get 1 free,It's one-stop solution for getting rid of any stress. Wonderla has got all the dry and wet rides for all age groups.It is heavily crowded on weekends and public holidays. It means you'll have to wait for almost 30-40 min waiting to get on the ride of your choice. It's good to go with a company to max out the fun.Would suggest going on weekdays or offseason.There are good food joints inside. Do not expect anything great but after having burnt 400 cals whatever you get will be tasty. Do not take meal option from the food joint near the wave pool. Didn't find it hygienic as people were just getting it right from the pool.
TOTALLY AMAZING,An amazing place with breath taking experience. You never feel bored no matter how many times you visit this place. The BMTC bus service from majestic to Wonderla is very good. They also give discount on showing of those bus tickets. Food combos which they ask while buying the tickets are worth it. Food is also good there. One hell of a experience. Lockers are available for phones and valuables. You can't keep your luggages though.For more details ig me- @abhi.rao10
Life worst experience-wonderla,"Suggest not to visit the place. Food bad nd staff show attitude nd misguide to waste time. Too commercial nd expensive,not worthy. Visiting hours 11 to 6pm, by the time we take tickets nd check in it will be 12pm. Issue of dress one more hour Lunch next, finally from 2-5 we can enjoy. No arrow indicators for rides, lack of staff to guide, less staff at slides so delay in enjoying rides. For school children its not at all advisable.suggest not to visit.700 Staff we have what they say is completely false."
"Expensive, not worth",It's better to teach and introduce the kids to nature and natural beauty rather that things man made this as it's beyond ordinary man's reach.
Good park with drawbacks,Definitely Wonderla is a great place to visit with family and friends. There are many rides and water sports to enjoy and once can enjoy over the the week and weekend with offers. Now they also offer stays. There are some drawbacks like - check on quality of food vendors are serving - check on how people are entering the water and more frequent clearing /cleaning of water. I have seen especially ladies coming with open hair and lot of oil and entering water area. - some rules on how to enter water like tied hair etc. Rest other drawbacks can be managed and adjusted but if people are coming for water games they expect clean water.
Excellent place for family and kids,We as a family of 5 and a total of 15 members visited wonderla. We had so much fun age was not a limit and time was not enough. Definitely I recommend and will return again soon.
Excellent place,Wonderla Amusement park is located in south west bangalore on  mysore road. It  has many water rides and entry fee is bit expensive.
Clean amusement park in India,"Have visited amusement parks across globe and always yearn for a water park that is well maintained. Wonder la , Bangalore is one such gift for Indians. Until metro train extension is not open, alight @ Mysuru road station and take bus #226 ( right outside the station). The volvo 226 goes directly to park and regular ones stop @ main road ( 3 Kms away from gate). It took a solid 90 minutes from MG road. So start early to arrive at gate by 10.30 or 10.45. The dry rides start @11 and water rides @ 12 noon. BUY FAST TRACK tickets. This will ensure you have a strategy to do all rides (even multiple times @ leisure) by 6 pm and take the volvo back to Station. Water slides are the hit and hence you will find folks going straight to water side, first. If you buy Fastpass, then do the dry rides between 11 and 2. After lunch, do water rides between 3 and 6. Some days , regular queue in water slides can snake to 60 mins wait. Food is good, facilities are neat. Lockers and swim wear rentals were available. If you have, recommend you get ur own. There are a few sit in shows on dry side. You can do those after lunch for a win-win"
Fun and Family time,The place is a major attraction of this city. Although its on the outskirts but it is totally worth it. Few rides are fun and few are thrilling to the core. But overall there is something for every traveler to enjoy and remember. Lot of great memories are created here.
Good water park,Wonderla located in southern outskirts of Bangalore is the best water park in Bangalore. ON weekends it gets very crowded.
Nice place to visit,"The park is having lots of fun filled activities for children and adults. It is good to take the food from the food stalls inside the park, the price is reasonable and quality is good."
Very well managed and fun place,The place is really good with an option to stay at the resort. The day is well spent with kids having great time. You get everything in the park and therefore it is verybeasy to navigate inside and you can cover most of the rides.
Must go,If you like adventure this is the place in Bangalore to try :) So many awesome rides including water rides and rain dance and wave pool. Food is Ok but you are not here for food . this place is for fun only for fun. Do not expect any thing else .
Excellent place for holiday,Here u can find so much relief and relaxation and new world feeling. U will forget all your tensions and worries. U will enjoy a lot if u r with ur family or friends. Thank u
Most Enjoyable Place,"The park is most is located on mysore road,This park consist of different kinds of dry rides and water rides.Best ride is wonderla roller coaster ride,food is available inside but very expensive,Security and safety is also good.Overall my experience is very nice"
"Fun, fun and more fun",Went for a day trip to wonderla with family and it was loaded with fun. The water rides are exciting. My family had loads of fun in the water slides. As it was a weekend there was some waiting time for the popular water slides. However the fast pass tickets came in handy and we were able to complete some rides multiple times. One day is not enough to enjoy all the water games and rides. Enthusiastic travellers are advised to stay a night at the resort and enjoy all the facilities and rides over the complete weekend.
Wonderla is just wonderful,"No words to explain the place, i have gone here more than 3 times and it has never disappointed me, The must play is water games even small kids can enjoy(all type except couple of them), wave pool, rain dance is must, its a stress buster i would say. Then with respect to dry games, i would say its based on your capacity you can play, one game to mention is Recoil which is very good. Then the land games/shows like 3d mv is too good. Dungeon ride, dashing cars etc, over all you should plan all dry games and land games/show in the first half before you have lunch ie by 2PM and later get in to the water games after you have food, it will be perfect."
The best amusement park,This is truly the best amusement park in South India. One of the first branches of Wonderla (they later setup one in Hyderabad).We went here earlier this year. Located between Mysore & Bangalore. Its a good day-out option if you love adventure & water sports.Good option for young kids as well.
Extremely thrilling land rides. Really good experience,"Plan to be here for a full day, definitely. Anything less just won't cut it. The land rides are especially amazing. Preferable to go on weekdays to avoid extreme crowds. If going on weekends, fast track tickets are definitely advisable, otherwise you will be able to cover the good rides just once. At least one change of clothes needed if planning to take water rides. Here are the best I found among all the rides :Land Rides:InsanityY-ScreamMaverickHurricaneRecoilFlash TowerWater Rides:Wavy and Free fallPlease avoid Equinox if possible, many from our gang reported dizziness post this ride. If at all maybe at the end only."
Great amusement park,one of the best amusement park located in Bangalore-Mysore highway.. there are may dry games and water games and a day is not sufficient to cover all games..
A one stop destination for complete enjoyment,Very suitable place for family as well group outing. The entry fees is slightly in the upper side but all the rides are free. The queue at some of the most sought water rides are very lengthy and we wont be able to do such rides more than once bcos of long queue.
Beautiful,Beautiful and amazing place so many rides and also restaurant inside I enjoyed the rides and food I'm not fun with the pool love to come back
Good place to go and spend a week end,Most of the rides and water play area is covered in the ticket. It is a good place. There are rides specific to children and elders. Choosing of rides depends upon your apatite to thrills.
