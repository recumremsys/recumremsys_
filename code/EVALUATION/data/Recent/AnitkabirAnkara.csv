Interesting place!,"This is such a majestic location that is highly informative to visitors.  The grounds of the facility and the architecture itself is spectacular and worth a visit while in Ankara.  If you are an American, think of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC as an analog.  This is worth a couple hours of your day. (As a side note and reflective of the times we live, security and military were heavily policing anyone who lowered a face covering ... for even two seconds ...literally. Even though there was hardly anyone there and we were outside. Ridiculous).  But visit here while I’m Ankara!"
Attaturk barrier place ,A nice half day out to look around with a nice view of Ankara . Nice history of the way it was built and by whom .
Impressive,A walk through the greatest mausoleum of the Turkish people. There were some works in progress but it was still an excellent visit.
The place where the heart of Turkey pumps,This is the place where you should start first when it is your first time in Ankara. Highly suggested to go around golden hours.
"Very impressive, but not accessible for wheelchair access","This was quite a spectacular visit and informative about Turkish history. If you're there long enough you get to see the guards changing which was very interesting.Staff were wearing masks, there were some points of sanitiser dispensers throughout, the museum was closed to prevent spread of the virus, and there were limited access restrictions in places like the souvenir shop. Saying that, not all tourists were wearing masks, and the amount of people in main areas like the mausoleum and memorabilia showcases were not monitored.Unfortunately, there's a lot of stairs throughout Anitkabir, and I did not see a single point for wheelchair access. Anyone would this restriction wouldn't properly access the landmark, and wouldn't be able to visit it comfortably."
First place to start in Ankara!,"Huge Memorial place with vast grounds to walk around, it has also good views from the top to the city of Ankara. The museum contains full story and history of Ataturk. A must visit to understand this history and enjoy the daily military change show."
Must see in Ankara,"A huge building whit the mausoleum of Ataturk, which is the founder of the Republic of Turkey. There are lots of paintings from that time of the Turkish war of independence and how the republican identity started. Definitely a place worth to visit and deepening yourself in the republican history."
Interesting,"This massive Mausoleum is built for the final resting place for Kemal Ataturk between 1944 and 1952.  There is also the Ataturk and war of independence museum.Very Interesting, must to seeEntrance freeOpening hours from 09.00 till 16.30"
Stunning and beautiful area. Must visit!,"I travelled by train from Istanbul to pay my respects here. There is an incredible feeling of love and respect for the great man. The museum is fantastic, with so many treasures, including cars, the funeral gun carriage, portraits etc. The gift shop is very reasonable and there is a nice cafe for a drink and rest."
Nice and peaceful,Wonderful place. Must visit. During season always packed with tourists. Underground museum in the same building is fabulous. Very huge fabrication it is. Wonderful with beautiful garden a d lanscape. At the  time of shifting of duties of guards it is a fabulous time. Guards stand and keep on standing till the changeover without any movement. Great it is.
Obligatory visit!,"Seems that every tour to Ankara is taken to Anitkabir.  It's OK and offers some insights into the hero-worship that Turks have for Kemal Ataturk, founder of the Turkish Republic.  But the mausoleum itself is not all that impressive.  Built in similar style as the mausoleums of Ho Chi Minh and Mao Zedong (actually, I guess they came after), it's just a big-columned structure idolizing the founding leader.  The mausoleum is stark and bare inside.  The most interesting part of the visit was seeing the school groups and how they behaved during their obligatory visits, and the changing of the guard (which was interesting but not as impressive as some other such exercises in other countries).  If you have limited time in Ankara, better to plan to spend more time at the amazing Anatolian Civilizations Museum."
"Unmissable, even if you are in Ankara for just one day!","This is an utterly fascinating place!  You cannot miss it, even if you are in Ankara for just a day.  Basically, it is the mausoleum of Ataturk, but there is much more to see than just a tomb.  The whole place is paradise for photo and history buffs.  You enter the central area through a broad road, lined with statues of lions.  At the end of this road is a huge courtyard, with Ataturk's tomb on the left and a museum on the right.  You need at least two hours to see everything. It would be good if you can budget three hours.  Wear GOOD walking shoes, there is plenty of walking to be done.  People with a stroller may have some difficulties, there are quite a few stairs.  I did not see arrangements for wheelchairs, you may need to check.  Little kids may find this quite trying.  Also, I don't think this place would appeal to teenagers.  But, if you have even a little interest in history, this is indeed paradise.  So much information on modern Turkish history, on Ataturk,  on his life, etc...etc...  And so many photogenic buildings.  I went by taxi, the driver dropped me off at the main gate.  It was quite a walk, uphill, to the Lion walkway, and then there was more walking.  There must be some way to directly access the Lion walkway.  If so, you can save yourself a long uphill walk, and also save a lot of time!  It is perhaps the most impressive mausoleum in the whole world.  It left me with a sense of awe."
Official visit.,It was a solemn and  moving experience.  Well worth doing at least once.  Wear comfortable shoes.  It is a bit like a pilgrimage.
Best place to learn about modern Turkish history,Don't forget to visit the museum if you want to learn more about modern Turkish history and general atmosphere in the Republic of Turkey.
You must visit Anitkabir if you visit Ankara ,"I think you cannot really visit Ankara without visiting Anitkabir.It’s architecture is interesting and it’s kind of simplicity makes it very monumental. And monument it is.For me, a Nordic visitor, the importance of Atatürk is fascinating. The museum around the mausoleum gives you an idea how loved he was and is. I saw many families and couples taking photos Anitkabir on background and studying the museum very carefully.I recommend this place because its importance for Turkish people, there’s something special how they talk about Atatürk, the father of the Turkey. Based on what I saw I think he was a man with academic background but he could touch the people of Turkey by the way he spoke. And being a soldier finalized his heroic status."
MUST BE SEEN in ANKARA...,"Anitkabir... My legend, Mustafa Kemal Ataturks, great commander, founder of Turkish Rebuplic, resting place. If you are interested in history, here is not just a place to give your respect to him, also to see and learn a lot about close history, the real one, with real proofs and witnesses."
Very moving with an excellent WWI museum,Saw the changing of the guard - worth watching.  The museum had a excellent depiction of WWI from the Turkish view point.  I recomend this for everyone to visit.
Perfect and also important place to see.. ,"Anıtkabir is one of the most important place to see in Turkey. If you have been in Ankara and you haven't seen Anıtkabir, means that the other places you saw are meaningless."
Highly recommend ,A great history lesson . The information and set up is great . Loved the car and the personal belongings as well as the history reminder. Views from the top spectacular.
Splendid ,Awesome It’s one place that everyone should pay a visit to it is very beautiful very big and very nice a lot of Chinese and Asian people friendly and accommodating I will visit again when I am in Ankara
Anıtkabir ,Very historical and beautiful. An amazing place to visit. Gives the life of Atatürk and really pays tribute to him and his greatness.
Amazing Monument,A must see in Ankara. You will learn alot about the history of Turkey and Ataturk when you visit this important monument. Its always very well organized and entertaining to visit and enjoy a piece of Turkey’s history.Side note: Wear walking/comfortable shoes when visiting because you will walk alot.
Highly recommend ,If you want to know the details of this wonderful country Antikabir is the place to visit where you can see The graveyard of his Everlasting General and historical Mustafa Kamal Ataturk
Great Man in History of Humanity,"I think this is the most impressive building in Turkey. Every single detail has a reason and meaning. No matter where are you from, nor friend or foe you have to visit."
might be the only place to visit in Ankara,"the place was built with passion that is for sure, the founder place in the hearts of Turkish people is also obvious,i am not a fan of graves, but this place is a monument more than a museum or anything else,"
Excellent,"If you would like to know historical information about the founder of Turkey, you should go and visit this exceptional museum. Strongly recommended."
"A ""must-do"" visit to appreciate modern Turkey history","This mausoleum gives a visitor an appreciation of modern Turkey history, which was marked by Ataturk's leadership post Ottoman Empire. The building includes a museum of Ataturk's life and his many achievements in modernizing Turkey. However, the many sub sections that present his achievements, in the walk through museum wing, are pretty extensive and one would take an hour or so to complete the viewing of the exhibits. Depending on one's interests and time constraints, one could just focus on the early section presenting Ataturk's life and military history."
In memory of Ataturk,Stopped by on the way to Cappadocia. I was bugged by a bad back so only reached the flagpost but the wife did the full deal. Witnessed the changing of the guard and the wife did the mausoleum and musuem. It was bitterly cold. Great for fans of Ataturk.
mausoleum built to honour the father of the nation,This mausoleum was built to respect the father of the nation Mustafa Kemal Ataturk who is the founder of the Republic of Turkey
Worth visiting many times.,"Apart from being a highly (actually the most) respected place in Turkey, it offers a beautiful city view."
To everyone - Herkese,"Number one in Ankara! Mosoleum or museum. First visit then bir easy to forvet... Ankara'da bir numara. Mozele veya müze. Bir ziyaret esin, unutmayacaksınız."
"amazing place, i enjoy visiting different parts","amazing place, i enjoy visiting different parts. There were many students there for graduation ceremony, also the soldiers say some words in Turkish while marching, it was interesting for me that how Turkish people love Ataturk."
"Historic, Grandeur and Impressive !!","This is a must visit when one sets foot in Ankara and be prepared to set aside at least half a day to go through the four sections of the momentous site with the most important being the mausoleum of the Father of Turkey, Ataturk.The four sections broadly are 1) which houses Ataturk ( Father of Turkey) personal belongings 2) 3 Panoramas of Canakkale Battle, Sakarya Pitch Battle and the Great Attack are exhibited 3) Consists of vault galleries where thematic exhibition sites are displayed covering events occured during the period between 1919 and 1938 4) private library of Ataturk covering 3123 books of anitkabir collection from Ataturk's personal library.Other interesting sites are the hall of honor, the changing of guards, the sarcopahagus of ismet inonu, souvenior shops and the lion's path outside. A must see and it is truly educational and impressive."
Mustafa Kemal Ataturk,"Great monument as this is a historically important place for Turkey, Father of modern Turkey. Anit Kabir is very impressive, when in Ankara, make sure you have some time to visit this significant place."
"Great Monument, must visit","Great monument , You will feel the grandeur and respect of this place. Beautiful garden with plants & trees that bring from many country different species and origin."
Number 1 place to visit in Ankara,Very important monument in which Ataturk in rest. At least once in life to visit and feel the great atmosphere.
Great Historical Site,Very awesome historical museum with lots of stories to be told. Love the carvings om the walls and the interior of the building. Get a glimpse of the changing of parade where soldiers will be marching across the parade ground close to the vistors.
Must Visit to understand Modern Turkey!!,"Far too many vistors to Turkey don't visit Ankara- and do not understand  the importance of Ataturk in creating the modern state- or indeed his acheivements in transforming the state and creating a nation in less than 20 years. this monument might appear to many to be OTT but it isnt ,in terms of his achievements ( not forgetting that he was a successful soldier as well!). The displays are not brilliant- but they do lay out his achievements his promotion of a long past, secularization social reforms etc- but they are hard work. The scale of the monument is truly impressive- oh and the Lirary display is fascinating- not only becuse of its size- but because of his wide reading!"
 Nice place ,A must see place when you visit Ankara.It’s nice that you see how much respect Turkish people have for this great man after more than 80 years.
The most memorable building for Turkey,"First impression that I get when Im visit this place is History and power. The Turkish old and young generation showed they are respected to the very important man for they are country Mustafa Kemal Atartuk. Every body craying and praying for him, even me. So easy to come here, because this place in the center, and you no need to pay entrance. Really recommend this place.Happy travel."
Very Impressive Monument,Very informative displays of how modern Turkey evolved.There is a sense of great national pride here.Certainly a very fitting monument to a very special man.
Exciting visit,We evixperinced   an exciting visit to the memorial of Atatürk who is the first leader of The Turkish Republic
This is a great palce to understand the country hav for the love of Ataturk,It is  an interesting and wellplanned monument to the man who changed Turkey. The grounds are beautiful all year round
Amazing,"Worth visiting. The atmosphere is very nice,the place is very taken care of,clean. Absolutely stunning views!"
The father of Türks,"A must visit place when you get to the capital of Republic of Turkey. The museum of Atatürk, the one who established the modern Turkey."
Anıtkabir,"Anitkabir is one of most important monuments, places for us, Turkish as our founder of Turkish republic rests within the monument. I have visited this place many times since I am very young, this time I was with my husband and young son. There is an interesting museum part that explains the wars, the hard times our anchestors went through to protect our freedom against imperialist countries. I found it little overwhelming as there are many topics covered about wars, Ataturk and revolution.  If you do not know much about Atatürk and Turkish history I recommend you to do some reading about Turkish history between 1900-1938 before you visit then it will be easier for you to understand the exhibitions in the museum. You should plan 2-3 hours visit."
Huge and a beautiful monument,"It has commanding views: changing of guards is also very good. It has a beautiful garden. Very well done monument for the father of the nation. He is revered, for a very good reason."
EMOTİONAL VİSİT,This one was the most emotional visit I ve have been. First commander and president of rebuclic of Turkey. Ataturk made lot of great things to turkish public. All thanks for Ataturk. Rest in peace Commander!
Impressive architecture ,"Anıtkabir, the eternal resting place of the Great Leader Atatürk, founder of the Republic of Turkey, is located in the heart of Ankara.Free entry for all. Huge garden and enormous square to walk around. One can spend an entire afternoon if wishes."
The place of utter respect and pride for the Turkish nation!,"The mausoleum of Kemal Ataturk, located above the city, is a must visit. This place shows best what a respectful and grateful nation the Turks are!"
Antikabir,This is the most visited tourist place in the Ankara in it is worse to miss it. There is an interesting museum and nice park.
Impressive Memorial,"This large hilltop memorial surrounds a ceremonial plaza.  On one end is the mausoleum for Ataturk, while there are smaller galleries and figures around the edges.  Soldiers and sailors stand guard in various places like statues.  Every hour there is a precision ceremony to change the guards.  When we were there a complete medical school class was celebrating their 20th reunion by laying a ceremonial wreath in the mausoleum.  Don't miss a small gallery near the WC that describes the building of the memorial and shows the (discarded) alternate designs."
Majestic place ,A large and extended place with tourism attractions that represent Turkish disciplines. Every where you can see soldier that I thought  it is maquette but it was real👍🏻. Interesting...
Wondeful ,Of you understand Turkish people you should see Anıtkabir. Very nice and very clean district. You may visit there
excellent!,"We were there with our frienda in spring 2019. It is stunning. We Will come back next year, because we did not see all."
Monument dedicated to prominent statesman Ataturk. Father of Turks,"Certainly was above our expectations. Anitkabir is a huge monumental complex devoted to Ataturk. The atmosphere was very impressive and unique. If you are lucky enough, you might as well come across Turkish soldiers changing guards. Moreover, the museum is very well curated and there is quite a lot of information on the salvation war Turks won against many countries."
Fitting monument,Very short for time we had to forgo the museum and head straight for the great hall. The hall is some 30 metres high with the walls faced with a variety of marbles and travertine limestones. The great man rests in a 40 ton sarcophagus made of a tiger striped Turkish marble. Light pours through a arched window. The upper arch of the window is furnished with a golden mosaic. The roof is lightly ornamented giving the overall impression of grand but restrained architecture. A fitting resting place for the great man. Pivoting around you are treated to a panoramic view of Ankara.
Peace at home peace at in the world! ,You have to see this graveyard and its museum. It has a very important information about history. Ataturk had a very important person in the world!
Great view from Ankara,"Very interesting history of Atatürk and modern Turkey, calm place, great view. A must see in Ankara."
Great!,Masterpiece . With all the great signs of masterpiece in the modern era. Like it for photography . I felt somewhat a sense of excessive security control over us.
"Anıtkabir, Shrine and museum in the capital Ankara","A distinctive cultural monument and a tourist attractionIt is a building, inside the mausoleum of Kemal Ataturk, It also has a museum, contains personal items and clothing for Kemal Ataturk and it contains a 3D view of the wars he ledIt has a panoramic view of AnkaraFree admissionVisiting hours; times for visiting Anıtkabir on special dates vary.09.00-17.00 09.00-16.0009.00-16.30 week daysWeekend (Closed)Religious Holidays (open)Public and national Holidays; 1 January, 1 May, 30 August, July 15 (open)Address: Yücetepe, Akdeniz Cd.

Great monument ,Great resting place for a great man.It was such a moving experienceIt was another highlight of my holidays. .
Really massive Mausoleum to Mustafa Kemal Ataturk,It's impressive how massive Mausoleum and area are. Obviously it's very important place for Turkish.
Magnificent.,"We've been to Anitkabir on numerous different occasions by now. It really is simply a magnificent place, tributed to Gazi Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.The thing is, it is hard to review a place like this in detail, as it contains a lot of information about Atatürk, is free and even if the prior two statements wouldn't be there, it still is just beautiful. In the center of Ankara, with a great view almost the entire 360 degrees.It really simply is a must-see in Ankara. Also to learn more about the most important man in recent Turkish history, who's name and portrait you can see pretty much across Turkey.Offline reading about him in addition is also definitely recommended."
A massive Mausoleum dedicated to founder of modern Turkey,"A vast open area and Mausoleum dedicated to the founder of  modern Turkey Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who is the 1st President of Turkey, after World War One. Apart from the Mausoleum, there are separate room showing the presidential cars and photos showing his victories at the Turkish war of independance, after World War 1. We managed to witness of the charging of the guards as well. Good enough to spent 1 hour at this place."
One of the greatest persons in Turkish history,"Ataturk led the falling apart Otoman Empire into modern day Turkey, gave women voting rights and tried to liberalize the Islam."
This summer,"It is must seen place to get to know the biggest leader of Republic Turkey. You have to get into the celler as well, there are lots of historical memos, tools, photographs, stories you should know."
A must see!,This monument should be on top of things to do in Ankara. Check opening times online before visiting. Entrance is free.
Please All Rise and Salute for ATATURK...,The founder of the Turkish Republic Mustafa Kemal ATATURK  is visited by millions of Turkish Republicans on every occasion to express their deep respect and gratitude for his invaluable ministration to his Nation. Every spot has its own history and meaning so be aware of every single information to understand the passion and devotion to this Republic... Even the architecture and decoration has so many words to tell you about the TR history.
Excellent museum!,"This is a wonderful museum, very well done!  Every part of this museum I enjoyed and I especially loved learning so much about Turkey's history and Atatürk's reformations. This museum is a must if you want to learn about and understand Turkish society. My favorite places within this museum are the murals and art galleries. I could stay all day in those rooms alone. It's very impressive. The amount of Turkish influence in advancement with so many fields of study was also impressive. My kids really enjoy running around the square and seeing the changing of the guards. They don't like the museum as much because they get bored but I sure do like it. It's also free, which is awesome!"
Excellent,"A fitting mausauleum for a giant of a man, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.  The Road of the Lions and the Ataturk Museum were personal favourites of mine.  Am still in awe of this great man who showed such vision."
Beautiful,"beautiful place with such of history and amazing architecture, put some respect and enjoy your historical visit."
Historical,It was a nice historical and informative museum to visit. Would recommend it if you are interested in Turkish history.
Great monument,"This is the first thing you have to visit in Ankara. The buildings are magnificent and the museum is really excellent and in great detail, but probably more interesting to turkish people than other turists, because of more general knowledge they have on Ata Turk's life and work."
The father of turkey where He’s buried,The father of turkey Mustafa Kemal Atatürk this is his Mazzaliuum it took 15 years to build by the Italians and that’s where he’s buried Lot of history when you walk around it will take your around good 2-3 hours
Most memorial place I visited in Ankara,"Most memorial place I visited in Ankara , I t has un beliavable history , Its the resting place of the most Famous Turk AtaTurk , modern father of Turkey"
Worth the time ,A worth two hours spent at the mausoleum and museum reflecting Ataturk and his struggle against the Greeks and reuniting modern Turkey.
Must do!,"I went here with my 13 year old son who had been drawing it for Republic Day almost every year at school so I thought it was about time we saw the real thing. It's so worth it. Brilliantly built - huge and yet inside surprisingly intimate. We went late in the day so it wasn't crowded but we should have got there earlier - I'd say around 3pm - we would have had more time to take it all in. There's a museum that goes from the right hand side of the main structure, underneath and comes out on the left - do it! It has Turkish Republic history in a nutshell with lots of Ataturk memorabilia. The whole site is full of wonderful 1930s art and sculpture which I wasn't expecting. There's a drama to it all reminiscent of the Russian style of art at the time. Look at everything, it's worth it, but not on a very hot sunny day, there's not a lot of shade outside. Oh, and my son found out skateboards are not allowed on the site!!"
Impressive in a cold way,"Like any other memorials, it is a cold, sterile place, beautifully crafted to suggest power. The changing of the guard animates it for a few minutes. It's a long walk fro the city but a short and cheap taxi ride."
Ulu Önder Mustafa Kemal ATATÜRK,The founder of our country and Turkey republic. The monument is a must-visit and to convey their respects to Ataturk for anyone coming to the capital of Turkey in Ankara.
A must visit in the capital city,Amazing place in the capital city. Plenty of historical and very impressive museum in the are where a must.
History of new Turkey,"The place is quiet beautiful, beside the tomb of Mustafa Kama Ataturk, you can also enjoy the beauty of garden. There is nice Turkish Military show, dont miss it."
Impressive monument to Ataturk,A huge building complex located on the top of a hill in the heart of Ankara. There are a lot of things to see in the museum. The museum itself it can also help understand better the Turkish people.
Ataturk tump,"Its the tump of Mustafa Kamal Ataturk, and all his belongings,  his history, his legacy and finally his tump. Great place to visit with wonderful building structure and its free of charge"
The First President,"Turkey has done a great service to extolling the military, political, diplomatic and national accomplishments of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. His mausoleum, museum and the 3-dimensional portrayal of the hideousness of the war that under his leadership allowed Turkey to become a republic after the fall of the Ottoman Empire is truly representative of the pride and nationalistic spirit of Turkey. It is definitely worth a trip. Count on about 2 hours. As adults we had visited one time and before we returned with our two elementary aged children we created a 30-point scavanger hunt. We selected specific physical things to look for (lions on the walkway), points of interest in the paintings (Ataturk with a hat, Ataturk  on a horse) , as well as different reprsenations in the 3-dimensional mural (a soldier with a flag, Ataturk with binnoculars). They recorded each successful ""treasure"" with the camera on their phone. It made for a more interesting time for the children and allowed us to have meaningful conversations after our visit."
29 Ekim 2016,"Atatürk's mausoleum... As Colin Powell put it when he was the Chief of Staff of the USA, ""The greatest statesman of the world in the 20th century..."""
A true understanding of Turkey,"Is 100% a must see, especially for the people from countries that were involved in WW1. You get a true understanding and appreciation to Turkey when you see what Atatürk has done for the country."
Very impressive,"Went here with colleagues and Anltkabir is very impressive Mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder and first president of the Republic of Turkey. It has been planned very well and it is a must see if visiting Turkey. It is located on a hill overlooking the city."
Wonderful,Everbody must go thete & fell fhe greatnes of ATATÜRK most. Important man of Turkey most of the other countries people know him werywell
Great museum and a must see place!,"This place reflects the independence history, I found it very interesting to learn more about Turkey's recent history and about Mustafa Kemal Ataturk the founder of the Turkish Republic. A must see place while visiting Ankara"
Soul of a Nation Lies Here,"This is the well-kept mausaleum of Turkey's founder Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, one of the most iconic places in Ankara or maybe in Turkey as a whole. It also has a museum about the Turkish War of Independence and Atatürk"
A tribute to Attaturk,Our guide took us to Mustafa Kamal Attaturk Mausoleum which also is a Museum. The place is pretty impressive with lots of guards standing at places in full attention just like those standing still st Buckingham Palace. Saw Attaturk cars and boat which were on day display. Lots of tourist were there in the morning which added a nice atmosphere to the place. We were fortunate to witness a graduation ceremony of soldiers who were near the main entrance ground and had to wait for 15 minutes before we entered the mausoleum. Our guide explained that the actual grave was downstairs but we didn’t go down since we had done lots of walking.The place was drenched with history and we really came to know what Attaturk had done for his country.A must visit in Ankara.
Must see!,"Both the Mausoleum and the museum underneath are must sees when you come to Ankara. Both are impressive. The museum especially so to see how progressive Mustafa Kemal Atatukrk was in bringing about societal change. He is revered, and rightly so!"
A tribute to the Founder of Modern Turkey,The only place worth visiting Ankara is the Mausoleum where the bodies of the First and Second President of Turkey Republic lies. Watch out for the change of guards at every hour. A simple security screening of bags at the entrance is compulsory for all visitors. You may take photos with the guards but do not touch them as a mark of respect for them. Toilet is free and a souvenir shop sells relatively cheap items which commemorate the Founder Mustafa.
2nd visit. Even better this time.,"Made sure to go earlier in the day this time. Many more people this time, mainly asian tourists. Finally was able to see the soldiers rotate shifts- something you should not miss while there and it happens quite frequently. The only issue is that foreigners seem to have a serious problem with understanding the significance and/or meaning of this sacred monument for Turkey and its Fathers, along with treating the soldiers as ""toys."" Thoughtful reverence should take precedence here; visitors should be much more aware and respectful."
"Great Museum, Must Visit if You Are in Ankara",Hugh museum to both pay respect and learn how their founding father Mustafa Kemal Atatürk led the Turkish people to defend their motherland and to form today's modern Turkish republic government. A must visit in the city of Ankara.
mammoth architecture,Place is spacious. It is the final resting place of the founder of Turkey.There are many exhibits indoor.We watched the changing of guard. A good place to people watch.
The father of modern day Turkey,Excellent display in the museum showing Turkey's place in WWII and Attaturk's role in bringing Turkey fully into the 20th Century - indeed it has regressed under more recent leadership -
Mausoleum ,"Of AtaturkThat is how I see it. Monumental build. Have to have impression, that is for sureI am so sorry that was raining so badly, I could not visited museum"
Monumental,it’s worth a visit for its architectural value alone. Great information about the Turkish war and a place of significant local cultural value. I didn’t find it as engaging as a foreigner.
The Turkish glory...,The place in which a great person rests... the pride of Turkish democracy... The first place to visit in Ankara for every visitor... we love it more after several visits
A Lessing of Turkish history,"A very large place dedicatet to Ataturk. A large and impressive museum dedicated to the most important momente of the Turkish modern history, a good lesson for visitors. We were lucky enough to Assist to some ceremonials dedicated to Childrens Day. Impressive."
A must do,"Besides paying tribute to the greatest man in Turkey, this visit is an excellent opportunity to learn about the Independence War, as well as all thr other reforms made by Ataturk.If you don't want to rush, and considering some queues for some areas, allow yourself 3-4h to visit the whole site. Go as early as possible!"
Nice place to visit if your in Ankara ,"They say when you come to Turkey you should visit this museum/mausoleum to pay respect to their founder and hero, Mustafa Atataturk.  Its a very nice place mostly made of marbled structure surrounded by a well manicured garden grounds. After touring the place in probably about an hour or less, I'm afraid there's not much else to see other than just wander around and take selfies. Try to witness the changing of the guards if you stay long enough for some added attraction."
Yes it's a MUST SEE,I'm sure the Turkish people are extremely proud of their founding father of modern Turkey.  And this museum/mausoleum did a wonderful job of showcasing it's history.Wish we had more time to explore it's entirety.   Nevertheless on this beautiful April day (we've been really blessed with gorgeous weather the entire week in Turkey with occasional sprinkling of rain) the museum visit had a lot of photo ops moment as well.By the way the museum gift shop has a lot of nice items at reasonable prices as their philosophy is not to make huge profits on tourists.  Example leather coin pouch US$3 made in Turkey.
The man who made Turkey ,You can’t visit Ankara without paying your debt to the man who made this Turkey. Atatürk was a great figure and his tomb is a must see with the guards marching around and the great museum underneath the tomb. Don’t forget to see the cars and boats at the other side of the site.
Family ,"Many thanks to of the hotel staff for their outstanding customers service. Rooms are big enough to feel as you are at home. Beds were very comfortable, and the room was very cleanOne important part of my stay was the hotel staff as the majority speaks English"
good,"this place important for turkish peoples, espacially last 15 years(after AKP party)turkey lucky before they had Ataturk, if they don't have they are same like middle east,he died so early  if Ataturk live long maybe now turkey same like europeplace  so good but last 50 years technology changed and they need to improve many sometings, if AKP party do it ?"
Good,A place of worship to Kemal Ataturk located in a hill with a very nice view of Ankara. There's also a very interesting museum
Must see in Ankara,I highly recommend a visit to AnItkabir if you’re in Ankara. The museum is easy to navigate and does a fabulous job of bringing history to life.
Really Great,A magnificent setting for a man who deserves all this splendor. Atatürk's tomb on a hill with a great view of Ankara
Try to time your visit to coincide with the changing of the guard,"While I did not go into the actual tomb of Ataturk I did tour the museum, it was great.  Many items of his and dioramas depicting him in various situations.  Also items given to him from other rulers of the world at that time.  I was lucky enough to be there during the time of the changing of the guards.  It was fabulous.  There were a ton of people at this site at the time but I got some great photos and suggest you try to be there when the guards change to add to your enjoyment of this place."
Nice architecture and mousoleum of one of the greatest leaders in the world history.,"You have to enter Anıtkabir from the Lions' Path. After visiting the grave of Atatürk, don't miss to vist the Atatürk Mouseum. At the end go to the opposite side of the square and take pictures."
Anitkabir mosuleum,Nice gardens and interesting museums. Currently busy with roof repairs but still worth a visit. One of the better museums I have visited.
Absolutely breathtaking ,A must see if you’re in Ankara. You learn a lot about the free and fair foundations on which Turkey was formed. I would go as soon as it opens to avoid the big school trips and try to organise a tour as you’ll get a lot more out of it that way. I loved it.
Greatest person in the history,He is the greatest person in the history. You must see his library to understand how he build a new and modern Turkiye. Also you can see wwr ı and indipendence war museum.
Full of history,"In addition to the mausoleum, there are also museums with diverse collections. There were two antique bullet-proof cars that were beautifully maintained. Changing of the guards was interesting to see."
A must in Ankara,If you made it to Ankara and go without seeing Anitkabir it’s a big mistake. Great place to get a quick history lesson of recent Turkish history.
You gotta take some time to stop by this place if you are in Ankara,"what amazes me most every time I visit  Ataturk's mausoleum is the drawings in the hallways that tell me the stories behind each and every step of Turkey's independence war that led to making of a contemporary republic. Rather than conventional rituals you could see almost in all similar places, one should focus more on understanding untold stories in history books. Go and see for yourself..."
Worthy!!!,"The view is incredible, is so beautiful. The people is very kind and you could feel very good being up there, is kind of majestic. You can see the love Turkish people feel for their country ‘cause is a museum as well. Either you want to go with your couple, alone or with friends. It’s really so nice time and could be relaxing as well. By this season, up there you can see snow remaining in the mountains 😍There’s so much better photos than this (sorry I don’t like to publish my family)"
Great place,Great historical place that give plentiful information about Turkish Republic. You can also buy gifts.
If you're into this kind of thing you'll enjoy it,"There is no doubt that history buffs will enjoy the experience of this complex, however whilst it di give me an insight into the history of the country, it was little too focussed on personal effects of Ataturk - his pens, notebooks, pipes etc.  I'm not particularly interested in history, but still found parts of the museum interesting, so I must give this a very good rating.  Worth visiting if you have no other plans, but wouldn't travel too far to see it unless you have a particular interest."
Must see place in Ankara,"Those who courios about history of modern Turkey, Anıtkabir is the place where you can find the roots. It is a mesmirising place. And Atatürk is one of the greatest leader of all times. The day he passed away, an Italian radio announced that; ""Ceasar, Alexander and Napoleon, stand up and show your respecr, cause Atatürk is coming"""
Beautiful place to visit,"This place is a must to visit while being in Ankara, I loved seeing all the development during Ataturk time and also it was such beautiful place with old path to walk on."
Must see!,Its the place where the father of Turks sleeps in peace. You will be amazed by it. Also the museum shop goods are pretty affordable.
Enjoyable ,The Mausoleam is beautiful and well maintained. We were able to witness the guards changing. Unsure how often this occurs but it is worth sticking around for.
Interesting place ,Mausoleum of Turkish leader Ataturk. There is small museum of his personal belongings and some painting. If you visit the country would suggest to visit the place.
Nice Place,The first time I visited was in 2000 and have been back atleast 6 times.  Improvements are constantly being made and well worth the visit.
Respectful,İt was 10 th of november when we visit with family it is full of People and emotions and feelings. İt is always meaningfulnand teaching moment to visit here specifically on these days. National days
Ataturk,Best part of visiting Turkey is this museum highly recommended for everyone to see. Great leader rest in peace
Really nice place to visit.,This is a great place to see d a couple hours if you are in Ankara. It is the resting place of the founder of modern Turkey one of the greatest leaders of the 20h.century. It was his determination to save Turkey that created what Turkey is today. His defeat of the British Greek Italians and Anzecs must rank as one of the greatest notary victories ever. You can spend a couple of hours seeing how history was made understand how war is never a answer.Do it if you are in Ankara.
history place,"The Ataturk Mausoleum is a good place to visit. It is a large square with 2 buildings, the first one with a few memories of Ataturk, another building with the Ataturk Mausoleum, the beautiful history of the past, the place not far from the center of Ankara city 10 minutes by taxi."
Tomb of Founder of Modern Turkey,"First off all, all the Turkish citizens (loves Atatürk or not) should visit Anıtkabir and see how a country could be rebuilt. In the panaroma part of War of Independence you get goosebumps with all manner of pictures, figures and live music. It makes you experience ambiance of those times. In other parts you will see Atatürk's clothes and things as well as items used after revolution. Taking photo is forbidden in some parts of Anıtkabir.Don't forget watching the video of The Great Speech By Atatürk (Nutuk) towards exit."
Weird,"The Atatürk Mausoleum is very weird for an Eastern -European man. The memory recall the memories of Lenin Mausoleum in Moscow and the Stalin and Rakosi era in Hungary.  Not speaking about the cult of Caucescu in Romania. What can we see in Ankara? An idealized man who was always perfect, who was always good, who was always in love with its country. The man seems to be always lonely just like all dictators. He has had just co-operators, servants, soldiers, but not friends, no family. We cannot see a human being in this museum just shadows of a very contradictional man. Why is it so necessary to idealize a human being? I think that he and his memory is used for something, but I do not know for what. But it is a fact that the ordinary Turkish people coming in masses into this Mausoleum and take pictures by the ugly painting. Whole families, and lonely amazons and soldiers taking selfies in this museum Very interesting."
Father of Turkey,"I was in Turkey on an EU Project.  After a meeting we spotted the Mausoleum was just across thr road.  Not sure about summer but in winter it closes at 5pm.  We were taken around by our interpreter who said she had been 5 times before and still had a connection with Ataturk despite being 2 generations away from his life.  You start by walking up a wide staircase onto the lion road [there were stone lions on both sides all down theis walkway] and far beyond there is a large flag piole with the Turkish flag that can be seen all over Ankara.  Then down to a large flagged area with buildings on 2 sides, the road andthe mausoleum making the 4th side.  It was a snowy day so I felt sorry for the very young soldiers standing on honour guard all around the area.There is a speach made by Atarturk in from memory 1933 which our interpreter says is coming true today.  It exhorts unity and pride in Turkey as being the way forward for Turks.  The Mausoleum itself if both impressive and without and frills, the sarcophagus itself is plain stone with no words.  However the hall has a very special feeling.  In the buildings around the open area house museums but we were too late to look insode.  Overall time well spent to get a small insight into Turkish people and their first leader"
Great museum,"My kids enjoyed this museum. It has a lot of history, great paintings, there where a lot of visitors and much respect for every space. We had the opportunity to see the change of guard which was a great experience for my kids."
FOR ALL HUMANITY,Lets go and always forever!! The great headman to follow for all our future!!! The must first of Ankara if ypu made your first step also as a pasanger!!Please welcome with the food necessary to gulp down !!Vist the Ulus district and eat Ankara Tava as well!!Some sheap's head and food soup in Rumeli restaurant!!
Father of Modern Turkey,One of the most popular places to visit in Turkey. Thousands of visitors comprising locals and internationals are crowding the mausoleum every day.
Atatürk Mausoleum -Anitkabir,Most important visit while in Turkey. Founder and father of Turkish Republic Mustafa Kemal Ataturk rests here  in Ankara. This place must be visited by anyone would like to know more about the most incredible and unforgettable leader of the world.
Impressive,Impressive to visit. It gives a good impression and is very well kept. You'll see many locals visiting and enjoying the visit.
A must see,This is an amazing place to see if you are interested in history or modern day Turkey.  There are so many things to see here and has so many items on display.   Wear your walking shoes because there is a lot of walking to do if you want to see it all.   We went on a rainy day and early in the day and it was not to crowded.  By the time we are leaving it was getting a bit crowded. I would recommend planning on spending about 2 hours.   We don’t speak Turkish but still enjoyed the tour.  If you don’t speak or understand Turkish you might want to go on one of the paid tours.  As you are leaving there is a little cafe where you could get a snack and some tea
A visit here made me wish I was Turkish!,What a great place to visit to really learn about the father of Turkey and what a great man he was!  The museum located underground was very busy unfortunately so we had to breeze through it rather quickly but would've loved to spend more time there.  A MUST SEE place during your stay in Ankara!
Stunning!,This is quite an amazing place ... although we did have to walk a lot to get to it because of some security issue. The museum there is extensive but may not be as interesting to people who do not have interest in minute details of Ataturk's revolution and the various people who helped him. And it gets very crowded. But do ask an official - there will be many around - about the time of the next guard of honor and snag a good spot early to see it up close.
Fun with Children,"For the first time I had to bump my way into the crowded souvenir shop to get the attention of the sales assistant. The children seemed to have fun at the mausoleum and museums, that afterwards they bought souvenirs enthusiastically. It's a very interesting view of how these young students paid respect to the founding father of a nation post Ottoman empire. Not only I learned about Attaturk's endeavor but how his legacy lives on by watching the children from very young age introduced to it."
Ataturk,From birth to death about Ataturk and friends and Turkish Nation;As a militaryAs a revolutainist;As a humang being
Great Turk lays here! ,"Everyone should visit this great memorial! Such a great place and great atmosphere, should watch soldiers shift changing ceremony. There is also a huge museum that Ataturk’s personal items, books, guns and all of his belongings."
Impressive ,"Impressive structure, mausoleum of the famous Atatürk. The stone architecture with a lot of attention to details, the museum, the Hall of Honour & the guards outside, all of it makes a great monument.Atatürk’s cars that are kept on display, which are interesting."
Nice place,"Nice place. Interesting for those who like to know about Turkey's recent history,  specially the foundation of the new state with Mustafa Kamal."
Great Mausoleum of a great historical figure,"This is a great Mausoleum of a man who modernized Turkey, and greatly separated mosque and state. In addition to the tomb, there are also museums in the area, as well as an underground museum to view Ataturk's life and accomplishments."
The most striking visit in Ankara,"This is a great mausoleum for Turkey's founding father. Built cleverly, one can realise the contributions of Ataturk to the country of Turkey and the world through this place. One cannot help but be fascinated by its sheer size, the vast expanse of items on display and the very fact that one is standing in the same complex in which the leader was buried. I thoroughly enjoyed and recommend this place as a must-visit for Ankara. Expect to spend 1 to 2 hours on site,"
A Must-See Place When You Visit Ankara,People from all nationalities around the world should see this place in order to feel and understand the greatest leader of all times!
The highlight of Ankara,This is a striking and fitting memorial to the greatest world leader of the 20th century.  If you have time for just one thing in Ankara then Anıt Kabır should be it.
Must do sightseeing in Ankara,"Atatürk Museum and mausoleum is dedicated to the life of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the first president of the Republic of Turkey. It is a wow experience to see the artefacts, books, his personal collection of gifts from heads of states. Tributes to heroes and important events are captured beautifully. Go early before 9 am, stand in queue and enter as soon as the mausoleum opens, that way you will get the best pictures in the outside grounds. Once you are done with the tour inside, you may get lucky to witness soldiers parade by paying tribute to the founder. Must visit the gardens at the back -  it gets busy with school field trips and tourists so get your photos done early on when entering as by the time you come out - the place will be packed!"
A historial must see of Ankara,Turkey is so rich in culture. If you're making a stop in the capital you really must make a visit here. The collection of Ataturk's past belongings is quite impressive. Along with the display and explaination of past wars and allies. My favourite part is watching the shift change of the guards out front.
"This is where ATATURK  lays to rest, after winning many battles who is responsible for the modernisation of TURKEY.","Ankara is the capital city of Turkey, a very acedemic city with many Universities and Hospitals.Beautiful restaurants and cafes through out the city.Transport facilities first class. with alot of options from Train, underground, coaches, buses and taxes, also very cheap.Transport available from and to Airport."
National(ist) pride - try to visit it on 29 October,"Well worth to visit, perhaps one hour is enough. Climb up, see around adn the view adn visit the small museum. However, things change especially on 29 October, the Republic Day. There are at least 10,000 people coming and going, children yelling manifestoes, people waving flags. People are jsut flowing to this place. What an experience!"
father of modern Turkey,On the road to the Mausoleum and museum of Ataturk we were given an in depth history of this almost universally revered father of the nation. Going through the large museum for an American without a cultural attachment to the man might be like asking a Turk to spend a couple hours in a  US revolutionary war museum or George Washington's Mount Vernon. But one can feel the reverence felt by the population and I gained a sense of respect for this great general and statesman
Interesting and Informative,"I walked the 2.6 miles from the Wyndham hotel, and back, and the walk went by some government buildings and shopping areas. The mausoleum is very informative for anyone not familiar with the founding of modern Turkey. Walking around the grounds reminds one of Greece or Rome, the structures are very formal and serious looking. It’s definitely worth a visit."
"Superb...history, personality and achiements Of Ataturk encompassed so beautiful at one place","It was one of the best spot we’ve seen in Ankara from history point of view...undoubtedly Atatürk is the most Important figure in current turkey, so if you’re really interested in him and his achievements n his miracles in making present turkey from a scratch to the place where turkey stands today, it’s a must visit place...it has a small cafe and souvenir shop inside n it’s real good..."
Interesting spot,"Ataturk is a legend in Turkey, a pretty damn deserved label. This whole site was built to honor him, and has a lot of interesting things too see, but for us, the coolest one, was the change of guards,  wich happens several time along the day, if youre visiting, make sure to watch this."
Better if you have a connection w/Ataturk,"It was a beautiful place and a fitting memorial for a national hero.  Unless you are interested in learning more about Ataturk or have a connection to Turkey, you probably will not spend too much time here.  It was nice, though, to see Turks excited to be there.  Lots of schoolchildren and proud Turks visiting.Entrance is free."
Interesting artefacts,A comprehensive curation of the life and achievements of Ataturk. A great way to learn modern Turkish history.  Peek through one of the windows from inside the building to view Ankara city.
Outstanding ,"The Mausoleum (known as Antıkabir by the locals) is a magnificent construction, placed in a park which takes you away from the crowded/noisy city. The colonnaded tomb of  the former Turkish president Kemal Atatürk, it’s facing a large square. The museum (part of the same building) is so rich with information (from maps and photos, to personal items that once belonged to the former leader). Everything on a large scale, but in this case quantity is also quality. A must if you are in Ankara."
"Free, interesting, must see in Ankara","There aren't that many sites in Ankara so this is a must see. The museum is free and it goes all the way around the building.  It was interesting enough as someone who is not Turkish as the museum narrates the life of Ataturk and the wars that led to Turkey's independence. Well worth a visit.  The gift shop was super crowded with lots of people and the prices were very reasonable (thanks to the favorable exchange rate). I ended up buying a bunch of Ataturk souvenirs like bookmarks, keychains, and magnets! I'm a true fan! There's a shuttle that takes you up the hill. I didn't know until I walked 20 minutes down the hill. Still, this is a beautiful area/garden to explore anyways."
Very informative and interesting place to visit,This place gave us a real overview of how the Sultanate and the Ottoman Empire transitioned into modern day Turkey and the role played by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.. Very nice atmosphere and displays were very informative.
Here where the founding father of Turkish Republic rests,Ataturk moseloum along with the Turkish independence war museup is a must see place for visitors that came to Ankara. It gives you a chance to learn how this brave and visionary man lead a nation to strugle to get its identity and leap forward.
Beautiful tranquility in the big city. ,"We visited on our holiday. It was our first visit to Ankara and the main reason we went there. The grounds are so well kept. There was not a single piece of rubbish or cigarette butt anywhere. We managed to see the changing of the guard at 2pm which was great. There were so many things to see and do, we could have easily spent all day there but because we drove from Antalya we couldn't stay as long as we wanted. The museum was fascinating, the murals and paintings were beautiful. Atatürk's possessions and clothes were so interesting and that library just has to be seen to be believed. It was a wonderful place to visit. The gift shop had loads of things to buy and it was very reasonably priced. Free parking as well and we were amazed that it was free entry. Well worth a visit."
Atatürk,"Very emotional for us Turks to be at Anıtkabir, for foreigners interested in Turkish history and Atatürk, a very important stop."
The Man Who Made Turkey a REpublic,"Ataturk's mausoleum on a hill in Ankara was built after his death in 1937 - a massive museum and tomb are there, though one cannot enter the room with his tomb - having to do with religious practices, but the site is stunning and extremely important to the Turkish people.  It is a very important place for visitors to see in order to understand how modern Turkey came into being."
huge mausoleum of honourable everliving man .,It is an excellent architect complex covering an extensive area within an huge park of variety trees and flowers-plants bought from various area of the earth .
"Visit to a great Man,Atatürk",I have visited the museleum with family with friends and with business people many times and every time I feel great exitment.It is not just the building but more spiritual wonderfulness.I am very proud and grateful to the founder of Turkish Republic.
Great Historic Information,The museum is well-done and has a lot of history. You will learn about Ataturk's career and his beliefs in creating a separate and modern state during a time when the land was considered sultan-ruled and not distinctly modern or independent.The grounds and interior are well kept and it seems to attract a lot of people and bonus that admission is free.Watch the closing times as they do vary by day and plan to spend 2-3 hours there is you are into reading and want to see everything.Its definitely worth a visit if you are in the area.
A view of modern Turkey,Although this is a memorial to Ataturk and his role in founding modern Turkey - it is not just of interest to Turks. There is a museum attached to the mausoleum which gives a good insight into the man behind the nation. Although it is quite nationalistic it is still very interesting to see. The whole complex is kept beautifully and is an oasis in the busy city. Be prepared for strict searches coming to visit this place.
Glory,this place is great. there is the tomb of Ataturk and also a museum of war which is touching. it took about an hour but worth visiting.
Atatürk visit,Atatürk’s Mausoleum is the best in the world. Museum part is extended for years. Very clean place and a lot of people visiting even in weekdays. Giftshop is very nice. Thank you our commander Atatürk for the existance. Ne mutlu Türküm diyene!
Amaze in Ankara- Ataturk Mausoleum,"Be prepared-is a 460 KM drive from Istanbul to Ankara.It took us 5 1/2 hours to reach Ankara and eventually we got to see the amazing structure-Ataturk Mausoleum.The timing we reach was perfect (2.00 pm) as the change of guards are about to happen. All the audience stay quiet for a minute. It would be better to visit the place later in the evening as the environment is much cooler as compare to noon time. Overall, great place to stretch your leg before we travel another 300 KM to Cappadocia."
Great honor to a great man ,The location is on a hill which is dominated all around the city and at night when it ‘s lighting turns on you can feel the presence of this respectable man from every single part of the city and it gives you a good feeling about how Turkish people respect their founder of modern culture and it’s a must visit place in Ankara
history artefact,"Its a beautiful sight, with high security. Lots to see and a great place for good photos. // çok güzel ve fotoğraflar için iyi alan"
Family visit from Canada,We visited Ataturk Mausoleum today during our family trip. It was a great cultural heritage experience for our children (11 and 8 year olds). Gazi Mustafa Kemal Ataturk is the founder of modern Turkey. His life is being celebrated and appreciated at Anit Kabir by millions of visitors around the world.
Anitkabir,"Ataturk, founder of the Turkish Republic and the first president of the republic, died in 1938. Anıtkabir is his mausoleum tomb and you must visit when you come to capital city Ankara"
Remarkable,This is the 20th century Turkish equivalent to America’s Jefferson Memorial or the Lincoln Memorial.  It also has a well done museum on Ataturk!
Amazing view and beautiful walk through,Its really wonderful.The view over ankara is incredible and the walk ak through to ataturk' tomb is nice.
ANITKABiR,"He is the most famous person in our history, he is the man who saves the country, he is the man who builds the country, he is the man who develops the country and he is the man who sees the future and left so many advice to his nation. My HERO, MY LEADER.."
Perfect,"Every child should visit there to see museum. Fabulous place, perfect history. There are some rituals there about soldier you can see them if you catch the shift changing."
It is a MUST.,"Here is not only a tomb, also a museum which has information about independence war and early years of the republic."
A huge place,First of all I am family with teens and young children to gather It is a big place you will walk a lot in side There is a big park out sideYou can find every thing about the history of Turkey between 1915 -1938A drink machines are every where hereThe important thing you have to know about Ankara that the pubic WC for. Free and it is not clean
Monument that can be skipped,"I've seen many monuments to men in my travels but this is one of the most overrated, built on hero worship. As helpful as many of his actions and decisions were for the country (and some were not), this seems equal to a pyramid in Egypt, which, in a democratic country, is a little out of order. This space is, however, large enough for public gatherings and a relief from traffic and busy shops. A little quiet contemplation is never a bad thing."
Worth a Visit,"It is worth a visit as it has a strong significance to the Turkish people. It is also nice to see the architectural design of the whole place which is visually quite amazing. The soldiers put on a great display at the change over of shifts which was a good experience to see. There is a cafe to purchase food, drinks or ice creams. Parking is available close to the entry."
One of the top sightseeings in Ankara,I enjoyed the visit. The monument is beautifully designed and soldiers guarding in the corners are so disciplined they don’t move a muscle! The building is constructed on hilltop so you’ll get a nice view of the city. The museum must be more interesting to the Turks who are so proud of their former president Ataturk but it’s also informing for foreign visitors. The park around the monument is also calm and clean. Overall it was worth the visit.
"If you visit Ankara, you must visit Anıtkabir","You must visit Anıtkabir and the museum when you are in Ankara. I suggest you come with a taxi and take the free shuttle from entrance. If you come with your own car, it is a hassle to enter and exit due to security requirements.Museum explains how Republic of Turkey was found. You can also see the belongings of Atatürk."
Respect and love for the founder of our republic,"It is an impressive architecture decorated with sculptures that narrate Turkish war of independence, flooded by citizens of all ages and all political opinions especially at the national holidays. I strongly recommend the Independence Museum downstairs. You can also see the Nobel  prize of Aziz Sancar, which was presented to the museum."
Impressive Show of Respect,Very impressive mausoleum which shows the Turkish people love & respect for the founder of modern Turkey. It also highlights history & battles to independence. I was fortunate to catch the changing of the Guards.
Best place to visit in Ankara,This place is bar far the best place to visit in Ankara and one of the places in Turkey.It's a spectacular memorial to Ataturk. The exchange of guards was great to see as was the museum.The main memorial building is truly breathtaking.
As Expected,"Well done, but not terribly interesting unless you want to know more about Turkish adoration of Ataturk. Includes a small gift shop and museum."
Amazing place of one of the greatest genius men ever lived,"In every step you feel the spirit of the great leader ATATURK.The atmosphere is much more important than the physical decorations and chambers. For me, no place on earth can ever be worthy of him. But in general, this Mausoleum is bright, carefully thought, modest, humble,enough places to learn the history, not so long way to walk."
Impressive,"I am glad that i have visited the mausoleum. It is really impressive, with the beautiful view on the city. Also the gardens around are nice for a very pleasant walk."
Grand ataturk memorial,"One of must do and sees in ankara. You can walk from entrance to the top , where ataturk memorial is there. City view from top in spectacular"
One of the greatest leaders!,"The life and times of Mustafa Kemal ""Ataturk"" (father of Turks) offer a fascinating insight into what makes a great leader, something we wish so much for our times. A must visit if you are in Ankara."
A good place to learn Turkish History,"Atatürk's mausoleum is simply magnificent! Although the main attraction is the tomb of the founder of modern Turkey, you get surprised with the lot of information that you can learn inside its rooms. Many things have been said about  Atatürk but if you want to know the other side of the story, you should visit this place and understand why he's so beloved by his people and how he changed the destiny of an entire nation defending it from foreigner colonization at the end of WWI."
"Anıtkabir, Mausoleum of the Founder of Modern Republic of Turkey, Must See !","Anıtkabir (Mausoleum of the father of Turks and founder of modern Republic of Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.) You should visit there on your first Ankara trip. There are museums inside of the Anıtkabir which helps you the understand his life and accomplishment of his great vision."
History Lesson in a day,You will learn one day history in this museum. Very nice buildings. Breathtaking details of subjects in each time line.
"Awesome, moving and magnificent.","This mausoleum holds the tomb of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, much loved and revered by all the Turkish people. The site is a must see, not to be missed. You can see the actual tomb on video along with all the artifacts and historical dockementation appertaining to the greatest and most loved Turk-that ever lived."
Don't miss it,Its really interesting place to visit. U can walk in the park enjoy the nature. Inside you can see all the moments of the life of Ataturk. Thisbis one of places everyone should visit in Ankara
Do not miss visiting this place.,"Do not miss visiting this place. It is very close to the subway and it is very easy to find on the subway map since there is a drawing of it on the map in each train. It is absolutely magnificent and the view of the city from there is very beautiful, so do not forget your camera. I also advise you to take sun glasses for everyone since it is a vast area and the sun could be very annoying."
A must see,"The mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal ATATÜRK is a must see in Ankara. It may be quiet crowded in normal times, but i highly recommend you to visit during 29th of October."
"If you want to learn about the great man, this is the place to come.","The mausoleum shows great reverence to Ataturk. The area was full of citizens paying respect, and is clearly a venue for graduation photos. The museum is fantastic - we learned much about the great man. Fairly good for children, and great for adults. Impressive venue - surrounded by green and a long driveway followed by a long walk way before you reach the actual mausoleum complex. Impressive and statuesque rather than beautiful. If you want to learn about the great man, this is the place to come."
No trip to Ankara is complete without a visit here,Wonderful visit to see the mausoleum for the great Turkish leader Ataturk. It is set in nice grounds with great architecture. Highly recommend.
Anitkabir,"One of the few tourist attractions in Ankara.  Worth a visit to understand the reason Ataturk is held with such esteem.  Talk to the guides, quite a few speak English and they are willing to explain anything to you.  Watch the changing of the guards.  Spring is a good time to see the gardens.  If you really want to understand why Ataturk's picture is everywhere in the city, read the book The Star and the Crescent first, it gives an amazing insight in to the life of the man"
Heart of Ankara,"May be the top of the must see places. No need for much words, the moseleum of Atatürk, the father of Turks and Turkey.A historical place including a great museum."
Changing of Guards,Time your visit to coincide with the changing of guards. There is nothing much to see in the area except a museum within. Overall worth a visit as it is the mausoleum of the founder of the Republic of Turkey.
Impressive,Large area including the mausoleum and side buildings.  Was able to watch the changing of the guard which is always impressive. The main entry is lined with statues of lions.  There is a nice view from the terrace.
A grand monument to the single pivotal figure in modern Turkey history,"The buildings and grounds are impressive, both in size and clean architecture. The museum portion is well-done and quite informative - think of the George Washington of modern Turkey. Be prepared to walk a fair amount and go up and down in elevation, but it is a nice place to visit."
Excellent day out!,A great monument to Ataturk.  Spotlessly clean and well maintained. The museum is huge and full of information.  Well worth a visit.
They said anitkabir ,Local say this place anitkabirIt’s a big place and in my opinion in ankara you don’t have lots of place to visit and this attraction can be good
"Definitely, the most interesting thing to visit in Ankara","One of the most interesting sights that can be seen in Ankara. The mausoleum is majestic, but not pathos decorations, but for simplicity and magnitude. We traveled with a small child in the carriage, sometimes there was no way for the carriage to drive.In general, it was pleasant, and if you are in the capital of Turkey - definitely visit this mausoleum."
One attraction in a big city.,"I went to this place and on way before reaching I thought it must be a small place to see. But there are guards doing the changing and certain hours of the day. I heard it is 2 hourly. This AM is very large. Out of this   countries cal,l it as Mustaffa Kamal  Mausoleum, There are parks and in around this place. At the time of my visit there are foreign dignitaries laying of wreath to MK A with all the soldiers marching up and doing the salute,. Nice to see the respected  father of modern Turkey here and there are museums to read the history of Ataturk ."
A Must,"If you are visiting Ankara in your trip, this place is definitely a must to visit to learn more about the Independence War of Turkey and the founder of Republic of Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. Give yourself at least 2 hours and wear appropriate clothing as it is a spiritual place."
Amazing ,"It was an amazing trip to Ataturk Mausoleum, beautiful gardens, wonderful museum. I like especially the changing guards routine."
A visit to Ataturk Mausoleum,"A must visit place in Ankara, the capital city of Turkey. At Ataturk Mausoleum you could have a closer look to the life and contribution of Ataturk, the father of modern Turkey. It is also the final resting place of İsmet İnönü, the second President of Turkey. Guards changing at the Mausoleum is the must see part. You could buy souvenirs from the Souvenir shop inside Ataturk Mausoleum complex. Many types of souvenirs for you to purchase. The design of Ataturk Mausoleum is very grand and unique. You could take many photos especially at the Lion road. The garden is very well maintain too. The flowers are extremely beautiful. The staffs and guards are friendly too. They will try to help if u need any help. An amazing site which is highly recommend for tourist who is visiting Ankara"
Wow,"What an excellent way to learn about the history of modern Turkey and its founder, Ataturk.  Simply an amazing site to visit."
An essential destination,"The scale of this place, and its theatrical impact, are amazing. it is well worth a a visit if you are in the vicinity. The surrounding park is very enjoyable but a pre-read of some of the history and features to look for will add to the pleasure of your walk around this monument if you are not on a guided tour."
Very impressed ,Although it’s a long walk to get to the entrance from metro it was well worth it magnificent building poignant memorial to the founder of a great country
Breathtaking...,"Well you love the Turkish culture or you don't. For the ones who do, this is like the most important stop you can make.The place is truelly breathtaking, the grandeur and architecture is beyond belief. Be sure to not only visit the tomb and central square but pay a visit to the museum to. It explains the life of Ataturk and the changes he made to transform Turkey in a vast modern economical powerhouse.... picked up a great memorabilia at the end of the tour, but my wife lost it an hour later...grrrr.Have fun in Ankara"
One of the 2 essentials in Ankara,"Other one is Anatolian Civilizations museum in Citadel. To understand the Turkish People 's devotion to Atatürk and the Republic save an hour or two for AnıtKabir, worth the visit. It is free."
Great side seeing!,"While I was on business in Ankara, i decided to take a break to recommebded sides, and this side was full of surprises, bot only security was very uninformative and nice to us. Even gave us an umbrella to use. The inside was explain mostly in Turkish but the guide they provided spoke perfevt english and we learned a bit more about the big traumas and war that Turkey went thru the years. A must do to understand this culture."
Homage to founder of Turkey,"A nice place to visit and pay homage to founder of modern turkey. Nice experience, interested guys can also witness the flag lowering ceremony performed by guards at the mausoleum."
Must visit place in Ankara,At first sight there is nothing special but if you are familiar with turkish history this place is must visit for you. The soldier changing process is extremely touching.
The father of the Turks!!!,"Anıtkabir is a Mausoleum of Ataturk who is father of the Turks and leader of the 19th century as described on the page of New York Times in 1923. Not only he was one of the greatest leaders in the history but also he is founder of the modern Republic of Turkey. He did great works about education, enfranchisement, industry, agriculture, gender equality and many things. Anıtkabir is not only a place which has a stunningly architectural view also it’s a monument that has an intensive emotional meaning for Turks. If you plan to visit this lovely place, you should definitely read and know something about Ataturk. You should visit it in spring and autumn I mean between April and June, September and late October these are the most appropriate time to visit."
Wonderfull,"Without doubt one of the most famous and important places in Turkey is the Anıtkabir in Ankara. It is the mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of the republic of Turkey. Everyone who ever visited Turkey knows about the great importance of this man for the Turkish people, so it is no wonder that his tomb has to be something very special."
History about 1st President,"Modern Turkish history lay here. When I was here, its time for guard army change their shift. Nice to see. Come early morning, no people because even on working day also got crowds and meed to long queue to the museum"
The legacy lives on..... ,"Info: I’ve visited this museum 3-4 times in the past, it’s a museum in the memory of Ataturk. General and leader of the Turkish army. Pros:- Plenty of displays to visit and see. - the changing of the guard. (Watch the soldiers change guard) - the museum building itself is quite pretty. - learning about AtaturkSummary, if your interested in the history of turkey, this is the place to be educated."
Visit to the museum where the first and second presidents of Turkey are resting,Very interesting to see the various wars fought by the first presidents of Turkey. Interesting pictures and statues. Very nice experience not to be missed.
Excellent,there are many people and is very beatiful is good place you must go there . I think big man there is boy .
ATAM Huzurundayız,"Burasını anlatmaya kelimeler yetmez. ATAM seni yaşarken göremedik ama en azından kabrini ziyaret edebilmek bile bizim için büyük bir şeref oldu. Ne mutlu ölmeden bir kez bile olsa kabrini ziyaret edip seni hala oradaymışsın gibi hissedebilmek bu millet için  yaptıklarını fedakarlıklarını tekrar kendi gözlerimizle görüp yaşayabilmek.There is no any words to tell here. Even if we could not see you(I mean ATATÜRK) in live , visiting your cemetery is being a great honour for us. It's not easy to be the great man in the world , you can just understand at the moment  what I mean when you visit his library. There is almostly 4300 books which many of them in french and germany belongs to The great leader ATATÜRK.Be sure that in history , a few people may be same as him. I'm proudly of to be the child of the great leader Mustafa Kemal ATATÜRK."
A Must see in Ankara,"To understand what Ataturk means for most Turks one must visit the Mausoleum. He is after-all the father of the Turks, at least the secular ones."
ALWAYS IN,"This place is always in between turkish tourists as is the moseleum of founder of modern Turkey.You will ba captured by the ambience,kids around,turkish soldiers,road of lions and marble ground.The museum is a must seen place,plus film."
Must visit here..,The most important place in Turkey.. you must visit this place.. It's priceless to be there.. You have to breathe this atmosphere and see who is Ataturk for Turkey..
The Most Famous Place in Ankara,"Anıtkabir (Ataturk Mausoleum) is the mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the leader of the Turkish War of Independence and the founder and first President of the Republic of Turkey. It is located in Ankara and was designed by architects Professor Emin Onat and Assistant Professor Ahmet Orhan Arda, whose proposal beat 48 other entries from several countries in a competition held by the Turkish Government.I saw a few memoirs and pictures of Reza Shah (Former king of Iran) and it was very interesting for me."
A must visit! ,"If you know anything about Ataturk, he defined modern day Turkey and it was extremely important that I pay my respects and understand better how he impacted a Republic."
Ataturk Mausoleum is a must visit place in Ankara,"The Ataturk Mausoleum symbolises 2 important points, For one, it is the mausoleum for the highly respectable late admiral Ataturk who fought tirelessly for what turkey is today and secondly, it reflects the spirit of strong nationalism and patriotism of the Turks for their country and for Ataturk. The place is huge with the main display area on the right which houses Atatürk’s main mausoleum and it is heavily guarded with scores of his personal belongings, copies of letters from foreign head of governments, titles and awards, huge pictures complete with both written & audio narrations on how he has won the war for Turkey against Greece’s aggression in the famous war of Çanakkale battle in 1921.There is a well stored souvenir shop when one can buy memorable mugs, tie pins, t-shirts, caps, posters, replica statute etc of this incredible statesman that commands phenomenal respect of every Turk. Not forgetting to view the change of guards at every half an hour interval at the open square and it is definitely a beholding sight not to be left out.Also worth seeing is the section on the left that housed Atatürk’s limousines where one can see clearly what were the cars he used to travel around in the early 20th century."
"A ""Must See"" Stunning Memorial ","A huge, wonderfully majestic square and mausoleum building in a super location peacefully overlooking Ankara. A fitting memorial to the father of a nation. A must see for any visitor to the city. We were fortunate as during our time there the President of Djibouti paid a state visit with a full Turkish military escort which added  more spectacle to our visit"
Awesome sneak into turkish history,The location is very scenic for those who love photography. Those who are into history will love this place as it gives extensive Turkish history during Mustafa Kemal Ataturk's reign
Worth the visit despite the cold,Very interesting slice of Turkish Culture. Beautiful buildings and interesting narrative. The changing of the guard was well done.
Great Leader and impresive mozeleum,We visit Anitkabir few times in every year. The most impresive and meaningfull place in Turkey. Every day we understand better how great leader Ataturk was and is!!
The eternal place of the great turkish ancestor.,It is the eternal place of the great turkish ancestor. The founder of the republic of turk lies here. It has a wonderful architecture that brings to visitors great respect. All personel were kind.Every year millions of people go there to present their great ancestor gratitude.
A must in Ankara,"Dedicated to the founder of modern Turkey, Atatürk, and independence war, this mausoleum is a must for anyone wishing to understand the heritage of Atatürk and its meaning to people still today. Remember to enter through the main gate, which gives you the right impression and dimensions of the monument. If you are lucky, you will be able to witness a ceremonial wreath deposition to the Atatürk's tomb. They are popular and take place very often by schools, alumnus, associations, etc."
"Ataturk, a great leader, not only for the Turks but also for the peoples of the world","Ataturk, a great leader, not only for the Turks but also for the peoples of the world. This is not onşy a mausoleum, there are lots of other historical data that you can find. If you ever plan to come Ankara, visit here also."
Founder of Turkish Republic ,"Impressive place.Great respect from everybody. Not only Mustafa Kemal Atatürk but also his friends from army and governmental time after our victory war, they have corners in Anıtkabir museum."
Tranquil place,"Only a quick visit, but enjoyable.  Interesting museum and good gift shop.  Fun to watch the changing of the guards."
Must go if in Ankara.,Must go in ankara. The place worth an half day visit.You cam reach by walk fromm Kizilay with a 20 mins walk.If you are a Instagram fan yoo can take really nice pics from there.
Koray,Atatürk Mouseleum is a must-see place for every Turkish citizen to appreciate the roots of the foundation of the Turkish Republic. It should be visited by children especially.It is very much adviseable for foreigners alike.Very impressive indeed.
You must visit,"I visited this place while I was in Ankara . You must Anit Kabir.the only place to visit and see it. It is free admission. And free car park just around the corner . In side there are many art , pictures and museum. About Mustafa Kemal Atatürk was a Turkish army officer, revolutionary, and founder of the Republic of Turkey, serving as its first President from 1923 until his death in 1938."
Fascinating,A fascinating place to visit and an insight into a great man. The Ataturk Mausoleum is free ( unlike many places of interests ). My suggestıon is to arrive just before the hour and watch the changing of the guard and then wonder through the underground museum
amazing piece of history!,Great place to visit in Ankara. Not only to find out more about Ataturk but also about all time of his ruling. Inside there is kinda of museum which tell a lot about I World War.
Nice place to visit,It's nice place to visit well handled .Also it's a symbol for Turchish people. There is a garden inside well mantained. Also security it's safe. The military also it's so kindly .If you visit Ankara must atop here
The greatest Monument,This is where the founder of Turkey Mustafa Kemal Ataturk rests. It is an impressive moseleum which was build during the 1930's. The facility has a museum of featuring the Republic war and era. A must see location.
Ataturk monument,It is a great historical place. One of the good sightseeing places in Ankara. Too much history behind it too
A touristic attraction,This place was the monument of Ataturk. The turkish leader and founder of the Turkish republic. It was built really nice and beautiful
Atatürk's Mausoleum,It is very impressive to watch cartouche photos and sculptures and videos of The Dardanelles War during visiting all halls of the Mausoleum
impressive,"It’s located in an imposing position in the Anittepe quarter of Ankara. The Mausoleum of Kemal Ataturk, founder of the Turkish Republic, was built between 1944 – 1953 with an impressive fusion of ancient and modern architectural ideas and remains unsurpassed as an accomplishment of modern Turkish architecture. It covers an area of 750.000 square meters. There is a museum housing writings, letters and items belonging to Ataturk as well as an exhibition of photographs recording important moments in his life and the establishment of the Republic. An important exhibition of the War of Liberation is also open to the public. Ismet Inonu, comrad in arms of Ataturk and the second president of the Republic, is also buried in the courtyard facing the Mausoleum. (Anitkabir and the museum is open everyday, except Mondays. During the summer, there is a light and sound show in the evenings)"
Great landmark in Ankara,"Anitkabir is a symbolic of this city , grand , simple but amazing . I recommend take a look inside the museum carefully you will understand why Turkish respect this leader . Do not forget to see the soilders there , they are awesome with great body and perfect face , i can say the most handsome soilders are in Anitkabir ."
Very Significant Sight to Understand,"A must visit if in area.  You'll get a very good appreciation of the respect the Turkish people have for their country and flag.  Very well done memorial for the father of their democracy .The changing of guards is a highlight . My only negative is the constant movement of black suits walking around the soldiers.  In sure it must be needed, but it is distracting ."
Great visit,We went on a Saturday and it was crowded but we still enjoyed the experience.  Fascinating for those interested in history.
High point of visit to Ankara,"Ataturk brought the Latin alphabet to Turkey and got the people to write from left to right--huge accomplishment.  But that was only the beginning.  He helped secularize the government (alas, the present leadership seems to be taking that in the opposite direction).  A high point at this grand monument was the hourly changing of the guard.  Quite a spectacle."
"Informative museum, impressive structures",We really enjoyed our visit here and felt like we had a better grasp of what has shaped modern Turkey.  The displays are informative and the artwork tells the story.
HUGE and impressive,"we visited the premieres at late afternoon and we were not aware about the closing time, so we had to rush our tour and unfortunately we were unable to see the private cars and some part of the museum. so i strongly recommend to visit early as it is very big and need time to complete as you can only walk. we witnessed the soldier walking show in the main open area in front of the tomb. you can buy some souvenirs in the museum but if the weather is hot i suggest not to enter as for a unknown reason they don't have air conditioners inside. check the garden a lovely place to walk through and take some photos in the lovely nature. P.S the guards are not so cooperative so don't bother to ask for help."
It is a must,"If you will visit only one place in Ankara, Anitkabir is the place. it is a must. As a museum as a building, as a meaning, it is unique. Dont let the cheap popularity of the new staff and ugly Kulliyes confuse you. Dont miss it."
"Great landmark, museum is a little gimmicky","The mausoleum itself is really nice, the change of guard is great to watch is also good to watch.The museum is gimmicky with mock ups designed to make it more of a story telling experience but comes across as tacky, and takes away from the real gravity of the situation."
Very nice,"Anıtkabir is the mausoleum of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the leader of the Turkish War of Independence and the founder and first President of the Republic of Turkey. Huge monument on a huge plot. Big museum under ground with lots to see and read about. Also witnessed a changing of the guard which was great to see."
Must see if in Ankara,"If already in Ankara which is otherwise a bit boring, this is a must see. The mausoleaum and monument for the father of  the fatherland is an impressive complex resembling an egyptian temple. The big hall with the symbolic grave of Ataturk (the real tomb is below) is serene. The museum about Ataturk and the history of the founding of the republic i interesting although naturally biased and very nationalistic, but why not."
"In Memory of the ""father of the Turks"" ","Atatürk was the first president of the republic of Turkey. He is not only important for Turks, but also for many other countries. The mausoleum, erected between 1944-1953 by Turkish architect Emin Onan, shows how much he is loved and still admired by many people. The building is absolutely impressive and reminded me of a Greek temple. Also located on the Anitkabir/Mausoleum area is a museum about Atatürk which should be visited by all interested in history. He truly was a great and important historical figure for Turkey and other countries and the whole area definitely is a great portayal of pride connected to him and his actions. Don't miss this amazing piece of architecture and historical remembrance while you are in Ankara."
Impressive Place,If you are in Ankara you should definetly visit Anıtkabir. Impressive architecture and full of history.
A hot day,"If I was writing review on another city (like Istanbul or Paris), I was not putting this place at priority list (although it's good to get know about the Turkish history by visiting this place).But we are talking about Ankara, where this is one of the few historical places you can visit.So if you are in Ankara and interested to history, museum and culture, I recommned to visit it definitely.The day we went there, it was very hot. In fact once you are in outdoor, there is no tree or place you can hide yourself from sun. You have to go inside buildings if it's a hot day (as we faced such situation on second half of September).The museum is the most interesting part of the place."
Mausoleum ,"It's an amazing place take time out and go see this wonderfully done architecture if u go with a guide it's better so all details are told well it's got a bit of walking as the area is large so be ready ,,,the change of guard is a great thing to come across ... the details the museum everything is worth the visit"
Highlight in Ankara,"The Atarturk Mausoleum is situated on a hill in the center of Ankara. It is an oasis of calm in the city. We were lucky when we arrived as the change of the guarded started. Each country has its own way of doing so, but this one is still different with the guards stamping on the pavement at regular intervals.The Mausoleum is in a big square. When you stand in front of the mausoleum, enter the museum on the right side. It is for free and you can get an English speaking soldier who will guide you through the whole museum. The museum explains how modern Turkey was built and what role Mustafa Kemal Ataturk played in the founding of the nation. At a certain moment, you pass a huge door behind which Ataturk rests. Once you have done the tour, walk up to the building and enter the mausoleum itself. Contrary to other mausoleums I have seen in other countries, this one shows much more respect."
The most important place in Ankara,"If you're in Ankara, you must not leave before visiting this mausoleum. It is certainly one of the most important monuments of Turkey. I'd advise visiting when it's less crowded, be it very early hours or in the period outside of the tourist season, because the crowd can ruin the experience a bit. A museum is also included which has an interesting collection related to Atatürk and the beginnings of the Republic. Don't miss it!"
A must see amazing historic site,This is the one place you must visit when you are in Ankara. It is dedicated to the Turkish George Washington. Once you walk through the museum you will have a greater appreciation for turkish pride. Ataturk made turkey the great nation it is today. He was a visionary ahead of his time. I hope all of the turkish people get a chance to see this museum and their history and take away the respect for the man who understood that turkey must be a secular government not a islamist run government.
Historical place,I liked the place it tells about Turkey history.It was an interesting visit we learned a lot of the new development after the empire.
An amazing site,I recently visited the mauseleum of Attaturk and the attached museum. It was time well spent. The whole site is on a grand scale with items associated with his funeral and procession on show. The spread of buildings was impressive.The changing of the guard provided an interesting aside to the splendour of the place.This was indeed a suitable resting place for one of the great men of the 20th century. A place that cannot be left off the list of asny visitor to Ankara.The museum contained an impressive collection of artefacts and paintings associated with the life of Attaturk and proved very interesting.  There were also recreations of the trenches from the 1914-18 war and the War of Independence.A very informative visit.
Very informative Memorial and Museum about Ataturk and Turkey Modern History,"It is a good place to visit as a start point to learn about Modern Turkey Historyb and Mustapha Kamal Ataturk, The place full of Items and photos as well as nice surroundings."
An unforgettable Experience,"All I can say is you must include a visit to Anitkabir during your time in Ankara, if you want to understand Turkey and its wonderful people."
Must see!,"Stunning location, incredible achitecture. Definitely a must see, take your time and enjoy walking around. Visit the museum, you got to know a lot about Turkish history!"
A must see when viairing Ankara,Anitkabir is a MUST see when visiting Ankara.  Take an afternoon to stroll through the place and surround yourself with the wonderful history of Turkey.  We went on a Saturday afternoon and it was quite busy but we were still able to get around and see all the sights.  Anitkabir is a great spot for pictures and they have a wonderful gift shop and cafe on sight with reasonable prices.  All in all a great way to spend an afternoon in Ankara.
History,"Ataturk Mausoleum is truly the highlight of Ankara. Located on a hill in the center of the city, this piece of history provides one a good hike and look into Ankara of the past and into the life of Turkeys infamous leader Ataturk."
Good view,Need to see a good place you should go to anitkabir. Big area mistic atmosphere and clean place go and see
Ataturk's Mausoleum,This was one of the best places to visit in Turkey.  The history and information provided is immensely interesting and gives great incite into Ataturk.  Excellent!!I would definitely visit it again.
great leader,I strongly recommend you to read Ataturk's life before to come here. It's necessary to understand why the Turkish love him so much. If you do it the atmosphere will change. Otherwise just stone tomb.
Great monument for a great person,"For the deed that Mustafa Kemal did for Turkey and the way he transformed it, this monument speaks it all. Amazing illustrations of his life, private items, and reconstruction of the battle for independence."
Huge mausoleum For Atatürk,"This is a gigantic mausoleum for Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. The entrance is free and might be the most famous site in Ankara for travelers.- Called as 'Anıtkabir' in Turkish.- Entrance is free. But, securities check belongings thoroughly when visitors enter.- A group of Students can be seen often.- Having it in a wide area, visitors walk a lot. It seemed there's a shuttle until the mausoleum.- Not only is the building of mausoleum to see, but also there are more exhibitions.- The guards taking turns are interesting to watch as well."
Important for an Appreciation of Modern Turkey,"Although the narratives and imagery are, (understandably) somewhat one-sided in tone, the mausoleum and attached museum offer an appreciation of the founding of modern Turkey. The scale of the monument is inspiring. The number of visitors can make a detailed appreciation of the museum exhibits somewhat difficult, but this only serves to underline the importance of this site."
Nice place,Awesome garden! and very pretty architecture. the change of guards is very interesting as well ( it happens every hour and is worth to wait for it). the museum does not have as many things to see as I was waiting for....but it is a mandatory place to see
"Great Visit, Even for Foreigners","I am not very familiar with Turkish history, but I found myself staying in the capitol for business.  It is a hike up to the monument, but its worth the visit to see.  Great views of the city and there are some interesting things to learn, even if you aren’t Turkish.  Its free to visit but you will need to go through a security checkpoint.  Just make sure you wear good walking shoes."
Important visit if you are a fan of Ataturk ,"As a great fan of Ataturk, this was on my top list to do in Ankara , the place is amazing from outside , but inside I was little disappointed with the content , it was all about his military greatness , little or nothing about his political and culture achievements."
Smells like history,You need to know the basics about this place before you go. It's not only contains resting place of Ataturk who is the father of all Turks but also has all artifacts of him and living history tour of independence struggle of Turkish Republic. You can find very eager to help translator inside especially my suggestion will be Mehmet. He is good. I always try to be objective in my travels to reap the best results. As a result I left that beautiful place happily and with much more information about great men of Turks.
historically important,"It doesn't matter if you appreciate Ataturk's legacy or not, this place is a must visit just to understand how this great man built modern turkey, from the ruins of the ottoman empire.i liked the round walking between the buildings, and of course the wonderful views of Ankara."
Interesting,This is a place you definitely must see if you wish to better understand Turkey and its history.....
Bombastic With a Big B,"Most Turkish people have a selfie here on their bucket list, but there a better backdrops for your vanity shots."
Very inportant place to see the efforts of people to have civilization,"Anitkabir, Ataturk museum is very nice place to see all the effort of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk's and anatolian people to improve civilization level"
Perfect for a hero,"This is a perfect place to go and pay respect to Ataturk, the modernizer and liberator of modern day Turkey. Set in beautiful grounds, clean and well visited, it has a happy yet slightly somber feel to the place. I love when there is the changing of the guard."
Must See,Very interesting place with all the history of the Turkish empire.  Would definitely recommend this place for a visit.
