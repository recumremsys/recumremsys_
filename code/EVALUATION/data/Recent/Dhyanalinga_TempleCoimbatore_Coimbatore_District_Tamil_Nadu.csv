Amazing experience,Best place to enjoy the silence of nature. Meditation hall was mind blowing and must visit place in Coimbatore
Wonderful meditative ambience,"It is a wonderful place to sit and meditate. The atmosphere is very conducive to higher states. Due to the high flow of people and to avoid interruption during meditation, every 15min a bell rings allowing people to come in and out."
Perfect ,The perfect place for meditating in silence. The overall ambience and the structural brilliance of the place is simply amazing.
This was an amazing experience.,If you want to find out the basic in life this is it. This is true you find out your inner balance and if you stay for a week or longer you will have great food in great company eating in silence. There are different options for lodging from the very basic to more luxury. There is a great spa and you can signup for courses and free yoga.Very much recommended. Look up Sudhguru and find YouTube and listen to Sudhguru. He explains the most complicated issue in a very understanding way.Thanks Christina
Powerful,"The bold, strong and powerful existence of the dome and the Linga within it, overwhelms you into a meditative state. If one is evolved to an extent, and comfortable with oneself and the quietness of mind, they may relish the experience. Else, it can be eerie and cause discomfort that one may want to strut away asap, not even sitting through the brief 15 min time that is usually given. Coughs of adults and whimpers and crying of children spoiled my experience, but experiencing this is good."
A powerful energy force conducive to meditation,"It is like no other place I have ever been. As soon as you are in the vicinity  of the Dhyanalinga you go into another state of being. I was in awe of the energy that was transmitted and kept wanting to go back there again and again. It is a powerful experience to meditate in the presence of the Dhyanalinga. I highly recommend going if you have the opportunity, it has the potential to transform your life."
Totally relaxing,"Visited here during a business trip to Coimbatore and was stunned by the peace and tranquility of the site.  Yes it is becoming commercialised but so are many visitor attractions around the world.The temple visit was, although not a particularly religious person, energising and relaxing! 15 minutes of contemplation where I thought of nothing but my mother who passed away 20 years ago.The Shiva sculpture is enormous and awe inspiring and although busy very well worth a visit if ever in the area.Made my trip to Coimbatore so much more enjoyable."
Interesting,"Really enjoyed visiting Adiyogi Shiva and Dhyalinga temple. All staff/volunteers were very smiley and welcoming, I was left with a strange feeling about the foundation. Definitely worth a visit and a Google!"
Best place must visit,Superb energy .. Must visit...it is spiritual place.. Any one can visit irrespective of cast creed religion..
So peaceful,This temple is in Isha foundation. This temple is so nice and peaceful environment. This temple gives different happiness to our mind.
The most powerful meditation spot I have experienced. 15 minutes passes like a minute.,"Visiting Dhyanalinga after taking a dip at the nearby Suryakund (for gents) or Chandrakund (for ladies) you experience the awesomeness of the space. It is energetically charged, and slipping into serene states of meditation is easy. Especially recommended during new moon and‚Ä¶"
Excellent experience,"Dhyanalinga is a form of Shiva created by Sadguru, to bring life force focused on one's growth. I arrived around 3pm. It took us around 2-3 hours inside. To enter one has to leave mobile and shoes outside. The whole visit starts with a dip in a pond specially created. The holy‚Ä¶"
"mesmarising, peeeeace","Goood place to visit, All together appears to be difference place no comparision to any existing place in india. Could be better to plan to visit the place by 4:00pm onwards so that sadguru may be avaialble during evening.   During meditation @ dhyanalinga,  i sensed lot of‚Ä¶"
"Amazing ,calming & unique","Peaceful,fulfilling experience, amazed by the clockwork functioning ,people are v.friendly & polite. Must visit"
Inner peace,"If you want to go in search of inner peace, then this is the place to visit and stay there for a couple of days."
Unexplainable peaceful place!,"Dhyanlinga, the place, I would like never to leave this place. Where I automatically cut off myself from the earthly world, without any special efforts! Wonderful experience cannot be described in words!"
A day out at Isha foundation ,"One of the largest linga temple I have visited.Very organised ,clean and peaceful Zero discrimination!Clean and hygienic toilets Vegetarian food available for purchase apart from prasadams provided by the foundationBhairava carts available for ferrying people from dhyana linga to parking lotMust visit if you are around Coimbatore"
Tranquility at its best,"The Dhyanalinga Temple is one of the most peaceful places at the Isha Center in Coimbatore. The absolute quiet inside the dome can make even the most distracted person meditate. A bell rings every 15 minutes, signaling people to enter or leave the temple without disturbing anybody. Make sure to bathe in the Kunds before entering the Dhyanalinga for an even more meditative experience"
Peaceful ,"Very peaceful, it attracts you like a magnet. Puja done twice a day is simply awesome. No elaboration here but touches you to the insides. Grace is there, but are we ready to receive it , is a question . Felt the magic for sure üôè"
Amazing peaceful place,Go there only if you wish your peacefulness to permeate through you. Best time to visit: early mornings. Avoid weekends. Also try to be a part of the naad aradhana that happens twice a day.
Quiet and peaceful,"Impressive place, but also raises expectation of a mind blowing inner experience which it was not.What was lovely was to see so many respectful quiet people waiting their turn to spend 15 minutes in contemplation.Perhaps I expected a deeper than normal meditation in such surroundings.. So entirely my fault I'm disappointed in that count."
Good,"Dhyanalinga temple, beautiful temple, overall good atmosphere for pray and relax , located in a beautiful place"
Spiritual,Very very very very Spiritual and rejenuvating experience to achieve..rare chance to have such experience
Heavenly feeling,"I do not know what heaven is feels like but if highest level of satisfaction is the goal then definitely this place. Just be there and close eyes, everything happens by itself."
Must visit,I have done my Inner Engineering and Shoonya meditation from Isha. I do meditate daily. But if you meditate inside Dhyanalinga then you can feel the difference. All the energies flow inside you. And there is only positive energy. About one and half hours drive from Coimbatore by cab. It will cost about 600-900. I will suggest to check both Ola and Uber fares before booking.
Meditation Place,It's a good place for people who are looking for meditation. Well managed and volunteers are their to guide and support  .One can not take phone inside and can't click pictures.
Divinity at its best,"Located in the foothills of veliangiri hills , an hour drive from coimbatore is a place not to miss. Isha foundation manages this temple and peace and serenity are at its peak. If you are a meditator ,this is the place for you. You come out of this temple as a different and new personality."
ECHO Environment,Must visit this place to see how they made individual block with echo. I personally felt some negative vibration in this ashram.
No Pictures allowed,It was ok for the purpose of the visit but I felt like something weird going on there. All the staff looks like they have been brain washed and honestly felt like they were walking zombies. They will not let you take pics apart from the giant Shiva statue. They even ask you to leave the mobile phones at the check in area. It is free to visit. But little odd!
Sit in peace,The location is about an hour (give or take) from Coimbatore; it is worth the ride out (and there will be plenty of options for getting back to the city). Sit in the silence. Let the silence speak. You came this far. So linger in the pauseOf the peaceOf stillness.
Inner Peace and Divine place,We attended aarti at Dhyanalinga. Absolute quiet place. Aarti is for 20 minutes and during that time it is better if no one can stand or move. Time is from 1150 to 1210 hrs.
Meditation,"Super management, pin drop silence for meditation ,excellent, no word to explain their all facilities"
A day visit in Coimbatore,"The place is best suited for those who is interested or have belief in spiritual things, the 112 feet adiyogi statue and dhayanaliga is the main attraction, It is situated in the foothills of veliangiri hills, also a visit a Shiva temple approx 2 km from adiyogi.After visiting adiyogi statue and yogeshwara Linga, we visited the other part where a big Nandi was present, Suryakund (energizing bath) , Matha Bhairavi temple, free yoga sessions and dhanalinga is there and also a wall where you could see God Shiva in his 3 formPlease note : Mobile phones and sleepers are not allowed, but no worries they have a well managed counter. And there is no entrance fees any where in the campusThe seasame Lando is tasty but costlyCanteen is available, but you will not find much food variety and the taste is ok ok but expensive"
""" The Meditation "".","Dhyanalinga ,at ISHA,ooh!GOD,how to Express the feel at this space for meditation!the soul searching exercise!The depth of focus,self realisation,and the resultant energy one derives by sitting with closed eyes ,in pin drop silence at this Divine temple is incredible.Far from the chaos of madding crowd/ maddening crowd/one can meditate on total solitude ,only your own breath and inner voice to give company....and come out totally rejuvenated.The healthy atmosphere ,clean air and premises and the positive energy that radiates are something only experienced by visiting with a purpose."
Good Place,"Though its bit overcrowded in weekends, it is a good place to visit. The place is maintained very cleanly. I have visited only once and hence I will not comment on the yoga or the meditation practices conducted here."
"Dhyanalinga - ISHA , experience the power of yogic realities","The place can be reached from Coimbatore.  Great place to stay for a couple of days and meditate.  The yogics experience what you actually want your mind to perceive or receive a blessing .   The gurus teaching are essential.There are two sacred bathing ghats with lingas for men and women.  I enjoy the Gurus music nadabrahmam, books and food.  A great experience.  First mile and last mile connectivity matters."
good place for meditation,"a calm place for meditation. but I haven't got to feel any positive lift by sitting here, may be I am not  tweaked for it, don't know"
Powerful and Energised Temple,"Dhyanlinga Temple is the abode of Shiva.  The Shiv Ling is gigantic and prior to entering the temple one can feel the positive vibrations if you are sensitive to energy.The volunteers dressed in their white dress welcome the devotees with a smile and in silence.There are several carved statues outside the temple.Once you enter the temple you are mesmerised by the beauty of the temple and the Shiv Linga.  Volunteers are also inside the temple guiding the devotees.There's so much energy and you feel in peace, joy in that particular area and be in a meditative state. Even those who do not mediate can sit and feel relieved and content within themselves.It is a place where one can discover their inner self and release the stress, and be revitalised and energised.The temple can be visited by every person as long as they remain quiet.  Children can be accompanied with their family members and take darshan.I was lucky to be visiting Dhyan Linga on a full moon day (purnima) where special prayers are done and people can do offering water or milk.  It is festivity period as the ashram is vibrant and the energy level is at it's peak.  There are special prayers.I would highly recommend visitors to spend some time at the Dhyanlinga as it's the place where one can find peace, clarity, knowledge and inner power.Please note pictures are not allowed in the temples.Thank you Sadhguru for taking care of humanity."
Awesome place for meditation.,I have visited this place a week back. Place is worth visiting as usual. I have visited 4 to 5 times and always I love visiting this place. It creates splendid affect whenever you sit for mediation.
Peaceful place for meditation,"It is a huge meditation hall constructed uniquely without pillars, round shape with a beautiful lingam at centre place. Silence can be enjoyable, good place for peaceful meditation. Staff guides the visitors"
Animal abuse in the name of bhakth seva,"The foundation is nothing but inflicting animal abuse and harm to the environment. There are bullock carts that transport a load of people the whole day, back and forth making trips that stretch a few kilometres each way. These bulls are not given any rest, water or food and are made to work non stop. Sometimes there is only 1-2 bulls that make these journeys non stop during the day. Neither does the foundation and nor do the people who visit have any consideration for these poor animals. In the age of technology, the foundation still makes these animals slog especially on hot, sunny days."
silent place,"Dhyanlinga temple is very silent and quite place. no noise in the temple, pin drop silence we need to keep while entering in the temple"
must visit place,"This place is very calm and cool with pin drop silence, one should must visit this place, it is very very different and fantastic"
Mesmerizing pin drop silence,"A supreme place to meditate peacefully. Ladies / girls pls avoid wearing any noisy jewellery like payals  , bangles etc. As you need to submit them before entering the place."
Great place to experience your inner soul..,"It was really good that I could able to make it this time. really Quiet, Calm and beautiful place  One should take opportunity to visit.."
Impressive,Inside was like a planetarium. Music went on for about 20 minutes. Very meditative. Impressive. Felt like UFO-landing site in Spielberg's movie.
Dhyanlinga,Perfect place to meditate. Opens your chairs.Conscerated structure for spiritual liberation.Must visit.
A divine power of meditation,"As th name means - meditation place, no phone, no shoes, no cameras are allowed inside, but you will not need them as you will be busy enjoying each and every moment of this place, Surya kund it's just a great place for men to take a dip in holy water and touch the 3 Ling's which are half submerged in water, the same set up is available for women at Chandra ling & the Dhyanalinga is just amazing a huge shiv ling, you can offer water to the ling directly and sit and medidatate it's so much of positive energy which cannot be expressed in words, you must vist and experience it yourself."
Isha Foundation - Dyanalinga,"I went for the first time in July 2019 desperately in need of healing following a family tragedy that left me feeling painfully stuck in grieving the loss of a loved one.The moment I laid eyes on Bhairavi Devi my tears flowed with love and compassion for myself and my loved one. I visited each day and took part in the chants during my 10 day visit.The moment I entered into the Dyanalinga I felt a distance between my physical and non physical form. It's as if my consciousness travelled beyond my mind, my body and my feelings. I can only describe this as a peaceful and harmonious place; but equally a place I felt alive and awakened with each of my chakras opening. I spent hours here each day. Effortless mediation is one way of describing my experience here.The gardens are tranquil. The accommodation is extremely comfortable; I stayed in the Nalanda Cottages. The food is the healthiest I've ever eaten. I wish I could eat like this each day at home. I felt light and nourished with the variety. Theres an air of love and grace amongst volunteers and swami's which you cant help but notice and feel.I returned to London accepting my tragic loss safe in the knowledge that I'm not alone and energetically something much greater is holding us. I no longer felt stuck and returned feeling replenished, reenergised and full of focus with a yoga practice to help balance day.I will definitely be going back very soon.My advise to anyone seeking a spiritual path, a shift or maybe even guidance to the next level of ascension is to visit this magical place at least once in this lifetime."
Great experience,This temple is very nice and a must have in Coimbatore. Very professional meditation with strict rules.
Always High in Energy ..!,"Can able to feel the richest energy when we sit inside the dome, and one place which you should not miss when visiting ISHA is Dhyanalinga Temple."
Inner engineering retreat,"As I retired in May 2019, plenty of leisure was at disposal. So, without much thinking and expecting I opted for Inner Engineering Retreat at Isha Yoga Center Coimbatore. The program turned out to be the best investment made in my life, no exaggeration. Not only I felt rejuvenated I can see a purpose for my life and can do much more in future, till I fall dead!"
Peaceful place to meditate,"Dhyanalinga Temple complex houses Suryakunda, Chandrakunda and Bhairavi Temple, apart from a dome shaped Dhyanalinga Temple. Mobile phones, bags, foot ware, etc are not allowed inside the complex and there are counters, where these can be deposited.The atmosphere inside the complex is peaceful and serene, with people meditating all around.Dome shaped Dhyanalinga temple is built around the Shiva Linga. No sound of any sort is allowed inside this temple and the ambiance is made conducive for meditation. Those who intend to meditate can sit around the Shiva Linga and meditate, while others can just visit the temple without causing any disturbance to others. Even with so many persons visiting the temple, the calm inside was appreciable.Refreshment centers and shops are available inside the temple complex.Overall, a good place to spend time meditating."
Peaceful,Few mins meditation in front of the Dhyanalinga is a blissful experience. You enter Isha Yoga and immediately feel the enchanting Shiva‚Äôs presence. The gigantic Nandi is stunning. Must visit.
No words to describe ,"Finally we got our chance to visit Dhyanalinga Temple. What can we say, the pure energy that surrounds, from cleansing our soul at the cold suryakund, making our to seek the blessing from Linga Bhairavi, attending free Upa Yoga session, finally getting to Dhyanalingam, the moment you sit in, and starts your mediation, all your 7 Chakras will starts to energise. A pure 15min meditation is enough to energise yourself. Stay longer and you will lose yourself in another conscious state of mind. A must visit place at least once in a life time. However, avoid the weekend or holidays as it tends to get crowded with tourist."
Tranquility....!!!!,"As said by Sadhguru, just sitting silently for a few minutes within the sphere of Dhyanalinga is enough to make even those unaware of meditation experience a state of deep meditativeness."
Peacefull and serene,A place worth visiting when in coimbtore to get inner peace and admire the beauty and cleanliness of the place.People are so down to earth..
Meditation centre,"You will be left speechless by the ambiance and its influences. May continue to sit here longer, if you wish to."
phenomenal energies,"it is a great place to just sit, and soak in the energies around. there is pin drop silence and if you close your eyes the experience is fantastic"
Om Namah Shivaaya,"After reading books of Sadguru and listening to his talks, we decided to pay a to visit ISHA, Coimbatore. Firstly, we thought of seeking accommodation; however felt,this being our first visit and with smaller kid, we  may not fulfill the Ashram protocols. Hence, decided to stay in Coimbarore. We took a bus ride from Gandhipuram to Isha and reached by 1300 hours. The facility is very nice, most of the by-laws are self explanatory there, one need to deposit almost entire bag, wallet, phones, electronic devices etc,.in dedicated counters. Water bottles are allowed, hand bags are allowed (excluding the above listed items). Once you enter, you may consider to take a dip in the Surya Kund (for men) and Chandra kind (for women) where dedicated dress changing facilities are available and is maintained to the best. Taking a dip in Surya kund was one of the great experiences, one may feel rejuvenated both spiritually and mentally. Avoid food, if you are planning for holy dip.One may spend 15-20 minutes and get back. After changing the attire, proceed to Dhyanalinga. Here, the accompanied women may have a dip in Chandra kund. Note, both kunds are purely optional.Once visit the Dhyanalinga, the volunteers would show you a video (available in most languages) to familiar with the purpose of Dhyana, do's and don'ts.. One can spend in the Dhyanalinga place for 15 minutes and can continue further if wishes to be. This place is one of the best for the meditation. Pin drop silence is maintained. Surprisingly, though kids are allowed they do maintain perfect silence!. We had good experience there. However, could not have the darshan of Linga Bhairavi during this visit as the temple would only open by 1620 hours. Collection of the belongings is also hassle free, as most of the volunteers are doing great job in well maintained system. After exiting the centre, we decided to have food in the restaurant and catch the bus back to Gandhipuram. We could have a glimpse of Adi Yogi from distance, as this particular spot has become a crowd gathering one with Selfies!, since there is no restrictions on mobiles and cameras. During weekends there would be huge crowd and suggest to avoid morning visits. But, be sure to have right plan if you are taking bus ride. Overall a good visit to Cherish!. Om Namah Shivaaya."

Truly surreal experience!,"I visited the Isha yoga centre as part of my conference. Am glad I didn't skip it as I initially planned to. The temple isn't very revealing from the outside. You are let in groups by the swaminis into the temple who humbly with their folded hands request you to maintain silence through your stay. You are allowed in the temple for a 20 minutes, can stay longer if you wish to. Sitting around the circumference, listening to the low rumble of the air vents,  with the dome shaped ceiling with fine threads running and the large Linga in front of you... The experience is difficult to put in words but is one of a kind. I don't meditate regularly and this was my first experience... Sitting cross legged, with palms open upwards, chin up ,eyes closed and concentrating at an imaginary point between your brows. The experience was indeed surreal. You can't help but feel this weird energy in the room.I was so affected by it that I took time out of my busy conference schedule and visited it once again. This time I stayed longer. I realised that meditation doesn't come easy but in those brief moments where you are able to look within and hold the link, the experience is outwordly!"
S must for all spiritual seekers.,A place for all spiritual. seekers. The total. environment and ambience takes you to different plane.Meditationbecomesso easy that. youfirget the entire globefor a whilem Dhyanalinga and bhairavi are a must.
Quiet place really peaceful,Extremely peaceful place. Good that people are not allowed to talk inside the meditating space. Very nice place to meditate and amazing that even in summer it remains cool.
A place to relax,its a place to relaxMust have more than 3 hours to see this place peacefully.it is definitely a different experience.
Isha foundation,"An excellent place to spend quality time with family.Dip in Thirthakund , followed by visiting linga Bhairavi and Dhyanalingam temple was amazing. One has to be present in order to appreciate the feel the atmosphere."
Isha Foundation Supreme Moksh,"Must visit place.if Ur in Coimbatore.Takes an hour to reach from the city. But it's worth the drive and effort.No entry fee but the Dhyanalinga is worth Ur time.Nice serene atmosphere. Calm , get one with your soul.Find Ur inner person"
Excellent place to spend time with family ,Excellent place to spend time with family with peace and 100% without any disturbance for devotional experience!
Meditate,We spent some time with family to meditate . It's peaceful and people from different geographies were seen.
A very healthy & spiritual Place,"Isha Yoga centre is a very healthy & spiritual Place. Built for spiritual awakening. It has meditation halls, separate spiritual bath pools for men & women & a huge Adiyogi Pratima nearby. So peaceful & divine..."
As the name suggests - Meditation is the key to everything,This temple/sacred place was famous long before the Adiyogi Statue was inaugurated right next to this temple. This place needed no landmark as most of them knew about this since long ago. Although to be honest the crowd increased since the Adiyogi sculpture was made. Many‚Ä¶
Not advisable for handicapped and senior citizens,"Hi, I have been to Isha Yoga Center in Jan 2019, i have roamed the full center in wheelchair, seen temple and surroundings. Only one place i couldn't visit was Dhyanalinga Temple....as it didn't have any separate entrance for handicapped and senior citizens as such. I missed it.‚Ä¶"
Place at peace ,Dynalingam is one of the most important and must watch place to be visited by local people as well as tourists. It's such a wonderful place with positive vibrations throughout the temple for anyone who enters it to just sit and meditate which gives  a mental calmness and relaxes‚Ä¶
Scared and Vibrant,I have visited many temples in India for first time I felt a different feeling in this temple.  Dynalinga is big dome kind of building where a huge linga in it. First time i went in for their usual Nada arathanai. (Offering of sound). I felt all my burden gone and relaxed.‚Ä¶
Makes you highly self aware,One is not allowed to talk once you enter the dhyanlinga outer sanctum. It is just so calm and quite and peaceful you start hearing your heartbeat. You close your eyes and start discovering yourself in a way you didn't know was possible.  A must visit spiritual experience.
Quite Place for deep meditation.,Amazing !!!. Very quite and serene ambience with an INSIDE CAVE  concept. The series of oil lit lamps placed surrounding the LINGAM creates a divine illusion. Keep sufficient time in hand for this place.
Solace,Be here for a meditation session and remember there are timings for the same. Keep quiet and feel the vibrations for a lifetime experience. Many people sit for longer time but you must complete a session of smaller interval to have the feel. You can feel the vibrations around and I feel the cleanliness is the first and foremost thing here beyond ant other things.
Divine place,Travelled in April . Very divine place which gives a total feeling  of solace . Feels nice to sit in the temple for hours .
Sp special,Walking in barefoot after meditating was so special. And on the new year! loved all the sights sounds and people.
Adiyogi Coimbatore,"Travelled in April when the weather is really hot.It takes about an hour to travel as is out of city limits near the Velliankini hills. Surrounded on 3 sides by the hills  it has a serenity of it's own.Adiyogi himself stands tall and as you drive near, you can start seeing him behind the coconut trees. Made up of steel, it has an aura of it's own. A befitting tribute to the first YOGI.They have electric and Bullock carts to take devotees to the statue and back. You can have meals which are hygienic on the premises.The Dhyanlinga has the serenity that the place has to offer.  You get to spend a minimum of 15 minutes there, you can of course stay longer if you wish. The advantage of travelling in April around 3pm , there was comparatively less crowd so Darshan was easy.You can take a dip in the Surajkund.Devotee helpers guide you through and it's a one time opportunity to sit in the Dhyanlinga . For first timers the first 2 minutes one wonders what he doing there, but the serenity catches up and you hardly realize when the 15 minute bell rings and its time to leave.Worth a visit"
Peaceful place,Lovely visit to this place. It is very calm and peaceful. Beware of bees though. We narrowly escaped a bee attack.
A unique place with a powerful vibration and silence..,"This Dhyanalinga meditation hall has powerful vibrations in it.. It has a vast Dhyanalinga in the centre of the hall.. It also has many small cave like places where you can sit and do meditation for hours.. Pin drop silence is maintained in the hall.. For every 15 or twenty minutes, a bell rings and the batch of people who were sitting Inside the hall (those who would like to stay for meditation can remain) go out and the next batch come In.. Linga bairavi,  mercury Lingas in the water are the special things seen here.. Cameras are not allowed inside the campus..."
A production line of visitors,"They have a set divinity route that you have to follow, eventually ending in the dome that will resonate to any tiny sound, so sniffs, coughs and sneezes are amplified greatly but you can sit and just take in the calmness for as long as you like, very reverential, and peaceful."
Good,"Dhyanalinga temple, a beautiful temple at a beautiful place, we all like the temple and enjoy the old brauty"
energy of meditation,The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and is situated at Isha Yoga Center almost 45 kms from Coimbatore airport. The yoga center offers Yoga courses along with staying facilities. Holy dip in Surya Kund makes you feel energetic. The main meditation hall is a closed dome with 15 mins of time for a batch of people.
Spirituality in serenity,"Total spiritual experience in side the meditation hall called Dhyanlingam. They allow to remain there for 15 minutes and a bell rings to sign the time but you may continue to sit if desire. I highly recommend to sit and remain calm for longer time it will be a great experience. One must spare at least four to five hours to visit the foundation, it will be better if you can spare a day and stay in the night too."
Stillness in Motion,The entire ambience of the ashram and the way the volunteers are within themselves is all towards blossoming your essence of being human!
Feel the Energy,"The energy is like nothing else on earth...if you are a Yogi and/or a Healer especially if you understand the Chakras, and how we are literally energy this is a must visit.... we went several times and will return.."
Amazing Place to Visit,"This is one of the best Dhyana Place with Shiva Linga where we can also do Abhisehka and sit for Dhyana, so quite and un-forgettable memory of life.  I whole heatedly thank Sri Sadguruji to create this location as world class and make us proud of being Indian"
Spiritual & Divine,"A peaceful place to calm yourself. This is way too much far from the city you gotta travel bout 30 kms from the city to get yo this. But once you reach and park your vehicle, you could see the beauty of the place.if you are going to this place.. make sure you start a but early so that you can sprnd some quality and peaceful time here."
Peaceful place,Peaceful place . No Pooja carried out at this place . You can sit and meditate for a period of time.
Euphoric and Blissful experience,A great place for all meditators. The powerful place enhances and aids meditation.  We were here for a yoga workshop and did take time to meditate everyday that we were at Isha Ashram. The recommended protocol is to take a dip in Suryakund (for men) /ChandraKund (for women) prior to meditating at Dhyanalinga.   They provide a ring at the end of 15 mins but one can continue to meditate as long as they like.
Spare time and visit ,This is very beautiful and peaceful place for visit and also stay.  I will plan in future for staying and learning yoga in this devine place.
Must visit place,Calm ...peaceful... spiritual.... magnificent...ecstatically beautiful... Must visit place for meditators.
Time to Turn Inward,A dip in chandrakund and then a visit to Dhyanlinga and Devi Temple was mesmerising. One could surely find it easy to meditate infront of Dhyanlinga. Helpful and courteous volunteers made this visit all the more satisfying and pleasent.
Divine!,"Whether you appreciate Mr. Jagdish Vasudev or not, you cannot deny the fact that he and his team have created a unique spiritual space here in the lap of Mother Nature. A must-see in Coimbatore even if most of the people coming here make it a picnic or a circus rather than the decorum and calm you should associate with a divine place."
Puts your mind at ease,Dhyanlinga houses a 7 feet tall Shiva linga with all seven chakras charged! Exceptional energy can be felt in the dome meditation hall. You enter it only if you can spend a min 15 mins there to fully embrace the energy of the place. It is also advisable to take a dip in suryakund/ chandrakund before entering dhyanlinga
Dhyanalinga Temple always in my list of places to be when in Coimbatore,"an ideal place to be full of positive vibrations...I love spending my time alone in this temple....Its the silence which is mesmerising ..and one has to go there to experience the vibes.Each of us would have a different experience; but definitely a must visit to anothe engineering MArvel at the Isha yoga cente, coimbatore...Please do not miss the visit to the Linga Bhairavi temple and a walk to the Adi Yogi monument."
Great place for meditation,"Dhyanalinga Temple is situated inside Isha Yoga Centre, about 38 kms. from Coimbatore airport.(Takes about 90 mins. to reach by taxi). It is a great place for meditation. Visitors to Isha Yoga Centre are recommended to participate in a 20 mins. meditation session. It is open from 6 AM to 8 PM on all days. Photography is not allowed. You can keep you mobile phones/bags etc. at a counter provided outside the temple."
"Dhyanalinga Temple, Coimbatore",Dhyanalinga Temple is situated in Isha Yoga Centre. Centre is about 25 KMs from Coimbatore city. Lord Shiva  deity is in Linga form . Dhyana means mediatation and dhyanalinga is powerful and unique eneregy form. Devotees used to sit silently for few minutes within the sphere of Dhyanalinga. We were there during prayer times.
A peaceful experience.....,"This is one of the places you should plan to visit during your trip to Coimbatore.  This is a very spiritual place and don't expect 'fun' !The highlights are - The Adiyogi statue, Dhyanalinga temple, Lingbhairavi temple and Theerthakund.  The centre also conducts various spiritual courses.As a visitor the above four would be of importance.  If you are visiting in summers, please make sure that you go very early in the morning to avoid the heat at the Adiyogi statue location.  Would recommend carrying an umbrella during day time visits.  In winters, late evening could be a bit chilly due to the cold breeze. The Adiyogi statue is really spectacular.  From the Adiyogi statue, it is about 600 mtrs. to the Ashram entrance.  The ashram operates bullock carts and mini buses at a nominal cost for people who prefer not to walk the distance.  During peak rushes, the wait time may be more.At the ashram entrance you have leave your electronic gadgets and footwear.  There is a cloak room operated by the ashram, free of charge. The visit inside the ashram will take about an hour and a half depending on your choice to enter the Theerthakund.  The temples would take about 20 mts each depending on the crowd.  To enter the Theerthakund you need to change clothes.  There are separate Theerthakunds for male and female.  There is a cafeteria inside the ashram and serves very good food.  There are other stalls where you can buy souvenirs.  Since you have to leave all your gadgets outside the ashram, you cannot take any photographs inside the ashram.  However, photography is permitted at the Adiyogi statue site.Over all a good place to visit.  You can also continue not he same route to Siruvani dam, and on the way back can also visit the famous Perur Temple..."
Best meditation place,It is the place for anybody to have beat meditation experience. A pin drop sound can be heard inside the dhiyana lingam.This place is definitely giving some high level improved feeling.I will suggest everyone to visit this place at least once.
Must experience while at ISHA !!,Wonderful experience for Dhyana !!One has to experience this as words cannot do Justice !Twenty minutes of sitting in silence with eyes closed here will really help focus !
Over hyped place,"Being a local resident, would say this place as over hyped. First of all let me tell about the locality. 25-30 kms away from the city. On the way to siruvani falls. Yeah, once watchable. Can do peaceful meditation inside the dome. Nothing more. Completely man made concrete blocks by destroying several acres of forest & agricultural lands. Well known for destroying the peace in the valley by loud noise during Maha Shivarathiri."
A place for worship,"The statue is not made up of granite. It is built up with steel.  Neat and calm place to meditate, can visit in your life time to enjoy the experience. nice location"
Religious place,I visited the place with my friends and the place was very peaceful. We all loved it. If anybody is visiting Isha foundation they should definitely visit this Temple.
Powerful Meditiation Spot,Photos were not allowed so I don‚Äôt have any. This ashram as a whole is impressive! The Lingam is huge and the done that it is located within is a soothing space. There is insense. People are offering lotus flowers it is really lovey. The second day I went I was able to stay longer because there were less people.
Mesmerizing experience,Have explored mixed terrains as well as most of the popular travel destinations but for a change this one has been a calming experience involved with fun activities around and aligned yoga practices. For sure a once in a lifetime experience one must have in the to-do travel lists for life...
Must Visit for truely awesome experience.,"The place Dhyanlingam is approx 30km from coimbatore city. You may book ola package for Isha Yoga center (available on ola app, 4hrs, 70km rs 1200 approx both ways). Even if you exceed some time...it hardly get extra rs100 or so.(otherwise cab may charge Rs2500).Coming to Place, its wonderful experience inside Dhyanlingam(just by sitting there fr 1ominutes make you feel with new level of energy).The overall place is serine nd pristine beauty surrounding will make you feel in different world"
For family trip,"For half day trip at Coimbatore,this is good place to visit. You can take both and have mediation about 20 minutes without any disturbance because mobile not allowed inside. Traditional foods with nominal price available to take. But don't go with big hype in your mind. Just visit and relax also on weekdays only advisable to visit to avoid crowd."
Good but not exceptional,The total time you need for the Isha Centre is about 3-4 hours . It takes time and you need to be patient ....So plan accordingly . The Bath in the SuryaKhund was the highlight. Dhyanalinga needs time as they will let u go in batches and u need to be inside the temple for 15 mnts in silence . Its not the traditional temple type where u go pray and come out .
Bliss full Exp,It was worth the visit very well maintained complete silence and neat and clean.You can either take the surajkund dip for men or chandani kunddip for women for 20rs(they charge for providing a loin cloth for men) and then go to the linga.
Experience the divine energy ,"The Dhyanalinga temple is accessible via bullock cart or walking from the Adiyogi Shiva bust. Snakes adorn the entrance gates and after 100 meters of walking you have to deposit your footwear and mobile phones before entering the ashram. Photography is not allowed inside the ashram so the pictures are of the outside. The way to the ashram is dotted with shops selling things to eat and other things made by the Isha foundation including food items, books, collectibles etc. The inside has two sacred energised ponds for bathing - one for men and one for women to bathe before entering the temple for worship. Bathing in the pond is optional and not mandatory. On the way to the temple there are free yoga classes offered for 30 mins where via Sadhgurus video you are guided through basic kriyas and meditation. For those who cannot sit on the ground benches are available so do make the effort to attend this session. We went there in the afternoon and the outside was fairly hot. After the 30 min session I felt so relaxed and cool and it was a must before visiting the linga. Before entering we bought a lamp and lotus flower for offering. The lamp was copper / brass and was a big one with a snake motif on the top and a few flowers as offerings. It is the most beautiful lamp I have ever seen. Once inside we were made to wait outside the linga. A sign was held which asked devotes to wait in silence till the bell was rung. Once the bell rang in 15 mins we went inside the linga. The sight was mesmerising and unforgettable. Around the linga was a water pond with floating lotuses and the lamps were placed around the linga. Devotees sat around and meditated. In the wall there were spaces where people were sitting on mats and meditating. The energy of the place was divine. In another 15 mins a bell was rung and the next lot of devotees came in. The whole experience was unforgettable. Once outside you can buy Prasadam of jaggery. On exiting the centre there is an outlet of Isha yoga where one can buy items like millets, Isha foundation products other souvenirs, books and collectables. Only two things I didn‚Äôt like- 1) the restrooms- we could not go as the outside was wet and we were barefoot so it was really unhygienic. 2) The steps inside were really high and was difficult for elderly people to climb and provisions should have been made for ramps. Otherwise it was a really memorable experience! Also rem"
A really good place,"Well the Isha foundation which runs this, is really good. The silence in Dhyanalinga is very peaceful."
Excellent place for meditation,Certainly the aura of the place as well as the atmosphere make it certain that you can meditate there
Energizing,The energy and calm in this place is something else. Attending Nada Aradhana in the space is another level of experience. An experience that must be had.
Family ,"A wonderful experience. The complex is 1500 acres . A huge Shivlinga established inside a tomb, a place for meditation and peace. A holy and satisfying visit. A must visit. Keep 3 to 4 hrs minimum whilst visiting from Coimbatore. No camera mobile etc allowed."
Nostalgic and blessed,Great place to visit specially for followers of Shiva. A place where u get sublime peace and finding real way for Dhyan.. Must visit place in Coimbatore.
Make a visit to get peace of mind,"An hour's time from Coimbatore, A great property created by Isha Foundation, If you are lucky and have right contacts you can get an appointment to see Sadguru , As we all know he is not only famous in India but in many foreign countries , Take a dip at the dedicated pool which is separate for men and women, The property as become much bigger and as all the facilities for the visitors and inmates , Foreigners also come in big numbers, a must visit place to get peace of mind"
An ideal place to re-invent yourself,"A peaceful place where people come for devotion, spirituality and meditation. One can watch people meditating everywhere. One can stay in the Ashram as well and yes don't miss the food there. One can find Volunteer, calmness and humility of those will certainly make you think how to grasp the same in yourself. Various courses are also offered, I believe this opportunity should not be missed. IT OPEN THE VAST OCEAN OF POSSIBILITY IN ONE'S LIFE."
A peaceful place ,It‚Äôs part of the complex with Adiyogi Shiva and is aYogic temple around 30 km from Coimbatore started in 1999 by Sadguru Jaggi Vasudev and is designed for meditation  Absolute silence is maintained inside and Mobiles and footwear are not allowed  One can easily and securely‚Ä¶
Meditation heaven,This ISHA foundation temple of Sadguru is a major tourist attraction of Coimbatore which according to me defeats the very purpose of the Dhyanalingam temple where it‚Äôs a place of meditation and quiet and touristy places ain‚Äôt remain quiet but here the number of local and foreign‚Ä¶

Vibrant Dhyanlinga,The Dhyanlinga has qualities that you don't find in temples usually. Infact to call it a temple might restrict it's impact. You can't pray when you are inside the Dhyanlinga space. You sit in silence which may be explosive or pulsating. The energy of that space surrounds you and‚Ä¶
Best Place to find solace,"Visit Dhyanalinga if you are in Coimbatore. It is 30 KMs away from Coimbatore city but worth the visit. Must visit if you are lover of Lord Shiva. In fact, anybody can visit this place to find your inner self"
Qwesome spiritual place,"This is the place where the spiritual energy speaks to everyone.. It is a rare place and a moment to get to know the Devine.. Everyone will feel this energy.  I'm coming back again,.. and again..  and again..."
A must for visitors to Coimbatore,Sadguru Jaggi Vasudev had built this place to bring out the calmness in you. A must to every visitor to Coimbatore whether a tourist or business person.
Must visit among the spiritual places,"Though I lived in Coimbatore for many years and visiting now often to meet my relatoves, i didnt get a chance to visit this Isha Yoga Center till yesterday. Just went with my family today for a day's visit and we enjoyed the experience and really wonder when will every temple in‚Ä¶"
Must visit,"An opportunity to connect with your spiritual self.. Anyone seeking and enjoys silence, this is the place. very well managed "
Meditate in front of it to experience warmth,"A place inside Isha Yoga Campus that has large space to meditate for people, warmth space that will transport you into a new different place."
Shrine,A beautiful shrine and so calm and peaceful... you can spend almost a day there... no noise pollution and no mobiles allowed... have canteen for refreshments and relaxing...
Consecrated place full of vibrations and peace,"Was lucky to have 6days at the Isha Ahsram hence visited the Dhyanalinga many a time. It is a must visit if you are a Shiv devotee or looking for a spiritual journey. Words cannot do justice to the experience so it is best to keep an open mind visit the venue and take in the vibrations and blessings.On the other side there are few things like when u enter the dhyanalinga do try and take a dip before, in the Suryakund or Chandrakund for ladies it is supposed to enhance your experience and it def did mine so thats the 1st step.Secondly the devotess can give offerings like Dhoop (some thing like incese) or a lotus flower or a plate of oil diya( lamp) and flowers. All of these are priced very reasonably so thats ok too.Once you enter the gates on the left is the Patanjali statue which is BEAUTIFUL, opp to him are many carvings of tales and their explanations in English and Tamil.Visitors are congregated here and once the bell rings you can enter the Dhyanalinga (dome) inside is a Shivling on top of a snake. From here each soul will have a different experience of and from it so do visit and experience it for yourself.Remember it is has not much to do with Religion you will be able to feel the vibes irrespective of whatever religion or caste etc you may belong too. May your spiritual journey begin in grace peace and harmony.Om Namah Shivay."
Undefined Serenity ,"I had visited the temple with my family. You need to submit you mobile phones outside along with your footwear. Once you enter the ashram, you will notice peace and calmness. There are 2 kunds inside - suryakund for males and chandrakund for females incase someone wishes to take a holy dip. Once you reach the temple, you are made to sit outside the temple in silence till the time the bell rings. The bell rings after every 15 mins and this is when the people inside the temple can exit and the next set of people can enter the temple. What you see inside a huge shivalinga which exuberates positive energy. You are supposed to meditate in the temple which happens preety effortlessly. Once you come out, you would feelva change within yourself. There's a canteen too which serves food at reasonable rates. This is a must visit place incase you are in Coimbatore"
Meditation center at Isha yoga center,"The temple is situated inside the Isha Yoga Centre. This place is the sanctum santorum and we need to maintain pin drop silence. You can sit here, meditate and energize your self and feel your inner self. Amazing place."

The Dhyanalinga Yogic Temple offers a meditative space that does not ascribe to any particular faith or belief system!üòçüôè"
Dhyanalinga,The place where you get peace in temple. This is the must visit place for every one to get peace in mind. But the road could be better. May be that's also part of lord Shiva's THIRUVILAYADAL...
Peaceful Meditation,"This Hhyanalinga temple, located inside the Isha Yoga centre was something above my words and description. It is an architecure splendour.The linga situated inside a very huge big dome..the devotees are let inside in silence and made ti sit around the Dhyana linga. Its pin drop‚Ä¶"
Amazing,First time i visited here..  Such a huge lord siva..  Ehile seeing that itself we will be in different  comfort zone..  Climate locatiwarea cleanliness everything was awesone..  Its real peace

Amazing ,Good place with good signages. Convenient facilities. Volunteers were helpful. Enjoyed the serenity thoroughly. 
Not that great,More in to Commercial. A-z is getting charged i understand for food but why for seeing god. More over their spoiled the nature an forest n made the temple. Please understand that through nature only we can see god
Amazing place ,"It's a amazing meditation place & puja mantra at Isha Yoga Center at coimbatore city, must visit place if you have a plan to visit this city, it's around  1 hour drive from the city, and it's very peacefull area at the ashram"
Temple,Very peaceful and good place. Must visit for all spiritual seekers and yogic aspirants very simple and attractive architecture
Perfect place for meditation ,"This is within the campus of Isha foundation. Dhyanalinga is an experience in itself.Before going to Dhyanalinga, as a preparation we are supposed to take a dip in the Kunda (water body). There are two separate Kunda‚Äôs called Suryakunda for gents and Chandrakunda for ladies. A dip in this Kunda before going to Dhyanalinga makes our meditation more powerful. Its said that when we enter a holy place like a temple or a Dhyaana Mandira with the wet body ie. after taking a dip in the Kunda our body becomes more powerful and will absorb the positive energy present in that place. Procedure for taking dip in Chandrakunda:1. Firstly I would like to tell that, whoever wishes to take a dip can take. There is no force at all. You can even directly enter Dhyanalinga without taking a dip2. Near the entrance of Chandrakunda, there is a counter where we have to buy a orange gown for Rs.20/-3. From there we will be directed inside where there are shower cabins. We are supposed to remove all the clothes, including inner garments and wear the gown and take shower. 4. Hair should be tied up with the rubber band or a clip. Not to be left open. 5. When you come out of the shower you will be checked and then sent to the Kunda.6. When you enter the Chandrakunda, you feel like you are totally immersed in water. Initially you may not be able to walk. We feel like we are walking in space. Get down the railing on the right side and with the help of the wall try walking slowly towards the Linga in the Center of the Kunda. Hug the linga and enjoy the experience.The energy in the water is unbelievable. Ah.....Chandrakunda dip was a memorable experience for me.7. Once you are done come towards the left side where there is a waterfall. Stand below that and climb the railing and come up.8. Take shower again; change your clothes. There is a small tank where we are supposed to dip the used gown and put it for drying on a stand just opposite to it.9. It‚Äôs better to carry a towel to wipe ourselves after the dip. Better not to carry any valuables like watch, cell phone etc. One can deposit it at the counter next door if you have any.10. People with any disease like diabetes or skin manifestation, ladies who are menstruating are not allowed for this holy dip.Dhyanalinga is very huge. Its beautifully constructed in a dome shape. It is a meditation hall with a lot of energy. Ah...very powerful place. Visitors can just go around the linga; or even sit and meditate for few minutes. Volunteers around the linga stand in Namaste position.  Visitors are literally forced to keep silence and move on in Namaste position only. That‚Äôs a very good step to manage the crowd and maintain the sanctity of the place. Hence Dhyanalinga has pin drop silence.My experience here was wonderful. Would love to go back to this place again and again. Highly recommended üëçüëçüëç"
best  place  to get  inspired for  meditation,"if  you  have  even the  slightest  liking  for  spirituality  , then  this  place  in the dome  is the centre  from  where  you  can  start  your  endless  travel towards  your  soul search."
Unique place for meditation,"This  temple is built with dome structure  with Dhyanalingam at the centre . Nice and peaceful place for meditation. well organised, unique experience."
Vijay Kaul,"Excellent place. High energy. Very quiet inside which takes you straight to a meditative mood even if you have no previous experience of meditation. The Dhyanalinga is 13 feet 9 inches in height and it is the largest mercury based linga in the world. Must attend Nada Aradhana, which is the offering of sound twice a day. With a Rs 100 ticket one can do temple cleaning service at night which is a very emotional experience. Must visit place overall."
Unique Experience,"During our recent trip to Coimbatore, my wife and I visited the Isha Yoga Centre and had the opportunity to pray at the Dhyanalinga Temple. The orderly manner in which the devotees were let in and the pin drop silence observed inside the dome structure was an unique experience for us. We would recommend that whenever one visits Coimbatore, a visit to this place must be planned!"
Mesmerized,"we did spend sometime in the Dhyanalinga temple.. very quiet.. everything in order.. there were hundreds of devotees and visitors moving around, but pin drop silence.. well organised in every way.."
Unique Meditative space,"Just sitting silently close your eyes for a few minutes enough to feel the deep meditativeness. Minimum you need to sit for 15 minutes, after that you can hear bell sound, if you can come out without distributing others. Very peaceful place to stay. Its part of the Isha Foundation. Almost 30 km away from Coimbatore railway station and 40 km away from airport."
Beautiful space for meditation ,"The Dhyanalinga Temple is part of the Is a Yoga center located at the foot of the Velliangiri Hills on the outskirts of Coimbatore (approx. 30 kms from Coimbatore Junction and 35 kms from airport). It is a beautiful space to meditate with a large cavernous chamber housing a commensurately large Linga in the center. Private meditation spaces are stopped out from the wall of the chamber in which one can get seated in siddhasana or ardha-siddhasana and meditate to one's content. Owing to the acoustics of the chamber, even the slightest sound gets amplified."
"Once a calm place, now a little crowded","The place used to be a calm and great place. But now it has been highly commercialised. But just on the way, you can find iruttu pallam from where the western ghats is just 3 km away. Also the forest is untouched. Even, here in Dhyanalingam, you can roam off to find some peace. The statues here are great and worth a visit."
quite and peaceful,nice to mediate in this serene environment with a quite crowd around..very neatly maintained at the foot of nature
Amazing!!! Must see.....,"If you are on the lookout for a quality Spiritual experience, this is the place to be. The whole Isha Yoga Center is a place to see how efficiently a place of this size and magnitude can be managed, only through volunteers. A different world altogether."
A powerful place to expirence,"It said that every heuman being, regardless to his past expirence with meditation or any other practice, can expirence a deep meditative state by just sitting in the Dhyanalinga with his eyes closed for 15 minutes. It is a place you need to expirence in order to understand since words are uncapable to describe it.Recommend: Every day at 11:50-12:10 and 17:50-18:10 there is a sound offering ceremony- Nada Aradhana which is open for all."
"Beautiful, breath taking",A must visit place for people who are nature and peacelover. Beautifully designed with so peaceful environment. The shiva linga inside the foundation with so much meditative vibes. I was so much fascinated in this place that next time when ever i will come to coimbatore i hv decided to take a dip in mercury water to gain the positive energy by linga of shiva.... üôèüëçüëç
Dhyanalinga visit,"They have made it beautifully but to make this lot of forest area was cut and when you go inside you are not allowed to carry your cell or even slippers but then there are people who have come there for yoga course and who stay in the resort's they carry their cell and walk inside having coffee, just to see once it's ok"
Lord Shiva in major role,"While travelling from Coimbatore to Kodai kanal, we visited Isha foundation aashram as a visitor and spend about 2-3 hours there. The ambience of the aashram is different and catches to eyes in one stroke. Further the concept of pathway, shops/stalls and everything inside is ecological. Even the urinals are just like those in villages or jungle. So the overall feel of the aashram is very natural and the concept is worth praising.Inside the aashram Dhyanlinga is place for meditation. It is a 15 minute schedule. Prior to this, you may (if you wish) perform a dip in Surya Kund (if male) or Chandra Kund (if female) and then meditation. Those who are very sincere to perform these actions, the place is worth spending whole day or even for staying for a few days, but since we saw this place only as a visitor, so simply perform meditation, visited the inside places and went back.Outside the main gate, there is place for parking, a restaurant and bullock cart for amusement. You can spend time in these places. Just outside this area, the huge Shiva face statue is situated. This was a center of attraction for most of us as it was in media when the Prime Minister Mr. Modi inaugerated this statue of aadiyogi  sometime back. The statue and the area is worth watching.Overall the place gives the feeling, as your spirit. If you want to perform meditation and spend a few days then the feeling is good. But even as a visitor, the place is worth  visiting. Frankly speaking such places have different feeling for different persons, so a generalized review cannot be given. But overall, if you have spared time to visit this place, it will not be a disappointing feature."
A big statue of lord shiva,The place is very silent and calm you can go with your family to dhyanliga temple....... the view and climate is awesome in middle of mountains
Amazing experience,"Must visit , would be going every month till the time in Coimbatore. Guided meditation  is a life time experience , you don't feel like coming back. What a place"

Amazing place.,"Amazing place. Must visit. The place is different to any place you may have seen in terms of architecture and what it has to offer in terms of stay, food, even drinking water somehow tastes better and of course the temple. I totally recommend it. Do meditation in the Dhyanalinga without fail. I highly recommend you visit this place - whether you are spiritually inclined or not."
Best place to meditate,"Nice and calm place to meditate, you get gangajal and milk for offerings if you interested but you have to pay for that , yes commercialization is there."
A place devoid of spiritualism ! A soulless place !,Never have I visited a place that claimed to be spiritual but was sooooo devoid of spirituality but screamed commercialism every place! The very purpose of this place was not coming through at all! Forest and farm lands cleared to create this monstrosity of a place (remember the Sadhguru's rally for rivers - one wonders where the disconnect was!!) that is like a fancy park from the west! Right in the middle of nowhere is the statue of Shiva -  sadly it isnt even awe inspiring! And then the long walk (bullock carts were running full!) in the hot sun left all of us pretty exhausted by the time we got in. And once we got in we had to deposit all our belongings in a sack and head inside! We walked to Linga Bhairavi and witnessed a mini puja and then the Dyana Linga in the huge dome structure where one can meditate and also offer prayers! All of this felt like walking through a museum which had no purpose other than to just put up artefacts for the sake of attracting customers and make them fancy enough through its grandeur so that it stays relevant! But never have I ever visited a place that was so soulless !! Wonder if the place will ever find its purpose!
Isha Yoga Centre,Isha Yoga centre is such a nice and calm place about 40kms away from Coimbatore. At the entrace of the centre you have the Adiyogi Statue to see and then enter the premises of the Isha centre. There is bullock carts for ferrying people just near the statue to the centre. At the entrace there is food court where you can have some nice south indian food. The place is crowded on weekends and it is nicely maintained. You need to follow instructions and you will reach inside the centre where you can see Dhyanlinga and take some experience of what Isha yoga meditation is done. You can take a taxi from Coimbatore but bus are also available from the Gandhipuram bus stand.
No words can describe ,No words can describe the grace of this place. With the blessings of Sadhguru visited this place in May during inner engineering retreat. Haven't had any such experience in the past.  Must visit place for spiritual seekers
Amazing place,"It's inside the Adiyogi campus. It's amazing place. Do visit it, it's a walk to.the main Campus. So pls be aware  "
Overwhelming Experience,"The Dhyanalinga temple at the Isha Foundation near Coimbatore leaves you with a sense of awe and wonder, especially if you have read up on how Sadhguru, his wife and his associates meditated for days to create this edifice.

Dhyanalingam,Very serene and spewing positivity. Rejuvenating experience and makes you meditate and find inner self.
Excellent experience,"Nice and neat place. Please visit the place as it is worth it.But there are a lot of steps here and there which is a little difficult for elderly people. The bullock cart service which carries you from the statue to the temple stops after 6pm,so then you will have to be ready‚Ä¶"
Sacred ,Nice place should visit once in life time people very far. It is very useful for who want to know their inner soul.

The grounds are absolutely beautiful, and the artistic design that Sadhguru gave these temples and their supporting structures has a magical and‚Ä¶"
This is a must,"This very powerful temple is unique. You just sit and imbibe the energy in a beautiful, meditative space. Sadhguru, the phenomenal Yogi who created it, says it is the distilled essence of Yogic sciences with all seven chakras. It is not religious, or rather it is‚Ä¶"
A Huge Shiva Linga,Dhyanlinga temple is shaped as a Dome and a Huge Shiva Linga decorated with various flowers is superb watching.  In this temple a meditation is performed for say 10-15 mins.
Aadi yogi isha temple,"Got lot of positive energy, u can bus facilities for Coimbatore, dis place covered with nature, best place to strip with both Family and friends"
blissful experience,"The Dhyanalinga is a Yogic temple located 30 km from Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu. The temple was consecrated on June 24, 1999 by Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev, a yogi and mystic.this is one of best blissful experience you can get in Coimbatore if you are religious."
A visit to Dhyanalinga,"A must see place in Coimbatore. Very peaceful and calming. You may have to walk and climb some steps, which can be difficult for children and elderly. The main temple is a must to see."
Peaceful location,"Dhyanalinga is situated inside the Isha Yoga Center where at a time at least 150 people can sit and meditate. One can stay inside for 15 minutes or till they ring the bell; but one can stay longer if they wish to. They ask women to remove the anklets so as to not cause noise disturbance to others and I saw one woman really struggling to remove in spite of using tools. This can be simplified by providing socks so that the anklets don‚Äôt move and create noise. Inspire of this exercise, the dhyanalinga is not at all sound proof because of people sneezing and coughing in rounds disturbing the meditation mood. Otherwise, the place, lighting, and Linga create a heavenly feeling."
This is how famous temples must've come to existence.,"It certainly has become a 'must-visit' place for those coming from outside Coimbatore. However, for Coimbatore-residents, it's more of a duty to accompany the folks coming to visit them. The massive Shiv-Linga is made of steel plates welded together and painted black. For believers, they can see God anywhere. So if you can see the real Shivain it, you are lucky. Not superstitious. The architecture inside the temple premises is good. An underground tank is an added new experience. The meditation hall too is a nice experience. However, the Tamil non-Hindu community and the media with their support is constantly trying to denigrate this centre. Better visit yourself and judge. But the uppermost question in my mind is, ""after Jaggi, who?"""
being meditative is possible,"You go inside Dhyanalinga Temple and life changes. This place is peaceful, mystic, beautifully made and kept. Anyone who has the chance to take the 14D bus to the outskirts of Coimbatore should do it in a blink. You will not only find the Dhyanalinga temple but a place built for the wellbeing of human race, run by kind and devoted souls. Isha Yoga Center, where Dhyanalinga Temple is located, offers you more than you expect when you decide to go visit a temple in India."
Divine and massive ,"Loved every bit of the visit. Spend couple of hours to get the real experience. The chandrakund, Mercury lingam, meditating inside the main temple are the key features here"
Quiet and calm place,It is an hours drive from the city and everyone walks in for free. There are 2 kunds ( bathing pools) one each for men and women and they are believed to help increase concentration for doing dhyan. The meditation hall is good and don't miss out on the Shiva statue. You'll need at least 3 hours to see the place.
cosmic silence,"The peace and serenity of the place transports you to a divine level. The splendid dhyanalinga surrounded by lights is a wonderful joyous sight and as you close your eyes and meditate in the silence, you attain peace and some respite from worldly routines and worries."
One time visit,First finish off siruvani waterfall and then Come to Isha.It's a one time visit. .if Iskcon is for Bangalore . then Isha is for Coimbatore.Overhyped. .vast amount of area (with  full of  trees)had been cleared to make way for the newer attractions.
"ADHI YOGI, DHYNALINGA CENTRE","The Isha Centre, about 20 kilometres away from Coimbatore, is a fine spiritual centre. My wife was attending a conference at Codissia Centre and I was free. So I decided to hire a Red Taxi to the Isha Centre to see the bust of Adhi Yogi.   The taxi driver told me that I would‚Ä¶"
Beautifully Made,"While in Coimbatore, this place is a must visit . Far from the hussles of city, it‚Äôs located 45 mins away from Coimbatore. If you want to relax and meditate, please visit this place. It has amazing statue of lord Shiva which takes you to another level.  Highly recommended"
Cool Silent Divine feeling,You get a divine feeling when you go and sit near the dhyanalingam. Its a place where the surroundings are such that you automatically get into peace and want to sit near it. At least this was my experience. You can get into a mode where you have no business with the‚Ä¶
More of a tourist spot than a place of meditation,"I have visited this 2-3 times. The crowd management at the bag and shoe deposit can be better. Eventhough the volunteers are friendly, you dont get a feeling of sanctity due to the artificialness of the place. The security staffs at the entrance are quite rude. "

Wonderful Visit to Isha,Isha Yoga center in coimbatore is a wonderful place to visit.. esp the Dhyanalinga temple. Helps you meditate in an extremely calm and peaceful atomsphere
Tranquility Personified,I visited Dhyana lingam with a group of friends.I liked the peaceful atmosphere and mediation inside Dhyana lingam was was surely an experience.AdhiYogi statue was superb
at peace,this is in isha yoga centre... u can go there for a day. very peaceful. avoid taking children as it require no noise.
SPONTANEOUS MEDITATION ,This is the only place where meditation happens spontaneously without human effort.  There is no entry fee and there is Overseas help desk to facilitate your needs. Isha yoga center holds this magnificent spiritual Dhyanalinga - located 40 km from Coimbatore airport. I strongly recommend this place for foreigners planning to visit South India to gain exuberant spiritual energy beyond religion or language barriers.  You never be that  same person after you leave Dhyanalinga!
Spiritual sojourn,"This is a late review Visited this place in August 2016 and had a beautiful experienceIts nestled 50 kms away from Coimbatore in a tranquil environment . There are buses and other cabs available to reachShoes are to be kept in a storage place at the entrance .There are 2 holy kunds(holy ponds )for a ritual dip...Suraj kund for men, this is open and well lit by sunlight and the Chandra Kund for women , this is dimly lit and cooler n eerier than the sun pond. I am petrified of water and not keen on dark places still chose to take the dip..It was a beautiful and unforgettable moment of my life. The moment I waded into water shivering I landed close to the shivling and the moment I touched it I felt myself floating as if someone was pulling and holding me up in the water..Felt completely charged and revitalized after the dip..After the theerthakund, there is a dhyan linga where complete silence is maintained and one can medidate peacefully Overall a must visit place to energise oneself"
Relaxation ,The Dhyanalinga is a unique circular dome shaped structure that creates an atmosphere conducive to meditation. Like most of these Ashrams one must exert conciouss effort to get the most out of the visit
A must visit in Coimbatore ,The yogic temple is must visit for us in Coimbatore. It doesn‚Äôt belong to any believes and religious systems. The energy is immense.
Miracle of sadhguru,"Dhyanlinga temple is situated in isha foundation in Coimbatore. As a process, men have to first take bath in surya kund, and women in chadra kund, before entering the dhyanlinga temple. surya kund has three shivlingas in the kund. Preferably, carry your own dhoti and towel for bath in kund. After having bath in kund one can visit the linga bhairavi temple and dhyan linga temple. This temple has one of its kind shivlinga which can activate all seven energy chakras. Silence is maintained inside the temple and you can meditate there."
A perfect meditation centre. Visit this place and get peace of mind.,"Dhyanalinga Temple - The meditation section here is such that you dont have to know how to meditate, you just enter and sit there for a while and you will see yourself automatically going in to a meditative state. Maintaining silence is the crux in this dome shaped structure, you are not allowed to speak, the volunteers their also speak in actions. The whole area is full of positivity. Enter Dhyanalinga Temple and come out charged with positive energy. Awesome experience. Would like to visit more and more."
Meditation  hall,"Isha yoga center ,the spiritual non profit organisation of Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev  is located at the foothills of Velliangiri Mountains and is around 30 kms from Coimbatore.The Dhyana Linga  is a yogic temple dedicated for meditation.It is a big dome shaped hall where you will be allowed to sit and meditate.It is a beautiful experience to sit in silence.Relax and  feel the vibrations."
Beautiful Sculpture ,"It was really nice design of Lord Siva sitting on  dhyanam  Did not like to use bullock cart for transportation,instead management may consider, battery operated cart,bicycle or any other which does not hurt the poor animals "
The Meditation Facilitator,The Dhyanlinga is a 112 foot Shiv Linga in the Isha Yoga Centre and is housed in a dome shaped structure. The entrance is flanked by a huge statue of Patanjali and the Kalpavruksha. Panels depicting various events relating to the mystic Sadhguru and other sages is etched in‚Ä¶

A new experience,"Stayed here for 2 Nights and its the first time in my life i have entered an Ashram.First thing that gets to you is everyone is moving around in their own pace,there is no hurry to get somewhere fast etc.I went vegan for the time i was there since meat is not allowed and it felt‚Ä¶"
fligh High,you guessed it wrong..its not the weed thingi but a more powerful way of  getting high ..the MEDITATION way.here you can sit for hours.. i sat 20 min and you can feel it..no sounds and nosie allowed. 
New age temple,Attractive new age temple this one at Isha centre motivates one to meditate as the atmosphere inside is so calm and the huge Dhyanalinga in the middle radiates certain energy. The music mesmerises.
For yoga course,The ashram was the purpose of our visit. It provides spiritual sustenance and a peaceful experience. If you are a seeker then this experience will be welcome
Peaceful atmosphere,"We visited the Isha foundation which has Dhyanlinga , Bhairavi and the newly installed Adi Yogi statue. There is a Mantap surrounding the dhyanalingam where people can meditate."
Temple for meditation ,"This is located in a thousand acre campus of Isha Foundation started by Sadhguru Yaggi Vasudev.This is a temple where a huge Siva Linga is seen which is reportedly made out of solid Mercury. It is temple for meditation - but entry of the devotees are allowed after taking a holy dip (or sprinkling of holy water) in Surya Kunda (for gents) or Chandra Kunda (for ladies).Daily ‚ÄúNad Aradhana‚Äù is held in multiple sessions each lasting for twenty minutes. Devotees are not allowed to make any sound inside the temple premises & pin drop silence is enforced during Nad Aradhana.Bullock Cart rides are available for commuting between the Adi Yogi statue & Dhyan Linga. They charge a nominal amount of Rs 10 per head for this Bullock Cart ride. Apart from the Bullock Cart ride, shuttle bus service is also available inside the Isha Foundation."
well maintained premsis,"I visited this place long ago & had different memories of it.Now new temples added and everywhere priority access for people with money. the more you spend better the priority will be.Most part of the temple is silent.  full credit for maintaining it.  the place is architectural wonder.  should visit once when ever anyone is visiting Coimbatore.  it is bit far from city and we have to travel thru many villages.  lot of greenery around the place.We loved canteen.  tried cookies, plum cake, bajji and coffee.  all were very good."
Best Temple constructed of our age,"I love to visit old temples, especially the ones of a 1000 year old. This is the only temple I can say constructed in the recent times having the power of a centuries old temples. One can feel the vibe upon entering the Dhyanalingas dome. Maintenance here is so good, entrance here is free, and they will safe keep your electronics and footwear before entering temple. A must visit."
Deforestation in the name of religion ,isha foundation in the name of shiva destroyed the forest. Other side karuyna in the name of jesus destroyed other side of forest
Great Meditation Centre,"Amazing place....No entry fee. Shoes & Mobiles are not allowed inside. You can deposit it at counter for free.Saw people taking bath as well in typical dress, don't know how do they manage at Nag statue.The Shiva linga is situated inside a dome kind of structure. You have to seat in open space with pin drop silence. Once inside the Dome you have to stay inside eyes closed for 15min until the bell rings. The experience was amazing"
Good place to visit once,"We stayed here for 1 night in Nalanda Accommodation. Place is very nice and quite and the most beautiful part of our visit was having lunch at Bhiksha hall. Kudos to the volunteers the way system is followed in regards to seating, serving and then cleaning.Check in process was an absolute night mare, it took 90 mins for them to finish the process making us move from one counter to another even though we were the second one in the Q.Restaurant inside the centre is very un hygienic, while I am talking about hygiene wanted to mention that toilet near the restaurant doesn't have a wash basin, so you are basically expected to go around without washing your hands after using the toilet.I found It really strange that this place is again one of those regular temples where they sell superstitions saying tie some thread or light a lamp and your wishes will be fulfilled. I think this is totally against the ideas of Sadhguru.overall it is a good place to visit once."
Peace personified!,The temple is within the complex that houses about a dozen other places of worship/rituals. Entry is free but you need to deposit all electronic items at a counter before entering. The arrangement for this is pretty efficient and trustworthy.About the temple itself - after many years visited a place of utmost silence where I almost heard my blood flowing! It was scary and comforting at the same time. Worth a revisit. Have made a note to visit and stay for a longer duration in the not so distant future. Beauty!
isha yoga centre,"excellent place, rejunavanating, peace and good for one day visit or can take part in isha yoga foundation programmes."
Peaceful place ,Dhyanalinga temple is temple of lord shiva. It is situated in beutiful nilgiris mountains and 40km from coimbatore city. You hav to go there in morning at morning nature is its peak its beutiful awesome. There was a pound over there in that mercury shivlinga present at the bottom. It was my goodness to touch them and see them. It is very peaceful for every one
This is a new spiritual wonder! ,Amazing grace! Just go!!! Look for more information at the website form isha yoga centre. Go early in the morning. You have to drop your phone and bags at the reception.First you must fill a formulier. And you get a token. Perfect services. Please be smart and talk minimum of 3 hours
God ,I HAD gone with my family firends it was very super place and I spent some money we should have some money I very enjoy
"Tranquil, peaceful and calm",The place is located 40 kms from the Coimbatore City Center. surrounded by beautiful mountains lies this place. One can sit in Dhyanlinga Temple for 15 minutes to meditate. the architecture is beautiful brings calmness with complete silence.
Blissful experience,The place is pure of highest order with persistent positive vibes.Must go irrespective of caste/religion barriers.
A Shiva place With Bhairav and Bhairavi temple,Actually its a wonderful place especially the 3 Shivalinga made of Mercury in the pond of very cold water.When you enter in pond its so much cold just like a water of ice but when you touch your chest to mercury shivalinga feel vibrations as well as heat in body.Dont know what was that but must say awesome experience.
Adiyoga - a serenity Place,"A peaceful place to visit , Huge Statue of Shiva SadGuru Ashram are must see places. You will find people  doing Yoga  and Meditation all around the place."
"Visit Dhyanalinga Temple, Bring Home Peace","In my experience one of the major tourist attractions in Coimbatore, the best place and showcases calm and peace. Being in the foothills one can feel the vibrance. Check for the crowd information and during public holidays and weekends, its typically very crowded. If you are a visitor to Coimbatore and have a day left, you can visit and get home, many taxi and hotels offer packages to this place, so getting to this place will not be difficult for an outsider. It's safe all the way"
Wonderful Meditation experience,A very good place for some peaceful meditation...you need to come here by a bullock cart ride or by small walk from the Shiva Statue...the place is just awesome!!
"High image, Disappointing experience","Charmed by the image it has, took a day oof in Coimbatore to visit the place. The large statue of Lord Shiva looked charming from a distance itself. The Velliangiri Hills give agreat background for the statue. Once we reached the approach road, e realised that it was a Singur with religion to back it. Blatant misuse of good agri land. Beyoud the 38 m high statue of Lord Shiva, we are supposed to walk or hire a bullock cart to reach the main sanctum. The pond on the way, Nagaraj, Linga Bhairavi and Shiva linga are well placed. But no spiritual or religious feel is there. We took the bullock cart back. We realised it was a sort of bonded labour for both the bullock and the cartoperator who hardly get a break during day time. Altogether a disappointing experience wasting half a day and a few litres of petrol."
Profound experience,This is anout 30kms from Coimbatore. We went by bus from gandhipuram. Journey was good as views of velliangiri hills is very nice. Temple has calming and profound atmosphere. Meditation is instant and good. It is managed well by Isha volunteers.
Good place for Meditation and Yoga,"One of the good place you must visit during your trip to coimbatore. Well maintained and well managed by dedicated volunteers that shows how well temple can be maintained.There are lot of yoga training classes available and you can get enrollee yourself and it is worth  trying. Spend some quality time inside  the temple .If you can visit during Mahasivarathiri time then whole atmosphere will be different and you can feel the difference. If someone wants to stay inside the campus, it will be possible by doing reservation through online."
Divine ,Great place for those who love meditation...  The place is so clean and systematic...  My experience at chandrakunda was a memorable one...
Spiritual,"A must visit place to all the people, nice and calm atmosphere , Very Spiritual and had the blessing of Lord Shiva"
Spiritual experience,The Dhyanalingaa is a must go if you are in Coimbatore. If offers the calm you are looking for and meditation comes naturally in a place like this
Serene place !,If you looking to reconnect to your spiritual place and you are an ardent fan of Shiva - you should definitely visit this place !
Unusually beautiful in different dimensions,Visited the ashram for a couple of nights. Ashram is spacious and surrounded by hills that give it a cozy and energetic feel. A decent cafeteria for the non-meal hours food requirements. Huge ground with distinct activities through the day like games etc. What is most profound is feeling the consecrated places. Take a dip in the Suryakund/Chandrakund and sit in the presence of Dhyaanlinga. First day I did it without the dip and felt very silent. Second day I did it after the dip and in about 30-45 min after that I experienced immense vibration with awesome stillness. It is difficult to put it in words. But that effect lasted for a few days after it. Definitely a place for inner transformation if you seek an experience more than regular social life.
Get peace of mind here,A place for yoga and meditation.stay here for some days to get change in your life attitude.you Will feel better.
good place to visit,"this place is @50 km away from coimbatore. It is nice place to be there, a great ashram with calm environment and a massive shiva structure which makes this place amazing."
Nice and calm Environment,Have a visit in case you have time as this is little outskirts of city. I visited in February during the preparation time of large shiva statue. Also don't forget to take a dip in the surya kunda. You really feel mesmerized. Also visit the dhyanalinga temple for meditation for‚Ä¶
Awesome,"Serene, clean, meditation magnet and a place which at outskirts gives you view of culture with modern thought"
Only Dhyan ,"Must visit to the place who really are in search for a peace of mind. Takeout a whole day , spend maximum time in meditation which will definitely help in our spiritual path.."
Amazing one,"I was surprised to see the pillar-less construction of such a big dome. My surprise increased thousand times, when I heard that this was constructed with out Steel & Concrete. This was built with the ancient Indian technique with brick, mud, lime, clay and some herbs."
A  must visit,"A must visit if you are in Coimbatore, a completely different experience for people more so for an North Indian as they are loud this place is very quite where everybody is speaking in whispers"
Spiritual and Calm Atmosphere,"The Shiva Linga at this temple is very large.  Once you enter into the temple, you will have to keep a pin-drop silence.  The dome shaped temple has enough space and you can sit for meditation for some time. Before entry you can also have a holy bath in Surya Kund (for Males) and Chandra Kund (for Females).  Towels are available on nominal charges of Rs. 20 per person."
Extremely Superb,"Dyanalinga Temple is situated near Coimbatore at Isha Yoga Centre, which is formed by Spiritual Guru Shri Sadhguru.  The Linga is huge one and the ambience is very quite.  The temple is built in a Domb shape and once we enter into it, the experience is very spiritual."
Spiritual ,Recently visited a good spiritual calm place. Has improved a lot from the initial days after the gigantic statue of Lord Shiva being there.  There is a positive vibe in the environment.  A peaceful place to visit and stay.
Serene,The fifteen odd minutes of serene silence in the dhyana linga temple was an experience . One has to sit on the floor though and for those with creaky bones and joints this could be a problem . But the silence and the dhyana linga are an experience worth going through any trouble
Hara Hara Mahadev!!,"Visited the much talked about Aadhi Yogi statue of Shiva.  It was a beautiful drive from Coimbatore.  Passed by villages and there was a mild drizzle.  The parking is opposite the Dhyanalingam.  You can hire a cow cart to visit the main ashram from the Aadhi Yogi statue.  It is Rs. 10 per person.  The statue is humongous.  You can buy theertham for Rs. 10 and the purohit will pour it over the lingam for you which is right below the massive shiva statue.There are several shops inside the main ashram.  The sukku coffee was good.  You will need to submit your mobiles and footwear before entering the main ashram.  There is suryakund (for men) and chandrakund (for women) where you need to purchase a ticket to take a holy dip in it.  They are located separately and is massive in the waterfall.The entire ashram is spread over several acres and situated at the foothills of Vellingiri hills. There is good cultivation of coconut, grapes and turmeric all the way to the site.Please don't litter and keep my Coimbatore clean. Do visit Aadhi Yogi - he is just too good!"
Award goes to best deforestor..üò°,A devotional place should be filled with nature. But ISHA became a place of depredating forest.. Nature is prime god/godess...People becoming foolish by day..
Remarkable experience! ,"This place is located about 1 and a half hours (provided there's not much traffic) drive from coimbatore airport (if you require shuttle services u can actually contact the Isha Yoga centre coimbatore for assistance). Our checking process was quick, just be ready with your passports and visa at the foreign checking counter. Our rooms were very comfortable and clean. Just a note though, u'll need to bring your own towels and toiletries. A very organised itinerary will be provided and you can choose which session or activity you want to do. Dhyanalinga is awesome! Definitely given a chance we would love to visit again. Once your here don't forget to visit Adiyogi, it's located outside of the Isha Yoga centre but merely walking distance. U could ride on a bullock cart or van to the Adiyogi as well, services are available. In a nutshell, you need to be there to experience the atmosphere!"
Ancient temple,Worth visiting. It's gives you a feel of old world n the pious atmosphere meserises you.Our family had a good pooja time.
Awesome place for meditation ,Please visit and discover the experience than going based on feedback.I went without any expectations and turned out to be exceptional
A day of peace ,The dyanalinga brings out the calm in you. The sense of peace and oneness comes after a short meditation at the dynalinga. Do not miss out the nada dhara and the evening abhishekam to linga bhairavi.
tune in to absolute silence,The temple contains a big statue in the middle and you are allowed to sit around it to meditate. Make sure to sit there for 10 minutes; quietly with eyes closed and feel the difference it makes. Absolutely wonderful.
The perfect peace.,"Thank you Isha Foundation. This place is something which will make you understand the meaning of eternal bliss. Located about 35kms from Coimbatore city, you not only have the absolute Peace,but also you get to kno yourself. The mesmerizing and gigantic ADI yogi statue, and complete eternal peace inside the Dhyanlinga temple, and a pure bath in the chandrakunda sets your soul free.A must visit, infact one of the thousand thing you must see before you die.Thank you Sadhguru."
"Not to recommended at all, only commercial and has nothing to do with spirituality","Its not a spiritual place at all, only commercial and has nothing to do with what Sadhguru is talking about. I went 8300km from Germany just to visit that place, doing courses and learn. The Inner Engeneering course costs me 16.000INR what is equal to 208‚Ç¨ for 3 days course and they knew from beginning that i smoke cigaretts. So as long as i paid and did the overcharged course nobody complained when i went out of the ashram to smoke. The very next day i went into volunteering the security on the main gate and said its forbidden to leave the ashram as it is dangerous outside. The over sea office then requested me to come to their office and told me that this ashram is not the right place for me and i should leave. Well that was at 5 p.m. so isnt it then dangerous anymore to let a foreign Single woman who is the first time in India and know nothing yet about this country out in the middle of nowere 1 hour before its getting dark outside? And when i requested my money back for the next course that i already had booked for the next day they refused and said i can come back the next day for the course. How ? Walking by feed in case that i am still allive ? Sadhguru said everyone is welcome to that place and never mentioned any restrictions nore is it written on their page anywere. Also i respected the place and walked each time more than 1km to leave the ashram to smoke but were is their respect for their costumers? Its my very own decision to smoke or dont and its an ashram, not a prison. So i cant recommend that place at all and would advice u to think twice about going there special as a female foreigner who would be in the same situation like me. The management is very rude and the idea of that ashram only commercial. Anything is charged extra even a pillow and blankets and a thirt meal if u plan to stay for volunteering. Sadhguru is a great man with a unique understanding about the life itself just pity this ashram has nothing to do with him, just using his Popularity for commercials."
you can`t miss it,This temple is strictly for meditation where you experience complete silence so much so that you can hear the sound of a paper being teared.
nice visit,was there for a yoga course of 7 days so got good chance to visit the place. Nice to be there for good time.
Very peaceful place,"This is place where you have stay for some time and appreciate.This is not just a tourist place , it is more for meditation and for your self. If visiting like a tourist than have to make mind in that way.Altogether it is nice place for your self."
Beyond words,"If you are a seeker of spiritual truth, look no further, i recommend you stay at the Ashram for a few days and soak the energy up, all becomes possible at this very special site"
Great meditational centre,"An excellent meditational centre established by Sadhguru. While  entering in the chamber of Dhyanlinga ,I experienced pin drop silence and vibration ."
Worth a visit,Dhyanalinga is worth visiting. I recommend visiting this place during weekdays when it's less crowded. Visit this place at leisure especially during evenings.
Ashram or a water theme park?,"To me the place looks very commercialized. Every where there is shops, people guiding you on what and how to do and everything is charged. Its like ISKCON where you have food sellers, variety of vendors selling there products all over the place. One time experience was good, but not a place to visit many times."
Pristine Surroundings,"The Dhyanalinga is part of Isha yoga centre, located in the midst of lush green surroundings, amid hills and plains, away from the hustle and bustle of Coimbatore city. This is a place set with tranquil surroundings and the architecture is based on ancient Indian monuments. There are guides who will courteously explain the features of the center in English or Tamil. The Dhyanalinga is inside a hemispherical dome, which is a meditation center. Though it is loosely related to Hinduism, people of all faiths (or no faith) will find peace and solace here. There is an artificial waterfall inside the complex. Don‚Äôt miss a bath in there. There is a restaurant which serves simple, healthy food at nominal cost.Don‚Äôt forget to hear out the video recordings of the speeches of Jaggi Vasudev, who is a very good orator. He will tell you what you already know, in an impressive manner.Many new parts of the complex were still under construction during my visit. I am sure that it will be a marvel once completed. You can go to the center for peace, merriment or just for an outing (picnic)."
Mind Relaxing,I was really relaxed during my visit . it was amazing. Adhiyogi statue was really mesmerized us and it great was great effort made by this foundation. dhayalinga place was extremely calm which made us to feel real spirituality.
Spiritually uplifting ,"If you happen to find yourself in Coimbatore or are traveling to the Isha Foundation. A stop at the infamous Dhyanalinga Temple is a must for any human being, religious beliefs not matter. This is a place of energy and must be experienced. Especially, the evening offering of sound."
it feels like a 'holiday resort',this center is very much dedicated to lord shiva founded by satguruits very beautifully built....n the feeling of visiting it was refreshing......upon arriving .....i was welcomed by the largest lord shiva statue in the world.the main highlight in this center were the large lingam & the holy bath.after a brief meditation session at the large lingam & holy bath......i was pretty much relaxed n felt 'reborn'  its like spending thousands in a luxury resort with all the spas & massage.....it was honestly tht GREAT!!!its a must visit destination if you happened to be around the area.I will planned my trip here again!!
Positive Vibrations!!! heaven on earth !!!,"Dhyanalinga Temple located Velliangiri Foothills, Ishana Vihar Post, Just 29 Kms from Coimbatore city.Connectivity to this temple by road, Its better if you have your own vehicle.Temple around mountains and deep forest, its something we feel heaven on earth.Inside temple premises Camera & Mobile not allowed and made separate counter their you can drop your valuable things. Surya Kund & Chandra Kund - (Not Compulsory) For men Surya Kund and the women in the Chandra Kund.The procedure was to shower first in nearby wash rooms and then enter the Kund for three dips before proceeding to the Dhyanalinga for meditation.Before entering to Dhyanalinga - Outside volunteers will guide you and they also show the video clips. (must watch video clips).Batch wise batch they will allow into the temple, every 15 mins rotation will be their,Once you enter the temple inside we feel positive vibration and inner peace."
Isha,A must..i was moved ..the whole experience left me me wanting more.A spiritual cleanser...soul soother...an abode for the weary traveller of life
Need to establish connection with what you are? Check this out!,"This is not an urban legend. There are some places on earth which, have certain vibrations, a kind of electricity which suddenly and unexpectedly CONNECTS you to your inner self; or at least reminds you gently from within, that there is something out there and in here, over and above the mundane physical/material. I have visited some places like that, a good number of them being ancient Hindu temples, many of them in South India. This is one of them, though the physical infrastructure is modern and newly constructed, you can definitely feel the ancient, deep rumbling within yourself when you enter the huge domed structure and sit in one of the quiet alcoves. Sit with your mind blank, and let whatever thoughts that want to come in, come. The dome itself is an architectural marvel, made of bricks with no metal used anywhere in the construction. The huge Dhyanalinga is awe-inspiring and commands silence and respect. Many od the tourists who trail in (and thousads do, every day) initially do not appreciate these things  and stare and sometimes chatter, but are generally seen to subside at the awe and grandeur of the place. The massive snake around the Linga and the pool festooned with fresh flowers add to the beauty and mystery. Do not forget to take a dip in the ritual bathing pool attached to the temple.Come here if you want a seriously different experience outside the pale of the ordinary tourist trip. And catch the awesome Adiyogi sculpture on the way out. Go with some time to spend...."
Wonderful Place,"Wonderful Place, i stayed 3 days and it was pure Magic.I Meditate in the Dhyanalinga every day for at least 2 hours, it felt Amazing. The accommodation is very good and clean, and the food Delicious"
Spiritual place ,"I had a great time visit Isha yoga at vellingiri hills coimbatore. All of our family members enjoyed visiting Dhyana Linda, linga bhairavhi, and very excited to see adhi yogi statue."
peaceful visit,"I am my family went to Dhyanalinga temple on a holiday (15th Aug'17) with my cousin family. all are enjoyed with peaceful dharshan. kids had enjoyed playing in the ground of Esha Yoga. taking selfies etc., A great day with peaceful mind & happiness. Thanks"

Adi Yogi,Good Calm and neat place feel a little bit of commercialisationSurrounding place is very nice better to visit in morning hour.
Good place to visit.,Commercialised . Nothing more to comment. Meditation hall is good. ADI yogi .... Not matching to the explanation provided.
Meet my friend,"This is in cbe. Ish yoga center. My friend is there as swamiji.  I met after a long. He took us to dhyanalingam ,with rhythmic drums. Sooo spiritual experience."
Isha Main Attraction,This is the main attraction at the Isha Yoga center. A huge lingam in the middle and you need to meditate(or keep quiet) for 15 minutes. A serene environment. Not an everyday affair.
Perfect place to peaceout,Everything related to spirituality and health. I like Yoga and meditation here. Maintenance was good.
Absolute calmness,"I did not have any idea about this place when I visited it with my family.  One key thing that is emphasized - you need to take a shower after you reach this place and it is mandatory.  The entire area is calm and the meditation chamber is quiet and brings calming influence on the mind.  Though there are some controversies about the place, let us leave it aside and enjoy the calm location to refresh the mind after hard working week."
Excellent place for dhyana,This temple is located in the coolest place of coimbatore. The climate was very nice during the months july-aug. It was drizzling which i enjoyed. The most favorite thing is dhyana mandapam. It really gives you peace and refreshes your mind.
Evening visit,"Try the temple on spl days, will offer various poojas and prasad too. There are various sub temples, try to visit all of them. Try to go up by climbing 500 odd steps, will give an unique experience."
nice place to visit,even we might have differnce of  throughts about their actvities its a nice place for a day outing. all facilities are nice. food is available at normal cost inside.
Spiritual Places near Coimbatore,"Isha Yoga, excellent place for peaceful meditation. Brilliant architectures, waterfalls, especially Surya kund & Chandra kund. We also can visit the south indian's Himalaya- VELLIANGIRI HILLS, and Giant Statue of Adiyogi Shiva."
Isha Foundation,Although Coimbatore  is a little difficult to reach from Chennai or Trichy I decided it's on my do list.The center is on immense property  and the Dyanalingam very accessible once you follow entry procedures.Freedom to visit or to meditate is a plus as with all the different areas of the center.However to see for myself the vast areas of beautiful forests of the Vellagiri hills. cleared and devastation to its plant and wildlife to make way for concrete buildings for fun and fare in the name of godly bliss was unpalatable for me and my Two cents worth.
Nice place with great intentions,"I love Sadhguru, his efforts and his speeches.  I love the location of this place and the calmness it has around it.  But the over enthusiastic volunteers of this place are just a pain in the neck.... I was sitting and waiting for my turn to enter the Dhayanalinga hall. Out of nowhere, a volunteer walks up to a random person (who is really really silent I say), knocks them on the shoulder and says ""SHHHHHH"". She kept doing this to random people.... Very very irritating given that the volunteer was the one who was interrupting a very silent crowd. I have noticed this during my multiple visits to the center.  The intentions of this place are great but I wish that the volunteers who stop over-acting."
Truly spiritual ,Wonderful place and spiritually positive . Do visit to relax yourself in spiritual way . They also have a stay available where you change yourself completely .
A place beyond religion.  Never fail to have a moment at the place.,"I with my family visited there.  Each and every volunteers / staff there are begging every devotees / visitors to keep the holiness of the place.  Culturally, architecturally, auspiciously, .... excellent.   U can spend a minimum of 2hrs to a long life in this place."
Nice calm place!!! Isha,"Isha!! Hello all, outer side from coimbatore, excellent, very peace full place for dhiyam. Inside Linga place is very brilliant architect and its very calm. Once you visit Isha temple...much more better and good for your mind. Thanks!!"
This temple will develop into a major cultural centre for the followers of Lord Shiva!,"Visited in July, and the first stop was the 112 ft Adi Yogi statue of Lord Shiva. One word to describe it, Majestic!The drumming was a bit off but, that is what the Lord likes! The next stop was the temple. I had my 80 year old mother and I found it a bit difficult but we made it to the sanctum. The arti and the pooja style was different and the atmosphere was divine. I bought a locket made in combination with mercury and wearing it felt good. Then I went to the Lingam, and the atmosphere was divine and I will visit again, hopefully. The place is well organised, a lot of believers and it is nice to see them walk purposefully in their attire and observe their methods. Overall, a very good experience and a must see when in Coimbatore."
May be one of the biggest Shivlinga in the world,Dhyanlinga is a Shivlinga consecrated by Sadhguru as per wish of his guru. It is at Isha Yoga Centre which is 43 kms away from airport. Timings are morning 6am to 8 pm. There is Nadha Aradhna ie prayer through sounds from 11.45 am to 12.10 pm and 5.45 pm to 6.10 pm. Prasad offerings can be purchased outside the temple. Entry to temple is via Linga Bhairavi temple. Drive to the place is very scenic. Taxi like Ola can be booked on rental basis to visit the place
Peace and tranquility ,We visited Isha foundation in the month of July 2017. We were amazed by the large number of volunteers helping in the conduct of events in the centre. The Suryakund and the Chandrakund are neatly maintained for men and women separately. We can experience the absolute silence and meditation in the Dhyanalinga temple.Overall it a different spiritual experience
"""Must visit"" when you are in Coimbatore","One of the places not to be missed in Coimbatore.There is also a new addition to the campus,  an Adiyogi Shiva statue, a 112-foot-tall (34 m) statue of Hindu deity Shiva inaugurated by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in Feb 2017."
A Serene Place with a great Aura!!!,Adiyogi structure is awesome under the backdrop of the lush green Western Ghat Mountains and gives a solemn aura to the place. The Isha Yoga Centre is worth a place to visit for taking a break from city life.
Sacred place,"i attend the Dyana Hall, my mind completely silent. Have a very good experience in my inner world.South indian s Himalaya under the VELLIANGIRI HILLS."
You will yourself meditate here,I am in love with this place. I would suggest tourists to stay here for a day at least and experience the truth and beauty of life. If possible do join a course.
peacefull,"this is how modern Indian can pay back to mother India well built and maintained by isha foundation, by visiting this site spiritual and mental calmness and happiness can be achieved,the pool in the beginning as well as all the structures are modern marvels in itself ,to enjoy one must spent at least half a day preferable mornings"
Excellent,An Excellent place to visit and have a quiet meditation. The organization is all through volunteers and hence is without the usual bustle of a standard retreat.
Wonderful experience and great trip...,Its a good place to visit and spend an entire day. One who is looking for spiritual growth must definitely come here. Places to see in Isha Yoga center: a) Dhyanalinga temple b) Linga bhairavi temple c) Surya kund (for gents) and Chandra kund (for Ladies) d) Adi yogi statue and‚Ä¶
Place for peace,Sadguru has made this Dhanalinga temple. It is located at foothills of velliangiri mountains. It is about 38 km form the Coimbatore. There are many travel options available to reach from Coimbatore. Ola and private taxis are available. Government transport buses are also‚Ä¶
Never miss it,Dhyanaliga temple is great. Once in your lifetime must visit temple. Near the mountains atmosphere is good.
Dhyanalinga,"Dhyanalinga, located at foothills of Velliangiri mountains is about 30 Km from Coimbatore. It is a energy centre created by mystic Satguru Jaggi Vasudevan for meditation. I visited this place in May 2017.  Good place to initiate into the spiritually and yoga."
