Interesting way to spend a couple of hours,"Very interesting, we spent a couple hours looking around, even better as it free! You must book though due to covid."
Lovely little museum,Lovely museum and kept safe during Covid-19. My 3 year old loved going round and looking at all the trains. It’s also free so you cannot grumble either
Great day out!,"Very easy to visit, even with new COVID systems in place. Booking a ticket online was no hassle at all. Nice cafe and good range in gift shop also."
trains and more trains,"we visited this museum on a Sunday , and even though we had to pre-book our visit due to the Covid 19 restrictions the place was busy , although there was plenty of space for social distancing. overall I think the museum is well worth a visit especially as it is free to enter although they welcome donations towards the upkeep and running costs."
Fascinating even for non-railway visitors,"My wife, who normally is not interested in trains, found the Royal Carriages fascinating for how the Royal family travelled by train.Another, albeit sad, example of history was the Ambulance Train depicting the wagons used in World War I to take the wounded from the battle front"
Two day break,A large portion of the museum is closed due to COVID but it’s still worth a visit things keep changing so there’s something new to see
Best place in York in my opinion.,"I love this place. Free to get in and easily the best selection of trains, simulators and attractions of any railway museum. We did everything, they had covid restrictions in place which I hate but do understand. We got around everything in a couple of hours due to time constraints but the depth of knowledge and quality of exhibits could keep you interested for hours. A truly outstanding example of British heritage."
Excellent,I have not been to york in many many years but decided to visit this museum and local model shops. I was very pleased with both! Sadly the covid restrictions made it not as enjoyable as it should have been but I knew that going in and can't fault the museum or staff at all. Thank you - John
Enjoyable,"Visited here during a 3 day break to York.Some really interesting exhibits on show. Love the fact they have all types of engine and carriage on show and I thought the layout was well thought out especially during these strange times (Covid).I like the idea of pre booking as I can imagine during normal times it can get quite busy and very noisy with the children running around.One slight downside is the price of food but I suppose when the entrance fee is free they need to make their money somehow so I don't begrudge this too much, plus you don't have to buy it!"
Areas out of bounds ,"Been here several times , but with restrictions certain areas I enjoy not accessible .We always donate bit until this virus is ended will probably not visit again ."
Sorry lots of out of control children|!,I love to wander around here so much history.Sadly it was spoilt by children running around out of control spoiling my visit.It did not feel safe or clean because of this.Social distancing out of the window.
Amazing!!,Definitely worth the visit. A lot bigger than we originally thought. Really interesting and the coffee and scones were delicious! Wish we would have been able to spend a little more time in there (even though we are not train fans). We very much enjoyed our visit.
Loved it,"Really didn't know what to expect and trains are not usually of interest to me, however I really loved it! Was really taken by the stories behind the carriages and trains they had. The history was fascinating. From royal trains, to bullet trains and modern day exhibits to mm and but a few.Well worth a visit."
It's fantastic and it's free!,"So much industrial history, so many reminders of when the world was mechanical, not electronic. I like mechanical stuff. Even at rest and with the fires out, the sheer size of a main line locomotive is a thing to behold; they are visceral things that create an emotional response in many cases.Even with some of the exhibits closed because of the pandemic, and the need to wear a mask, there is so much to see. Mallard, Evening Star, Rocket, Duchess of Hamilton, literally dozens more; all represent British history in a time before this country became impoverished and diminished. There's a range of exhibits from overseas also, to remind us that railways may have been invented in the UK, but marvels were created in many places around the world.I cannot imagine anybody being bored here; some might spend an hour, others half a day, but there must surely be something here to pique the interest of anybody."
Rail Museum visit,"Virus restrictions in place so many parts closed, cafe had very limited options. Quite busy but well ,managed. Restrictions meant you couldn't go inside any carriages or engines but still worth it. It's a large museum, lots of walking, car park is quite a distance from entrance."
12 years on and still great,"Going back after 12 years was a shock, so much has changed and certainly will do for the future, saw the Stratford to Moreton tramway and it's history, we see a little which still remains in Stratford upon Avon, an amazing place to go around and to be able to see the Mallard experience, for myself was great, shame at present the Flying Scotsman is not there, she makes my day, as I can remember her passing us many times when younger on regular service, what is going to be done with all the artifacts you hold as due to Covid-19 this are not being seen, which is such a shame as so much is there, hopefully they will be on display in the future, wish you well for the future with all the plans we saw"
Train Museum,"I’m not a ‘train fan’ but my other half is. So we went here whilst in York. It was better than I expected and I did quite enjoy it and so did ‘Teddy’. We found a few things from our part of the country too, which was quite exciting to see."
great time,only got a couple of hours was slightly crowded in parts but staff greatly on hand to assist with social distancing
Fantastic visit!,"Both my husband and I visited this museum and absolutely loved it! There is just something about trains that is nostalgic. You have to be into trains to enjoy, a little bit of history, engineering and the best of British."
"Very interesting, but a few exhibits closed due to covid","Very interesting place to spend a few hours, and great value being free although you do have to pre-book tickets online.We parked in the Long Stay station carpark for £5 all day and just a 10min walk away.2 large halls/hangars with all sorts of trains from super modern Japanese bullet train, Eurostar, right back to the days when horses pulled carriages, and the first ever steam train - Rocket. Very informative and interesting reading and seeing the whole life span of trains."
Interesting,"We spent around 2.5 hrs here and could have been here longer there is so much to see.  We did the simulator of the Mallard which was good fun, would recommend."
Great even if your not a train freak,A really good experience. Dont go to York without seeing this. Although they like to receive donations admission is free
A must,Really interesting a must visit if in York.Really enjoyed seeing the history.  Great afternoon spent here.
Great day out,Great free family day out. Donations are encouraged and worth the experience. Cost is £10 to park. Lovely day with family
Railway history close up,We loved being able to see all the engines and carriages close up but we were sad that due to COVID restrictions we couldn’t enter them.
Great free day out..,Free day out..remember to prebook!Lots to see even if not a train fan...was really interesting...shame some things closed..Good few hours wondering around and stopped for a cuppa..Lots of different trains from eras and can get close up to them..
Really enjoyable ,"This museum is brilliant I really loved looking through the windows of the royal trains, amazing to see where queen victoria sat on her trips to Scotland. The luxury she and prince Albert put into all the carriages was incredible.So much to see in the two big halls of trains. Including a replica of Stephenson’s rocket and so much more."
Worth a look ,Having pre booked our visit a necessary requirement due to Covid we then spent a great couple of hours exploring this wonderful museum all for free we did however leave a donation .For train enthusiasts or not this really is worth a visit with so many exhibits to see Highly recommended
Great Collection of Trains,Easy to find as well signposted.Great collection of old trains and memorabilia.Quite a lot was closed off due to Covid-19 regulations.
Great,Great place to go the stuff you learn I was like a kid with new toys. Great place for all of any age
Great FREE venue.,We really enjoyed spending a couple of hours here on a wet afternoon - you do have to book a entrance slot at the moment though.  I especially liked the old royal trains.
Great Morning Visit ,Good covid rules in place - shame we couldn't see some of the carriages but totally understand the constraints needed. Very well laid out and fabulously preserved trains. Well worth a visit.
Wonderful,Best attraction in York and it is free Appeals to all age groups Well organised exhibits and efficient one way system Covid restricts access to interior of exhibits which is understandable Good coffee in socially distanced cafe Must prebook an entrance time  so as number of visitors can be controlled and no overcrowding Don't miss a visit if visiting York My favourite  Mallard
"Seriously good value - ie free, and very interesting!","I had to book in advance everything we visited on our Lakes and York holiday, so forgot this is free! What is not to like? It is huge, with really interesting examples of the history of railway engines and carriages. I loved them all, especially the yellow ""Rocket"". At the moment you cannot go into the trains, because of COVID which is a shame, but was still enough to take up around 3 hours taking photos. I also was able to buy a very interesting book of metro rail systems maps of world cities in the gift shop which I like very much. Hopefully for future holidays when the virus has been defeated!"
"Free experience, limited with Covid but well worth a  visit","Positioned behind York station (and can access by walking through the station), this is a free attraction (donations welcome) which I think would be well appreciated by train fans (which we weren't).Still an interesting walk round the exhibits, most interesting for us were the royal trains.  The museum, as expected, has quite a few restrictions due to Covid, so was quite limited in what you could do.  Felt safe walking around a 1 way route to see the trains and exhibits.  You need to book a slot on-line so just just turn up.  Cafe on site and gift shop, neither of which we used.A must for train fans!"
A very good place for train enthusiast ,Had a great day at the National Railway Museum. We have never seen so many trains from the early steam trains to the bullet train. It would have been extremely amazing if we did the steam ride but due to Covid 19 it was closed. This is a must do when visiting York.
September visit,"Not bad at all. Booked tickets for a half hour entry slot, very efficient entry system in place. As tickets were limited, there was plenty if space to see the exhibits, without lots of people crowding around. Very well set out inside, my only issue was that there was very little information about each train on display."
We visit here annually,"This is a fab place to come for all ages and especially you railway enthusiasts out there. We come here annually because my boyfriend loves trains and you get to watch the trains come into York from the museums open platform, it’s free to get in but they do ask for a donation and it’s just next to the stations, they have real live departure boards so you can know what train it is. Well worth a visit!!"
EACINATING PLACE worth a visit,You will see what put the great in Britain at this place . take a good hour to go round . Royal trains and even the new range of japans bullet train on show café etc . good for children to see our history and heritage
"Glad to be open, but rather static in these times of hysteria","The two main halls were open, showing the royal carriages and the locomotives.  all were well presented.  However, it felt rather staid and static and was quite a long 'signposted' walk back and forth between them.  There were no outside attractions or activities available nor the land train to the Minster...  However, we were glad to attend and donate, helping them to come through these difficult times.  I bought an interesting and challenging 1,000 piece jigsaw for Christmas, showing the History of Trains.  A useful reminder of a happy morning spent with these old iron work horses."
Could’ve been better,"This museum is certainly well worth a visit. The trains on display are amazing and the royal carriages are very interesting. The gift shop has a good range of pretty decent quality books, souvenirs, toys etc.. I was disappointed, however, with the lack of information to accompany the displays. It would’ve been good to have had some archive video material of the trains, the drivers, the postal workers and even the royals. It wasn’t always clear what we were looking at. Imperial War Museum does a very good job of this, though they don’t have free admission. Admittedly the Covid restrictions might be to blame ... after an hour and a half, the face mask becomes a bit hard to tolerate, so don’t expect to stay very long here!"
Day out,"Excellent COVID measures in place, fantastic heritage, the whole place is very spacious and clean. Fabulous food and Mallard simulator is great fun. Really friendly staff."
Great for children and adults of all ages,"Excellent exhibition of real steam trains from The Rocket to modern day. Able to go up close to trains but not inside. A small but enough detail of their history is on show. A model train is outside great for children and adults alike. Leave a good 2 hours to get around, two cafes for teas and coffees- and its free!! How do they do it?"
Excellent insight into railway history,The museum was extremely well set up and offered many exhibits. I felt that the whole area took the safeguarding of visitors during this difficult time very seriously and therefore spent a good amount of time wondering around the halls. A little disappointed that all Harry Potter exhibits had been moved to Warner Studios.
Loved it.....,Not all the sections are open....but its lovely seeing all the trains so highly maintained and looked after. A good one-way system is put in place but you never feel rushed and you can linger as long as you like. The shop could sell more just needs a better choice in some things...but enjoyed our visit.
Interesting place to visit,Great place to visit even if you not a massive train enthusiast.  Lots to see about trains and in large halls so easy to keep socially distanced and even better no charge to get in.  Not many places don’t change. But I do recommend a donation
Nice museum ,"Interesting, we liked this museum. Good organisation. Nice to see that it's available for disabled people."
Fantastic,Loved the trains and the fact you can see inside them. We took a 19month old and he loved it too. Will definitely return when he's older.Brilliant that museums like this are still going due to donations. The parking is a bit steep £10 for the day but they have to make money for the museum so seeing as we didn't pay for tickets we didn't think that was bad plus you can go into City centre etc and leave the car there.
Fascinating place ,We had been told by several friends that we must visit the national railway museum. We booked a slot (free entry) and didn't wait long before going in. Due to covid-19 it's marked out for social distancing although at times it's hard because of other people visiting. We presume you can usually go in some of the trains but they were closed off. There were a few parts closed off and only one cafe open. Even if you are not a train enthusiast you would love this. No steam train ride or mini railway operating. Need to go again sometime
Well organise and still fun,"Visited the museum whilst on holiday in York, had been before a few years ago.Give the current COVID restrictions we thought the museum did very well in organising the exhibitions, and we still got a lot out of our visit.Well worth a visit to support this important facility"
Wonderful museum,"Wonderful museum and have taken all of the coronavirus precautions, only allowing a small amount of visitors per visit. Free with optional donation. Could have had better lighting but for a free museum it’s fantastic"
"Several exhibits closed, due to Covid restrictions","I have been to this museum many times and always enjoy it, this time I took our grand children and unfortunately many of the exhibitions were closed due to Corvid 19 restrictions. Still the children enjoyed what the were allowed to see. The staff controlled the entry very well, you must book before arriving."
A wonderful asset,"THE place to visit whilst in York. I haven't been here for over 30 years so things have changed a little in the mean time.... At the moment you have to pre book online (Free or a donation)  so they can restrict the number of visitors. Very efficient entry system even with people turning up on the off chance were told sorry but you have to book online or wait for a slot. Once inside just follow the arrows it has a one way system, although you do get the occasional person who thinks rules are not for them. They soon found the errors of their ways. All cafes were open as was the main shop. Certain parts were closed because of the situation, but still well Werth the visit. We were there for nearly 2 hours and saw everything, I'm sure people do stay longer."
Good to visit,This was an interesting well organised venue with lots of interesting things to see. The current safety measures didn’t get in the way of the enjoyment.
"Was okay, but seemed to be a lot of signs missing ","Me and my partner visited here as we are both into anything involving engineering. We got a late afternoon slot (around 3pm) which did not leave us a lot of time to enjoy it, so try and get a earlier slot! It was well layed out and easy to social distance. But in one of the areas there seems to be a lot of signs missing, so although we could be impressed with the locomotives we did not know what we was looking at. We think this might have been down to them closing some parts between trains because they are to narrow to social distance, but would have been nice if they moved the signs."
Great visit! ,We visited over the weekend and felt very safe given the current covid circumstances. The staff were very polite and accommodating. We’d recommend a trip here as it’s free (voluntary donation given for the great work and up keep!)  especially if you have kids who are train mad!! Hopefully the covid situation calms down so they can open the experience fully but it was great still to wonder round and she these great trains! The monarchy/royal collection is well worth a visit!!
Love this place!,Used to come as a child many times and hasn't lost its magic even as a 25 year old. Wish everything could be open but obviously I know why it isn't - still a great hour to be had wandering around looking at the amazing exhibits. My favourite is the bullet train and now I can take it everywhere with me as I bought a pin badge of it to the bewilderment/amazement of my boyfriend from the gift shop! Thank you for this lovely museum!
Sheldon would be in heaven here!,"This was more for my husband than me, he loves trains. However, this turned out to be a very enjoyable visit. Some of the attractions were closed due to COVID but that didn't take away from the visit. It was lovely to see the royal trains and Stevenson's Rocket. There were a lot of people with young children there and I think 8,9, 10 years olds would be covering this in History at school as I could hear lots of questions from them.   Worth a visit"
trains ,I have been hear loads of time the best museum in the uk lots of trains to see things to do as well cafes and shops too
Well worth a visit,Great way to spend 90 mins looking at the old trains and free to enter as well - exhibits well spaced out and signage very clear in these Covid times
Stepping Back In Time,"A great day out and a living history lesson. Thank goodness that someone had the foresight to rescue and restore these important pieces of history. The exhibits are excellent, I really enjoyed the royal carriages and the Mallard. Some good places to eat, amongst the exhibits. Entry was free with optional Donation - COVID restrictions require booking ahead. Easy walk from York city centre or car parks nearby."
Good,"It was a good museum but more geared towards kids than the serious railway fan but still a good museum Although it is a shame that the original Stevenson’s rocket is there cause the kids aren’t going to be interested in a rotten old Barell on wheels are they, the REAL rocket should be at locomotion because people will actually like it there an very un-informative due to the lack of details on the signs such as Eddystone, on the sign it just said ‘express passenger locomotive’ but otherwise a good museum, but I do have a couple of issues , such as: i was expecting to see a Stirling single but it was nowhere to be found, I was expecting them to stock hornby, but no!"
Not all open,Shame it was not all opened because the pandemic not their fault but still a very good visit will be back even the wife enjoyed it
Great museum,"Was really surprised at how interesting and vast this museum was! Amazing value given that it was free, and even with some of the exhibits shut due to covid, we managed to spend over an hour and a half there. Well worth a visit even if you normally have zero interest in trains like me!"
A morning at the NRM,"I’m not a great fan of railway museums, however, I would recommend you spare sometime in your trip to York and see for yourself.Unfortunately, a lot of the displays were closed, because of the physical distancing measures, but still so much to see.It did make me feel quite old, to see the 125 inter city trains, on which I once travelled and drank that terrible tea!"
Excellent,"A truly excellent museum, if you like trains. If not, it is still worth a visit. It is also free, as all museums should be."
"Trains, trains, trains","Having a train obsessed 4 year old, we thought we would go back to the NRM - we're happy we did.Covid measures seem to be spot on - bookable tickets, one way system, hand sanitiser points and some smaller areas closed.The selection of trains is great as ever, with the inclusion of an Intercity 125 a particular highlight.You can walk around the museum, following the route, and get close to the trains as normal, although (for obvious reasons) you can't access the cabs.This is always a great way to spend a few hours when in York."
Love this museum,"It is such a nice place for a day trip with family and friends, there are so many trains with lots of details and even places to eat at here. I love going with friends and every time it doesn't disappoint me, best part is it is free to visit and great for train lovers."
fantastic day out!,I booked this after seeing the museum on Good Morning Britain last Monday. We weren't disappointed-it  was an amazing experience
Great even for non-enthusiasts,"Went with low expectations because I  confess to not being particularly interested in trains, but the historical context including trains for the Royalty and the fastest steam train as well as ambulance trains were fascinating."
Really Great Museum To Visit If You Love Museums & Learning About History! ,"We Came Here Because Our Family (Who Are All Adults!) All Loves Going To Different Museums! And We Were Not Disappointed! The Place Is Absolutely Huge With Tonnes Of Different Trains! So Much History & Learning To Be Done Here! They Have A Small Train Ride That Goes Round The Grounds At The Back Which As A 30 Year Old Adult I Really Enjoyed! Lots Of Drinks & Treat Stalls Dotted About With Plenty Of Benches To Sit On If Anyone Needed A Small Break! Could Easily Spend A Good 3/4 Hours Here If You Really Took Your Time! 10/10 Will Highly Recommend! Plus The Museum Shop Is Quite Reasonable In Pricing, And Their Cafe Was Good Prices Too! My Fav Part Was Learning About All The NHS Trains We Used During The WW2! 5* Will Definitely Be Going Back Again!"
Is what it is niw,"Tipped up here of a long weekend in York and one has to prebook a slot to enter.It’s such a pain to wear a mask around the whole massive gaff the whole time when you can go to a pub and carry on with gay abandon without one. Not their fault I note and more a Boris bumbling.The exhibits were interesting with a number of steam engines, a hst loco, the mallard and a few other modern day classics in the collection. Bit of a shame though that a lot of stuff was sealed off still for the sake of nutty children who don’t know their class 87s from a 4 triple sub for fear of super spreading.Wasn’t a bad visit being it was free, but the restrictions meant it felt depressing at times. Not their fault though so will give the classic 4/5."
Great free museum,"Far more interesting than I thought it would be as I have no interest in trains !  I loved the furnishings and furniture of the carriages, particularly the royal carriages through the years. Of course, many many old engines and carriages to see for the more traditional train enthusiast. It's free which is great and you go at your own pace. I would have liked more info about what I was seeing, without having to buy the guidebook. You can get refreshments inside the museum. 5/5 as it's free and good."
Very good visit for all ages,"We visited with two grandsons aged 12 and 8 and we all enjoyed the visit very much, especially having a connection with some of the exhibits as my father, grandfather and great-grandfather had all worked at the Swindon railway works.Despite the restrictions we were still able to see a lot of the exhibits and the boys were wowed by some of the trains. We also visited the play area which, while quite small, was a great success. We went to the cafe as well and felt that there should have been more 4 place tables set out as we had to sit on 2 separate  tables.However all in all the museum gives a great day out - we spent nearly 3 hours there including the cafe and the play area."
Great visit ,"Lovely little visit to the museum, shorter than hoped as not everything open, but kept our little train enthusiast happy for over an hr.  Very interesting and informative and some good safety measures in place. Will hope to return when more is open."
Rubbish,Absolutely rubbish no indication of having to book in advance drove round to it paid £7 in the car park not theirs which £10 told no tickets no entry now out of pocket £7 to a car park company that’s automated not like it’s a local attraction waste of money and time
"Great trains, shame about some visitors","The good: the trains. Very interesting exhibits even though many areas are still closed. And of course it is all free!The not-so-good: I saw several parents encouraging their young children to climb and swing on the trains despite signs saying not to. Perhaps some staff enforcement would be helpful here? The cafe was also pretty poor, but I didn't really mind paying the inflated prices if it helps maintain the museum. The staff member who served me wasn't very attentive or friendly though and I had to ask for sugar for my tea and a plastic knife for my scone. These were just plonked in front of me like I'd annoyed him!"
Very happy!,"Great first time visit to this museum, although some of the attractions and areas were off closed due to Covid restrictions we were still able to have a great couple of hours here. The main exhibits were all easily accessible with the wheelchair and there are lifts in place so we could access balconies etc.The cafe downstairs was a little expensive (£3.95 for a scone) but entry and accessible parking is free so not a big issue, will definitely visit again when it's back to normal with all exhibits open."
Surprisingly interesting and enjoyable.,"I wasn’t expecting to enjoy this visit so much. I went with a friend who was keen to go, but half expected to be bored silly. There were restrictions due to coronavirus, but there were loads of trains to see and lots of interesting information alongside. I particularly enjoyed the exhibition regarding the hospital trains in the war."
Could be a lot bettter,"Staying in York for a few days and managed to book tickets online after website kept saying none available. The approach on foot to the museum is through a grotty tunnel smelling of wee with broken glass not a  very pleasant start. Once arrived at the museum in our dedicated time slot we were shown in quickly. We decided to try to get something to eat first so went to cafe in the great hall, 2 sandwiches and 2 cans of coke nearby £15 No Way!! we put it back and decided not to eat.  Shame reasonably priced food would sell well, when I questioned price I was told well the museum is free, not the point.Inside is an interesting collection but the great hall I didn't feel was that great it's missing something and felt a little worn out and dated. The rocket is an example as it's kind of stuffed in a side room surrounded by white walls that really to show it to it's full glory, wasted opportunity could be a really fantastic display with a bit more thought and input. Glad I've seen it but wouldn't rush back."
Very interesting ,First I have to say that they have made the museum easy to navigate and use with the COVID restrictions. I have wanted to visit for years and today we finally the sheds are well organised and the engines look amazing it’s a great place to visit even if you not into trains.
Wasn't Chuffed,I've been to the NRM many times over the years and was pleased to hear it was open again.TBH it's not really my cup of tea but I was looking forward to a half price cuppa thanks to Rishi's Dishes. The platform cafe was closed - understandably to allow social distancing.The other cafe in the main hall was open but the hygiene standards flew in the face of all the advice. The table tops were crumb covered and bins overflowing. The queue of only a few people took ages to be served and the prices would make Betty herself blush. Thank goodness it was half price.Need to get the catering back on the rails - maybe invest in some ... erm ... train(ing).
Superb collection of old railway engines,I'm not one of those people who gets extremely excited by ancient steam engines but this museum is absolutely extraordinary and is a definite must.  The locomotives are extremely impressive and they are well explained.
Exhibit good..... cafe bad ,"The selection of trains (even though half was still closed) was excellent and we really enjoyed reading about and looking at the displays. The museum is very clean and is set up well to meet covid requirements, with lots of space, reduced capacity, cleaners and hand sanitizer! The cafe lets this place down so much, the prices are very very expensive! £2.50 for a cup of tea, which is hot water and a teabag as I take it black! The prices in the cafe resulted in us taking our custom to a cafe in York. Gift shop also very expensive, cheaper to buy the products on offer elsewhere. Fantastic museum let down by the prices in the cafe"
locomotive heaven.,What a place kids loved it and so did I. Nice the get up close to the locomotives. I would definitely go again.
Passed a few hours,"Well worth a visit to pass an hour or 2, unfortunately not all open but fully understandable in these times! Will hopefully visit again when it's fully open"
Training visit,"I'm not a train enthusiast but still enjoyed walking around the huge locos... from vintage trains to the modern bullet train from Japan.  For someone like me that only has a passing interest in trains it was quite interesting.  For any trainspotters it must be heaven.. Some areas are currently locked off.. I'm guessing due to covid.Considering this is a free to enter museum, it is a must visit, really good for a rainy day,  just remember to book in advance at this timeAs for this review.... end of the line.... everybody off! 🙂"
Not covid ready!!,"Completely disappointed .We travelled for 2 hours, paid £10 to park the site to find our total visit was 40 minutes because the majority of exhibits and halls aren't yet open. Would have been nice to have been informed at time of booking. The day has cost us a fortune for nothing.  Save your money!!!"
Made to feel not welcome,"My husband & I travelled from Kent to give the museum  some paper work we had , We booked  for 12 August  , We were both looking forward to going  but I forgot my  entrance ticket so was unable to get in  . A loss for them ."
It's not all re-opened,"I was really looking forward to this and I'll admit to being disappointed. One entire hall was closed. I understand we're in a pandemic, but I fail to see how it couldn't have been safely opened with staggered entry and arrows, just like the main hall was open. The interpretation needs updating. There are some stunning locos in there but several have non-existant or hard to locate labelling. The significance of the pieces isn't always clear. Again, I fail to see why a one way visit of the Shinkansen wasn't available. If I can survive 2,5 hrs in a train from London to get here, I can survive 2mins in a display train. The history of railways in Britain, which was pretty well displayed, ends in the 1990s. Twenty years have passed in the meantime. If you're visiting York and love machines, then you absolutely must go, but maybe adjust your expectations."
Shame not all open,"Not really my thing but I went for my son who LOVES trains. I did find it quite interesting though. It is such a shame that not all the museum was open but couldn't be helped. I didn't have anything to eat so can not comment. There was quite a few trains to see and it is next to the train station and quite easy to find, sign posted."
Brilliant heritage visit and great for kids.,Brilliant place you can actually get lost in the heritage. Loved the bullet train set up. The informational vids were brilliant. And great for the grandchildren!!
Spent an amazing day here ,We spent an amazing day here. Had a bite to eat which was a slightly confusing set up but a nice setting. Free to get in with optional donation. We definitely recommend you donate this is a fabulous day out. Thank you so much for an informative packed aw inspiring day.
Good ,Its got quite alot of engines spread over a number of halls and you can actually go on a mock up of a bullet train carriage. Personally I liked the mallard best of all but there are plenty of different locomotives around. It's free entry which is always a bonus and of course there is a well stocked gift shop. We visited in January so I don't know how much the dreaded covid has affected the place.
Brilliant,Unfortunatley at these COVID19 times this attraction is closed. However if in the future you visit york it is a must you will be overwhelmed by the history. Our fav was the 1st ever bullet train from Japan knowing how fast this went back in the day was fab
I took my 10 year old ,Its a charity so free to enter but you just want to donate its an amazing place i have taken my son many times there is always something new its incredible
Very enjoyable visit ,I went here a few months back and well i was really surprised that i enjoyed this place. trains aren’t really my thing but when i went to give my grandad a look at how things were when he was young i enjoyed it as much as he did. he loved telling me and showing me where he sat and where he worked. it was amazing for all of us. getting to see such brilliant and beautiful trains was a great day out and well worth the visit. thank you for making my grandad able to revisit how it used to be for him and thank you for making the rest of my family have a really enjoyable day out!
Excellent,"Am amazed that this place is free,so much to see . From a woman's point of view i thought it would be a bit boring but not a bit of it was. The Japanese bullet train was a revelation and lots of steam trains but my very favourite trains was the ones with the royal carriages , wow luxury indeed."
Incredible trains,"Always go to NRM if visiting York.  Wonderful to see the old and new trains: the Flying Scotsman and Shinkansen - incredible.  Lucky to have travelled on Flying Scotsman in 1970's wow!!!Looking forward to visiting again, spend a day there always delights."
Must visit if you love trains,"If you love trains, this is a must visit place in York. The museum was very close to the York train station and was easy to locate. We  drove down to York from Leeds and we found a convenient car park right next to the train station. The weather was pretty cold and we chose to visit this place after a nice warm lunch. There is no entry fee for visiting this place. There is however a voluntary donation box at the entrance (atleast 10 boxes) and volunteers were all over there asking for donation. I did pay a donation as I love trains and I thought it’s fair to pay for maintaining this place.Wow... we went starting to the hall where the old trains were parked. Huge... huge... just awesome. Unbelievable to see the huge machines that you normally see in movies.We spent a good two hours visiting the different exhibits. We missed the virtual train experience by just couple of minutes. So if you are visiting this place towards evening then please do cover the virtual experience first before you start enjoying the exhibits."
Best transport/ social history museum in Europe,"Love it! Visited frequently since about 1993 : )As an ex-York-resident I tell all my friends to visit (forget the Minster) regardless of an ""interest in trains"" this is an important social history museum, quirky and endlessly rewarding. In London entry would be at least £18 (with queues); it's at least London Transport Museum + London Museum of Packaging and Advertising."
Another great experience,"A really rainy day in York so decided to go to the railway museum, we have been before and once again we thoroughly enjoyed it. We were staying at the Hampton by Hilton which is just around the corner from the museum. Really good to see the old and royal trains from yester year in all their splendour. Also all the world wide modern trains."
Great photographic day out,Loads to see and do here and the chance to take photos of our history. Free to enter but donations welcomed.
media trip,i went with a group and took loads of videos and made loads of films i really enjoyed taking videos and uploading them on my laptop back at work
Nice,Must visit this museum it's all about the railway how it was invented you can find the history of the railway New York
Unbelievably free of charge! Brought out the geek in me!,"Firstly, I cannot believe they don’t charge. Such an amazing place and totally free. You can still make a donation to the museum upon arrival - please do. Interesting to understand how advanced the steam engines actually were at the time. Guides can provide amazing insight on how the steam engines work. Lots of clear interactive displays and a absolute wealth of information for anyone interested in steam engines. Great to actually see the flying Scotsman and some other truly beautiful engine's. Engineering at its best."
Good,This place is very popular with the locals and had an amazing time over here and I got to see how the Railways exactly started in York
An Easy 5 Stars,"What an amazing museum of historic railway locomotives and carriages. In fact, it is a whole lot more. You can easily spend many hours in the museum, so be sure to make yourself plenty of time for this visit."
Best freebie you'll ever get!!!!,This is a fab museum nestled next to the railway station in York.We always find something new to look at here and the place is steeped in railway history for train buffs
Great museum,"Well worth a visit, lots to see and a huge area to walk around.  It was also free entry which was great, just had the parking to pay for."
Well worth a visit,"Definitely worth a visit. The displays are fantastic, even if you’re not into transport museums. Staff are really pleasant and knowledgeable - clearly passionate about what they do."
Fantastic historical time capsule,Fantastic place full of beautiful trains and winding engines of all sizes. Its one of those places that leave you in awe but you really have to go to get the overall feeling of it. The catering staff are brilliant and friendly too and the food is good
Must see destination in York,"The National collection of railway items is vast and far too big to do justice to on a single visit. There is a walkway from the station, but it is not well signposted. The museum has some lockers if you want a quick visit while waiting for a train and don't want to cart your bag around, but these are not well signposted at the entrance. Big ticket items are the main attraction. The present temporary exhibit on WW1 ambulance trains is well handled, but I notice the positions of some of the photos and explanations may be difficult to read for both the young and old. The various carriages from the royal trains over time are well displayed, but could have explanation cars on both sides rather than just one side as at present. Also, the surrounding exhibits lack logic to support the overall theme of this 'hall'. Japanese bullet train is looking tired, and there is no reference to recent upgrades in rolling stock across the world. A section on railways for the future, including the HS2 controversy might help make this a forward thinking rather than backward looking attraction. Also, nothing on Beeching and the cuts to railways and their recent dramatic growth in passenger numbers. Railways are part of the future as well as the past and this collection needs to make that clear."
Surprisingly wonderful,"Had a bit of time to spare so had a look round the national rail  museum.  Not being a train buff I wasn'texpecting too much, but wow! What a surprise!  This was incrdibly fascinating. From marvelling at theluxury of the royal carriages to sitting in the bullet train,totally immersing and never lessthan interesting."
great as always,"Very good for all the family and we have visited many times.  It is such a short walk from the station and if you are getting the train back home, it is easy to see this museum in the afternoon and then not too far to walk to the train"
One of the best Museums in the U.K.! ,I am not a rail enthusiast but this museum is a must to visit. It is amazing with great friendly staff. Unusual for York this is a free entry museum. If you wish you are invited to make a donation. Please do and let’s keep it free!
A Must See Attraction - Admission is FREE,"The National Rail Museum is a must-see attraction to which the admission is free. You will a minimum of four [4]hours to see the exhibits or to properly takin all that is on show a good five ]5] to six [6] hours.The museum chronicles the history of rail from the original ""Rocket"" to the latest Eurostar and includes items from the rail tunnel.You can see the majesty of the Kings & Queens rail cars through to the modern-day Pullman cars, Eurostar, as well as, the old mail sorting vans."
Fascinating,"Great way to spend a half day with lots to see and especially family friendly with many, many kids. A fun place even if you are not particularly drawn to trains."
Great place to visit,"Free entry, lots of trains with lots of information about them all. Good history, nice cafe and gift shop"
Mr Christian Jones ,A wonderful museum . Locomotives in the main hall are very well looked after. It's a national treasure. The shop has a wonderful selection of model trains. Staff are very friendly and helpful. You can walk around be amazed by the effort they gone to.
Worthwhile visit.,A must when visiting York. Enjoyable for all ages. Children's play area available.  Cafe / shop available. Railway lovers will enjoy a visit here for sure.
Extremely Interesting,So much history and information . You need more than half a day there. Highly recommend.Easy to get too.
Part of a flying visit,My husband enjoys mechanical things so our visit to York by steam train was a fore gone conclusion that we would visit the National Railway Museum which is FREE to enter and relies on public donations.What an amazing Collection of trains through the ages you could spend hours in there and still not cover everything.Lots of the trains you could view the interior some you could stand on the foot plate - every child’s dream! The were a couple of cafes serving drinks and snacks. The toilets were clean. There was a shop selling memorabilia. Signing from the station maybe there but we missed any and had to ask a couple of times and seemed to walk round in circles. Better signing would certainly help especially from York Station.
Excellent exhibition,Went on Sunday so loads of out of control kids running around however there is loads to see.  It’s free entry just encourage a donation to help maintaining and expanding the stock.   There are refreshments and a shop.  Plenty of toilets.  A lot of the display is undercover so would be a good visit if the weather wasn’t very good.
Rainy day visit,"Enjoyable couple of hours here, plenty to see, we came in out of rain and glad we did. Brought back nice memories"
Spring in York 2020,"Caught the little Land Train with the York Pass, (free 1 way, £3 back). Museum was excellent expectially if your a train buff or a child. Most was under cover."
York weekend,Visited the museum on a Saturday. Was very busy. Had a very interesting couple of hours. Really informative tour round. Gives you an insite into the British railway network from conception to present day. Every type of steam engine to view. There is a  talk that explains how a steam engine works. There is a cut away engine used as a prop. Excellent Well worth a visit
Great day out,Had a lovely trip to the National Railway museum. There is so much information about the trains and the history of the trains in the museum. So much can be learnt here and the staff on reception and around the museum and so lovely and always ready to answer any questions that you may have. This is fantastic place for people who have an interest in history and trains!
Museum visit,We went here on a Sunday morning. We had a fantastic time. Not really ecstatic about trains but it was very interesting. Lots of information and it's free. A must see!
Excellent ,"Wow, a great place to spend 2/3 hours. How lucky are we to have these trains on display for all to see? Amazing"
Fascinating story of the train,"Husband was very keen to visit but glad I went, lots to see and do, very interesting and great place to visit"
"Trains, trains and more trains!!!!","Trains and lots of them!!!! Lots of activities for younger children in the half term holiday when we visited. No admission charge, though a voluntary donation is appreciated. Only downside is the cost of the food. Best to take your own, lots and lots of picnic space indoors and out"
Really interesting ,Thoroughly enjoyable. Free entry (voluntary donation). Enjoyable to wander around and look at locomotives from different eras. We took in a demonstration which showed the inner workings of a super-heated steam locomotive.
All free,Decided to have a stroll down memory lane. As a pensioner this can be a completely free day out as the travel by bus and the museum are totally free. Short walk from the bus drop off point at York railway station to the museum down Leeman Road. Didn’t plan it but struck lucky when there was a guided talk and tour of the Royal Carriages soon after I arrived and the young lady Helen was extremely enthusiastic and knowledgable. Some of the exhibits you can actually enter but most are cordoned off. I would have liked to have access to at least one footplate but I never found one. Thousands of artefacts As well as the locomotives themselves. The display locomotives are immaculate and when you visit the repair shops you see how much work goes into restoring them. Also plenty of activities for the younger end to keep them amused. Intercity 125 is already a museum piece😢😢 donation boxes dotted about the building suggesting a deposit of a fiver which I didn’t think was unreasonable for such a wonderful experience
Day out,Really enjoyed my visit. I was amazed at how much there was to see and the history was fascinating would definitely recommend everyone to visit.
"If you like trains, you'll enjoy your visit","For those with an interest in trains this is a good place to visit. It is free, but you do get the impression that you are expected to pay £5. That said, even if you had to pay the £5 is good value.Lots to see and explore. My son especially liked the model railway - he spent a lot of time there!The only negative is the cost at the cafe. Very expensive! Thankfully you can take a picnic - bring your own food! I would certainly recommend this if you are a family otherwise you may break the bank!"
Mallard fans,A return visit to the museum after a few years and found it just as good an experience as before with some updates to make it even better. A good value day and the cafe was excellent in the main area in the coach seats. We had a lovely cream tea ! A short walk from York centre and a little train ride  back. Allow yourselves a good day though and beware of numerous school parties!
Great day out. Stayed all day.,Free entry is always a bonus with a young family. Bring a picnic or try the train cafe/restaurant. Reasonable prices for quality food. Lovely outdoor area for kids to play or to picnic. Lockers available so no need to carry all your stuff with you all day. Really interesting and fun for the whole family. No need to be into trains to enjoy here.
An amazing collection of rolling stock,It’s great to get up close to these magnificent engines and also to explore inside some of the carriages.And it’s all free !
Great experience,My wife thought it was going to be boring looking at trains but even she enjoyed it here. plenty of information boards telling you about the trains and what they were used for. There are plenty of ramps for the disabled so you don't miss out. As it is free to get in you cannot go wrong. The only mistake I made was that I left my camera at home.
No brainer! It's amazing and FREE,"We had seen the National Railway museum as an option while researching what to do in York. We figured it would be good, but after visiting it we can definitely say that this is a must do. Especially when you factor in that it is completely free (we gave a 5 pound donation and bought some items from the shop). There is a tonne of history and beautifully preserved trains for people to walk around and check out. The exhibit is so massive that they actually have 3 massive buildings to house it all. The main building with all the locomotives probably has at least 40-50 massive locos for people to see from all ages and places."
Great day out,Who knew trains are so interesting. Spent most of the day here. Especially loved the royal trains. They were brought to life by the guide who was very knowledgable. So much to see and learn about our railway heritageThoroughly enjoyable day. Good refreshments available and lovely staff
Enjoyable day out ,Lovely place to visit and so much to view. Easy lay out to get around and to view the locos. Noce touch with the viewing platform.
Lots to see,"We had a lovely day here, so much to see, would return if in the area again.  Well worth a visit. Little train back to the city was a bit bumpy! Not the Museum, blame the roads!."
Absolutely brilliant,"My wife and I took our 3.4yr old grandson here today and we had a great time. This is a fabulous experience for young and old alike, and it’s free entry between September and April, all they ask is attendees make a donation. Easy walking distance from the station and town centre."
York railway museum,Visited here on our weekend in York it’s brilliant especially if you have children even though we didn’t on this day it’s a great day for all the family and it’s FREE
Trains,A great place for families especially small boys or grown men. Take your own food there are plenty places to eat them or the cafe is available eating on the platform amongst the trains. Indoor and outdoor activities so great whatever the weather
WELL WORTH A VISIT.,"I''m certainly not a train geek... but this place is fabulous!So much to see... but, I'll keep it short... the Japanese Bullet Train... FAB!!!Made in the 60's... and so much better than most of our trains now!Well worth the donation of £5... you could spend hours here... so much better than other viking ralated things to do in town!"
Great visit! ,Railway museum is great for anyone. You don’t have to be a train enthusiast to enjoy it. It’s free to get in. Great for families with small children plenty for them to see and do. The rail road shuttle that runs from the museum to the Minster is only £4 per person and is another fun addition.
What an experience of history ,"Arrived at the museum and wow what an amazing place, staff weren’t as welcoming, they were happy to take our money and say nothing at all but museum itself I would recommend"
Great Museum,"The museum is well laid out and there is information infront or at the side of most exhibits. shame not all have a description.entrance is free and you get a guide leaflet free. But they ask you for a £5 donation i feel this is an attempt to guilt trip people into paying £5 before they have even seen the museum. there are plenty donation boxes dotted allover the place. and they have all got plenty money in them so obviusly the museum isnt in that much need of the money or it would empty the boxes more often. The cafe in the great hall is realy over priced i mean £2.70 for a 500ml bottle of coke it's daylight robbery. maybe theyre trying to recreate the great train robbery! My advice is dont let them guilt trip you in to paying £5 donation before you have been in. go around and decide if you would like to make a donation when you are leaving. i gave them some loose change and spent some money in the gift shop.also disabled parking is free of leeman street but i dont think this gives them the right to charge £10 per car to the ablebodied public. had this been the only carpark available i would have drove off. might i suggest you lower this to £5. as when you go round there are many atractions that you have to pay for steam train rides, miniture railway etc."
Train spotting ,"Nice staff, spotlessly clean, and a step back in time to view all of the trains! Really enjoyed the informative walk around."
Absolutely Fantastic,"I am not a great railway enthusiast. But I defy anyone not to come out of this museum in awe of the engineering and prowess that went behind the railways of old, and not so old. For me the older the better. Only because steam is part of a history that was central to transport, economic and social developement and tourism in the 19th and 20th century. I cannt receommend this place enough. AND IT IS FREE!!!!! An absolutely wondeful experience."
Just a brilliant place to visit,"Just a brilliant place to visit. It’s free, it’s wonderful. The staff are great and informative. The store with all the ‘logged’ parts could take you a day to walk around. Just go."
Pay,"Didnt mind paying the £5 voluntary entrance fee, but when we tried to visit another part of the museum we were hounded for an £11 fee each, as an oap with a small child it was expensive, the aircraft museum was much better value, and the volunteers were much nicer."
Interesting afternoon ,This was free entry but we made a voluntary donation. It is mainly undercover and has good access for wheelchairs and pushchairs. There is lots of things to look at and do. Some things do have a small charge. Good for all ages.
"Trains, Trains, Trains...","If you like trains then you will love the NRM. Everything from the first locos to the Shinkansen are on display. My favorite has always been Mallard, the world record holder steam engine (126 mph). Good gift shop with some bargains, a cafe, and best of all (especially for York), it's free. They run a road train to/from the museum to near the York Minster, price £3. This trip I found the library, an amazing place to sit and relax (away from the kids running around on the main floor) and read a railway magazine or check out some of the books. There's a few dozen for any taste. I wrote down some titles and found them at Waterstones in London and I figure most would be available somewhere on the Internet. There also some really wonderful paintings that most people don't look at, do, they are quite good."
Fantastic day out,"I have been visiting the nrm all my life and it never disappoints a fantastic place to visit, great experience for all the family. We were just abit disappointed that the south yard was closed."
Always a good day out ,We had a lovely day out here exploring. We got to go inside a few of the trains they had opened up. The wonderful Emily gave us the history behind the engines once inside. We rode on the little train which fun. We had great day learning about the history of British trains and railways. Had a lovely afternoon tea whilst there
Must see,"Loads to see, fascinating exhibits. Good choice if it’s a wet day. Stay a while and get coffee and a nibble too."
A real national treasure,"I'd been here back in the 70's and remember well the great hall and turntable with the locomotives arranged around. Today it looks just the same but with new engines, better information and a smart cafe area with light snacks and a range of drinks.The museum is free - with an option to donate if you feel inclined.Highlights are some of the oldest rolling stock in the world and, if course, uniquely, the Royal carriages. The one used by Edward is my firm favourite; the one used by Elizabeth looks disappointingly spartan.We spent a good two hours here and, had we had more time, would have spent longer looking at the range of memorabilia and artifacts from a now increasingly distant time.Thoroughly recommended - even if the thought of steam, diesel and electric doesn't immediately turn you on."
Fantastic place to visit,"What a fantastic place to go and visit and it’s all free. We spent almost 3 hours looking at all the trains ,locomotives, engines and associated train memorabilia Highly recommend for any ages so much to see"
Brilliant,"It helps if you enjoy railways, trains, and their history! What a great museum and day out for all the family. This is a ‘must visit’ if you are in York. The staff are really helpful and very knowledgeable. The displays range from models through Stephenson’s Rocket, a vast array of steam locomotives, carriages, Royal Trains, diesels and electrics. There is even the Japanese Bullet Train. The Mallard is there as well as a simulator so that you can go for a ride on it. Probably the museum with the most impressive display items.The road train will take you to the museum from York Minster if you don’t want to walk. A small charge for this but it runs every 30 minutes."
FANTASTIC !!!,"I am not normally a train type person. It was raining all day so we went with family. So much to see and free entry. We donated 5 quid a head and I'm very happy with that.There's plenty to look at from across the world, spanning quite a time scale. I was quite shocked to find myself looking at a magnificent steam train built after I was born! Am I really that old? Anyone into engineering will be interested, as anyone into history in general. You may just like to wonder about and grab some snacks. In all a great family day out, especially if it's raining.The children loved the ride on the mini train."
Worth going to York just to go here.,"Cannot believe how great this museum was! Even my wife who is not in to trains said how brilliant it was.Even with car parking £10 for the whole day, worth going too as FREE to get in, wow.The minute you walk in you are greeted by friendly helpful staff, and it’s like this all over, every one helpful and happy and enjoying their work.I expected ropes around the trains, not one you can get up close to all. Including the great  Mallard, even stood on the footplate. One down note, all your friends will walk away as you cannot stop talking about it."
Excellent,Great museum for all ages and free to enter. Ideal for families on a budget as the food is priced to attract customers with very good value for money. An experience that will be remembered for a long time.
Railwaytastic,"This has got to one of the best value museums anywhere. If you're a steam train nut like me you will be impressed by the exhibits and could spend hours there. The layout is good . The staff are friendly and enthusiastic. The only gripe is that there is a basic crowded  eating area in the Great Hall , which we used , only to find out later on there is a nicer , larger and more comfortable looking one in the Station Area ! Although free a contribution has to be given?"
"Trains, Trains, Trains","A must-visit for anyone who loves Trains, filled to the brim with trains of the past, present, and future the National Railway Museum makes a great place to visit for the whole family"
Great if you like steam and other trains,The museum is free (you can donate money in boxes around ) the layout is very good and seems to flow very well with different sites to visit with plenty to keep you happy if you like trains there are plenty of toilets and places to eat
Really enjoyable museum,"Huge museum, can easily spend 2-3+ hours here. Plenty to see, and plenty of trains to go inside. The museum would benefit with more interactive and informative sections."
Amazing for anyone who likes trains,"Fantastic place with lots of engines. Free to get in. Lots of stuff to keep children and adults amused. Food is ok, lots of clean toilets. You can spend more than a day wandering around. A must see"
Weekend away,"A great place to visit. The staff were very informative. The layout of the museum was well laid out and quite flowing. A great place to visit if you are into rolling stock or heavy engineering. The museum is free, with a small donation. I think the only down side was £10 for the carpark."
A brilliant museum,"Visited here on a miserable February Saturday. The museum is very interesting and free entry, with a £5.00 suggested donation. Seeing the royal carriages was impressive and the Mallard is a highlight! It would certainly be great for younger children and you don't need to like trains especially. There are lots of information signs etc and things to read, but it's more about seeing the history."
A ‘must visit’ when visiting York ,A free attraction to visit with the whole family. On site cafe a little pricey but great styling with carriage style seating. Allow for plenty of time to get around everything!
Fantastic museum,I live in York and I’ve been here multiple times. It’s a fantastic museum located just behind the train station and it’s free to enter.
One hour stop off before getting train home,A fascinating glimpse into the golden era of rail. Plenty of engines of all shapes and sizes and lots of stories to go with them.
Free activity - great for train enthusiasts.,"Visited with 5 yr old grandson and despite him not really being interested in trains, he spent a couple of hours looking around, climbing on board the exhibits and learning about how transport has changed over the years. Lots to see and well presented. Entrance is FREE with a suggested donation of £5 which is well worth it."
Great day out!,"Been here many, many times now with the little one. A great example of history in action with lovingly restored locomotives, meticulously well looked after. Regular events throughout the year with the Tim Peake exhibit from 2018 being a particular favourite. Great for families and those who like to see history up close. For the record my favourite exhibit is probably the bullet train. Entry is free but the food can be a little steep depending on what you go for. Parking is £10 but you get a whole day out of that. Overall the good bits far outweigh the bad, highly recommended."
SPECTACULAR MUSEUM,"We have visited the Railway Museum many times in the past, but it has been a few years since our last visit. We were amazed at the changes this time. It was always well worth the visit but now it has improved and expanded beyond belief. The locomotive exhibits are stunning, the displays fantastic and the memorabilia collections are endless.  Choose to spend a few hours here to do the visit justice. An extra bonus is....there's no entry fee!!!!"
 Informative museum,We had a great time at the National railway museum in York. We can totally recommend it especially for families.
Half term trip,Fantastic museum for those who love trains and for those who aren’t too keen. We visited especially for our autistic son who loves trains on a day trip to York and we weren’t disappointed!! There’s so many trains to see and explore that I’m sure we missed some... thankfully both our boys can’t wait to return so we make sure we haven’t missed anything!!
Great day out,"Took 2 boys aged 11 and 13 here for the day and they loved it.Real trains close up. Can go on board some of them, but not many.The steam ride out the yard is a 10min ride, goes up and down a piece of track a couple of times, but for £4 made them very happy. Probably not worth it if you live near a 'proper' steam line though. You stand in a little outdoor carriage (no seats).The cafe was quite expensive though - 3 drinks and 3 cakes was over £20 and we struggled to find a seat. On examining the receipt it did say the cakes should have come with icecream - they didn't and it was never offered/advertised."
Freddie’s Friday Frenzy,"Trains, trains and more trains. Every type, age, shape and size. Everything you ever wanted to see and know about the history of railways from their birth to date. Freddie in absolute paradise...especially with the Mallard Experience. Cafes also a highlight. In summary a truly outstanding (and free!) museum worth committing a full day to if you can."
Really interesting & educational.,This museum was a great day out. My husband went to York specifically for this venue & was not disappointed.
"Throughly enjoyable visit,","Good range of trains, well laid out, plenty to do. If eating there were plenty of places to. Great gift shop. Very interesting to see stages of change in British and other nations train systems."
Mr n mrs goffin,"Absolutely fantastic spent 2 and half hours in this amazing place. Packed with history, big thumbs up"
Where to find the Mallard,"Well worth a visit,even for the non adventurist. Loads to see. Some great history of the railways. Would go again."
Perfect Start to a Day In York.,"My girlfriend & I visited The NRM first thing in the morning, getting there 30 minutes prior to opening when we entered it was quickly apparent to the real size of this wonderful, education and FREE museum. Entering into the shop and going through to the Station Hall it was nostalgic and oddly exciting seeing all these amazing trains in one place. With locomotives dating back to the 1800's and the station hall itself dating back to the mid-late 1800's its a nice dive into the history of the British Railways, you can see a collection of Royal Carriages in the Station Hall as well as a variety of locomotives and carriages of other various uses. Should you wish to treat yourself to refreshments, afternoon tea can be enjoyed in the Station Hall surrounded by rich British History as well as other refreshments. Heading out into the South Yard you can take a look around 'The Depot' where operational trains take a break in a canvas shed, a few interesting locomotives in here are the Prince William locomotive, named after HRH Prince William in 1995 as well as 1930's replica of an 1830's rolling stock carriage amongst others. If you're looking for other things to do, there is a miniature steam railway as well as a play area for the kids. Heading back inside through to the Station Hall, to the left is 'The Rocket' as well as The Gallery where is home to a variety of models of trains with magnifying glasses to see the intricate details. Back into the Foyer area and left down the stairs (or lift) and into the Great Hall, a large number of trains on display will take your breath away, whether its the Eurostar, Shinkansen or the Mallard, there are more trains, carriages and displays to entertain yourself with for hours. Including a model railway and the 'Search Engine' where you can read many magazines, books and archival material to hone up on your knowledge and history of the British Railways. With another café and a shop, before you take the final steps of your visit at the National Railway Museum you can proceed into the North Shed, there is A LOT to see, whether its the NRM's collection of railway related items, the story of The Flying Scotsman or Signalling School there is a lot to see on the ground floor. If that isn't enough, heading upstairs there's a viewing platform overlooking the East Coast Mainline and the River Ouse where you can see trains to South and to the North of England passing by. Inside on the 1st floor, there's a gallery dedicated to the working railway and over the barrier you can watch the NRM's hardworking engineers maintaining and rebuilding trains and rolling stock in the dedicated workshop. I couldn't recommend The National Railway Museum enough, if you're a fan of history, engineering or just need to spend a few hours in York, I cannot recommend this highly enough."
Fantastic! ,Wonderful place to spend a couple of hours. No entry fee and lots of interesting trains (even if you’re not into trains!).
So much to see!,"The NRM is a must see when visiting York. With free entry, it’s a no brainier, even if trains aren’t your thing. There are so many different trains both modern and old to see and a hall full of train bits."
Amazing collection ,Most amazing collection of engines all complete with stories and presented in informative and interesting ways. Not one but two huge halls full of historic engines and carriages. Steam rides and mini railway rides are a fun addition. Love the collection of railway ephemera as well - brought back some memories.
Lots to see.,"If you like trains itis great. It is free too so that is a bonus. Only downside was the number of unruly children running around, but that is not the fault of the museum."
A great place to visit,This is a great place to visit and a train enthusiast heaven! It’s a well thought out museum with something to offer all ages. We went during a busy half term but there was lots to do and see. The family meal for 4 in the hall was good value at £20 with drinks 👍A great place to go on a budget- lots to do for just a small donation at the entrance 😊
Well worth a visit,"Very interesting even if your not a train enthusiast, me and my husband thoroughly enjoyed looking at all the different trains through the years and the exhibition area showing miniature versions and engineering at it best, really amazing. It is free to enter, but £5 is the suggested donation and it is well worth that."
Excellent and huge museum,"This place is amazing for young and old, being able to see the Goliaths of the Railway age from old to new up close and personal! You can make this a short stop over, as I did, if you are travelling, by getting off at the magnificent York Station, heading over to platform13 and picking up the signs along footways and steps to bring you out in the museum car park. It is a free entry but you can leave a donation, very easy to do as it is well set out over several halls. I arrived at lunchtime with an onward connection about 3pm, so headed for the Great Hall where all the big “boys” are kept! Also they have two cafes there. I must say I found the food a bit “bland” and very expensive, but then you are in a museum. You can’t do it all in such a short time so will save other halls until next in York. Well worth a visit."
Great day out ,Loads to see and lovely to take a step back in time - engineering at it’s best - it was half term so incredibly busy but the cafes were big enough to cater for all.
Great value  experience,"Free entry to this museum of national importance is great value. A mecca for railway 'nuts', but lots for the layman too. Everthing is well laid out and preserved. Lots of activities aimed at children, a good place to visit on a wet day. Excellent cafes and shop too."
Lots to see!!,"Great to see especially on a rainy day! Loads of different sorts of trains to see. Well kept and maintained.Free entry suggested donation of £5, which is more than worth it."
Rainy day activity ,"Even if you dont like trains this is a great rainy day activity, you cant help but be impressed with the engineering and the layout of the place is well done."
Great museum ,"Visited here Saturday 15th feb and absolutely loved it. A lovely trip down memory lane, especially the inter city 1980's train! Took me back to my youth."
Really enjoyable✔️ Extortionate food prices✖️,"Good-Free entry and donations asked for. Lots of different areas to explore and fantastic, varied examples of different trains, through the ages to see. Lots of chances to get into or near the trains. The staff I dealt with were friendly. A range of extra (paid for) activities was on offer, including a mini railway, road train etc, so something suitable for all ages. Picnic areas available to eat in and lots of choices for food and where to eat. Well stocked gift shop-we all love them!Not so good-my son (7) was disappointed in the signage around the trains. He felt it could have been more informative and explained a little more about the history of each model. Other museums have large boards with full write ups but the NRM seems to prefer shorter statements. I was really disappointed in the pricing of the food and drink. You expect to pay more in places such as this but I really felt it was extortionate. A very average looking brownie was £3.10, A plastic cup of squash was £2.25! For squash, that’s a ridiculous mark up. We were visitors to the area staying in a hotel so bringing a lunch wasn’t really an option but I would advise others to."
What a fab day out,"So much to do, so much to do. Appeals to all ages and my boys loved it so much they wanted to revisit their favourite train again the next day before they had to go home."
Fabulous museum,"Spent a rainy afternoon here. Our grandchildren loved it, very child friendly. Cafe very expensive - £4.50 for a chocolate eclair!"
Impromptu visit on a rainy weekend,Excellent facility and I was more than happy to make the voluntary donation despite the free entry. Marvellous exhibits with concise and informative notes
Fantastic attraction for all the family,Could have spent the whole day here. Lots of things to see. Famous engines and carriages. Lots of history associated with trains and the railways.  Staff excellent and informative.  Wheelchair accessible and plenty of parking for the disabled.  Cafes strategically placed for breaks on your journey around.
Transport yourself into the past,"It's a super place to visit for any sort of party or amount of time you have. There's so much to see but it is put into manageable sections. The entrance is by donations , the suggested amount being £5 per head. Well worth it. Take your camera."
It's FREE!,"What an amazing place, if you like trains.  Gets quite busy after about 10 am, but totally worth it.  Food options a bit naff, but you can always take your own snacks"
Really good,Easy and quick to get around really enjoyed the day and great that you could go in some. Really enjoyed!
Great for everyone,"The kids loved it here, there’s a brilliant selection of trains from old to modern that you don’t only view but can go and have a good look around on.  The kids loved being able to explore inside the trains."
Great British History,"We took our 2 Autistic Grandchildren to visit this museum, been a few years since our last visit and they enjoyed it then.They absolutely loved the place, buzzing with lots of old engines, trains, accessories and really interesting place to visit. Spent at least 3 hours here and they even wanted to go on the train simulator which they said was really good.A good day had by all and very interesting and educational saw parts of the museum we had missed on our last visit a few years back the place is lovely and the staff very obliging and friendly - would highly recommend for young and old alike"
Brilliant ,Spent nearly 3 hours here with my 7 year old and 9 year old. Theres plenty to see and do. It's great that you can go inside the trains and underneath them too. The old steam engines were their favourite. Theres hands on items dotted around the whole museum. It's really informative and manages to keep the kids engage throughout.Well worth a visit and it was my 7 year old son who gave it a definite 5 stars.
Great attraction,We returned to see the trains and enjoyed it thoroughly.  We loved seeing the royal carriages and the dandy from port Carlisle.  The kids loved Mallard and the bullet train.
"Quick Visit, was worth it","My wife and I decided to go to York for the day and we went into here to kill some time. We were in for nearly two hours and found it to be one of the best places in York.Free entry, a vast amount of things to see, cafe, toilet, locker facilities etc.There was also quite a large area about WW1/WW2 which I found fascinating too."
Lovely visit,Enjoyed a few hours at the museum. Seeing the trains brought back some memories. Lunch was expensive and disappointing. The Geordie lad on the desk on the way out more than compensated though.
Boys birthday treat,We all had a Fantastic day and my partner did the cream tea whilst there and that was superb as well. Took my elderly mum and dad and mum was in a wheel chair and my twin sons for a birthday treat.
Never disappoints,"Went with family including 2 children.  Attended a demonstaion of the science of steam travel which was great fun.  The ""explainer"" was brilliant and the kids loved it (including one 6 going on 13 year old boy)"
Fab trains,Really interesting way to spend an afternoon especially if you love trains like my husband does. Lots of things to see - loved seeing the royal trains. My husband liked seeing the mallard closeup.
Excellent railway museum in York,"Excellent museum with free entry although it helps a lot if you make a donation - £5 suggested.  Well worth it to keep this place running!Anyone who loves railways can easily spend 3 hours here.  Make a point of visiting the Collections Store and look out for the sign to Platform 9 3/4.Unfortunately, the visit was marred (slightly) by the Station Hall cafe which was disappointing.  For the price charged, I was expecting to get a decent sandwich but mine was dry with little filling and nearly inedible.  I'm sure they could do better.  The one in the Great Hall may be better?"
a day out,This National Railway Museum  is fantastic and very interesting looing around the oldtrains to the up todate ones we were looking around and this Museum was excellent and the entrence fee was very good worth the visit
Trains,First time looking around the train museum and found it really interesting  my Grandchildren would love it there x
Great visit,"Thoroughly enjoyed by both me and my boyfriend, certainly recommend going here.Just keep in mind that the steam train only runs on weekends and school holidays! But any size and age can go on the mini train!"
Short visit,"Visited as part of a short break and even if you're not a rail enthusiast ( which I'm not ), its a great place to visit whether young or old. It was great to see some of the trains that I remember when growing up. Getting an insight as to the way things were and how they have evolved was really interesting. My wife also really enjoyed it, even though she was not really interested to begin with. Anyone visiting York must go and see the museum as you would regret it  if you don't."
Brilliant,Took our Grandson here. What a fab day it was.Would definitely recommend to any one who's children love trains Absolutley Spot onWe can't wait to return
"Brilliant, free day out for all the family","We couldn’t believe that we’d spent 5 hours in this amazing place! The time flew by, with so much to see and do. As with most National museums, it’s free entry but  they offer you the opportunity to make a small donation towards the upkeep, which is up to you entirely, but worthwhile and appreciated. There’s plenty of tables and chairs where you can have your own food and drinks, or purchase from the cafe, while surrounded by the magnificent trains.  There’s plenty of opportunities for children’s hands-on activities and to board some of the trains, to embrace the atmosphere.Another plus for the site is that It’s  just a short walk into York City."
Great for train enthusiasts,Took 4 year old here. He loved it as did we all. Highly recommend. Also took tractor train back to york minster which was £3 per adult for one way.Close to york station and good viewing platform within museum to watch station.
Day trip,"I went here not expecting much and as someone who has very little interest in trains. It was incredibly surprised by how much I enjoyed it! Really brilliant experiences, I felt really educated and was really entertained. Also it was immaculate really clean factory sterile I was super impressed lovely atmosphere great trip all round!"
"A great museum, with or without kids!","Loads to see at this museum, which is free (£5 per person recommended donation).  The displays are impressive with a good variety of trains and carriages, and there's plenty to keep kids entertained.  A lovely way to spend an afternoon."
Another great visit,As always a brilliant day out. Great to be there when you could go in the driver box of the mallard and the duchess. Good coffee and cake too.
"The Railway Museum, worth going to","The museum is large and plenty to see. Very interesting and there is a cafe on site. There is no charge for visiting. Brings back lots of memories with the old trains ""Intercity"" etc."
Brilliant,Great day out whilst we visited York for the weekend so much to see and do need to go back for a week at least if your into trains then you will love this museum 😊
Afternoon tea,"The atmosphere in the coach was amazing. Lovely and warm just like a Pullman car. The staff were absolutely fantastic so friendly, welcoming and polite. The food? It was the best afternoon tea that I have had. It blasts Betty's of York and Harrogate out of the water!!!!"
School trip,With 10 year 6 children in my group this proved one of the easiest days with the children in our whole week in York. They were all enthralled and so much is hands on rather than the usual looking at exhibits in glass cases. After 3 hours they were far from ready to leave. A great morning spent there
A day to remember,"Brilliant throughout. Talk along the way were brilliant - learnt much about Japan's ""bullet train"" thanks"
A full day out,"We had nearly 5 hours at the museum including morning coffee, an excellent lunch on the platform and a cup of tea in the afternoon.There is so much to see that the time just passes too quickly.Set out really well with information boards explaining everything.The only complaint is the walk from the car park to the entrance ( it had changed from our previous visit ) which on a windy wet day is not very pleasant. We understand that the area is going to be redeveloped so hope they sort out the car park ?"
Always a great visit! And usually something new to see,The NRM is one of my favorite museums. I always find the time to make it across the station to visit. Whether its just for a coffee in the great hall or a wander around the exhibits.
Absolutely amazing Museum,"This museum is by far my favourite Museum I visited in York.I went twice in the weekend, I was in York."
Enjoyable Day,"We spent the entire day visiting the museum. Personally I’m interested in railways so was in my element. However, my partner is less keen but she also really enjoyed the day and found it very informative. Food is nice and not too bad price. However, one minus point the soft drinks are expensive but as it’s free for entry you can really complain."
Everybody should visit this place,"Took my three year old grandson here in Jan. 2020 and we had a great day out.  We travelled by train to make the whole day more special.  There was so much to see and a three year old is  a bit too young to enthuse over it all.  However I just let him look, and we talked about the things he noticed and ignored the detail, so he didn't get bored.  There are plenty of oportunities to get on board and see at first hand.  There are places you can walk right under a train.  We saw a train fully turned around on a turntable.  After our wonderful day out we had terrible tears on the train travelling home when we realised the boy had left his beloved teddy there on a train.  Now this is where the staff excelled, teddy was found and posted back to us without charge.  Happy grandson."
Mallard ,"Fantastic place to visit, plenty to see throughout the sheds. It was good seeing hw the euro tunnel is constructed. My wife’s highlight was seeing the Mallard steam train. The museum is well maintained, clean with plenty of facilities."
a good way to spend a few hours,whilst enjoying a short stay in York we called in here to visit this museum and particularly enjoyed seeing the royal trains a good place to pass on a few hours
Full of wonderful things.,"Our second visit about ten years after the first. It hasn't changed a lot in the interim. There is a huge amount to see and many different rooms, sometimes a bit of a maze. Even someone not interested in railways can find something interesting here.We never managed to see everything on offer as it would have taken longer than the time available which was dictated by the state of my health."
Not my thing,"Trains are really not my thing but we really enjoyed our day out here.  Definitely worth a visit, we learnt some interesting facts about travel in the 1800s. Cafe was great for a light lunch."
The Best Experience,"This attraction is free and we spent a good three hours here. Lots to see and do. There is a suggested donation of £5, but they underrate themselves."
Great day out,"It's been a good few years since we went to the National Railway Museum, so we decided to re-visit yesterday.For those that haven't been before, it's less than a five minute walk from York railway station. If you're going by car, there is parking right next to the museum itself.Entry is free, with a suggested donation of £5 per person (or whatever you can afford). The money goes towards the upkeep of the museum and restoration of trains in it's ownership.Be advised though, that the eateries inside are uber expensive (a bottle of fanta will set you back £3)!There is absolutely tons to see here, and four hours just flew by. From a replica of Stephenson's rocket, through to Shinkansen (""Bullet train), this place has it all. In the main hall are numerous record breaking trains, including class 373 ""Eurostar"" (fastest UK electric train), Class 43 Intercity 125 (fastest diesel train in the World), and class A4 ""Mallard"" (fastest steam train in the World). In this area, you can also go into an inspection pit, and see the entire underneath of a steam train. It is also home to the ""ambulance train"" exhibition, a mallard simulator, the measurement coach which recorded Mallard's World record breaking speed, and much, much more. In total there are probably forty locomotives / coaches on display.In one of the other halls is a collection of royal coaches from lots of different eras, a ""pullman"" coach, a mail coach, wagons, break vans, a Class 87, preserved ticket machines, clocks, vans... the list goes on.In the engine sheds are a class 47, a Class 08 shunter, & a DMU awaiting restoration (class 101 I think).In the workshops, class A4 ""Sir Nigel Gresley"" is currently partially stripped, and you can watch engineers actually refurbishing it from the viewing balcony. A Class 37 & Class 31 are also currently in there.There is a further viewing gallery outside, which overlooks the northern end of York railway station.Outside is a miniature railway (which is £3 each), and a play area / picnic area.Overall, a superb day out, which can easily be followed up by a trip into the City of York itself (only five minutes away)."
Fantastic place to visit,The visit to the Railway Museum was so much better than we expected. The size and amount of trains etc to view was mind blowing. The museum is free but I expect everybody will have made a donation at the point of entry. There are plenty of things to eat and a varied menu to suit all tastes. The amount of trains on view is very impressive ranging from the very old to the very new. We spent over three hours there and could have spent more as there was so much to see. For us this was the best attraction in York.
Great history about trains,I spent a good couple of hours here when I visited York and I haven't been since since I was a kid. Lots of history about trains and you can see inside some of them. The museum begins in the Station Hall which contains trains from the past such as Queen Victoria's carriage. You can go through a passageway to the Great Hall to see the Mallard or Bullet Train. Next to that is the North Shed which contains a huge amount of train-related objects. There's also a gift shop at the entrance.
Very interesting ,1st visit for many years and really enjoyed my time in here. Lots of things to look at and all very informative. Will be back with my grandson in the summer for a day out.
"If you are a trainspotter, this is the place to go!",Everything in trains and locomotives you can ask for. They have it! From the Rocket to the Eurostar. Volunteers are on the alert to answer all questions. Great collection of everything train-associated. Nice café as well. Free entry but do make a donation!
very informative,"Do not miss this experience, History at its very best and well worth the visit.You will not regret visiting this great place"
Amazing,"A great day out - plenty to see and do.  My 3 year old daughter loved it too.  There is a lot try take in on a single visit, and enough places for a short sit down should you need it.  All staff are friendly, knowledgeable, and happy to help.  Some would think that the Cafe’s are a little on the expensive side, but when you remember that it’s free entry (well - donations) you rethink that it’s fair...and to be honest - the food is delicious! My only minor criticism is the signage from the visitors car park to the visitors entrance - I don’t think it’s clear enough, not only did we go into the conference entrance to begin with, we ended up walking past the sign for turning right and crossing the road.  My mum isn’t in the best of health and struggled.  It wasn’t until we were leaving that we seen the sign saying to cross. Like I say, it’s only minor, my mum didn’t die, and we all had a great day!"
a very interesting Museum,"A great couple hours spent here on our break to York. We are not train enthusiasts, but this museum is still very interesting, the exhibits are very well presented and in fantastic condition."
Impressive but avoid the simulator ,"Visited today with 2 young children. Parked in the museum car park for £10 (4 digit pin code given in exchange for the money to use exiting car park). 5 minute walk to the entrance of museum.  Very quiet so time to explore. Loads of trains of various types, huge steam trains to see and carriages to look at. Would have just liked more hands on exhibits. There are cabs of the intercity 125 and Eurostar - why not open these and let people sit in the cabin or replica of - even with a screen  in the front showing the trains going along. Just bring them to life a bit more. There’s a lot of looking through windows, some for obvious reasons. Able to go on the footplate of a few locomotives which was good and you can go inside the bullet train which was fab. Why not open up for example the Eurostar? One tip to avoid - The Mallard simulator. What a let down. £3 each for a dodgy camera angle of the train hitting branches and bushes then dodgy animated people. Whoever put that together needs firing. Awful. Should be on the footplate or then at the front of the train so you can see the track ahead not the dodgy camera angle. Save your money. There are talks on various exhibits throughout the day which is a nice touch. Shop is well stocked and there are 2 cafes serving usually priced food and drink. You can catch the land train to York Minster for £3 adults and £2 children one way. Overall for free entry, well worth a visit - could just be a bit more to keep those who want a bit more than just looking."
Never been to a train museum ,Never been to a train museum and we didn't know what to expect. The place is massive! Interesting exhibits of life sized everything train related.
Really interesting,"I'm by no means a rail geek, but I loved this museum. Interesting and informative and wouldn't hesitate to go back."
A free Museum not to miss,"That was the ONLY free museum we went to and it was great. Very close to the railway station, so if you visit before leaving there is a short cut into the rail station. Some beautiful old trains, engines and carriages, royal, ordinary, the only bullet train outside Japan, a temporary exhibition we didn't have time to see, very helpful staff, a spacious educational place where we overheard a talk to a primary age class) I defy you to be bored or irritated as you may well be if you'd paid the prices of the other museums in this historic city which are certainly worth a visit but not the 'gift' that this one is to tourists.Some lovely railway related paintings upstairs, don't miss them, plenty of railway related 'things' too but a return hometrain beckoned so we didn't linger of those."
Flynn,"What a lovely place the railway museum is and the staff are very enthusiastic and helpful. Lots to do for the family, especially considering its FREE..."
Great way to spend an hour or two when in York,So much to see here and it is very interesting. Its great that it is free admission and has a decent café as well.
Iconic,This must be one of the best national museums in the country. The history of trains and railways is encompassed within this large complex. It is free to enter but a minimum donation of £5 is expected. Thank you to the volunteers who make this place what it is.
Trip to NRM,Excellent museum free entry or you can put a voluntary donation toward the upkeep of the locos and museum lots to do and very informative.There are different talks on various subjects of railwayana.The museum has 3 large halls film of locos and railwayana there are also viewing platforms where you can see staff working on different locos.You can easily spend all day here there is a resteraunt and shops well worth a visit
Wonderful experience,"I took my daughter (9) to see the railway museum and we had a lovely time.  We were waiting outside when it opened and the staff were extremely friendly and cheerful as soon as we went in.We spent a good two hours going around the exhibits and could easily have stayed longer, however we had other plans for the afternoon, so had to leave!  My daughter was very surprised to learn that milk tankers used to be transported by rail and was most interested to learn that the post used to be sorted on the train as it travelled.  We loved seeing the royal trains and found the ambulance train fascinating - hard to imagine what life must have been like for those aboard.We were also impressed with the detail of the ""platform"" displays - all those dishes to be washed from the dining cars, not to mention the variety of things that were transported, from bird cages to bicycles.It was very interesting to see trains such as the Bullet train and to watch the video about it; seeing all of the beautiful steam engines was also a pleasure.The only slight disappointment was the that Flying Scotsman was not on site when we visited, however we knew that this was quite likely to be the case and still thoroughly enjoyed our visit.  We will just have to go back when it is in!We would definitely recommend this (FREE) museum to all ages."
Worth it,"Whether you are looking for old or new trains, this is a great place to find them! We had a wonderful time walking around and learning about various locomotives. They were in the progress of setting up a new exhibit, which showed me that this museum is not simply a stagnant storehouse of the past, but is always changing and growing. There are a couple of different areas where you can grab a bite to eat/drink inside the railway museum. One place had sausage rolls and another had salads and sandwiches. Due to the large number of people that comes through each day, these are set up in a more cafe/cafeteria/coffee shop style where you collect your food, pay, and sit to eat--not a full-serve restaurant where you wait for a waitress to take your order and bring your food. It is efficient and seems to work quite well. The food was good and I'm sure I worked out all off with all of the walking we did exploring the museum. All in all, a great way to spend a few hours!"
Great Day Out,"Never fails to disappoint (except when Flying Scotsman is on tour). Beautifully laid out , immaculately restored and presented , just need better parking facilities."
Nice experience,"It is definitely worth a visit to see the various Steam and Diesel engines, Royal Carriages, etc. Even better that it is free with a voluntary contribution."
Excellent ,"This museum is just wonderful. It is great for young, old enthusiasts or not it has something for everyone There are also plenty of catering outlets onsite too"
Gem of the north. ,Excellent museum particularly as it is free. Interactive. Well looked after. Loads to see. Could spend hours there. Great for kids and big kids. Easy walk from the centre.
Wowzers.,"What a collection of not only amazing historic engines and cars, but of all sorts of railroadiana. After viewing the mighty machines and stately carriages, be sure to check out the shop where they are actively working to preserve and restore train engines. Also, the row upon row of cabinets featuring railroad related items was fascinating."
Make time to visit,Well worth making the time to visit. Lots to see and some nice facilities. Suitable for all ages as well. We were lucky enough to visit while they had additional displays with handcrafted miniature models. Amazing craftsmanship   and a privilege to see.It's also free to visit with recommended donations of £5 which is unbeatable value.
Lovely experience ,"Came here with the family, had a amazing time loads of trains to see and quite a lot of history about the trains that are there. Worth the visit."
A strip Back in Time,We spent an informative couple of hours in the museum and could have spent far longer. It was great to see a bygone age.
Amazing,"Brilliant visit, so much to see and do and all for free, cafes have a great selection of refreshments and the museum staff are helpful and knowledgeable . Can't wait to return 😘"
outstanding,"What a wonderful experience, except for the toilets. This is truly a world class museum set in several large halls,Enough to keep you occupied for many hours, There are good gift shops and large cafes in each of the big building s which connect through an underpass under the main road.The car park is £10 a day and a 5 minute walk away. There is disabled parking at the museum entrance.Very suitable for disabled visitors. The only black mark was toilets blocked or not functioning."
Wow so much to see,"Went for a quick visit when in York ,so much to see you def need a full day to see everything,I loved the trains ,bullet train old royal trains A fab free day out, but we did put £5 recommend in donation on way out I will return to see all of the museum when have more time"
Day out,"I took my 5 year old grandson for a day out to the museum as he loves trains - he had a wonderful time. We were there all day looking at all the engines, the only down side for me was that the Flying Scotsman wasn't in but it's a good excuse to go back! There are demonstrations of some of the exhibits, we watched a train being turned round on the turntable and listened to the information about howit all works. To see a model of the very first locomotive ""The Rocket"" going through to the Japanese"" Bullet"" train and the way it has all evolved was educational. We went on a simulator for the Mallrd experience of breaking the speed record of a locomotive and into a pit under a steam train - wow! We ate at one of the cafes which I thought was very reasonably priced."
Fantastic,"The place is free but a donation is optional.Very interesting place to go if you love trains new and old. It even shows you how they work, how to send signals and even showed some people building the trains. Very interesting and informative. Loved seeing the shows and it's great for all ages.  😊I thought it would be boring but actually I really really enjoyed it!"
A Superb Day Out - And It’s Free Too,"Quite simply one of the best days out in the region, never mind the City.  Plenty to do and see, lots of interactivity and all (or most) undercover, so weatherproof too.Highly, highly recommended."
A must to visit,"enerytime we visit york we visit the railway museam....why because theres always something different inside.you dont have to be atrain geek to explore.great cafes as if you are actually in a train station.nice food,coffee ect."
Loved It!,A truly amazing snapshot of the history of rail travel. Was a very lovely way to spend a few hours. I honestly didn't think it would be so interesting. I particularly enjoyed seeing inside the royal carriages through the years.
Excellent,"So well done. Wonderful experience for young and old, enthusiast or casual observer. A must for any visitor."
Kids loved it,great way to kill a rainy day with kids. I miss thomas the tank engine though! BRING BACK THOMAS!!!!
Well worth a visit and cheap,"What a great place to visit there is so much to see you could spend the whole day there sit and relax with a cup of tea and a cake, toilets are spotless great for young and old you will not be dissapointed...."
Amazing Rail collection,"This amazing museum and collection of old, and new, rail exhibits are a must to visit in York and along with York Minster led us to visit this great city. It houses collections of famous engines, rolling stock, and memorabilia relating to the famed British railway system with wonderful engines like The Mallard, and if you are lucky, The Flying Scotsman. It covers some three large buildings encompassing Royal trains, Pullman carriages, station exhibits, uniforms and other pieces of history. The main engine building has a turntable and you can walk under a locomotive and see the workings from the bottom, as well as displays and cutouts of how steam locos work. The entrance price is fair, and you can spend all day there – four of us (and I was the only real train buff) were enthralled and spent almost 3 hours and could have spent longer. You can walk there from the actual York station (about a 10-minute amble) as well as from the city centre or take a cute little transit train that conducts a regular service to the centre of town (at a modest extra cost). There is a very large and comprehensive shop with the usual souvenirs but also a great collection of books and DVDs. A fantastic visit and a must to do when in Britain."
Great place to visit ,Fantastic place for all things railway with great staff. Donation of a fiver each is not forced but the least you should offer for the displays and history. A must do in York.
Visit to York,"Railway museum very interesting for all age groups, visited around lunch time not many groups of children due to time of year"
"Lots to explore, interesting and all for free!","Visited this site back in September 2019 with my sister who is a train nerd. She thoroughly enjoyed her visit, particularly seeing the Mallard and we were both fascinated to see a portion of the Eurotunnel. The museum is very large and many hours can be spent exploring the various warehouses. There are talks and presentations throughout the day, I particularly enjoyed the turntable talk (however couldn't help but cringe at the amount of children sticking their hands out after the tour guide specifically stated all limbs should be kept far away. Please parents, watch your children during the talk for their safety!)My sister enjoyed the upstairs balcony, which provides a viewing platform for York station - she was able to tick off each train as it came in and out. Great wee bonus for the train fans.As one of the very few (if not only?) free attractions in York, I highly recommend spending some of your time here. It's a less than 45 minute walk from the city centre (maybe even 30), and it's very easy to find.Staff were also very knowledgeable too - my sister quizzed two men about some of the exhibits and they were able to keep up with her no issue."
Sunday afternoon visit,"We took the trolley bus from outside York Minster,think it was £3.00 each way.Nobody else on it,worth it to give feet a rest.Entry was free,although they do ask for a charitable donation on entry.Not that busy at time of our visit around 2pm.An enjoyable way to pass a few hours even if you're not a train lover like me.Very interesting to see carriages of Queen Victoria and other Royals,how things used to be.Enjoyed our visit."
The best attraction in the UK.,Free entry. Superb exhibit. Very helpful staff. Wholly recommend. Great location 10 min walk from York Station.
Brillant day out,The national railway museum is brilliant and being free is good. There collection of locomotives and coaches is great and all in amazing condition. Being able to get on to some of the trains is really good. The shop is very good. The main restaurant has a very good menu and good prices.
A trip back in time,Wonderful selection of trains to have a look around and explore and it even features Queen Victoria's train carriage. It was also nice to read about the Mallard
Just great. Free entry,"Lots of things to explore and lots of run around space for little ones. We joined an excellent story telling session, inside a goods wagon. Two nice cafes. Highly recommended"
Interest fo r all the family,Not been for several years as husband more interested in trains than me but found several new interesting exhibits including original Rocket and hospital train. Also larger number of assorted pit stops for reasonable food. Lots of families with kids.
Great free exhibition!,"Came here before leaving as it is free and only a short distance from the train station! There was lots to see and do so didn't get around the entire museum, although we have been before maybe 5 years ago and a lot of the things have not changed! Worth a visit if it's a rainy day or you want to kill a bit of time!"
Great place to visit in York.,"Wasn't a great day weather-wise, but thoroughly enjoyed it. Sat in the Japanese bullet train, was of particular of interest to my Russian friend."
As usual great exhibits,"Been many times, great museum and free. Can give donations if you wish. I went especially to see  the rocket exhibition. A little disappointing considering the hype. The  original rocket was positioned in a very non photogenic position with the chimney early touching the heating pipes of the museum. There were far better places to put it."
Great Plave to Visit,The National Rail Museum is a great place to visit and entrance is FREE! They they do ask for donations.Car Parking is £10. Drinks are expensive so take your own. What a great day out and lots to see.
Brilliant Day Out,"It's easy to spend a day at this attraction even if your interest is only minimal. Wonderful collection of steam locomotives (along with diesel &  electric), royal carriages through the years and a massive railway mania collection filling one hall. Everything has easy access and there are several catering areas plus plenty of seating if you are self-catering. Entry is FREE!!!"
Family,"This has to be the very best Museum ever and in the North in York, to see the grandeur of Queen Victoria’s coach was amazing, and to hear a talk on how she travelled was something else ! The staff must have dreaded her visits since she insisted on not using the toilet facilities on the train ! She did not trust them ! So the train had to pull into a station ! Stop she got off used the facilities and then back on !"
Great museum,"This was my third visit! I visited as a child when my school class won a trip from London on the then new, superfast intercity train, so lots of fond memories for me. Then having visited with my husband during our holiday to York we were back a year later with friends. We have enjoyed each visit immensely. The staff were very friendly and helpful. There are lockers, which meant we could get off tte train from London and visit the museum without trekking across the city just to drop our baggage at our hotel. But be warned, the lockers are limited in number, get there early.The number of trains to see is amazing. Lots of great photo ops too.We didn’t rate the mallard simulator though, very disappointing. The cafe on the platform is lovely, but it gets very hot in that train shed during hot summers days.Love this place and now have many more happy memories to add to those of my childhood."
Trains,If you like trains it's the place to go  exhibits of locos and railway related stuff also a balcony for some transporting
This is the one place you must visit,If you only have time for just one place to visit then this is the one.   While it may not be the largest railway museum in the world (The one in New Delhi in bigger) the trains and coaches are well maintained and looked after unlike so many others.
LOTS to see,We spent several hours here with the grandchildren without visiting any of the paid areas. It was all free in the winter which was a bonus. A donation was encouraged which we gave at the end.A couple of sticker books purchased as we entered kept them amused although I think the museum could do one for children to follow a trail around the museum and have stickers of the exhibits.Steam train was enjoyed too.A BIG negative was paying £2.25 for a glass of blackcurrant squash for each of the children.Land train back to the Minster was welcome after all the standing.
