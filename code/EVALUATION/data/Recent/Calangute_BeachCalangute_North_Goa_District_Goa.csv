Calangute Beach. ,Calangute Beach is another popular and crowded beach with numerous shacks that offers various food items and drinks alcoholic and none alcoholic. It was breathtaking experience and best part is it‚Äôs clean.
Lively,We visited this beach particularly to have our lunch at Souza Lobo. The beach is very crowded and the water is not very clean. I did not dare to take a bath on this beach. Lots of activities happen on the beach.
Good Beach,"after spending some time at Baga beach, we went walking towards Calangute beach which was clean and seemed bit better , though this beach was also crowded Lot of options here too for water sports etc and both domestic n international tourists were enjoying at the Beach, lot of shacks available where one can rest n enjoy the local cuisine ...We spent some time here before heading to have some fresh coconut water followed by a nice lunch at Calangute"
Lively,"Calangute is another popular and crowded beach with numerous shacks that offers various cuisines and drinks, the prices are by and large same at the shack.  The beach is big with water sports options such as boating, water skiing & parasailing etc. Be it day or night, the beach is always crowded and lively, good place for enjoyment and hangout."

Cleanest beach,the cleanest beach in goa! the shacks are worth a try! - great food and great atmosphere with fantastic music!
The changes that have made this a beach of beaches,"I have truly enjoyed my visiting the beaches such as Calangute, over seven years.Celebrating 2020s New year was my return to this location, where its beauty, was/had been enhanced with now a cleaning service to the whole Calangute beach area. In the early mornings there were staff walking/cleaning the beach with transport picking up waste from these people also vendors selling food from the shacks  along the length of the beach. This was a great improvement for the Calangute beach.  Well Done the Goan,s"
best beach of goa,we went to goa in off season of september. the weather was very pleasent and comparatively less public than december.we enjoyed big waves with family.
Goa 2020,"This is our second visit to this wonderful part of the world. Calangute beach is lovely place to be,beautiful sandy beach plenty of Shacks to get a sunbed on locally cooked food smashing people. We are here during the Virus problem but still life is going on. We will return."
Clean beach,The beach is quite clean as compared to my earlier visit 4 years back. Good place to have a bath in the sea.
Great beach - can get a bit crowded,This is the beach that is very popular with tourists and local Indians alike - clean beach with food & drink shacks all the way along.Most of the shack prices are the same - so it is down to how good the loungers / shades / comfort and service is.
Amazing beach,"One of the most popular beach in  north Goa, approach is good, there are plenty of shakes/Local restaurants and sunbeds to enjoy, plenty of water sports options."
Goa with friends,It was superb holiday with friends after long timeCalangute and Baga beach is main beachin Goa were most of the tourist stay
good beach,The hotel is walking distance to Calangute beach. Calangute beach is an attractive beach in Goa with the facility of Sports activity. Souza Lobo restaurant on beachside serves good prawns and fisghes.
Cleaner than expected,Loved the sand and the cleanliness of the beach. There are relaxing benches on the beach where one could chill but these benches are encroaching on beach. Lots of eating and drinking places on the beach!
crazy beach,"Big, popular beach with water sports, such as boating, water skiing & parasailing, plus food stalls.We had a fantastic first time in India staying on Calangute beach.When visiting Calangute town you must also visit this part of the beach, it‚Äôs a great experience you won‚Äôt forget."
Rajeh,"Location is very good, not close to beach, staff is very kind, the front desk manager Mr Sir Adhithyen Gurumoorthy was helpful and looking after all customers and his staff all the time , active person and decent, he should be the manager of all Ibis hotels in India not a front desk manager, he deserves more than my comment to be honest, thank a lot A dhithyen , hope to come again to the hotel."
Crowded but better than Baga,Crowded all the time as it is adjacent to famous Baga beach. But still better here than Baga. Very near to shacks and also some good food joints in Calangute market.
"Wonderful beach, white sand, great waves in the sea!","We had a fantastic first time in India staying on Calangute beach.  Great beach huts, wonderful food, lovely white sand, sunbeds and parasoles, and fab waves in the warm sea, which was like walking into a warm bath!"
Goa India Calangute Beach.,"When visiting Calangute town you must also visit this part of the beach, it‚Äôs a great experience you won‚Äôt forget. On our few trips here we tended to head for the Royal Shack... As you arrive at the main Calangute strip/rd, there are steps leading down to the beach... walk down the said steps and turn left, the forth beach shack along is the Royal shack with the flag of India flying above it... you can‚Äôt miss it!! The shack is run by a chap called Makan, a lovely friendly attentive fella that always made us feel so welcomeüëçüèº He was constantly moving our umbrella throughout the day so we were always in the shade. Makan‚Äôs service of food and drink was excellent, 10 out of 10üëçüèºüòéüëçüèº bear in mind this is the busiest part of Calangute beach, possible busiest in North Goa so be prepared for an experienceüòÇ... for more relaxed options there are numerous other beaches in Goa, or just keep walking for around 500m or so on this beach and it‚Äôs a far quieter/chilled beach. But for something completely different it‚Äôs a must experience and everyone is super friendly!"
Over Populated Beach,"The Beach is over crowded and too commercialized.Not a beach for relaxation or chilling out.There are numerous shacks, numerous sun bathers and an open-air massage beach.Walked for 45 mins and then found the nearest exit to Souza Lobo"
Not good,The place always seems crowdy and lot of noise present over there of DJs. The place is good only if you want to drink and hangout
A very busy beach,"The sand it lovely, the shacks were good but this beach is like the blackpool of india. Lots of indian tourists come here and the beach is packed!! One of the busiest i saw"
The happening beach in Goa,"Nicely developed beach in North Goa and one of the most popular ones. Lots of crowd and water sport activities. Long beach and in fact is in continuity to another popular beach of Goa i.e. Baga beach. Reclining beach beds are in plenty but if you want to use one, you are expected to buy some drinks or food. The beach is children friendly and can be visited with families."
HIDEOUS,"Overpriced sea front caf√©s and far too crowded, will never return to Calangute beach ever! Unlike the actual town, which was full of character and interesting shops that didn‚Äôt overcharge!"
Crowded but the best beach,Lively and best beach of Goa but pretty crowded. You can enjoy the sunset and for a stroll along the beach.
A very happening beach,"Visiting this a must if u r in Goa, crowded at all times and also very much commercialised but even then it has great goan vibe."
Calangute Beach - nice beach but bit crowded,"This is one of the crowded beach and lots of happening ... thousands of sunbeds kept in queue . No charge . But you need to order some food.  Sunbath , swim , salt and bear ... one can enjoy a lot here . Water sports available . Near the beach , roads are crowded , lots of traffic .  If you come early morning then it is really refreshing.  Nice place to enjoy in group"
Most happening beach in Goa,"planing to visit goa then this beach has to be the first priority for you. The most happening beaches, you can stay till midnight 3 and 4 am."
Great beech,"A bit crowded on occasions but otherwise fantastic, Good place to try for good food and drink was Friends Corner, we visited most days"
Enjoyed Sun,"Nice beach although bit crowded, good to enjoy early morning at beach, crowd increases as the day progresses, evening are generally crowded & people enjoyed water sports activity."
Average ,It also near to baga beach so its has also crowded beaches but some less than the baga so its average beach tattoo parlour are more at this Beach
Clean  beach,"Was windy the day we went .Yet still buzy .lots of sellers an shacks full. Good vibes, went another day was packed full of people  dogs cows"
Beach is Good - Getting There Not So Good,Long sandy beach with lots of bars and cafes renting out sun loungers. Very clean beach but you have to walk through a lot of stench and rubbish strewn paths to get the the beach. Goa tourist authorities need to address the dumping of trash near the beaches.
Best place,It is one of the best beach in goa to hang out with friends the finnest beach is bagha beach I was staying at the bagha beach only
One of the most popular beaches of Goa,"The silent beach - as the local people call it. One of the most famous beaches of Goa, which is slightly less crowded than Baga and Candolim. You will love the blue water and white sand of the beach but if you are planning to take a bath in the sea, it will hit you hard!! At least the day when I visited it, the  waves were very big and it was not easy to take a bath. There are many shacks on the beach, which offer food and drinks at (obviously) higher prices. If you just want to sit on those beds available on the beach and relax, you will be charged INR 100 per hour per bed, which is double than the price of the beds on Baga beach. Watersports are available here. The beach becomes a bit silent at night, so if you just want to hang out with friends, this is the perfect place."
Tour to goa,"Beautiful neat and clean tidy beach with all facilities such as washroom, parking, restaurant, markets etc."
Not the best beach,Very packed beach. Any sort of privacy is limited and there is very loud music depending on where you sit. I would recommend Candolim. We had a better experience.
One of the happening beach in Goa,This is one of the happening beach in Goa and central attraction of GOA. This is one of the crowdy beach same time its full of water sports etc. activities. Water quality of this beach is really good.
Enjoy Water sports,"Calangute is the most commercial beach of North Goa. Water sports with traditional and latest rides. Shacks on the beach, Beer, Hukkah and what not..Good for Couples and Family both.Shopping on the way of the beach is also a great attraction. You can find variety of dresses and almost all type of product related to beach and specially Goan products.."
Mrs mussell ,Nice beach lot's of good shacks we mostly stayed at aggies shack very good in there staff lovely food good they will do anything for you
Wonderful night atmosphere,Calangutte beach at the day time is famous for its water sports and for families to spend time. As the sun sets the family atmosphere is lost and the nightlife starts. At night usually families won't go. There is a lot of drug marketing over here. Usually it'll be good if you go with your friends. You can spend time in the beach and the party hard.
What A Great Beach,"Calangute has changed in last 3 years. It was neat and clean. In the evening the place was amazing, one can stay here in any of the shacks for hours. Thanks to the Government for maintaining Calangute so well."
Calangute beach,The beach was really nice and warm ....loved the view ....the rush over the beach is nice ...parties at night are awesome...if you want to see the best night life in Goa this is the beach to be...it also has the best club Tito's which is near to the beach....üî•üî•

A serene beach,The beach is soo good and we have various sports like parasailingin the beach area.A good place to hang around specially during Christmas and new year eve.
Great Beach,Great beach to chill. Good restaurant and shack options. decent crowd and lot of party places around to explore and also shopping
Great beach to relax,Amazing beach spot in Goa. Would especially recommend Friends Corner as a place to grab a sunbed and relax with nice food and drinks.
Nice Beach,"All the beaches looks and feels same. This was the nearest beach to our hotel , so we used to spend time whenever we were free and it was a good time spending there."
Goa north beach,Excellant beaches neat and tidy with various water sports. People are great with excellant service Good food excellant wine and beersLove rhis place
Nice average beach as compared to south Goa beaches.,This beach is far better than bagha beach. Peaceful and good crowd. We watched sunset from there. Can be visited while in Goa
"Excellent Beach, highly crowded","Located in heart of North Goa, the beach houses lots of shacks and restaurants to feed ur hunger n thirst. The beach is clean but is overcrowded with people. There are lots of unpopulated beaches in Goa besides this. Don't forget the watersports"
Relaxing ,"Relax for a day , have a beer, chill out . Many restaurants and beach pubs where you can spend your day . Drink only bottled water ."
Too Commercialised,"If you don't like crowded place, specially when you are on a vacation, would suggest to avoid Calanguate Beach from the regular entrance. You can still enjoy and visit the beach as they are several lanes that takes you to the beach.Water sports activity, shacks are some of the things you can enjoy at the beach."
Great beach for night outing,This is a great brach for night outing and has lot beach shakes and restaurants and has lot shopping areas along the way
Most Popular but ? Find My Imp tip in Review...,1)This is the Most popular Beach of North Goa.2)Very Commercial Beach3)Super-Duper Crowdy4)Water Sports are there ...5)Parasailing rate 1200 for 3 Dip 6)Many Entrance 7)Please be noted North you can face issues in Google maps direction. which doesn't work in a proper way.8)I didn't like this beach as I have seen South Goa Beaches.9)For the first-timer ...Must visit place10)2 Wheeler parking 30 RsMost Imp Tip: People will come on the bike and ask Do you have this voucher ...Scratch card etc...Better just avoid it..as It is a new SCAM there
nice beach but very crowded,its a nice beach with ample of eating options in shacks as well as shopping options in the nearby lanes. However it is very crowded
Great beach Tropicana shack was the best we found,"Fantastic, safe we was well looked after bu tony and the guys and ladies who run the shack ate here and never had bad stomachs in 3 weeks so friendly will visit next year"
A bit crowded but it's ok.,I prefer the beaches to the south of Goa.. But this one is ok.. It's better than Baga for sure.Not very crowded but ok..
Great recreation space,"Calungute Beach offers a wonderful diversity. It offers great swimming, boat rides and numerous beach shacks with refreshments and good wifi. I enjoyed the beach walks and seeing families (and kids), couples and groups of friends having a very good time."
Calangute beach ,Excellent beach with shack‚Äôs providing refreshments and meals. Clean beach with life guard availability.
Increadibly crowded!,"Despite the fact being in India, the Calangute Beach on New Years Eve an Day needs to be seen to be believed! Having said that, just take a few step behind to a beachshack, and its all fine and relatively relaxed."
Overcrowded beach,"I have visited this beach few times. Looks like now it's overcrowded. Very difficult to get a place for a family. I find South Goa beaches are much better with clean white sand and less crowd. Also, during season too much space is occupied by restaurants and water activities guys in Calangute beach, leaving only small area for people to enjoy the beach. In addition, Life Guards were over controlling, if an adult is not allowed to go to knee length water, I think there is no point of visiting a beach for swimming. Also, many times water activities guys encroach space marked for people to swim."
Less of serenity.More of crowd and noise.,"If you do not mind a crowded and noisy beach then you will find it to be enjoyable.Lots of eateries around with good Goan food,music and drinks.Handling taxi operators is a challenging task."
Perfect beach holiday,"Lovely beach, lots of shacks nearby, close to our hotel. A great place to relax on the loungers and watch the beauty of the Arabian Sea or to have an invigorating dip in the sea. Fantastic sunrise and sunset."
Super and clean beach on goa,"The place is well maintained with clean beach and lot of security. You have life guard keeping a watch on patrol vans and motors boats all the time. Post sunset access to water is not allowed though till 2am you may find lot of joint offering dinner facing sea. Beautiful ambience. You may have water sport like jet ski, high speed motorboat rides, parasailing etc."
Clean beach with good food options ,We are beach lovers from gujarat. We have visited all beaches in gujarat and Mumbai. All beaches in gujarat dirty and not at all maintained but beached in goa are clean. Calangute beach is very long but clean everywhere
Great beach,No wonder people visit Goa..nice clear waters... Good people and crowd.. . Crowded though. Always go after 4pm..or before 7am
Goa Diaries,The best place in Goa to stay and enjoy with family and friends. The best part is the presence of Flying Fish Scuba Diving Resort right on the Calangute Beach!!!
Nice famous beach.,Nice clean and popular beach. Little crowded but not like Baga beach. Nearby many food stall and public toilet with bathing facilities available. Free parking little far. Goa miles can be used.
Clean Wide Beach with Vigilant Life Guards,This beach has all facilities for sea and sun bath & other enjoyments suiting every budget. The beach lies at a distance of approx 15 km from the capital Panaji and 45 km from Madgaon Junction railway station.
Crowded beach,"It's a very crowded beach, lot of shacks & loud music. Didn't enjoy the beach but sunset was beautiful."
Vibrant beach,"One of the most happening beaches of North goa, Calangute beach is not for those in  search of peace  & quiet. Its teeming with people this time of the year ,water sports facilities & shacks(with jarring loud music )  being a major reason. The beach undoubtedly is beautiful ...stretching endlessly on both sides. If you wish to enjoy the serenity of the sea go early in the morning, then its just you & the sea for company."
Very crowded beach,"It's a ok kind of beach, very crowded not clean enough also.There are water sports also there like parasailing its cost is ‚Çπ800 but if you want 3 dip in water then it will cost ‚Çπ1200, but experience was good.But if a person hired a bike or car on rent then i would literally suggest do not depend on Google map because it doesn't work over there in North Goa, but for South Goa map is superb one can blindly trust on map for South Goa.My hotel was just 2.1km for Calangute beach but because of map i reached there in approx 1.5 hours and covered approx 8 to 10 kms.Overall a good beach. One must try stone chocolate from Calangute it's realy very nice and different."
Central Goa is not for beaches,Central Goa is not for beaches but for clubs or good food.If one want to experience a serene Eve at beach go to extreme north or south. Beaches are full of tourist who keep spoiling your pictures. Avoid them if your priorities are peaceful walk on beach
Most Favorite Beach Of Tourists In North Goa.,"Calangute beach is excellent & therefore attracts very large volume of visitors including foreigners.In fact Candolim Beach, Calangute Beach & Baga Beach are on the same straight line of beach & in same sequence. All these three beaches attracts huge crowd from morning till night.The beach is located at 14 km from Panjim bus stand.There are two common parking place for car near to beach. One near the beach & other at 300 meter distance from it. I have attached photos of it. Rs. 50 for 8 hours is the rate.Plenty of options of hotels for accommodation & restaurants for food.Plenty of clothes & souvenir shops.Plenty of shacks on beach for drinks & food plus dance at night. We had dinner in one of the shack. Shacks closes at night 12. I have attached night photos of shacks. Water sports are available at this beach from morning till evening.Parasailing starts after 11 am till evening.Charges for water sport activities are:1. Rs. 1700 Package Parasailing, Jet Ski, Banana Ride, Bumper Ride & Boat Ride 2. Rs. 700 Boat Ride In Sea For 2 hoursDolphin Trip, Showing Film Shoot Spots, Swimming With Life Jacket In Sea3. Rs.300 Dolphin trip4. Rs. 200 to 400Jet Ski, Banana Ride, Bumper Ride, Boat Ride5.

Photo of this pamphlet is attached for your ready reference.There are agencies who conducts Grand Island tour. Grand Island tour is from Rs.1000 to Rs.1800 with different operators. The operator we chose thru Calangute GTDC staff reference charged us Rs.1300 per person. for tour from 9 am to 4 pm. It was thru Goayatra. It included:Pick up & drop, trip near to Grand island (not on actual island), snorkeling, fishing, soft drinks, unlimited beer, mineral water, veg non veg lunch on return.I won't recommend this grand island tour thru Goayatra as it is not worth. Nothing too see in water during snorkeling as water is too unclear. During fishing one will see the fishes caught. Better you plan Grand Island tour thru tripraja for better experience at Rs.1300 or thru the hotel owner of Blue Beach Marine Resort for better experience at Rs.1000.This owner has connection with tour operators who provide water sports & island trip at very reasonable rates compared to all others. Grand island is very near to Vasco Da Gama beach.This beach does offer eye pleasing sunset.Beach is maintained neat & clean.There are life guards keeping watch on the visitors playing or swimming in the beach water.There are paid change room & toilets very near to beach. Photo of it is attached.I have attached 180 degree photos of the beach. Please have a look at it.I will highly recommend this beach for all. It is the best beach of North Goa."
"Nice Happening Beach, a little crowded though","This beach has nice waves, vigilant lifegaurds, nice shacks for munching on various cuisines. But it is very crowded."
Beautiful N serene,"Loved this beach. Simply beautiful and serene. The sunset Here is spectacular. As you enter the beach, meet this guy Mr. Dariek. He is at the first shack OK n your right as u enter the beach. Amazing person and the best bartender out there."
An active beach,The beach is good for those who loves to enjoy the party beach side. The off beach space is good and many shops are around for shopping there.
Long Beach,It's crowded and long beach with lots of shacks with relaxing chairs but minimum order should be Rs 500 for snacks and drinks if you want to use those chairs...but worth it...in the beginning it's crowded but as you walk about 1 km along you find it's better and lesser people around....it's nice place for a long  walk in the beach ....also authorities are keeping it clean..
Beware of the Shaq Attack!!!,"The beach is generally clean. A little deep perhaps. But the shacks, I tell you! You cannot walk a 100 meters without someone coming and asking you if you need a seating, drink, food, hookah! But its a long beach and you can easily spend time here. There is even a public toilet, that's relatively clean."
Crashing at Calangute,The beach was pretty clean. There were different shacks but we preferred getting alcohols from a shop as it was cheaper. I believe this beach is best suited for people loving long walks. There is not much do there.
Nice place,Nice place just a little improvisation required there govt or tourism department shud fix the rates of the water sports activity and sun beds and benches must be installed permanently for resting
Nice clean beach's with activities and shacks. ,Really nice beach shacks all along worth checking out with a walk as you can usually find a nice quite or party atmosphere to suite your trip. Great to sit and watch sunset on a lounger.
Crowded beach,One time visit beach..lot of locals and vendor available there...but good market for shopping. Easy breakfast available there.. Take hotels near by this area
Beautiful beach!,The water and sand is clean.People who just love to have a walk or sit by the beach will find calangute beach very good.its not noisy like baga.
Crowded beach but still has a lot of life,"The famous beach of Goa still gets huge crowds and is lively as ever.Lot of eateries, pubs, shacks, shopping and nightlife around here."
Clean and neat beach,"Good place to have a bath and enjoy waves and sunset. Huge number of foreign Nationals found, but good place to enjoy with friends. Just move s ok me 50 to 100 metres away from main entrance."
Better beaches around ,"Seemingly the beach hippies headed for back in the day !However its heyday is well passed, not one of Goa best beaches, hardly anything to see, the sand is contaminated with red soil, and the fierce waves drag the sand out, then throws it back in the next wave, so the sea at the shoreline is not clear.There are a few shabby shacks to get drinks...and surprisingly delicious food.Some of the entry roads to access the beach need attention.Toilet and shower facilities are virtually non existent! One kind Goan lady took me into here ‚Äòhouse‚Äô to use her toilet!!"
Excellent clean beach.,"We visited the main calngute beach on 8th November with our kids. We found it cleaner than Baga beach, sand here is also coarse and does not stick. Because a cyclone had occurred just a week before the lifeguard s were cautious and warning against going deep inside. They even arrested few people who went too much inside. In this way it's safe if you stay near the coast.Next day we visited the other side of calngute beach. Since our stays was as Nordest Lemonmint, there was a part of calangute beach 300 metres from hotel, walking distance. We were captivated by the beach of this place. Another advantage was that there were no life gaurds at this beach. Life gaurds don't allow you stay near water after 6, so at this beaches we could enjoy till 6:30. The cleanest of all. Beautiful waves, best sunset scene, and lots of good crowd (not the one like you find at main Baga and calngute beaches). This was the place our family enjoyed the most."
Fun and food at Calangute,"Great options of food and drinks from so many shacks available on the beach. Also one can go for parasailing, scooter, banana ride etc. Overall, its a great place to stay and enjoy the Goan food and stay."
Must visit one,"Calangute Beach is very good and one of the must visit place, we enjoyed the time spent here, night would be the best time to visit this beach with lot of people and we can  get good food and drinks serving, night life is good here."
Beutiful beach with teash blemishes.,"Excellent white clean sand beach, but irresponsible tourists do litter it with bottles, cans, packets and other trash. That's an eyesore. It's still not a waste dump and retains some charm of being a beach. If the govt does not start using technology to spot people who throw trash around and fine them real heavy, the beach might just die soon and with that the businesses too will die."
go elsewhere in goa.,"The beach itself is well kept but all this entire town  is terrible.Crowded with thousands of poorly dressed single males groups rooming around in noisy, drunken way.If you are a foreigner in Goa:go south (agonda), go north (morjim) and avoid calangute-baga area!"
Nice beaxh,Nice beach with lifeguards on duty so you can swim between the flags. A good selection of restaurants along the beach also.
Awesome Beach,I spent a few hours here and it was really good. It has good vibes and feel to it. Do visit the beach if you are in Goa!
crowded but fun,"This is the most famous beach of Goa and is thronged by both local and foreign tourists, Nevertheless its a good beach and has a few interesting water sports options. The food stalls are worth a try."
Over crowded beach,Though the beach has scenic beauty but it‚Äôs over crowded. Plan to go to other beaches and avoid this one.
Cool Beach Ever!!,"We had visited this place during mid of June, I know we shouldn't be here as suggested by lots of folks but we didn't listen and went there for the excitement. Really, we loved to visit Calanute Beach, cool weather and lovely breeze which makes you more joyful inside. Go Goa doesn't need Weather just need a Good Company!"
Good but crowdy,If u wanna enjoy at beach then don't visit here as it's too crowdy and later not clean and local guide / irritate alot but u can have hit  corns   but better visit anjuna beach for good experience
Enjoyable yet Crowded,"Calangute Beach is an enjoyable place to be and laze around, spend time playing or sitting in shacks. The beach is crowded though and could be a turn off for people wanting peace"
Crowded beach,"Most tourists visit Calangute beach. This is close to Baga beach, but not as good as Baga. Water sports like Jet ski, speed boat, banana ride, bumper ride and para sailing are available at this beach as well. Calangute also has good number of beach shacks that serve food & drinks. We couldn't find good bathrooms nearby. There are plenty of shops nearby to buy beachwear, toys, artificial jewelry, cashew nut shops, tattoo shops to get temporary & permanent tattoos on the body etc."
Long Stretch of Crowdy Beach,"Calangute Beach in North Goa District of Mapusa, is a long stretch of beach from Calangute to Baga. This beach is a bit crowdy. There are shacks on the beach where you can enjoy food or drink. A market is in front of Beach having restaurants, curios and tattoo shops. Maintenance and shower, toilets etc are desirable in such a lovely beach. Many sort of water sports facilities are available in the beach."
Never in our lives have we seen  such dirty beach,"it's so filthy and dirty and are in mortal danger to catch all sorts of diseases. No showers, no toilets and the sewage for everywhere goes unfiltered into the sea."
Beautiful view of sunset,One of best beaches of North Goa. Beach is bit crowdy but a wonderful place for fun.  Children can enjoy a lot by sand play and beach bath. Sunset view is breathtaking from here.
bit crowdy but beautiful,Sunsets are beautiful here and one can enjoy beach shacks with food and alcohol. vagator and sinquerium beaches are much better then baga and calangute in north goa
Nice sea water,"This beach where most of the people can enjoy beach a most, most crowed and nice one, it's nearby Bagga beach , you can reach Bagga by walking through sea side.many stores also available here."
A great place to hangout,A perfect place where you can hangout with your friends. But the rate of the food at the shacks are too costly as per the quality they provide.
busiest and popular beach in Goa,the beach is most popular and busy beach in goa. even inn the off season the beach was crowded. lots of foreign tourist was there. the night life of the beach was very stunning. the food stall every where on the beach. lots of sea beach hotels are also with night clubs.
Park calungute ,Best explored from the park hotel the overlooking deck of park hotel is best place to Sip your drink and enjoy the mersmerising sun set. The deck turns into an open bar and disc in the night
Awesome place. ,We all enjoyed here too much especially my daughter. We enjoyed music also there as well as rain.You will get too much option to eat at this beach
The rocking sea with thrilling sports steals the heart,"The high tide and water sports makes the day. Also, like to stop and bargain with the small shop sellers for hand crafted items. Lastly though you know you don't win at bargaining but at least you're able to get some discount out of it."
Beautiful ,Very clean beach and beautiful. Lot of water sports and had good time... Best beach in Goa ..  Will be back again
Calangute crowded beach,The beach looks really good and you can find much outlets and prices are high near the beach side outlets. Apart from that you can fine many more water games and activities
Nice Beach,Its a nice beach when its not crowded. During festive season like Christmas and new year it is packed crazy just like the Kenyan mombasa beach.
Great place for family.. Clean Beach.,"Try the simple beachfront restaurant  Souza Lobo, open since 1932 known for its seafood and Goan dishes and live music."
Very good beach in Goa,We have been visiting Calangute beach every year on our holidays in goa. The beach is always the best place to go round the clock as it is very safe for families and couples.  Life guards and police are always available for the protection and help. Consuming Alcohol is strictly prohibited on the beach in open. You can go at any nearby shacka and restaurants to quench your thirst for a beer or anything else.
"White sands, green waters","A huge beach full of people. Multitude of water sports like water scooters, paragliding etc. The water here has an alluring blue green colour which makes you feel you could be anywhere in the world."
Beautiful,"Amazing beach and warm seas. Cant wait to visit agin next year.Food, drink and shack ownersall very friendly"
Beach with High Tides,"Beautiful Beach , Little bit overcrowded. As mentioned in my title beach with HIGH TIDES so please be cautious. Here also you find Restaurant serving Food's & Drinks.Must Visit this beach also. Highly Recommended."
Nice beach in north Goa...,"We had a wonderful time. This is one of the famous beach of north goa.Good atmosphere refresh mind. Calangute is just extension of baga beach. Many water sports facilities are available.Its good for families,couples... It‚Äôs crowded in evening time but not in early morning. We enjoyed morning time view and calmness...."
Nice place,"This is one of the beautiful beaches of north goa along the coast of arabian sea. The maintanence can be improved when compared to other places.do carry umbrella, caps,sunglasses, water, camera .definitely will enjoy here"
Pretty average,didn't like the beach so much.crowd is not good. Shacks serve pretty average food. Shops at the entrance of the main beach are OK. Very crowdy.
Good for night hangout,Good beach for nightlife and party lovers -lots of good resorts nearby and good restaurant .Centrally located
Calangute Beach,"Goa is certainly avery lush, progressive and beautiful area to visit. If you want a quieter more secluded area to visit than Bagu Beach then Calangute Beach might fill the bill. There were certainly quite a few domestic tourists staying at the time I was there. It was the wet season and it did rain for most of the morning when we arrived. The beach is easily accessible from any of the accommodation in the area. Because of the time of year the beach was very rough and closed to swimming. To go in the water would have been extremely dangerous. A lifesaver tower had been knocked down by the waves during the previous night. I was disappointed with the beach although, if I had of been in Goa for longer I would have gone for a long walk along the beach. Don't know that it would be a good idea to walk alone at the time of the year and especially not for women. Besides not being able to get in the water the beach was extremely dirty with rubbish that had been washed up by the waves. It was easy to see the large amount of rubbish in the water. By comparison, when at Bagu Beach later in the day, it was extremely clean. I can only speculate that the beach there is cleaned."
Not so Active in Monsoon,"Unlike Baga this beach is not so active in the monsoons. As usual water sports were closed and tourists were forbidden to go into the waters due to the bad weather. There were a handful of shacks open but most of them did not have proper cover....so when we sat in one of them for dinner, at one time rain started and due to the wind we started getting wet. I would recommend Baga for enjoying shack experience in case you are in Goa in the monsoons. However what we liked over there was that if you walked a little away from the shacks the place was deserted and peaceful. We as a couple enjoyed some lone time away from the hustle and bustle of Goa life. (However I don't think that during on-season this place remains this much peaceful.)"
Just Nice,"I visited this beach in early August and did not find it much amusing. Due to monsoon season, tides and waves were not pleasant enough to enjoy the water, we kept a safe distance from the coastline. Other than that, I did not see much fun or party ambience near the beach as compared to Baga beach. So, for me this was a nice beach if you would like to sit and have some silent alone time, less crowded. I liked the Calangute market more as compared to the beach. You can buy some good and cheap gifts from the market."
Good beach,One of the favorite beach of Indian tourist. You can reach to Calangute beach by private taxi/state transport. But one request to all avoid shopping because prizes are too high.
One of the good beaches in goa,Too crowded and dirty beach. But is a must visit for any goa visitor.It has all the shops starting from food to clothing to accessories. But do bargain.
Best beach in Goa,Its was great as due to rainy season most of the beaches were dirty but Calangute was fun and had a great time there.
Sunset is the best time to be there ,"You get a great view of the Sunset üåÖ at calangute beach, Goa. It‚Äôs better than Baga beach in terms of cleanliness. You can sip a beer üç∫ and relax at the beach for sometime. Cons - Parking can be an issue here Be careful while taking drinks to the beach üèù"
stinkiest beach ive been to in goa,"I couldn't stand being in the sea on calangute beach, the sea is so smelly with pollution I had to get out within one minute.plus beware of dogs under your deck chairs as I didn't know I had a dog under my seat and when I stood up I was bitten, it felt like it was biting and not letting go for at least 5 minutes.3 men couldn't get this dog off me, but when they did my leg was in a terrible state that took 6 months to heal and I've 2 terrible scars for life."
Place where the Water meets Land,"Calangute beach is a beautiful place to have a walk with ur loved ones, enjoy the ocean and the beach but the shacks are over priced.."
Most beautiful one! ,"Its one of the most beautiful beaches of goa, less crowded and has one of the best resturants near it, really great vibes and well managed."
Little overcrowded,"Calangute is the central part of Goa, This is quite overcrowded place and little dirty also, So I would recommend heading towards Baga or Anjuna beach rather than wasting time over here"
RUBBISH EVERWHERE !,A real shame and stray dogs everywhere.If you are looking for the miles of golden Goan sand you will find it here but under all the garbage !
Horrible experience. ,"Not worth spending more than 5 minutes there. Attracts all road-side Romeo's who, just by their leering, can make any woman uncomfortable. Very very crowded and dirty."
Serene,It was a lovely evening spent in the beach by us  The beach was clean and food was amazing in the shacks.
Calangute Goa is Just Amazing its a Paradise of Excitements in India,"Calangute Goa is Just Amazing its a Paradise of Excitements in India. If you are planning to visit Goa or if you are already in Goa for holiday, Then you must visit the place calangute. Because with including calangute in your Goa holiday trip, plan and package, your Goa holiday vacation is incomplete.1. if you stay in calangute while on holiday, you can really enjoy your holiday and experience the uniqueness of Goa.2.

Popular beach,"There is very crowd in the beach. Water sports, water rides activities, beers in many shops,fast foods, shopping,.. It is a very quiet n comfortable beach, people walk by using bare foot in beach but nothing noise. Lifeguards are excellent condition. They are helpful and caring to people. Love to eating goan thali. It is an awesome beach."
Vibrant beach with lots of eating options,Calangute beach is always a place we visit when we go to Goa. the beach itself is relatively flat so you can enjoy walking in ankle-high water. Plus there are lost of food options for surprisingly for vegetarians too. Souza Lobo on the beach is our favorite. Along the beach are small shops with knick knacks that you can pick for your loved ones. A must visit
Heaven of Goa,"I am a frequent visitor of Goa ,because I like goa most for enjoyment on Goa's crowdy but best beach calanguate ,best time to go is 15nth Nov to March,it is the best time and season to visit Goa in very pleasant weather,,new couples ,solo ,foreiners or say people around the world visit goa,,there are stalls on beach side to eat all type of food ,sea food ,snacks , liquor/beer ,relaxing chairs on rent for sun bath on beach side ,all types of water sports ,boating ,I had been there thrice in last 6 years ,so many hotels of various standards are there near by to stay ,in Nov.it is neither cold nor hot the weather is , you may also hire bikes on rent to visit different places of goa ,so many local tour packages available to be booked directly or through yout hotel ,the public enjoys whole dat but in evening after 5 Pm the atmosphere on beach is marvellous ,restaurants full in low lights for dinner, snacks,beer,although I have visited worth 10-15 total indian and foreign beaches but I will say Calanguate is the best."
"Calangute Beach Calangute, India",The Calingute beach also not good for children's as the road was so sleppery. Beach was good and clean but no facilities of Toilet and dress change
Beachy vibes ,This is one of the known beaches in Goa. Calangute beach offers a lot of water sports activities. It is a decent beach to visit. It attracts a lot of tourists because of being in the main city
Noisy yet worth a visit,"If crowded beaches are your thing, definitely go for it. Those who seek tranquility and serene ambience stay away! Always bustling with crowd, people flocking plenty of eateries and shacks around."
Joyful trip,"Calangute beach one of the famous beach of Goa we went here in mansoon when we reach here rain is start. Life gaurds wisiled & announced for safety your self. Beach is very wide clean and attractive, we fully enjoyed here. Beautiful beach"
Definitely the best beach,This beach is really beautiful and has a lot of crowd visiting here. It‚Äôs quite refreshing to have a drink lying on the chair and enjoying the view. I visited this place in monsoon and it was so ao beautiful.
Needs a good cleanup ,"We visited in the monsoon season with rip tides and unsafe conditions for swimming. So there were red flags on the beach with lifeguards whistling down anyone who went close to the water. Still the sand is soft and the beach stretches for miles. If only it weren‚Äôt so dirty. The amount of trash is horrifying, and the frequent broken glass in the sand means you can‚Äôt quite walk barefoot safely."
Super fun ,Calangute beach at Goa is a public beach and maintained by Government of Goa for public use. The beach is clean and awesome. Very crowded almost all the times. We did water sports there. Rode that high speed Yamaha water scooter and also went for Para gliding. Paragliding is INR 1000 per person without any negotiation.
Crowded.,"This is an excellent beach only if you are found of shopping, good local food and can handle crowd. 'cause this beach and it's surrounding has all of it in abundance. In season days big buses are stopped about 3 kms before and you have to cover the distance walking but you don't feel it as the street is full of shopping and eating options. Beach is really very nice and tides are beautiful."
Average beach with shacks,It's an average beach. It's crowded with more Indians. There are lot of shack options on the beach. Paid car parking is at walkable distance.
Most Crowded beach,Culungate is most crowded beach with all the water sports if u go till May end. In june due to high tides water sports are stopped but still u can enjoy beach bath or sun bath with tasty food
Nice beach to enjoy ,This is awesome beach in North Goa we had a wonderful time with my friends. As it is June and yet rain to start you may face lot of humidity problems.This is great experience
A Beautiful beach with Lots of Activities and Shopping,This is a very  crowded beach with lots of activities which will keep you entertained. Would suggest to visit in the evening as can enjoy and same time do shopping. It is a perfect place for dinner but the prices look bit on the expensive side. Don't forget to bargain while shopping.
Goa in May,"During our annual visit to Goa we would invariably settle down visiting our regular haunts like Brittos.this time however we decided to visit souza lobo at calangute .It's known for its Goan dishes and I was quite excited to try something local.i looked at the starters menu and noticed that everything they had was in nonveg.finally ended up with mixed veg pakoda and fries.how boring!the ambience was great.we got a table on the patio right next to the beach.it was 10 pm at night,the breeze was cool and the water was visible a few feet away.totally lovely.go for the location.dont go if u are vegetarian and want local starter's."
Touristy ,Not recommended if you want peace time.highly touristy with sky high prices. Restaurants are not value for money except Souuza lobo.
Good beach with lots of activity but very crowded,This is round the year happening beach in Goa but very crowded and not so clean. The morning and evening time is best to visit
water sports,"The water sports if planned to go directly in person, then calanguate beach is the best one as it offers it less cost when compared with Baga beach water sports. The sea guards are friendly and will update the visitors with the security guidelines."
Ok type beach,Nothing much to explore on beach. Not clean at all. But if you are in Goa then you have no option but to visit beaches.
Business visit,"Very nice Hotel, very nice hospitality and cooperative staff. The chefs ensure to visit each and every guest and ensures  ""Guest Satisfaction"""
Vacation at goa,"A trip to goa is incomplete without a 2 day stay at calangute. The most happening place in goa.good beach always crowded.evening to late night always alive ,pubs bars nearby."
Compulsory beach to visit in Goa,"Calangute is the most happening beaches of Goa. A busy and crowded beach but a not to miss type of beach.Quite Few famous restaurants , shops, market around Calangute beaches.Busy but It‚Äôs still clean and safe.A fun place. Can visit with family/ friends/ couple, etc.I m no one to rate/ recommend the beach .Evenings are pleasant with many shakes and restaurants making the atmosphere more pleasant.At 1:30 in night you still find people here sitting and enjoying the shore.If you have not visited Calangute beach you have not visited Goa"
Peace of mind,It is amazing experience and feeling relax and peace of mind.evening time is the best time to visit this place.
Awesome,We visited here on 2/6/19.we took a bath here.The waves are too big.Too rush here but enjoyed a lot.we took boating here.That was nice .They take 100 RS per head.you can bargain them.The beach had toilet n bathrooms.They take 30rs for a bath.There are many shops n clothes shops r there.Veg restaurant s are there.You can taxi from there.Must see this beach.This beach is in North Goa.Airport is very far.about 50kms.
Too crowded,One of the most popular and well known beaches in Goa. Went there on a weekday evening. The road leading upto it is very crowded with tons of shops and restaurants of all varieties. Some of the shacks on the beach have bad bollywood music blaring at unacceptably high volumes and distortion--but the dancing public dont seem to be sensitive to this. Worth giving it a miss
Majestic Sea with golden sparkling sand,"I went with my son in May 2019. We went by train from Mumbai to thivim. From thivim we took taxi which charged 600/- which are easily available out side Thivim station. I had already booked hotel from Oyo site which was just walking distance of 1 km away from Calangute beach.. Calangute beach is a beautiful mesmerizing clean beach with golden clean sand..(you can see in my photos i uploaded) as its one of the famous beach so was bit crowded but one can relax there very nicely.. nice cool breeze.. big waves, Calm, Quiet, Peaceful feeling.. there are many shacks on beach where one can sit eat & drink... but liquor is very expensive at shacks so if one wants to enjoy beach side relax drink they can go for it.. there is main market at Calangute beach where we can shop nicely..."
"Crowded, but has all the tourist shopping of local Goa","Though popular for most, please avoid if you need quite place. Most the sports activities seems to pay very little attention to safety, please be careful"
Goa diary,The visit to goa witjout visiting this beach is incomplete.this is ver nice beach with great crowd.!!!
Dirty and crowded,"It is one of the most commercial beaches in North Goa with a very average crowd hence it is dirtier than other beaches. If you are looking for something peaceful out there, you should not opt for this one !"
Best place to chill out ,"Calangute beach is place to chillout a must visit place from all the watersport like banana ride, skysailing etc"
Hot and not at its best.,"I knew that it would be rather hot, but the amount of rubbish on the beach was sad to see. Maybe this is because it is out of season. But it was cleaner years before when I visited."
2nd most happening beach !,"A lively, lovely beach with lot of eating options ! A beach to enjoy water rides, sip beer, watching waves !"
Calangute charming experience,"This beach is with full of joy. Beach sunset, tatto , sea food and many more....Also we had Natural ice Cream at Calangute Beach which is our Favourite."
Calangute Beach,Very good beach for indians to chill out at night.Perfect for couples and groups.Perfect night out
Lovely beach,"One of my favorite beach in goa, very big famous, clean with watersports activity like boating etc. On this beach many restaurant are there with dj(night life), candel light dinner near by beach. I really enjoy my evening with my partner. Must visit."
Crowded ,Normally it's a little crowded but try and explore the shack and beach located away from the main beach. It's beautiful and clean
Decent Beach,Calangute beach is clean and decent beach to be enjoyed. You can have nice time spending at this beach.
Nice beach but too crowded,Like any famous beach this is also too crowded so its not ideal beach for relaxation. But surely you can have lot of fun as there are good water activities and food jointsYou can easily spend some good hours here
Nice place for fun and relaxing,Calangute beach is one of the best beach in Goa.I had visited it in January 2019 and had an amazing experience.People from all around the world come to this place to enjoy in tides.I had visited it Solo but I will prefer that don't go there alone you need at least one or two person with yourself or you can go in a group of 5-6 people.The the beach was clean and also there were Goa police protectors who regularly warning All The Peoples not go far in the ocean that may be dangerous..The places were there were very expensive.
Lovely place to relax,"We spend a number of days here during our stay in Goa as it was a short walk from our hotel. It‚Äôs a lovely beach to sit with a book and the sea breeze was lovely. You can get beds at all of the beach huts, but we recommend going to Jolly Boys as they don‚Äôt have women pestering you to get a massage or buy their jewelry. At some of the other beach huts, we found the women far too persistent."
Simple too crowded,Avoid. It's one of the most popular beaches in Goa and most of the 1st timers end up here. It's too commercial and there is simply no vacant spot available.Shacks are a bit over prised.Explore other beaches.
Amazing experience!,Calangute beach is undoubtedly one of the  best sea beaches of Goa.its situated near baga beach. Someone can visit baga beach from this area within an hour journey. There is a small market which has very good collection of gift utems.
Sand to hot to walk ,"Visited the beach mid morning and settled at a beach shack for the day had a couple of drinks on the lounges watching all the the domestic tourists jumping about in the waves with all there clothes on, went into the shack for a pleasant elite lunch, after lunch it was getting very busy with the domestic tourists so decided to return to the quiet of the hotel pool , here lay our problem the sand had become so hot my wife was burning here feet and could not walk any further than the distance of one shack were a wait saw our distress and got her settled in the shade while I went to the shops and bought a pair of canvas full shoe for her ,nice beach but beware the hot sand , took 3 day's of aloe Vera to settle her feet."
Nothing special,"Nothing special, no bars, no sunbeds...I was a bit disappointed actually.There's a few more beautiful ones in the south actually"
Goan Beach Culture,We chose to go in the evening due to the hot weather. The beach was very crowded despite being a huge beach. We had a good time and wound up by having good snacks and drinks at the shack. ( Souza Lobo ).If you want to experience a distinctive Goan beach culture then it is a must visit beach.
Beaches ,"Wow what a beach!!!!Busy, bustling and very friendly.Deffo worth a visit.Lots of very happy dogs!!Be prepared to have loads of selfies with the Indian's.The beach shacks are great. Xx"
One of the best beaches in North Goa,"One of the most happening beaches in North Goa is Calangute. It has wide beaches, shacks for rests, drinks and food, Washrooms and toilet arrangement for the public, water sports facilities at a very reasonable rate. But cleanliness to be improved"
Ms. Sherl,Take time off for a peaceful stroll on the beach.. Tivia beach to Calangute beach is a 15 mts walk.. No footwear needed if u want to feel the sand and see the waves take the ground slipping beneath ur legs
Just extension of Baga Beach!,The Calangute beach is one of the famous beaches of North Goa. The beach is just the extension of the baga beach and offers similar atmosphere. The beach is a bit crowded just like the baga beach. Water sports can be tried here.
Lechorous ming mongs,"The beach is ok, decent sand if you can avoid the dog poo. There are literally hundreds of dogs along this and every other beach we went to, mostly friendly but also mostly stray. The beach is lined with very average bars and restaurant shacks, all endlessly trying to get your business. There is rubbish strewn around the place, but there is everywhere. The worst part of this place is the lechy locals, who barely try to conceal taking photos and videos of young girls and boys. Disgusting. Do yourself a favour and head to Candolim, it‚Äôs marginally better and quieter. If you‚Äôre not a local, avoid the beach area near town, full of local men and very intimidating for my wife and kids. Never again"
Long stretch of beach,The most popular beach in Goa. The sea was shallow and hence we could walk some distance into the sea. The beach was clean despite being crowded and we could find our own space. Lot of food shacks around. Must visit beach in Goa
Overcrowded,"The beach is a well known one, but being central is visited by one and all.Very crowded and dirty at places.Shacks and shops enroute are eager to fleece you so be careful."
Too crowded,"It's a bit too crowded for anyone other than a teenager. Not so good for a family outing. Has a lot of sports, so good for people 15-35 I guess"
Excellent climate,This is the first time I visit goa nice visit all are available i never forget that moment in my life
First time visit ,"Really enjoyed the beach in general was very clean, lots of shacks selling good food and drinks at reasonable prices sea was quite rough and strong currents but generally very warm and a lovely breeze,"
Relaxe after daughter board exam,We want some different after daughter board exam so we decided trip to goa.here we stay santa Monica resorte .
over run with gangs of men drunks and loud,The beach was packed with lots of gangs drunken men and making a general nuisance of themselves we went off to Candolim beach which was a little quieter the shacks are great  for a drink and snack and a sunbed with umbrella great for  chill out i woudl suggest going down early in the day to get a decent spot as it fill very quickly
"Beautiful beaches, strong waves.","Miles of sand, very hot, strong waves.We stopped at quite a few shacks to use their sunbeds and eat in their bars.Very cheap food and drink and the owners made you feel welcome. All have flushable loos the shacks we used weren't troubled with sellers etc.The beach has its own life guards and boats for trips to see Dolphins and fishing."
Large and famous beach,This beach is one of the most famous beach of North Goa.This beach is highly commercialised and fairly crowded...........Beach area is clean while the way to beach is full of littered plastic bottles......Why cant authorities maintain this beach properly which is full of foreign tourists?Even on a warm April afternoon the breeze at beach was cool and water was also cool.............Enjoyed time in water.....Water sports available here...
For water sports ,"This is beach has all kinds of water sports starting from 300 to 1500 . Opens on 10 to 5 only . This is have lots beach restobars with dj , live music and candle light dinner also. Highly populated and 100% no privacy . This is for groups and youngsters."
Beautiful Scene With Mighty Ocean,"I visited the beach during noon hours which was horrible due to the extreme heat but rather than this the visit was mind-boggling. I would advise visiting this place during the winters as the heat won't stop you from enjoying the beauty of the place. Things not to do, if you are economical then please refrain yourself from ordering drinks and edibles from the cottage area as the price is too high. Get your drinks from outside and enjoy during the evening or the night hours as the beauty is incredible during that time."
Beautiful Beach,"This beach is north goa's pride,and mostly frequented by Europeans as well as Indians lots of water sports is there."
Over populated and full of litter ,As Goan beaches go Calangute Beach is not on of the better ones. Over populated and full of litter. Head further north or south for a better beach experience.
Over Crowded,"This beach is one of the most famous beach of North Goa but its over crowded. You can spend time seeing others, enjoying water sports & spending time with loved ones."
Beautiful Beach ,Much nice and less crowded beach then BAGHA beach. It's clean and lots of beach side restaurants. Foods are good with nominal price. Safe for foreigners. Lifeguards are available all the time.
"Big, clean but crowded!",Mostly we have visited the beach around sunset to have a chilled drink and food to go along. A very relaxing experience even while surrounded on all sides by revelers!
Crowded beach in north Goa!,It is one of the most famous beach other one is Baga beach in north Goa. Both beaches are in continuity to each other and continue southwards into Candolim and further down to Sinquerium beach. It is heavily crowded beach especially in the evenings. But not so crowded in early morning hours and in the late night.
Clean,Lovely beach with lots of sun beds and food shacks. Serving lots of different cuisine which you can eat inside or even have bought to your sunbed!!!!
Good facilities but dirty beach.,"Calangute is the main beach of Goa. You will get all the amneties here. It is the best place to buy showpiece, shorts and tshirt for near and dear ones at home or your own. Lots and lots of tattoo parlours are there. So this place witnesses very very heavy footfall of tourists. As a result it became dirty."
Calangute Beach,"Omnipresent Crowds from All Over India & Worldover, Budget Friendly Beach Front Resto-Bar-Cafe Shacks. Brightly Lit Up for Late Night Outs."
Crowded beauty,I'd say your trip to Goa is incomplete without going to this place. This is one amazing beach with lots of food options and water sports
Worst of the beaches we visited in Goa,"We have been to Goa multiple times and this beach continues to go downhill. We only visited it once on our last trip, as we had to pick up some jewellery later. We found the beach to be the dirtiest of the local beaches and we had far more trouble here with Indian men wondering up the beach videoing the women (it does really need cracking down on).I would definitely advise folk to use other beaches!"
Perpetually crowded!!,This beach is super crowded. It looks as if a beach festival is going on all the time. The road leading up to the beach is well lit up and lined with shops selling souvenirs and small restaurants n bars.
Beautifulüòçüíì,a very beautiful place for family & couples.Atmosphere is too good.Any time you can go.love with this place.
Just ok beach,Just ok beach . Only to be used for water activities. Rest hugely crowd always. So not suggestive for peace loving people.
Nice beach very popular with Indian holiday visitors .we prefer Baga beach which not far away. ,Calangute beach is very noisy otherwise it's ok .it's  safe to go and enjoy your self. We used there are lots of lifeguards to help and gide lots of lot gift shops and bars lots of English tourists
Great,"many restaurants , great weather , normal quality of food . these 3 were the points i could recognize"
Cleaner tha in the past,Plenty of shacks to choose from.make your own mind up on your favourite.take a leisurely walk along the beach and pop into any one
noisy and littered,"a great long beachwater choppy so lifeguards stop you going in too deep... safety great but constant whistle blowing stops peace as does all the bars competing with their load musicwatersports avaialble loungers avaialble with purchases from thr owning bar dogs and cows roaming around, they dont bother you unless you call them overlitter thrown everywhere and no attempt seen to be cleaned up.... but also little in the way of bins so not suprising so mich litter"
Holi celebration,A perfect beach for couples....full on masti... Dance.. Music... We went for holi celebration this yeqr and it was so fun...
Nice Trip ,Very nice beach neat clean beach beautiful place to visit Amazing shacks amazing food beautiful weather in March to visit
Most Popular Beach Of North Goa.,"Calangute Beach located about 20 km north of Goa‚Äôs capital, Panjim, is probably the most popular beach of North Goa. Calangute is a happening place with plenty of restaurants, resorts, beach shacks, markets, and casinos.The beach itself is always buzzing with activities like para-sailing, water-skiing, banana boat rides, and swimming. There is always a crowd of tourists on the beach, with the local populace joining in on the weekends. People like to enjoy a meal in one of the many beach shacks lining the beach. We would take a long morning walk on the clean sandy beach, which stretches for about 3 kilometers with Candolim Beach at the south end and Baga Beach at the north end. There are lifeguards always patrolling the beach in their red jeeps alerting people whether it is safe to swim or not. It gets very crowded in the evenings particularly at the time of sunset.It‚Äôs a good beach to watch the beautiful tropical sunsets."
Nice crowdy Beach,"Nice crowdy beach, All foods and drinks are available, lots of shop near parking area, Nice place to enjoy"
Good beach though gets a bit loud at night,"Calangute is one of the most popular beaches for tourists and it shows in the high footfall here. Very easy to reach with taxis and autos always available. There is a beautiful photo point created on the beach and you have to click there. The beach has got all water sports activities and many shacks. However, the loud music at night in the shacks might put off some people."
Really a awesome beach for visting during goa tour,"Cool beach with all necessary requirements. restras on beach, near by markets, hotels etc. enjoys alot."
Good beach,We visited in march..i find it good..u will find good no of people here..water sports are cheaper than other beaches...its amazing at night with shacks and all..one can sit and relax on subed for good no of hours...closer to many attractions n good restaurants..
Nice Enough Beach,Nice enough beach. The beach itself is mostly clean but behind the beach has a lot of litter. There are lots of shacks to choose from and the food and drink is very reasonably priced. You do get the odd lady begging with children working her way along the shacks.
Really enjoyable and clean,Good indian crowd. crowded place. very well for enjoyment. but if you need peace then better to go to other beach. this beach is superb to enjoy in Indian Crowd. Foreigners are also visiting this place. Superb for night walk and DJ night with drink and dinner. Water sports are also available
One of the best ones in Goa,"Strongly recommended for its cleanliness, and atmosphere. Stays lively till late in the night, with constant vigilance."
Exelent,"Very good stay, very helpfuland friendly  staff. Nice food in Resturent. Good support frend office staffs. Thank you amit and  anoob"
Beautiful beach,Beach was good and clean but little bit crowded.You get all watersports facilities here and restaurent are also available.
Crowded but good,A very good  flat beach but draws huge crowd. Guess everyone who makes a trip to Goa ends up at this beach. They have a lot of water sports at this beach. Large number of beach shacks around. Very touristic place so if you are looking for a quiet place to laze around this is definitely not the place. They do have place to changeover and bath nearby. There are lifeguards at this beach.
A MUST GO PLACE....,A lovely stretch from Candolim-Calanagute-BagaI walked first day from Calangute-Candolim along the water and next day from Calangute to Baga.A very happening place with shacks serving amazing food and loud music for people in groups to freek out dancing...Always visit the place whenever I'm in Goa...
Great beach MUST VISIT ‚ÄòSEA FACE‚Äô,"Lovely beach, crazy sea. Waves that do not quit... we had such a laugh in the water! We loved it!Also we found a lovely little shack called ‚Äòsea face‚Äô big shout out to Ganesh and Camila.. couldn‚Äôt do enough for us. Tom & Emily"
Calangute beach,"Nice beach , could be fabulous if it was managed properly, can be a llittered with plastics and empty bottles at times and usually quite busy. Nice beach shacks serving drinks and food , they will cater for all tastes"
Great beach,"This basically is the same beach as Baga Beach , the 'two' beaches being connected and forming together one very long stretch of sandy beach ! The Calangute part of the beach seems busier , especially with locals from the indian middle class ! A lot of restaurants , bars and shacks - and a lot of watersports on offer !"
Good beach,"Calangute beach is located in a town Calangute in North Goa. The beach is the largest in North Goa and visited by thousands of domestic and international tourists alike. The peak tourist season is during Christmas and New Year, and during the summer in May. During the monsoon season, from June through September, the sea can be rough and swimming is prohibited. The beach offers water sports activities like parasailing and water skiing, among others"
Awful Dump,"Only in India can the local government take a fairly nice place & dis-organise it so that it becomes a dirty, smelly crowded dump.They have NO consideration for the people who have spent so much of their savings to come to Goa.And then they complain, every year, that it's not so busy as last year.Cheaper & cleaner in Thailand!"
Very crowded and fully commercial beach,"This is the famous beach among Indian tourists and is crowded with vendors on foot trying to sell you items so if you wish to relax then i would say better avoid and head to North Goa Morjim beach, Vagator beach.Shacks are plenty but the quantity served is less for the price charged it makes you realize you are paying for the beach front view and sitting.You have plenty of restaurants and food joints and shopping area which you cross to reach this beach. This is famous for Nightlife having many clubs.For water sports this is the beach to land for."
Our visit,We stayed at the Calangute Beach hotel behind the beach! Scenery was very beautiful although It may get a little dirty because the beach is right in front. My family and I went banana boating and also food at the beach was Amazing!!!!
Calangute,"Good beach views , small beach near the ibis styles. Lots more visitors at evening through out the night. Beach side affordable liquor, beers and food is available. Enjoyed a lot"
Nice beach,A very busy beach surrounded with markets for shopping and restaurants and shacks and many options for water sports. It was very hot even in dec so carry lots of sunscreen and hat and sunglasses.
MR Alan Buck,The beaches and shacks all that ive used have free wifi sun beds all clean and tidy majority of the beaches are fairly easy to access and as long as you eat or drink in the shack the beds are free if not there is a sure charge but as most people spend the whole day on there you always use them for food and drink anyway
Very lively - watch the scams!!,"A great long stretch of sand - perfect for a long walk but very very crowded - full of Indians who run around like lunatics as if they‚Äôve never seen the sea before - you rarely see one swimming - they just sit fully clothed in the water whooping with delight .It‚Äôs quite charming really especially when they ask you for a photo.BEWARE ‚Äî the boats that promise to take you out for 300 rupees and will have you sitting there with a buoyancy aid on until they fill up ‚Äî then they‚Äôll go a few hundred yards and come back - - a rip off even at that price .Also watch for the ‚Äú there‚Äôs something in your ear‚Äù men ‚Äî just keep walking .Also there‚Äôs a very big difference between the good shacks in terms of food quality service and prices and the not so good ones where the staff don‚Äôt seem to care .You‚Äôll be pestered every few yards by the spotters trying to get your custom,Swimming safety seems to be ok and there are lifeguards scattered along the beach but I would advise not to venture beyond your depth especially when the tide‚Äôs turned .Enjoy it - it‚Äôs chaotic and vibrant but be careful !"
Very nice - Must visit if youre in GOA,"It‚Äôs really awesome beach with kind peoples. Good sea food. I did water rides there and enjoyed a lot. Water hight level is also very good, people can go long (but no too much) with no fear. One thing i observed which should be improved, the cleanness, which is responsiblity of local public & visitors to do not throw any eatable iteams,bottles to the beach place.Overall i and my wife had a great experience of calanguate beach, we spent much time there."
Calangute beach,This beach is located to the north of Goa and is a popular beach. It is a hit with the locals and has lot of shacks available where you can chill and relax.
very  neat and serene,"very neat well kept enjoyed  going  there twice  with family, the people at  shacks were  good, enjoyed  playing  in  the  water the  security guards  were   always on the vigil"
Average in comparision to South beaches,"The beach is quite vast but over crowded and unkempt. You may find litter all around, and the crowd also seems least bothered. You may find families, couples, groups as well as kids mostly here. There are a lot of local shops and eateries here which are good for engaging in an evening stroll."
Good beach but could have been better,This is more happening beaches of North Goa. Almost all facilities are there for sports and other recreation. It is much rush and connected to other beach like Bagga. But I observe no facility to wash oneself once have sea bath. Ok type.
Stay at and visit of Calangute beach,"Early morning in darkness, visit of the Calangute beach was blissful. Moonlit sky with cool breeze and very few people jogging in the beach gives a refreshing feel. In the evening plenty of people move around this popular beach. One can relax and enjoy food in the sacks built in the season time on the beach."
Nice beach,"Very easy to have an excellent time at the Beach. Just pick a shack and then You can relax the whole day. You will be well taken care off. If you‚Äôre an western then don‚Äôt be afraid if you‚Äôre asked to take some selfies with some Indians, they really like it."
Lovely party place,"Everything is beautiful here, fantastic people everywhere, yummy food, good streetshopping.you can find everything here from car on rent to massage to food to hats to yummy food to bars."
Very Noisy and overcrowded.,Some people will like this beach. But my wife and I didn't as it was very crowded and noisy. The narrow streets were very busy with cars and motorcycles and people trying to avoid getting hit.
Nice and clean heach,"A nice and clean beach with a lot of decent restaurants and activities.Not too crowded, at least not when we visited."
Wonderful beach.,"It‚Äôs a loverly beach with the same issues as I have seen all around India and that‚Äôs far to much rubbish just discarded. From what I have seen it is mainly the Indians on holiday as they go to the shops buy cheap drink and just leave it where ever they finish it, it‚Äôs really not there fault so much as it‚Äôs everywhere. The Goans are trying there very best to get on top of it however it‚Äôs will take more than a few woman picking up litter, it needs to be educated in schools as well as villages"
Crowdy ,Beach is very crowdy. It's not scenaric. You can try some shopping options after some bargaining though.
"Nice walk, nice water, nice beaches","Here we can enjoy swimming, the water is perfect warm and clean, it s busy, but so big , there is a lots of place for everyone. Nice in the morning and beautiful for the sunset. Jogging is also really appropriate and appreciate there. We can not swim everywhere, but there some spots for. We really enjoy this paradise atmosphere, and very nice to see how the sea a new adventure for the Indians is..."
Beach,Fab beach. Sea a bit choppy so need to be careful. Lifeguards constantly watching. We used the love shack sun beds. Ronnie & Samir was very good to us making sure we ok for food drinks & shade
Great beach,Miles and miles of itBeer is cheap as chips and water is crystal clear.Can get busy but still great.
Totally overcrowded and the noise is horrendous,"Its unbelievable the life guards are constantly up and down the beach in old 4x4 with a siren and loud haler telling the Indian people to get out of the water, you are approached by gangs of males asking for you to have a selfie with them. the static patrols are constantly blowing whistles to get people out of the water it drives you mad. calangute  beach is the same as Blackpool 20 years ago.The problem is a lot of the Indian people on the beach cant swim and have never been to a beach so it total mayhem with adults throwing wet sand at each other for hours on end screaming at everybody it a shame a lot has change in 20 years unfortunately not for the better"
Most crowded beach in Goa,"The is most re-known beach in Goa. The beach is much flat and safe. Lots of beach activities available here. Restaurant, Bar, Shopping all are available here. To me the beach was more attractive at early morning and also the sunset view of awesome from Calangute beach. As the beach is little over crowded so it is bit dirty. The lifeguards are much active, they don't allow anyone to be in water after sunset. I have seen some stupid crowd around, who really stare bikini women badly. but so far I have found this beach much safe."
Disappointed,"This beach is so disappointing, 20 years ago this beach was clean with no litter and no beach shacks.The sea is polluted, with ALL types of RUBBISH including sanitary products/ nappies & broken glass.People need to take responsibility for their own rubbish, TAKE IT HOME"
Over crowded,"This is the beach everyone visits in Goa. Water sports. Sunset shacks nightlife. Localities , tourists and visitors everyone visit here. During long weekends this place is over crowdy. Water sports can be done at other beaches too."
"Nice Beach, Happening But Crowded",One of the most popular beach. Sand is great. Shacks have continous music playing and it seems every Shack is competing against other one on Music Volume..!!  Great place to hang out though ..!!  Finding a peaceful place on Beach will be challenge with lot of people around ..!! Beach to go to have fun n chill !!
Crowded!!,Visited to witness sunset with a toddler. It attracts huge crowd all the time! Water sports are available in this beach! I was impressed with the beach authorities that they were making sure everyone is out of water by 6pm! Huge waves were there.. so i recommend those who know swimming should swim.. kids should enjoy water in presence of their parents..There are lot of shacks available for foodies! Although we are vegetarians so we tried 'Sagar pure veg restaurant' just outside the beach...I must say food was delicious!! Beware of parking area.. we noticed they were trying to fool people by charging them extra! There are all types of hop on shops around the beach for shopaholics!! Good beach!! Those who wants to purchase beach wear or cloths suitable for goa should purchase them in and around the beaches.. u can get good cloths for reasonable prices! Bargaining is the key!
Busy in parts,"We like it on the beach but never sit at the central point‚Äî- it gets really busy and can be quite dirty there,we always go a bit further on towards covalim,it‚Äôs quieter and the beach shacks there are all have very good wi fi."
Too dirty,This beach is too dirty and crowded. total waste of time. I suggest you should go to baga beach.....
A very lively beach,"Calangute Beach, is lovely and sandy with some great shacks to eat and drink in.Parts of it are terribly busy, particularly areas around where the water sports are. There are hundreds of Indians having fun in the sea, a lot of whom are fully clothed! Many of these come up and ask to have 'Selfies' taken with you (If you're white) I found this quite novel and didn't feel threatened at all; however I can see how unnerving this may be for some people, particularly women on their own.Other areas have hardly any people in them at all, so it's not difficult to avoid the crowds,At night many of the shacks light up and are a great/cheap place to eat, thankfully not all of them have loud banging music.Sadly, there is quite a lot of waste on the beach and also dog/cow faeces from the many stray dogs and cows that roam around."
Beautiful beach,I happen to attend a marriage of my friend in Goa with my friends. next day evening we went to calungute beach which is about 10km from panaji bus stand. It's one of the cleanest beach in Goa. We totally enjoyed our beach party.
Happening Beach,This is the second most happening beach in North Goa .. Not a very peaceful place but worth a visit .. Water sports is in abundance here .. Nice restaurents around too ...
The Goan vibe ,"Beautiful and clean beach. Lots of activities like banana boat ride, para sailing etc. sand is a bit even here and you might find a sudden ditch when you wade into water.Lots of shacks with awesome food."
lovely sandy beach. loads of shacks serving good food and drink.,"I personally wouldn't risk children going into the sea as the waves can get pretty high and strong. I saw many an adult lose their sunglasses, hats and even bikini tops."
Good for Water Sports,This beach is an extension of Baga beach.Mostly it is very crowded.It is good for water sports as you can get good deals here.
Amazingly clean this time of the year,"Was pleasantly surprised to see that the place which is normally crowded like hell was quite clean and wasn't as crowded. Overall, it was a very good visit."
Dirty and crowded,"I would not recommend this beach for families with small kids. It is crowded with single adults (mostly men), the sand has motor oil stains and boats taking tourists for rides come up very close to the swimming areas."
Cleansed daily,"Beautiful sand and a warm sea, but be careful getting out beyond the breaking waves as they do come in strongly and can knock you off your feet. Recommend Pedros beach shack for cheap meals and Prince of Tides for cheap but well organised tours round India. ¬£20 -30 cheaper than Thomas Cook for exactly the same guide and tour."
Beaches if North Goa,The most popular beach...Very crowdedmusic and shacks aroundBut beach is good but not exoticFamily and friends fun Beach
lovely beach with great choice of beach shacks,Spent every day relaxing at Dominos Beach shack. the sea breeze was a welcome relief from the intense heat of the sun.
Another of the most crowded beaches in North Goa,Its the most dirty and crowded beach in north goa. Avoid it if you want to have some peaceful time near the sea. Go for candolim.
perfect gateway,"would spend the whole day in the beach after our morning breakfast till the dawn . There r tons of people who would offer foot massage etc, reasonable n good"
Good place,A nice placeGood food is available at the beach but it is expensive.Its a very crowded beach and the area is not very clean
Lovely,Wow what a beach I love the Goa beaches but this one is beautiful I love the sunset and cleanliness of the beach
idyllic. beware of the cows.,"short walk from the hotel finds you on this beach, which is absolutely lovely. However !!! be aware of the children on the way to the beach who surround you and seem to be very delightful and want to greet you and shake your hands. Please be aware that sun tan lotion which makes your hands slippy and rings on fingers are easy targets as we found out to our cost. Great quiet beach however the cows do wander onto the beach, and be aware of the huge crabs that reside in the sand !"
Outdoor beach experience ,Had a wonderful time ..beach was busy but very clean Enjoyed the watersports. Had a great experience
Sunset And Football ,Every evening when i went to beach it‚Äôs soo awesome we play football with my goan friends enjoy the sunset while playing football
Nice beach,Beach was nice and you can get very good photos there at sunrise. In morning you get samosa tea here. Must visit
Good for relaxing,"The beach is good for relaxing and enjoying the sea.  A number of water sports are available for adventurous tourists. Also there are a number of shacks, the employees of which try to keep the area clean."
Very crowded ,If you really want to enjoy this beach then be away from parking area and stay away from water sports area because beach around holiday streat is good and near Bagga area is also ok
noisy in the evening,The beach is dotted with lots of restaurants and bars of various hues. Almost all restaurants play music in high decibel to attract tourist and as a result the cacophony of sound disturbs the mood to relax. As it is a happening beach with approach roads full of shops selling wares of interest to tourists so the crowd.
Nice beach.,"Love this beach lots of beach shacks. The only problem is that holiday makers as discarding beer bottles, plastic and any other rubbish into the sea. We found broken beer bottles in the sea daily. This was very dangerous and made me worried about going into the sea."
Calangute Beach ???,"Arrived Dec2 2018  the dirtiest beach I've ever seen , it's used by domestic tourist as a place to abuse , broken bottles , dirty nappies ! food cartons , worst of all the contents of there stomach , disgusting . Things changed after many complaints in early Jan2019 , police on the beach, cleaners on the beach , threat of fines for the people responsible for the decline of genuine tourist , May this long continue , KEEP ABUSE OFF THE BEACHES ."
Best Beach in Goa,"This beach seems to be the best beach in Goa. There is a huge market in between the parking place and the beach, which is a great attraction for the tourists. The beach is Sandy and neat and clean. We all enjoyed the waves and loved going inside  water. The water front is quite long. Some of us preferred to have a long walk along the beach. The breeze was cool enough to counter the effect of the hot sun at arround 2 PM. The visit to calangute beach was enjoyable."
Beach bit crowded,"Its not lonely beach like south goa, bit crowded beach with many foreigners and you can enjoy delicious food with wine."
Beautiful beach spoiled by party goers,Visitors needs to have self conciousness atleast before throwing garbage in open beach and spoiling the beauty of this beach.Good beach but with lots of garbage .
very crowded beach,"very crowded beach although a very famous beach in north goa, attracts many tourists... but too crowded"
Over crowded and ridden with rubbish,"Dirty and overcrowded, sunbeds side by side with no breathing space. The sand was laden with rubbish from domestic Indian tourists and this got worse over the New Year period."
lovely beach,lovely beach plenty of sun beds and loads of shacks offering great food at low prices fishermans was our favourite.
Too crowded,The main calangute beach is too crowded.we stayed on calangute beach but in the southern part which is Tivai.It's wonderful silent and one good place to be.
Full Enjoy...,"Calangute beach is best place for enjoy in goa. Calangute beach and baga beach is twins beaches. Hear you can come with your family. But this is open for all, so you know all types of peoples come here. So just be aware.... But yes this is best place in goa"
