Iceland Ring Road,"Just came back from trip to Iceland. Started at Blue Lagoon (it was great and lots of fun), to ReykjavÃ­k for 3 days and then counterclockwise on the the Ring Road. We detoured for one night in Arnarstapi to see sights in the SnÃ¦fellsnes peninsula (amazing). The Ring Road is easy driving as long as you keep eyes on road with some easy switchbacks or no super steep mountain passes. Having said that, most of the time there are no guard rails, the road tends to be up above 8-12 feet above ground (we saw two cars and an 18-wheeler that gone off the side) and as long as you donâ€™t hit a snow storm - which we did. Drove for 1.5 hours in heavy snow, sometimes losing control of the car. Needless to say, drove very slow. Halfway into it, plows were clearing one side of the road so we were driving on the cleared opposite side until we saw cars coming our way, moved over and continued. I am from Miami and not used to mountain driving and I did fine. The Ring Road takes you through some of the most beautiful landscapes I have ever seen: lava fields covered in moss, fjords, mountains, valleys - endless views. I would do it again in a heart beat. Hope this helps anyone planning. Iâ€™ll be glad to share more info."
Easy drive,"So much to see, easy to navigate and we drove round in our rental. Great first day on  the road then we moved onto Road 1 and circumnavigate Iceland."
Tour choices,"If you plan to take a ring road tour, I recommend that you go with Arctic Adventures instead of Gadventures(G). G uses Arctic Adventures to run their tours in Iceland. Arctic Advenutures own tours are cheaper & better. The Best of Iceland 7-day tour from Gadventures is actually 5 days of touring. In contrast, the 6-day Around Iceland Adventure from Arctic Adventures(A) gives you full 6 days of guided touring, goes to more places, includes the glacial hike in the price and is cheaper (even accounting for 2 extra nights of lodging from Gadventures). There are two things that G tour has but A does not have is Bogarfjorour and Solheimar Ecovillage. To go to Bogarfjorour(B) means a detour with poor roads and it adds little to the trip. B is for seeing puffins & hiking. Puffins are gone after mid-August. Among the 100-110 Solheimar residents, only 45 are disabled. They get social benefits from the government. This type of visit is not the same as supporting a place in a 3rd world country. In my opinion these two items make the G tour even less appealing than the A tour."
The longest ever ðŸ˜…,Easy road for driving . Just rent a car and drive away . Easy and comfortable to drive there . But you need to get rest because very long .
"Gorgeous, non windy road!","I get major motion sickness and this road isn't too windy. You can drive all of Ring Road in around 20 hours. You'll have plenty of options for hiking and adventures along the road to stop along the way. They don't have a lot of gas options on the north side of the country so be sure to stop whenever you can to get gas. We really liked the Southern part of Iceland along Ring Road because that seem to have more adventure options for us.All in all, beautiful and a well maintained road."
Scenic Adventure,"The land of fire and ice kept us amazed. We saw glaciers, entered a lava tube cave, walked on black sand beaches, watched sheep cross the road, hiked around stunning waterfalls, and saw landscapes that looked like other planets."
Ring Road - Tips from August 2019 Visit,"We drove counter-clockwise starting from the Golden Circle sites. Many travelers only head to these places so they are more populated.  Once you start driving east, the crowds diminish significantly.Do the math and figure out if you want to rent from the airport or from places near Reykjavik.  We had a car service to/from and rented from Enterprise near the cruise ship terminal. I cannot imagine driving or parking in the downtown area.Our car rental included a wi-fi hotspot  - this was helpful for making phone calls.           The Lonely Planet publishes a guide that goes counter-clockwise.  This is an excellent resource and we highly recommend.Plan your hotels/camp spots in advance, you will be grateful that you did.Watch your gas tank. There are long stretches with no services available, especially on the east coast. The N1, Olis and other stations have basic hot food (hot dogs, burgers, soup, ice cream) at reasonable prices.  Plan ahead if you expect to want food/alcohol.  The ""Vinbudin"" stores that sell beer/wine close at 6 pm (1800).  When we were staying at Myvatn, the closest one was in Husavik (50 mins away). Similarly, stop for food supplies at Bonus or other grocery stores to save money. They close around 6:00 as well.  We did bring some snacks from home.  You can buy fruit pretty much everywhere.Our hotel restaurants were on the pricier side - often the only option there was a full dinner.  That's not always what you need - but in many cases may be the only option available.  Again, plan ahead on this.  Oh - and don't expect ice or microwaves.Many places sell outerwear basics but they are pricier than bringing your own.  Don't forget hat, gloves, sunglasses, binoculars.This is a well maintained two-lane road (you know that) that regularly goes to one lane on bridges.  Minimal (if any) shoulder.  We saw 1-2 police cars in 8 days. Other than Reykjavik and Akureyri, there was only 1 stoplight.Use Google maps instead of GPS.  Know where your hotels/restaurants/sites are - although there are signs, you often cannot ""see"" the building where you are heading (example - turned off for restaurant; drove up the road, saw farmhouse, then tractor barn --- the restaurant was next to the barn).There are sheep everywhere and can be a hazard in the darkness.There is a tunnel near Akureyri that requires a toll be paid within 3 hours of exiting - no attendants there.  You pay the toll online.  This is not difficult.Our trip was Sunday-Sunday. We felt we had time to see just about everything.  We also were lucky to have good weather for much of the trip."
Absolutely amazing road trip - what an adventure!  14 day ring road trip by campervan,"There is plenty of advice on trip advisor on where to go and what to do in Iceland but I thought travelers might find it helpful to hear how we planned our two week road trip.  We've been to Reykavik before, but this was amazing and I would highly recommend it, but you need to plan to make the most of it.  We hired a camper van and it fit our needs perfectly.  We could do what we wanted when we wanted and we were not tied to hotel bookings.  Campsites are generally good.  We bought an Iceland Camping Card (E150) which allows you to camp in multiple campsites around the ring road and saved loads of money.  No need to book ahead, just turn up and park.  It was perfect.  The ring road is absolutely fine to drive on, but you need to take it steady if you want to look after your motorhome!  Day 1 - Arrived at 15:30 in Keflavik airport.  Short 10 minute shuttle to Camper Iceland to pick up the camper van (see separate review), then to Bonus Supermarket for a quick essential shop (Supermarkets close at 18:00-19:00) and we camped at Vogar for the night.Day 2 - Proper food shop then on to the Golden Circle - Stayed at Skjol campsite which sells fantastic pizza!Day 3 - Fludir Secret Lagoon (Gamla Laugin).  Lovely thermal lagoon to bath in.  First one of four we did on our trip! Stocked up on food and fuel at Selfoss then on to the Lava volcano and Earthquake centre.  Stayed at Langbrok campsite which was probably the worst one we stayed at, but ok for a night.Day 4 - Waterfalls today - Skogafoss, Seljalandsfoss then on to the rock formations at Reynisfjara/Dyrholaey.  Stayed at Kleifar-Mork.  Basic site, but has a pretty waterfall.Day 5 - Long driving day but WOW!  Vatnajokull National Park - Svartifoss falls, Then on to Jokulsarlon Lagoon to see Icebergs breaking off the glacier.  We took a rib boat trip out to the glacier with Ice Lagoon.  Brilliant.  Over the road is Diamond Beach - so pretty.  Then 30 minutes further on the ring road to a hot-pot at Hoffellsjokull Glacier.  Great!  No camping card sites here so paid Â£32 to stay at Hofn.  Refuel and food shop.Day 6 - Another long drive day - the scenery is amazing, glaciers/waterfalls at every turn.  Stopped at Djupivogur - a few gift shops but not much else. On the long drive we spotted a hot pot at the side of the road!  Pulled over and jumped in! Stayed at Reydarfjorder campsite which was lovely.Day 7 - Egilsstadir - Food shop and fuel.  Then on to Vok Baths. Only just opened and beautiful thermal spa on a lake. (Better than Myvatn).  Waterfalls at Selfoss and Dettifoss.  no camping card sites so campsite at Myvatn (Bjarg) very expensive at Â£50, but beautiful views of the lake.Day 8 - Volcanic day!  Spent the day visiting all the volcanic sites in the Krafla area.  Amazing. (Viti, Hverir, Leirhnjukar) then had a soak in Myvatn Thermal Spa. We've been to blue lagoon before, so tried this one this time and it wasn't as good - but its much cheaper.  We preferred Vok Baths which was about the same price as Myvatn.  Stayed at Heidarbaer campsite.Day 9 - On to Husavik for whale watching!  WOW. Lots of companies do whale watching here but we went on a RIB with Husavik Adventures and they were brilliant.  Watched 3 humpback whales for an hour! Beautiful sunny day so ate outside at a restaurant in Husavik, then on to Godafoss Waterfall.  Travelled to Akureyri and stayed at Lonsa campsite just north of the town. Day 10 - Shopping in Akureyri in the morning (OK, but not great), filled up on fuel and food then on to Varmahlid for White Water Rafting with Viking Rafting.  Again, an amazing experience!  Booked a meal there - the food is great! Stayed at Hvammstangi - great campsite.Day 11 - Swimming pool at Hvammstangi which had hot tubs, then on to the Seal Centre.  You can go on trips to do seal watching, but we choose not to and pushed on to Varmaland campsite.Day 12 - Borgarnes - Settlement Centre Museum was brilliant insight in to the Vikings settling Iceland.  We then spent the afternoon on a hike to Glymur Waterfall which was challenging.  Needed a shower so chose to drive to Vogar campsite south of Reykavik (after a Dominos Pizza at Mosfellbaer Â£60 for four adults) as we knew it had good facilities. (Not all campsites have showers - you go to the swimming pools)Day 13 - Reykavik - we've been before in winter but it was nice to go on a hot day!  Ice-creams and T-shirts!  Gift shopping then on to the Perlan Centre.  You can easily park a motorhome at the University of Iceland.  Free and only 10-15 mins walk to the cathedral which you can see from the car park.  Also short drive to the Perlan Centre from there which was great. Stayed at Vogar again!Day 14 - No rush to get off the campsites in Iceland.  Spent the morning packing, cleaning the van, refueling and then returned the motorhome to Camper Iceland.  Booked a night at the Nordic Guest House (same building as Camper Iceland) so we could just unload straight in to our room.  Great!  Went shopping for food for the journey home/ate in a local restaurant etc.Day 15 - Shuttle to airport - Home!Iceland is expensive so to help you plan, we spent Â£363.44 on food at supermarkets for 4 adults for two weeks.  We took what we could in our suitcases to keep costs down.  Bonus and Kronan are cheapest. You just need to check the price as you shop and adjust where you can.  We ate well.  We had four meals out, spending Â£359.81 (again 4 adults eating).We travelled 2040 kilometres and spent Â£329.43 on fuel.  We had a large 6 bed diesel camper so fuel costs will be lower for smaller vehicles.The best guide book I bought was the Lonely Planet's Ring Road guide.  Take a good road map too, our sat-nav did not recognize some of the locations and a map helps you plan. Enjoy your trip!  It's amazing and we will go back to do the Snaefellness Peninsula and the Western Fjords next time as we didn't have time this holiday!"
Broke it up,Had an 8 day trip in Iceland.   Core of it around Ring Road and Glacier Lagoon.   Rented from Blue Car and totally had a great experience.
Hertz car hire from airport terrible.... queued 2 hours for a booked car through bentours,Great flight over from Bergen. When we arrived at Iceland airport we thought we would be able to get our ore arranged car fairly quickly..... no didnâ€™t happen. Have now been in a queue for 2 hours and am still 4 people away from front of queue.
"If you have any change, you should go for it","Just completed Ring Road trip in 7 days, including visit to central Iceland high land area. This schedule was tight, but still doable, however I would recommend to use few more days for the trip as there is so much to see. You also need to plan your trip carefully beforehand as you need to sleep in little villages and there might be limited amount of sleeping facilities or guided tours available. Planning is also needed to spot all interesting sights around the trip and especially in the north part of the Iceland, many places are missing from the TripAdvisor. Also some places are dislocated (pinned to wrong place) in TripAdvisor, so it might be tricky to find if only TA is used for navigation."
Amazing experience done in 8 days easily!,"We visited Iceland in June and easily did the ring road in 8 whole days! We stayed at another town every night and it was all worth it! I think itâ€™s the best way to really experience Iceland  and to get to see beaches and waterfalls that are not filled with tourists! The south side was my favorite but I have to admit that on the north side I felt like we were the only tourists, it made me feel local:)"
Out of this world!,"We did the Ring Road trip over 10 days and 9 nights (if you can call it night) between May and June!  We picked up a rental 2WD car at KEF and started this excursion following mostly the Ring Road in an anti-clockwise direction. We had no plans and did not do any off road driving, hence there was no need for a 4WD. What an amazing and wonderful country! Magnificient falls, surreal landscapes, beautiful snow capped mountains and coastlines, glaciers, hot springs, geysirs, lava fields, lagoons, diamond beach, quaint small towns and villages etc in this land of ice and fires! Our journey was during the shoulder period. And yet there are already quite some tourists. There is long hours of daylight and even from 11 pm to 3 am the sky remains relatively bright!Driving was quite easy for most of it and even when it snows. The only exception was the drive along Route 862 between Dettifoss to VatnajÃ¶kull National Park, where it was extremely treacherous on the narrow gravel road because of the heavy snowfall then.This country certainly is out of this world and experiencing the beauty of it just through the Ring Road made it lives up to its reputation!"
Access to the whole island,"Driving on the ring road is easy and it is generally in excellent condition. The road will take you past all the wonderful parts of Iceland. During our trip in early June, there were many days when we seldom saw another car!"
Spectacular Tour of Iceland,"Our family free and easy tour of Iceland quote name ""Ring Road of Fire and Ice"" from 29 May to 7 June, 2019 arranged by Iceland Advice was spectacular and fabulous. We drove in a Nissan X-Trial in comfort. Satarted from Revkjavik to Western than to North round trip to Eastern and Southern back to Revkjavik in 9 days. We got to see and feel and engaged with the country's landscape and geological transformation from volcanic activities millions of years ago, picturesque villages, farm land, glaciers, icebergs, beaches and the beautiful coast lines, geothermal fields and geysers, waterfalls, lava fields etc all extra ordinary spectacular sights. We stayed at great hotels with beautiful scenery and ambience and comfortable. We ate good local foods and seafoods and enjoyed every bit. We even had a open air bath under 1 degree C in  geothermal bath an magnificient experience and joy of doing something different. It was a great family holidays and our 6+ years old granddaughter and all of us enjoyed the tour of Iceland..cheers."
Do it,"If you planing to spend a week+ in Iceland. You must do Ring Road. Beautiful view around every corner. We did it in a week, but it's a bit of a stretch. Allow 10 days to do it in the normal pace with most POIs. We rented car with a local company Lagoon Rental and had no problem with pickup and return. We stayed in cabins and small hotels along the road and it was nice a fun. Make sure you plan ahead and have good GPS (google maps did good for us). Skip the tool tunnel around Akuery, it will take you 15 longer, but the road around is beautiful and worth 15 min detour (also will save you money on tolls and car rentals fee)."
Well maintained!,"The ring road and most of the main roads to tourist attractions are well maintained. Yes, a few potholes but considering the hammering the roads take from the severe and extreme weather conditions, these roads are great. Snow of about 3-4 inches fell overnight and the roads were cleared early in the morning, even on top of the mountains. Safe to travel as long as you drive sensibly. Just beware of some idiots on the road. One Chinese-looking lady tourist coming the other way insisted on driving in the middle of the road and almost caused a head on collision. Stupid woman, what was she thinking?"
The best way to get around,Almost everywhere you need to get to in Iceland involves using the ring road. It is a good road which in the most part is single carriageway with the occasional dual carriageway. The only issue is the 90 kph (56 mph) speed limit. It is there for good reason due to the weather conditions but it takes an age to get anywhere.
7 day Iceland trip!!,"It was a 7 day road trip across Iceland and we were all bowled over with the incredible scenic beauty of this place. Iceland has such diverse landscapes that every 5 mins, things just change. I could see the sunrise, sunset, moonrise and moonset on all days that I was here."
Quick Bathroom Stop,"Go around back for a clean bathroom/rest room/water closet.  What a site as you look through your windshield pass the wipers. The ponds filled with fresh water, volcanic rock, brown ground cover, and the land are breathtaking.  When driving, you should check the road conditions and wind speed, especially near the glaciers.  Burrr!"
9 day Ring Road tour,"My husband and I plus 2 teenage grandsons toured Iceland on the Ring Road in early August.  The varying topography was fascinating.  Everything glaciers, volcanic black sand beaches, waterfalls, hot springs, and mud bubbling out of the ground kept our rapt attention."
Great experience in driving Ring Road but not with the CampEasy Campervan rental,"It was great to do Ring Road while I was in Iceland. Iâ€™d suggest not to drive if you have no experience in Icelandic winter especially if you were rented a campervan. I myself have no experience in driving on icy road and strong wind not to say that campervan is very vulnerable to WIND! Ring road is pretty easy to drive on while thereâ€™s no wind, no snow, no ice and no storm but not when thereâ€™s one of the mentioned conditions. The wind was so strong that I almost got blown off the cliff (no hyperbole) especially there is little or no rail on the east coast. Please check the weather and road condition before youâ€™re on the road to your destination. Donâ€™t risk your life in seeing the beauty of the Mother Nature, itâ€™s not worth it. Moreover, if you insist to rent a campervan please do not rent with CampEasy. They will rip you off when you cause a small damage on the car. Well, to be fair to the staff who is working there, he was very good and polite. Iâ€™ve no problem with the staff. But not when I returned my campervan with a small dent and cracked taillight due to the narrow street in ReykjavÃ­k city, I have to pay 300,000ISK which is equivalent to ~â‚¬2300. I understand that Iâ€™ve to pay that much if I cause any damage on the car and I was told that they will reimburse me with the extra that I have paid (if any)after they have it fixed. I received an email from them an hour ago saying that they will not reimburse me. I couldnâ€™t believe that it cost â‚¬2300 for a small dent. I could fix it with less than â‚¬1000. As a reminder, please buy a full protection and ask for all the details what is covered and whatâ€™s not. They sent me an invoice with no CDW and theft insurance on it which is ridiculous cause I was told that it is covered with these two insurances. Iâ€™m still waiting for their reply!"
Stunning scenery on the Iceland east coast road,"Stunning scenery.Hired a car from Egilsstadir airport and drove on the Ring Road both north and south.Be aware that there are many narrow single lane bridges and stretches of gravel road on the journey down to Jokulsarlon glacier lagoon.Also, sheep can be found wandering in the road so watch your speed.Gas stations are few and far between so fill up whenever you can."
"Enjoyed it, so busy","Loved the ring road, we rented a car and were able to take our time go see other things and avoid some of the crazy tourism. So beautiful!"
Awesome!,"The Ring Road goes clockwise from Reykjavik to Akureyri, Hofn and back to Reykjavik. It is paved, though not for the feint of heart. and hits most of the major highlights. Iceland may in fact be the land that gave birth to giants, ogres, trolls and wee people.  Very Tolkienesque!  Everyone and everywhere along the route is used to  serving tourists and nearly everyone speaks English exceptionally well.  We had an incredible trip and loved it.  If you go, get off the Ring Road and visit the Western fjords - Worth the experience!  Oh, and go off season Mid Sept - Mid May.  I would not want to be there in the summer.  Too many visitors & cruise ships!."
"five days, akeyuri to keflavik - clockwise - perfect","Driving half the ring road was just perfect for us - not too far, too many hours to drive every day, time to enjoy the trip - not a chore to ""do the ring road"".  We had one week in Iceland and chose to spend 2 nights in Reyjavik - that's enough but it was nice to do and get a feel of the capital - we would spend that time again.  Must say you could spend a few more days if you were so inclined but with one week, this was a good divide.We then chose to fly to Akeyuri (Icelands second largest city) and quite an inexpensive flight (and most certainly cheaper than fuel), hire a car and drive on clockwise to Myvatyn.  This was an easy option just a few hours.  We got there so ""early"" we decided to have lunch at our accommodation (Vogafoss farm - fabulous food - had breakfast, lunch and dinner - all excellent) and then head out to visit the geysir area and dettifoss before checking in officially.  A good move and gave us extra hours the next day.  We did not visit the Myvatyn baths as TA advises they are quite confected - decided on a nap after an early set off in Reyjavik.Day two - we drove to Seydisfjordur - a wonderful little town (must do - but could be ordinary if weather is ordinary) - loved it we drove in over the mountain range from Eglistaddir in massive sunshine and the whole town was out celebrating - they don't get too many days like this.  Loved our picinic lunch at the many public tables available (there is a supermarket there, not sure what they stock, we had our lunch bought in Eglistaddir where we bought fuel) - Good cafe - ""Salt"" - coffee, lunch, bathroom - excellent.  Accommodation at The Bank (Aldan Hotel) - super overpriced for what is on offer but clean, OK for one night, ate at the restaurant - fine, not excellent but not a lot of choices.  Their breakfast included in the tariff was good.Day Three - onto Hoffn - we drove the coast road and got a full on rainy day - such a shame as the scenery would have been outstanding we feel.  All the beat up of Hoffn is just that - a beat up - we stayed at Hotel Hofn - very tour bus orientated, clean, large, no vibe, fine for one night.  Breakfast was poor.  We did have lobster dinner at Pakhuus - we very much enjoyed it, expensive but worth it.  Good supermarket here.Day four - to Vik - stayed at Black Beach Suites - again expensive but worth it, new, lovely view - we cooked in for a change - great supermarket in Vik, if you are looking for a 2 day stop - make it here.  Day five - Gullfoss - stayed at Hotel Gullfoss - staff ordinary, rooms clean and roomy enough, motel like, 2 standards here , new/old - luckily we got new.  The big win for this hotel is the location - enables an early morning visit to the falls - we thought these falls best of whole trip, with few people in attendance before the tour buses arrive from Reyjavik as day tours - evening meal disgusting and super expensive, but not sure what you can do about this.In summary we were very happy with our choice of route, and our choices of stops.  We would like to add if you have a bit of adventure or have more time than we did to do homework, or have more information from TA than we did, we would encourage you to do some of these stops at farmstays - we would have if we had known about them.Farmstays are EVERYWHERE and OFTEN and many of the farms are HUGE enterprises but maybe a bit out of the towns (not that they are so big) - apparently many offer dinner bed and breakfast.  If we were ever to do this again, we would certainly do a few of these along the way.  In some ways we are disappointed not to have experienced this (and they may [or may not] be a cheaper stay option).Would also like to add - driving this road in 2nd week August - easy, safe, barely any traffic, ignore any other commentary, don't panic, don't need a 4wd, dont need waterproof shoes, etc, etc - too many negatives around for this trip at this time of year at leat."
Why go to Iceland and not do the ring road?,"We spent two weeks in a camper van traveling the ring road and visiting all sorts of places.  Waterfalls, Fjords, Snowfields and Glaciers, Historic sites, Museums, Pubs, and the most consistently amazing scenery we've ever seen!  The sites within an easy day from Reykjavik were packed with tourists.  We went during the ""off-season"" but those sites were still full of tourists from all over the world.  Once we got past those areas, or headed off on 4-wheel drive roads we dropped 90% of the people.  We spent a month traveling via camper van in New Zealand last year and thought that place was beautiful.... Iceland blew it away.  Incredible areas, some of the most dramatic landscapes and scenery we've ever seen.  So many waterfalls they actually became a bit mundane!  The ring road is a must.  Each part of the country is unique in the geography, land use, and scenery and those differences can only be appreciated by traveling the entire country.  Plan to take your time."
To do or not to do...That is the question.,"While researching about my upcoming trip to Iceland there were altering opinions about whether or not to drive the ring road. Most of them said the ring road was a waste of time and you should just highlight certain area of Iceland. If you have less than 7 days I would agree. We spent 10 days in a campervan and we drove the ring road, and added in the WestFjords, and had plenty of time to see what we wanted. We even spent one day going to the island of Grimsey in the north and time on side tracked roads and alternate routes. There is so much to see in the vastly changing landscape of Iceland that this is the only way to truly experience it for yourself. If you chose to spend your time driving across the south part of the country and then backtrack to the west you could almost drive the rest of the loop without missing any time thus seeing new areas of the country. In my opinion, with more than 7 days, this is a must do."
Amazing,"We spent 6 days driving the ring road and what a fascinating time. Probably should have driven through the north west section without an overnight stay,( as there is not a lot of variation) and spent more time in Reykjavik. The most diverse landscape in such a small country from the glaciers, to the mountains, waterfalls, geysirs, black beach and so much more. All the accommodation, mainly guesthouses, were all immaculate and extremely comfortable. Would recommend this drive to anyone."
This is THE way to get around Iceland!,"The road is scenic and easy to travel. There are numerous rest areas with good food, coffee, drinks and free restrooms at convenient stopping intervals.  The road is paved (good condition) and frequently being updated and repaired due to damage caused by large vehicles with state mandated snow tires during the winter months. It is one lane in each direction but never that busy, except for the few large towns. I never experienced any real traffic.  Watch your speed - the locals all drive the limit and not any faster.  Tourists tend to travel faster and can occasionally be seen pulled over by the relatively few patrol cars that are out enforcing the speeds.  There are places to pull over and take photos but you have to pay attention to staying in your lane as there really is no shoulder to drive onto.  some bridges are one lane only, so be careful and courteous and you will have no trouble."
