Best visitor experience in Newcastle!,Immersive experience allowing you to feel part of the history of the tunnel's creation and what it was used for throughout the years.  Many thanks to Don and Pete for making the history come alive for us.
Excellent tour!,"Fascinating tour with friendly, knowledgeable and interesting guides, Joanne and Phil. We learnt a lot about the tunnel and the area, and would recommend to anyone as a great experience."
Enlightening,What a fascinating way to spend an hour or two. A very informative and interesting  tour led by the lovely Phil. Highly recommend to gain a deeper understanding of your home city. This is led by volunteers with a wealth of knowledge and passion for History. A perfect way to start a Sunday.
Fascinating and well led tour,"I found this tour fascinating.  Having lived in Newcastle for 35 years and with both grandfathers being coal miners in the North East the tour felt very relevant, but would be equally fascinating to anyone without these connections.  The tour guides Donald and Pete were very knowledgeable and made the tour interesting and enjoyable, with a little twist at the end!  I believe that the tour has been adapted due to Covid-19 with only a shorter tour available- certainly appropriate safety precautions were taken - but I still felt that I had a full experience and explanation of the history of the tunnels, both around their initial construction during the height of the mining industry, and their re-purpose during the second world war."
Fantastic tour,"Booked the family guided tour for 2 adults and 3 children (ages 10-13). Booking itself on the website was easy and straightforward. All of the information needed in regards to covid and the tour was provided. On the arrival we were greeted by Phil and Dave, who were our guides. The tour was extremely interesting and informative.  The guides were helpful, friendly and very knowledgeable.  They made the visit fun for the kids, which was brilliant.  All the precautions in regards to covid, were in place, so we felt very safe. Definitely recommend visiting"
Amazing,Our Gide was an interesting and informative chap. Lots of interesting stories bringing it all to life.
Fabulous underground tour,"My husband and I visited during the COVID pandemic, paying for a one hour tour for just the 2 of us. The tunnel is very atmospheric. The 2 volunteer guides, Donald and Pete, were very knowledgeable and made the tour incredibly interesting and informative. We were thrilled with the experience and absolutely recommend it. Brilliant!"
Interesting tour of well-kept tunnel,"The guide, Phil, was a very good story teller, bringing to life the people who had been part of the tunnel from construction to usage during WW2. It is well kept and not at all claustrophobic despite the roof being just above our helmets. Shame it couldn't be the full tour during Covid but very interesting nonetheless."
Amazing experience,Fantastic tour. We have always been fascinated by the tunnel and the Ouseburn area and this was a brilliant experience.  Malcolm and Pat were great guides and  the whole tour just flew over. Thanks to you both and to everyone involved in preserving this amazing part of our history.
Fabulous,"I can't thank Donald and Diane enough! It was my husbands birthday, we sang in the tunnel to make it special , So personal and historic, me and my family had the best time. As Geordies its fantastic to learn more about our city..You two are great!!"
Well worth a 3h 30min drive!,Amazing experience at the tunnel and Peter was a fantastic guide. Very knowledgeable on the history of the tunnel and very friendly.
Well Worth Visiting,"This was a well organised and informative tour conducted by Pete and Don, our knowledgeable and friendly guides. They explained the history of the tunnel from its construction in Victorian times to its use in WW2 in an engaging and humorous way. An unusual but rewarding way to spend an hour doing something very different in Newcastle. All appropriate Covid-19 precautions were in place. Highly recommended."
"A fantastic tour, well worth a visit","This was my first visit to Newcastle and I thought it would be interesting to see this tunnel having enjoyed a visit to the Ramsgate tunnel at the other end of the country.  John and Phil were fantastic guides, both of them were so enthusiastic and well informed and really brought it to life with tales from Victorian times and WW2.  I would thoroughly recommend this tour to anyone who visits this fantastic city."
A (tunnel) vision of a unique past,"If you are looking for something a little different then this is for you. A fascinating insight in to a unique and relativley untold part of Newcastle's rich history and heritage. Our welcoming guide Phil was full of anecdotes, facts and vignettes that brought the tour to life. Great sounds effects too. Thoroughly enjoyable and highly recommended. Get yourself down to Ouse Street..."
Newcastle getaway,Excellent tour by Joanne and Phil.Just the 2 of us due to Covid restrictions. Interesting facts about the tunnel’s uses and how it was built. Quite a spooky place!
A piece of history on our doorsteps.,"It might seem a strange thing to do - visit a tunnel! However, don’t be put off because the guides and their enthusiasm for the place bring it to life. Just walking through tunnel itself is amazing, but hearing the stories of how it was created and how it has impacted on the lives of others is truly incredible. I can’t begin to imagine how it must have felt being crowded in there sheltering from an air raid. My husband, coming from a family of miners, was particularly interested in its construction and how the coal was transported through it to the River Tyne. John and Phil were enthusiastic guides and answered our questions in detail. Also important in these times - the tour felt very safe. Highly recommended."
Such an interesting tour!,As per Covid requirements we were a group of 2. I thank the volunteers for continuing in these restricted times as I wouldn't have wanted to miss this. Donald and Peter were knowledgeable and informative explaining the history behind the tunnels construction and then use in second world war. So interesting. Places like this rely on the enthusiasm of the volunteers which allows us to experience history first-hand. Thank you.
Great Experience,"We booked the tour for Monday 7th Sept, it was just my wife and I with two guides, Donald and Trev. After well thought out Covid precautions we were issued with torches and hard hats for safety.Donald did the outward walk and dealt mainly with the use of the tunnel as a WW2 air raid shelter. He was very informative and told many tales as we penetrated further through the tunnel. He did tell us why the tunnel had been built but he left the details  of the construction and early history to our return journey with Trev.  Both guides were entertaining while sharing their extensive knowledge and the time passed very quickly.I would recommend this tour to anyone interested in the local history of either the Industrial revolution or WW2 Home Front."
Hidden gem,"Loved this tour! Amazing to discover what's hidden beneath the city. We had the tour from Phil and John, who were very knowledgeable and answered all of our questions. Had a great laugh."
A real hidden gem. Victorian feat of engineering that kept citizens safe 100 years later,Fascinating insight into a little known part of Newcastle’s history. John & Donald enthusiastically and knowledgeably told us about the building of the tunnels and their role as shelters during WW2 air raids as we walked part of the tunnels running over 50 foot beneath Newcastle.
Amazing experience,Phil and Diane were amazing guides! The tour was so interesting and fun. Really good to experience something different and off the beaten track. Due to COVID we had a private tour!
Amazing Victorian engineering,Excellent tour this morning. Volunteer guides Phil and John very knowledgeable and interesting. Strongly recommend.
Fascinating tour of Newcastle's underground history,A fascinating underground tour beneath Newcastle city centre. The volunteer guides Phil and John were really entertaining and brought the history of the tunnels alive for us - so many interesting facts and stories from a part of history that I knew nothing about before the tour! One of the highlights of our weekend in Newcastle.
Excellent attraction ,"This was a well organised attraction that is informative and interesting. There is parking nearby, appropriate safety items are provided and the guides are knowledgeable."
A great tour with excellent guides ,"Great visit to the Victoria Tunnel today. Fantastic, knowledgeable guides Phil and Iain showed us around. Would highly recommend!"
Informative and Fun Tour.,Great little attraction in Newcastle. Due to restrictions you are limited to a family group and the guide. In a way it's better as it's exclusive. Only myself and my good lady wife. Jeff was our guide for the day. Great stories and information. Funnily it makes you appreciate the buildings and locations above ground so much more. Great for kids of all ages. Safe in all respects. Check your location for the start and allow time to find it.
best tour guides,"Just want to say a huge thankyou to Mal and Phil for the fantastic tour they gave us through the tunnels in the summer holidays. I would highly recommend this tour , just as much to local people as visors from elsewhere.The visit was well organised for COVID safety. The tour was informative and very entertaining. Phil and Mal made me feel so proud to be a Geordie with their clear passion for our heritage. My son is interested in Engineering as a career and I can safely say Mal and Phil were so inspiring to the future generation. It gave him a chance to think about what great feats are possible with imagination and determination. The tunnel is an absolute marvel and its history as part of the city is genuinely fascinating. So thanks so much for one of the best daytrips in Newcastle I've had in Newcastle, you guys re absolute legends, so funny and knowledgeable, you are wonderful ambassadors for our region. Thanks a million!"
Fascinating tour ,"We had an hour long tour with Trev, and the time flew by. He gave us such an insight into the history of the tunnel and really brought it to life. We wish we did the two hour tour. Cannot recommend enough! Trev was a belter, and asset to the team."
Fantastic tour with Peter!,"Fantastic tour this afternoon provided by Peter, who has extensive knowledge of the tunnel, its surrounding, and history, not only the history of the tunnel, its geography etc. but of Newcastle as a city. It was brilliant to be able to discuss our interests with someone so passionate and knowledgeable. We're very much looking forward to returning in due course to undertake the two-hour tour. Thank you again! Tara, Laura & Ella."
Fascinating history,Fascinating tour provided by Peter. Very professionally done and Covid secure. Interesting stories and dramatic finish! Thoroughly recommend it.
Amazing,We visited today with our 9 and 3 year old granddaughters. John and Trevor were fantastic and interacted with us all. We are from the northeast but learnt a lot more about mining than we thought possible. Our 9year old had recently studied WW2 so was intrigued and asked loads of questions. I wish we’d known about this sooner as I’m sure we’d be frequent visitors. Thank you so much.
Everyone should do this!,"We did a one hour tour in August. I wasn't sure how I would react being underground for so long but it was so fascinating,  I felt totally safe and relaxed.  The guides Pete and John were amazing, their knowledge and enthusiasm made the whole experience brilliant. I'd definitely recommend this, it was worth every penny."
Brilliant experience.,"Despite being local to the area this is the first time we thought about taking this tour. I have to say it was much better than I expected. I always expected to enjoy it myself but even the kids thought it was great too. Mal and Neil (the tour guides) were pleasant, informative and really made it an interesting experience. Would definitely recommend."
Thank you Phil & John! ,"Thanks so much to Phil & John our guides this morning for a brilliant 1 hour. Very knowledgeable and answered all our questions, I would highly recommend!"
Great tour!,"Really interesting place to visit, fascinating history and a highly informative guide. Very COVID safe."
Informative,"Absolutely lovely tour, very informative and interesting. Great to learn about local history. Great price. Would definitely recommend."
Fabulous tour under the Toon,"Absolutely fantastic. Guides (John, Dave & Kev) we’re so knowledgable and their enthusiasm shone - in particular John, who lead our tour. Didn’t know what to expect but way way more interesting than we ever thought a tunnel could be. Will recommend to everyone we know. Great value."
Highly recommended,"We had a great time on the tour today with the two guides Diane and Donald. Our 10 year old and 3 year old both enjoyed it aswell as my 65 year old father, really interesting. Thank you very much for a great afternoon, we'd definitely recommend."
"Great value, highly interesting","Great tour, really brought to life by 2 lovely volunteer guides. Really worth a visit when in Newcastle"
Great value hidden gem ,I booked this tour for me and my boyfriend for a short stay in August 2020. I was a little hesitant about booking at first due to Covid restrictions and had read on the website the tour would be shorter (an hour) and £30 flat rate. I think the pre-Covid price was £9 each so thought it was a little steep for both of us but I was wrong!We were met by our guide Pete who explained the Covid procedures and we were asked to put on hard hats and given a torch. Pete was fantastic - super knowledgable and you could tell he has such a passion about the tunnel and its history. All of the guides are volunteers - so you know instantly there are there because they enjoy what they do! The tour ended up being an hour and a half because we asked Pete quite a few questions - we were fascinated. There wasn’t a question he couldn’t answer!My boyfriend and I both said it was the highlight of our trip and it’s amazing to learn some of Newcastle’s hidden past.
A taste of the past,"Great, short tour with guides Mal and Pat. The enthusiasm and dedication which has brought this former waggonway tunnel back to life are evident.The tunnel in itself doesn't hold too many surprises, but the way that the guides use the tour to tell the stories of how it was used as an air-raid shelter and how it was constructed are illuminating. This together with other stories relating to the industrial past of the tunnel brings the whole thing alive. Good value tour, and excellent to be making a contribition to this charity that has done so much to bring the tunnel to life."
So Amazing 10/10 would recommend,"I went with my family, in total there was 6 of us. The tour guides, Kev and John, were  so accommodating and were amazing! Even though the tour lasted an hour,due to the pandemic, but it was so informative and fun. Wouldn't have even known there could be tunnels under a big  city!"
Secrets beneath your feet,"Had a great morning yesterday exploring and learning about the history of these amazing tunnels with Pete and Joanne who were fantastic guides. If you have an hour or two spare and want to explore Newcastle's underground secrets, I'd highly recommend this tour."
Family tunnel tour a big hit,Fascinating stories and history about the tunnels brought to life with excellent delivery from John and Pete. My 80 year old dad enjoyed it as much as my 9 year old son. Really worth paying a visit.
Victoria Tunnel 1 hour tour,"A real hidden gem. Didn't even know this existed. Went with my wife and 15 year old daughter. We did the 1 hour tour but a 2 hiur is available. Our guide Pete was very knowledgeable and friendly with the right mix of seriousness and humour. Felt very safe at all times, safety precautions were very good and easy to follow. Would definitely recommend."
Victoria tunnel Newcastle ,"Fascinating experience. A hidden gem. Our home city and we didn’t even know it existed. Many thanks to our wonderful guides Dianne and Donald for their knowledge, insight and humour. Thoroughly recommended."
Great experience,We had a one hour tour as a family of 4 (two boys aged 11 and 8) and we loved it. The stories that the guides told were brilliant and really kept us all interested. We would recommend it highly. A different day out!
Go on have a visit.,"Fascinating tour during covid period,Limited to one family, one hour long. Jo and Phil, our knowledgeable guides kept us entertained talking us through the history of the tunnel.Very interesting, well worth a visit!"
A Great Experience,"We spent 5 days up in Northumberland and spent one of those in Newcastle. We parked in the free Spiller's Car Park, the route to Victoria Tunnel is pretty easy. From the car park, walk towards the Cycle Hub and on to Quayside until you reach The Tyne Bar. Pickup the Riverside Walk path, past Di Meo's (Recommended) until you reach the first bridge. Go up the steps, over the bridge on Byker Bank and then it's your first left Ouse Street and the tunnel entrance is on the right.Our guide Kev was waiting for us, due to Corvid it was just me, the wife and our 9 year old for the 1 hour tour. We all put on hard hats and were given tourches and left some of our things at the entrance. The door was locked so we felt our things would be safe. We waited an extra couple of minutes for the secondary tour guide to arrive as the tour is completed in pairs for safety but he was a little late so we started without him and he arrived half way through the tour. Not an issue at all albeit a little scary hearing someone (or some thing) coming towards you at pace in a dark tunnel. :)  Kev did an excellent job and taylored the visit for our girl, who had lots of questions and Kev was patient and happy to answer. The tour covered both the Victorian and World War 2 eras and Kev provided a number of interesting facts and stories and we left feeling like we'd done something unique and enjoyable."
Worth going,"Really interesting. There was just us on the tourCovers two periods of history. The building and it’s use in the Second World War   Definitely worth going on, as an amazing feat of engineering"
Facinating,Wonderful tour guides Phillip and Andrew. Really brought the stories to life. I would highly recommend the tour of the tunnel.
Excellent,"Absolutely brilliant. I am from Newcastle but moved away 10 years ago to Cumbria. I had no idea these were here. The two tour guides were friendly, knowledgeable and funny. Excellent way to see a part of the city's history!"
Secret life underground,This review is written by my student who enjoyed an educational visit here recently. As part of his learning he has written this review which I have added exactly as he wrote it. It is under the 'teens - family' category as there is not an 'educational' one.'What a surprise that a nearly 200 yer old tunnel has managed to survive and be in good condition all this time! The guides were amazing and they answered every question they were asked. They were polite and brought the tunnel to life for the visitors. The tunnel was originally built to transport coal to the river in big trucks called chaldrons. This didn't cost anything as it was built on a slope and used gravity instead of bumping down all the roads near the town. It was a really clever idea.It was put out of use after the pit stopped making money. Then it was cleaned and used as an air raid shelter in World War 2. It could hold a capacity of 8000 people and you can see how they were crammed in to stay safe. It was a very good experience to visit.'
Walk in the dark!,Extremely informative guides who brought the Tunnel alive with graphic descriptions of life below the streets. From an idea to planning and then labouring to build the feat of Victorian engineering. Also how it came to protect the local population from the terror of air war.Very interesting afternoon.
Victoria Tunnel ,We have been trying to see this for a while but it’s always booked up - I can see why! We booked the one hour tour. Great experience with knowledgeable hosts who regaled us with interesting facts and stories. A fascinating journey from the Victorian era to WWII - thoroughly recommended! Recommend you book in advance as it’s a very popular attraction.
Great afternoon,A very informative place to visit. Lots of interesting info and great staff. Amazing what you can learn about the history and what is under your feet!!!
Phenomenal ,What an experience to find out all the history of the tunnel. Mal & Kay excellent guides very informative.We had a private tour as there was only two of us on the tour.Great to learn the unfortunate history of the tunnel Pre war. Then what a saviour it was during the war.It’s a must do!!!!
Highly recommended,"Well worth the small fee for a 2 hour tour with two friendly, helpful and knowledgable guides. Interesting and informative talks about the history of the tunnel and its role in world war 2."
Interesting tour,"This is a very interesting and informative tour , it’s kind of eerie  down in the tunnel if you imagine the position everyone was in down there , having to evacuate their homes whenever there was an air raid and sit in the dark tunnel for hours on end with no comforts at all . We don’t know how lucky we are ! The guide gave an insight into what it was like with lots of interesting stories about the people who used the tunnel. It was originally built to transport coal from the mines down to the ships at the river . A great history lesson . I would recommend this tour very much ."
"Very interesting, highly recommend",We had a great visit with Phil and John who were friendly and very knowledgable. They answered all our questions and we would highly recommend anyone to visit. We just did the hour trip but would like to visit for the 2 hour trip or the walking tour in the future - thanks Phil and John!! :)
Well worth the visit,Interesting and engaging tour led by guides Peter & John who were both knowledgeable & enthusiastic. Easy walk with decent stops along the tunnel. Great way to start to understand Newcastle and the local area
Interesting and unusual.,A very interesting 2hrs full of facts and stories to entertain all ages. Barry and Donald were perfect guides and kept you informed all the way along the tunnel.
Brilliant!,Great insight into the tunnels history! The time flew by and extremely good value for money at £9 per person (2 hour tour)
Very interesting,The guides Tom & Jerry :) were great and very knowledgeable.  Great value at £9 per head and the 2 hours just flew by.
A very interesting journey back in time,"The 2 hour walking tour of the Ouseburn area and the Victoria Tunnel was extremely interesting.  Diana and Barry were excellent guides, really bringing the tunnel's 2 uses to life - first for the movement of coal in the 1800s, and its later adaptation for use as an air raid shelter in the 2nd world war.  They combined detailed knowledge with a light touch, making it an entertaining as well as educational experience that successfully evoked the lives of the people who dug the tunnel, sheltered in it, and in a few sad cases lost their lives in it.  Well worth a visit."
Incredibly interesting.,"We thoroughly enjoyed this tour. The guides, Trev and Phil, were extremely knowledgeable and interesting as well as entertaining. Wear comfortable shoes and clothes."
Brilliant history under your feet,"A compelling 2 hours journey through the history of the tunnel and the surrounding area.Our guide, John, was fantastic - very knowledgeable and kept us all enthralled with the tales of the tunnel. A great experience and terrific value at £9 per adult - that includes use of a torch.A great twist at the end!Suggest good shoes as the tunnel floor can be damp and a fairly warm coat.A brilliant afternoon!"
Very Interesting Tour,The guides were very informative about the history of the tunnels. We were on the 2 hour tour which was good value for money. The guides stopped walking at regular intervals to tell us about the history of the tunnels.
A great experience,Thank you to both Malcolm and Jeff for providing a great experience yesterday for our party of four. We all felt we learnt a lot more about our nearest city. The tour was delivered in true great Goerdie spirit.We will definitely recommend to others a visit worth taking. Thank you again
Interesting tour,Really enjoyed this tour and history lesson. Very professional and the guides were very informative.
Excellent atmospheric tour,"Good insight into the past - World War Two and it's history when created. Pete and Barry were good, friendly and helpful. They promised to check up on an associated historical point we raised about bombing on East Coast in WW2. The holes on the blast walls are an interesting recent feature! The sandstone in the lower part of the walls, below the brickwork, had evidence of being carved and the guides informed us of the history of the source of that stonework.  How do you avoid being killed by a run-away train carriage! Listen and learn!!Our only problem was my height - with helmet it meant I was crouching the whole time but Barry spotted it and suggested I sat on a bench during information session later in the tour. Two hours well spent"
An excellent  two hours spent underground,"A mixture of  experiences, entertainment  and history in a most unusual  setting.Our tour was led by Pete and Donald who successfully took us back through the years with a mixture of stories both humorous and sad in a hidden world beneath the streets of Newcastle.  Be aware though this is not for anyone who is afraid of the dark or who suffers from claustrophobia."
Interesting Tour ,Me and my partner went on the hour tour on Sunday at 16:00! Ian and Pete were great and really engaging! Thoroughly enjoyed and found it so interesting! Me and my partner will be back for the 2hr tour :D
History Tour,Me and my friends book to do the tunnels finally and really enjoyed the experience. A fascinating bit of history on our doorsteps. I would recommend this experience to anyone that loves history.
One hour tour,"We booked late and so one hour tour was all that was available - but well worth the effort of trying to find the place - we were staying in Central Newcastle and got there on the number 39 bus from Eldon Square. We were visitors to the area, so had not heard anything about it before. The stories of the tunnel in coal mining times and War years were recounted very effectively and we really enjoyed the experience - no problem with the restricted height of the tunnel - but i'm only 5 foot three!"
Educational and an Adventure,"We made a special trip up to Newcastle to visit the Victoria Tunnels, it was certainly worth it. The tour guide was excellent and really had a passion for the city. We did the 1 hour tour which was just right for our youngest (8 years old) with 30 minutes on World War II and thirty minutes on its use in Victorian time, it was educational as well as being a bit of an adventure. Would certainly recommend, it took us about half an hour to walk to the start from the city Centre."
2 Hour Tour,"We had a fantastic afternoon at the Victoria Tunnel, we booked about a month in advance for the two hour tour which flies by! The meeting point in the Ouseburn is really easy to find with plenty parking facilities nearby. It is clear the two guides are very passionate and enthusiatic throughout the tour and the history and knowledge you gain is truly engaging. We now have a fountain of knowledge about the local area! Great day out for all ages and groups and the guides were very friendly and approachable so if you needed anything they were more than happy to help out. Fab"
Brilliant glimpse into the history of the Tunnel,Very well guided by Donald and Phil who knew their stuff and made sure everyone was comfortable and happy being in a tunnel 60-80 metres below ground for around 90 minutes. Especially liked the guides dry humour and storytelling.Would recommend.
Excellent family visit,Excellent visit. My 10 year old son and 45year old hubby loved it. Very informative. Thank you. They particularly liked this amazing feat of engineering
Fascinating Visit,"We visited with our 4 grandchildren (14 - 8) and they all loved it - as did we. The guides, Barry and Diane, were superb, mixing history with fascinating anecdotes. They really made history come alive."
Historic,"Living locally it's a place we always see and hear about but never visited. It was so interesting listening to the history of the use during the war and how big the tunnel actually was. Finding out how and why it was built originally was something i'd never known before, would have been great to be able to actually walk the full rout but never mind!"
Great tour guides,"My partner and I had a wonderful tour today. The guides, Pete and Mal, were amazing and kept us all entertained"
Tunnel Tour,"Fantastic tour of the Victoria tunnel, excellent tour guides with Phil and John, would definitely do this again, highly recommend so much history and knowledge I didn't know about!"
GREAT DAY OUT,"I went with a group of friends on a long anticipated visit to the tunnel.  We had two great guides in Bruce and Pete who were full of enthusiasm for their subject. They were very knowledgable and passed on this knowledge with ease, humour and good nature."
Great stories,The 2 hour tour was brilliant. Great stories about two very different times in history from knowledgable guides Donald and Peter.
A great experience ,"Fascinating first visit a week ago, most interesting history. Guides were very knowledgeable and shared their information with enthusiasm. After my tour I took advantage of the 20% discount offered on food at The Cluny. A great afternoon out."
Great afternoon out,"Did not know what to expect,but not disapointed.Guides were great and because we had 3 they each had a differant kind of  knowledge. Nothing was too much  trouble for them, will recommend it to family and friends."
Extraordinary ,"A must for the engineering, railway or wartime history buff.One of the most unusual heritage sites I have ever visited.Highly recommended so long as you aren't claustrophobic or scared of the dark."
Interesting & educational tour.,Learnt a few interesting things about WW2 and the Victorian era. Well worth the money.  The guides were friendly and communicated well with the whole group
Interesting tour,I recommend booking this tour in advance as it fills up very fast especially at the weekend. Very informative and the guides tried to make it as fun for us as possible with a few laughs and jokes along the way.
Excellent ,We did the 2 hour tour. It was excellent. Lynne and Terry were great tour guides. I would highly recommend this tour.
Fascinating two hour walk in the Victoria Tunnel,"This is an amazing piece of Newcastle's industrial and social history. Our guides Jan and Barry split the walk into two with Jan talking about WW2 on the way into the tunnel and Barry talking about the building of the tunnel in the 19th century on the way out. I am a visitor to the city and found the visit interesting as part of Britain's past, but I think a local person would find learn something about their city's history. Allow time to look at the books and photos in the centre beforehand or afterwards."
Amazing,We had an hour long tour with 14 of us our tour guides were realey good and informative and made the experiance amzing
Victoria Tunnel ,"Great visit, we did a one hour tour with Pete and Chris and it was great. Brilliant stories and facts, very enjoyable would highly recommend. Suitable for All ages."
Very interesting tour,A very enjoyable 2 hour tour split into 2 parts with the first part about the Second World War period and the second part about the tunnels original use. Both volunteer guides were very informative and told their stories in an interesting manner. Would recommend.
2 hours of information and enjoyment.,A pleasant surprise to see the transformation taking place in the Ouseburn valley. The walk to the tunnel was informative and enjoyable. Our guides were well informed and made the experience fun as well as educational. Would thoroughly recommend this tour and it is extremely good value. There are plenty of other places in the vicinity to visit and enjoy after the tour.
Informative and interesting,"Highly recommend this experience. The tour guides made it very interesting, and their knowledge of the history of the tunnel is top notch."
Great Bit of Local History,"Had a very educational and fun couple of hours in the depths of the tunnel. Phil and Dee our guides were very friendly and knowledgeable.There is no lighting so you get your own hard hat and torch, so if you are in any way claustrophobic this tour is not for you.The tour starts at their office near The Cluny and you get a short walking tour of Ouseburn thrown in.Another plus is you get discount on unearby eateries, so all in all well worth a visit."
Really interesting trip.,Really interesting and the tour guide gave us loads of local history. I had no idea the tunnels were so long or so well used over the years.
Great experience,Only did the short 1 hour tour and it was very enjoyable. Got to learn a bit about the Newcastle history back in the 1800's and WW2 time. The guides were very friendly and informative.
Well worth a visit,The tour is reasonably priced and took about 2 hours. The first half was the story of the tunnel as an air raid shelter in WW2. The second half tells you about the building of the tunnel and it's use by the coal mine. Both have interesting stories as well as a walk along the Ouseburn giving some local history too. A must for anyone interested in local history. Be aware that in places the floor is wet so wear a decent pair of boots
Excellent Tour,Very enjoyable with excellent tour guides! Both staff members were extremely knowledgeable and friendly!
North east heritage at its best,"When we go abroad we always try to do at least one day trip to understand the local culture and see the sights, yet we are ignorant of what is on our own doorstep. What a brilliant tour this is and what fantastic tour guides for the day we had. Everything was done at a relaxed pace and it was so informative. If you are looking for a nice relaxed day and to understand English heritage you don’t need to look any further than this."
The jewel in the crown in Newcastle.,We went to the Victoria tunnel for a two hour visit. We had a pre tour talk and then we entered the underground tunnel and started the visit. The guide was very informative and told us all about the history of the tunnel. I would recommend any one visiting the area to book this tour as it was a good price for the tour.
One hour visit,"We took the 1 hour visit option; the friendly, knowledgeable volunteers gave an interesting tour of one of Newcastle's ""hidden"" gems."
A very interesting two hours,"My partner and I went on the tour after having lunch at the Biscuit Factory.  A point of interest if you show your tickets at the Biscuit Factory Cafe on the day of your visit you can get a discount.  We didn't find out until after, hey ho.  Our two guides were Donald and Phil.  Phil took us round to the Tunnel and gave a lot of information about the Ouseburn area.  Donald was the guide into the tunnel and gave the recent history, particularly about its use as an air raid shelter during the war.  On the way back Phil gave us the information on the reason for its building and early history.  Both were very engaging and had a vast knowledge of the area and the history of the Tunnel.  We had no idea what to expect but had a very entertaining and informative two hours, which passed very quickly.  Can't praise the two guides Donald and Phil enough, well done them."
Fantastic tour! ,"Me and my fella really enjoyed this tour! If you are in Newcastle I recommend this 100%. We had guides Phil & John (I think) they were lovely and knew there stuff. It was really interesting and fascinating. We did the 1hr tour on Sunday but really I wish did the longer one on the Saturday but this was fully booked when we tried, so make sure you book in advance!Thank you 😊"
"Victoria Tunnel Ouseburn, Newcastle upon Tyne","Thank you to Peter and Donald for giving us a wonderful, informative tour of the Victoria Tunnel. We learned so much about this amazing  engineering feat and the remarkable people who used this tunnel as a bomb shelter during WW II. We’ll be telling many people about our experience and be back! Jon & Anne"
Very interesting tour! ,Donald and Peter took us on a very interesting and informative tour of the Victoria Tunnels. Highly recommended.
Brilliant,"This experience was thought provoking, atmospheric, chilling and made you realise how lucky we are.  Thoroughly enjoyed this tour learning about history on our doorstep that I didn't know existed. The tour guides Barry and Pete were brilliant."
Defo worth a visit!,Lived in Newcastle my whole life and only just found this hidden gem. I now take everyone who visits me!
A hidden gem of Newcastle,"I have wanted to visit Victoria Tunnel for a while and finally got the opportunity. The guides Donald and Peter were very welcoming, full of very interesting history facts and the tales of the tunnel were exceptional! Its sad more of the tunnel is not open to public exploring but for the part that we were lucky to be able to travel was well worth the time and small price paid."
Fantastic tour,We have just been on today’s tour and loved every minute of it! Dee and Phil were so knowledgable about the history or the tunnel and Newcastle.. we particularly  loved the geordie humour that came out and could really tell the guides loved showing people the tunnel and telling the stories.Definitely recommend this to anyone (adults not young children!)  it takes around 2 hours for the full tour amazing value
Excellent and well worth money,This was a very informative tour by our guides Donald and Diane. It was amazing to go into the tunnels and be informed of such history. A very worth while tour for the price and I would highly recommend to anyone.
Victoria Tunnels tour,"What an interesting tour today, learnt so much about how the thousands of people took refuge here during the war in a tunnel originally built to transport coal, and how the tunnels came to be !The guides were good humoured as well as full of information, i do hope to read one day that the mystery of the tunnel has been solved! I am unfortunately useless at names but the 3 guides today 6/01/20 were fantastic!"
Really worth doing ,"2 hours well spent made by the tour guides Peter and Donald. Really interesting with great insights, facts and stories well told with a good balance of humour and empathy. Would definitely recommend"
Blast from the past,"My wife booked the short one hour tour for six of us for our kids and their girlfriends (one of which is from the USA).  I was aware that the tunnel existed because my mother used to have to come down here during the war and she told me stories about it.  But like many people who live close to attractions and tours, I was unaware that you could go down to the tunnel.  The tour itself is short but very informative with Pete and Dee doing their best to provide information and atmosphere to add to the occasion.  I myself felt totally absorbed in it as I knew my mum had been here and when I told Dee about the things my mum told me, she gave me additional information which was fab.  This tour is a snip for what you get out of it and I just hope that funding can be found to open the tunnel to its full length again. Also, there are a few nice pubs/restaurants right on its doorstep that you get good discounts from using the tunnel voucher which is an added bonus."
Fabulous Experience,"We had a tour of a piece of Newcastle History, that I didn't even know existed. Amazing knowing how by hard life was down there during WW2. In this modern day, we don't know we have been born. I have the utmost respect for those who had to dwell down there when the air raids were on, in what had to be horrendous conditions ie. Damp (Better Damp than Dead) was the motto down there...Lack of toilets. We were guided by Donald & Pete, full of knowledge & funny too."
Hour tour of Victorian Tunnel,Thanks to Pete and John for a very interesting hour tour of the tunnel. Visited on 29 Dec and only the hour tour was available during our stay. It came up as the top attraction in Newcastle as is well worth the trip. Pete gave us all the info about it as a mining tunnel and also an air raid shelter with an interesting story and sound effects at the end. Well priced and time went very quickly. Glad we made the trip. Conveniences are in the reception and entrances to tunnel a few minutes walk up the road so beware if you are doing the two hour tour.
Fascinating,"Have just spent a very interesting hour in the Victorian tunnel in Ouseburn. Dee and Pete were superb guides. I’ve lived in Newcastle all my life and never knew the tunnel existed until recently. Would definitely recommend, well worth a visit."
Two hour tour of Victoria Tunnels,"My wife and I visited the Victoria Tunnels and took the two hour tour. Our guides, Diana and Derek, were excellent and we really enjoyed the talks on WW2 and the original use of the tunnel to move coal.Would highly recommend if you’re in the area."
Really good,We booked this as a pre Christmas treat for our annual Newcastle Christmas shopping trip. Mal & John were great guides and we learned so much about the whole area that we will need to come back and go on one of the guided walks of the area.We started off at the Office/Shop - lots of interesting gifts to buy . We then left following the (Ouse)burn learning a lot about the history of the area including one of the “little ships” used in the evacuation of Dunkirk in WW2.The tour of the tunnel itself was really interesting with lots of interaction between the guides and visitors. An excellent couple of hours and would recommend it to anyone with any interest in history.
Santa visit,Our six year old loved her visit to the victoria tunnel to see Father Christmas and all his helpers. With stories of war time in the tunnel on christmas eve to what children got for christmas
Very interesting tour with entertaining and informative guides. ,"Thoroughly enjoyed our visit and the tour. Excellent tour guides, Trev and Pete, brought the past alive. Thanks chaps."
Very interesting,"This is a hidden gem of a tourist attraction, it’s a bit off the beaten track, but well worth a visit.It's not the normal thing you would expect to be doing on a visit to Newcastle, but if you enjoy something a little different and like to learn about the history of where you are, this is definitely a place to add to your trip.To dig a tunnel 2.5 miles long, hidden under the city, is an amazing feat of engineering, getting to walk through it and lean of its history, uses and what has happened in there is definitely an education.The guides are very informative, and more than happy to go out of their way to ensure you get to enjoy this experience.If you enjoy history, engineering, something different, or just want to broaden your knowledge of the area, you must take the time to visit this attraction, definitely time well spent."
Christmas trip to see Santa in the tunnels,"I wasn’t even aware this was a thing until my colleague told me about it, my daughter is 11 and still believes so I needed a Santa trip that wasn’t too babyish for her. After I’d booked she had a visit with school to the tunnels so had already been there! Santa was great, very natural and believable - we were really impressed! I’d definitely recommend it. I’ve even bought a voucher for my parents for Christmas to have a tour now!"
"Excellent, smart, unusual experience like nowhere else","This was a fascinating experience.  They take you to a tunnel and tell many stories associated with this structure. I have never been to a place like this. The tunnel is well kept and has very fresh, clean air. Being a unique and quite complex structure, the tunnel plaid several roles throughout time, about which guides will tell you with great professionalizm."
An amazing look back at how things were in the war and last century,A must visit place for locals and tourists alike. You find out how the people of East Newcastle survived the war and before that in the 1860's how coal was transported to the colliers on the Tyne from the pits in Newcastle
Fascinating,Fascinating place with lots of interesting history.  Make sure you wrap up as it's quite chilly. Great for kids.
Interesting,I wasn't really looking forward to this but I found it very interesting. Phil and Donald were very informative and made it fun
A wonderful hidden gem,"Hidden in the Ouseburn is the splendid Victoria Tunnel which was originally part of a Newcastle wide system of tunnels created to enable coal to be brought from the collieries to ships on the river. Then during World War 2 it was used as a bunker when Newcastle was being bombed. You can even see the marks where the bunk beds used to be. The whole concept is fascinating. The tunnel is well lit and generally you can walk up the tunnel without crouching. You need to be escorted by one of the guides who have a splendid knowledge of the tunnel as well as the Ouseburn area generally and clearly are passionate about ensuring visitors have a good experience, answering a variety of questions with enthusiasm and deep knowledge. Definitely worth visiting and discovering this splendid part of Newcastle's history."
Birthday treat,"Wanted to do something a bit different whilst visiting Newcastle. Great experience, fantastic tour guides Andrew and Kate they were very knowledgeable. Reasonably priced. I would recommend a visit."
Steps back in Tyne!,We really enjoyed our two hour walking tour of Ouseburn valley and the Victoria Tunnel. Brilliantly lead and brought to life by Donald and Phil. Thanks guys!
Fascinating insight to a very important piece of local history,"Really friendly and knowledgeable guides - no need to worry about being underground as there are lights and if anyone needs to go out, that can be arranged - I had felt slightly concerned that I would hate it - but that was absolutely not the case.  So much to learn about our local area - this is brilliant and I would highly recommend it."
A Great Birthdady Present,A very interesting tour of the tunnels under our city that had two very different uses over the years .We heard all about them from our two guides Andrew & Phil who made it fascinating & fun at the same time .A great piece of local history to visit.
Great slice or local history ,"A very different tourist experience, covering two parts of Newcastle history. We only did the hour tour but would like to go back for the two hour visit. Our guides, Phil and Andy, did a great job of bringing the history to life and keeping us all enthralled. Look back to going back and exploring the local pubs and art galleries."
Excellent experience,"We were given a gift voucher by family for this local visitor attraction and having visited it today, it was an excellent gift and a fun and different afternoon.David and Kate our two guides were friendly, informative and entertaining and presented the history of the tunnel very clearly. It was a fascinating insight into the ingenuity of local people when coal was king and also of the use of it as an air raid shelter during WWII. Highly recommend it - only issue is if you're 6 feet or over, be glad of the hard hat and be prepared to duck in places!"
Fascinating,"We went here as a family and it gave us a great insight into historic Newcastle. Very interesting, wear comfortable shoes but torch’s are supplied, I’m slightly claustrophobic but it was fine. Guides are great and very enthusiastic, great trip well worth the money."
Well Worth It,After reading other reviews we had to take this tour. Went with a party of eight and had a really good time. The tour was made all the more interesting by our excellent guides Kaye and Phil. Can't really add much more to what has already been said by others except take the time and book a visit.
Second Time Around,"As part of a group of eight people, I visited the tunnel today and was amazed at how much extra information was given by the two guides Phil and Kaye, compared to our first visit some 4 years ago; - they certainly know their stuff! The tour involved the surrounding area first and good local knowledge provided. The tunnel talk was then divided into 2nd WW and Victorian eras.The guides made the tour all the more enjoyable with little anecdotes and literally painted the scenes. Well done!"
Really interesting visit,"Excellent, knowledgeable guides (all volunteers). A really informative and enjoyable afternoon learning about the history of the tunnel."
Excellent attraction,Highlight of our city break to Newcastle. Phil and Pete gave a fine history of the tunnel’s construction and its use as an air raid shelter during WW11. Many anecdotes added to the presentation. At the start of the tour Pete gave us a history of the Ouseburn area during the Industrial Age which we also found fascinating. Highly recommend
Well worth a visit ,I bought a voucher for the Tunnel tour as a present for my husband and we both enjoyed our visit. Our guides Phil and Donald were excellent and gave us lots of interesting information about the role of the Tunnel as a waggonway for transporting coal down to the Tyne and later as an air raid shelter in wartime. They made the tour very entertaining too. Highly recommended this 2 hour tour.
Interesting tour,"After years living in the Northeast my husband and I finally booked a 2 hour tour. Our group of 15 was taken into the tunnel by two guides, Kay and Bruce. During the first half we learned about the use of the tunnel as an air raid shelter during WW2. The construction of the tunnel and its use for transporting coal was outlined in the second part of the tour. The guides were informative and told interesting stories about people associated with the tunnel; with a little help from some sound effects you can start to imagine what conditions were like back in the day. We thoroughly enjoyed it, and two hours flew by. If you have any interest in local history then I would definitely recommend visiting the Victoria Tunnel."
Fabulous,We thoroughly enjoyed our 2 hour tunnel tour with our guides Donald and Phil. They provided a wealth of knowledge about the origins of the tunnel as well as how it was used during WWII. Facts were delivered with an appropriate amount of humour whilst not detracting from the horrors that would have accompanied spending time in complete darkness in a crowded air raid shelter.This is a 'must do' on any trip to Newcastle.
Why did we wait 30 years to do this tour ? - Make a booking and do the tour !,"We have lived in Newcastle for 30 years and did the Victorian Tunnels tour today. We wish we had done it sooner ! It is a fascinating visit - covering the history of the tunnel construction, it’s use during WWii and a macabre story of death in the tunnel leading to a possible “presence” in the tunnel. Our group was mixed ages from 10-70 + and the information was lively, funny and very informative. Our guide, Ian, was excellent and the time flew by with everyone enjoying the tour."
Great afternoon tour.,"We really enjoyed our visit to the Victoria Tunnels. The guides Barry and Jeff were extremely knowledgeable and friendly guys. We started the tour with a short tour of a few places outside the tunnel in order that we got an insite of what the tunnel was built under.  We then went to the tunnel, put on hard hats, picked up touches and the inside tour began.  Every so often the group would stop and the guides gave us information on that particular point of the tunnel. The tour lasted two hours, you have a short briefing before you begin, and it was a very enjoyable two hours. We bought a souvenir booklet which was very informative and we also bought a box of edible coal biscuits.  Well worth the visit.."
Two hour tunnel visit - superb,"Book well in advance because this place is popular and for good reason.We met friends in the Ouseburn.  Great place.Tour guides were Peter and Donald - they were brilliant.Tour includes history of Ouseburn, early coal industry and latterly the use of tunnel during air raids.Excellent value and we all really enjoyed it (our group were aged 11 to 52)."
Birthday treat,"My wife surprised me with tickets for my birthdayOur guides for the tour were Pete and BarryThe tour started from the office where we reported fifteen minutes before departureThere were photographs on the tables of the area throughout the yearsWe had a safety talk before we're left the officeBarry led the group on the 15 minute walk to the tunnel entrance, showing points of interest on the way The tour which lasted about two hours was split into two partsPete led us into the tunnel and talked about the war years when it was used as an air raid shelter Barry led us out and talked about the tunnels origin and it's use moving coal from spital tongues to the quaysideBoth guides were knowledgeable and talked with passion about the tunnelThis tunnel is part of the history of NewcastleI didn't even know it was there til I saw the entrance on Claremont road I would highly recommend it"
1 hour tunnel tour,"A fascinating tour of a secret place. An excellent tour that was both both informative and entertaining. We heard from Kay all about the construction of the tunnel to transport coal to the docks, its time as a mushroom farm and its use as a shelter during WWII. Kay built a wonderful picture of the characters who sheltered there; the children, the Byker Grannies and the courting couples who removed the light bulbs to better enjoy a bit of wartime passion. Peter told us all about the industrial times but look out as his stories include a surprise! Thanks for a great afternoon."
Really enjoyed it,"Enjoyed both aspects of the tour - the history of the coal industry and the experience of what it must have been like for people avoiding the bombs. Was not as damp or cold as I thought it might be, but had sensible clothing and footwear on."
Fascinating Visit,Found out about this historical trip while looking on Trip Adviser on what to do in Newcastle. The guides who took our group of 14 were very informative and gave us all plenty opportunities to ask questions.The trip took 2 hours and most of the time was spent in the tunnel. Make sure you wear flat shoes and suitable clothing. Hard hats and torches are supplied. All for a very reasonable £8 per person.  Make sure you book ahead as this attraction is so popular.
1 hour tunnel tour,"Brilliant tour by Phil & James. Brilliant stories told about the tunnel, entertaining guides. Fascinating tunnel. A must for anyone visiting Newcastle."
Tour of Victoria Tunnel,"We came today in family group including 3 teenagers, 2 of whom at least were rather reluctant visitors (“Oh God. It’ll be like a boring history lesson at school” etc...). However even the cynical ones who are the age where they apparently know everything found it actually very interesting and informative. They were especially engaged by the WW2 part.  The only disappointment apparently was a lack of ghosts or other macabre anecdotes. Our Guides, Donald & Barry, were really knowledgeable and made the tour entertaining and humourous. Good value too. Would highly recommend."
a Must for History Buffs,"The guides are fantastic and really take you back in time to get a better understanding of what life was like.In depth insight into the history of the tunnel and the area. When we went, it was wet in the tunnels and the ground can be uneven so wear appropriate shoes.They are tunnels 85 feet under ground and would not be for the claustrophobic. it's not horribly confining but it is dark, enclosed, and a 2 hour tour. The guides will take anyone who is uncomfortable out but be forewarned before booking.We loved it and recommend it for history buffs."
Amazing place....great tour,"Born in Newcastle and never knew this existed.Pete and Phil do a great job of taking you back through time to the WW2 era, and the tunnel being used as an air raid shelter. Then further back to the Victorian times and the construction and operation of the tunnel as a coal transportation system. Well worth a visit."
Excellent Attraction,"It is true that you are not aware what excellent visitor attractions exist in your own city. My wife and I visited this attraction earlier this week and the whole experience was fascinating. The guides (Pete and Phil) were both friendly, helpful and extremely informative. We took the two hour tour which is split into the story of the tunnel as a war time air raid shelter and the creation and use of the tunnel as a working wagon way. Interspersed with humour the stories of life in the tunnel were fascinating and the trip flew by. Just be warned if you are tall you will spend much of the tour stooping due to the low ceiling but it is certainly worth it. Thanks to both our guides for an excel,net and informative tour the time flew by."
Victorin tunnel,"Went on the tour by myself, soon felt part of a group with the guides making it feel an inclusive experience. The tour was really interesting & informative and that was from our guides who were Donald & Phil very knowledgable & entertaining. The 2 hours whizzed by & I got a good feeling of what it was like for both the victorians making it, those who worked there & the people who had to use it during WW2. Highly recommend and the surrounding area is worth checking out."
"Fascinating place, run by volunteers","We did the two hour tour and found it thoroughly enjoyable. It was a fantastic afternoon and my whole family loved it! The caves are really interesting and I hope to see more investment for a great cause. Our guides Andrew and Pete were very knowledgeable and lots of fun. All in all, we had a smashing time and I cannot recommend it enough!"
A Worthwhile and Interesting Tour,A great and inexpensive two hour guided tour carried out by Trevor and Pete - two exceptionally knowledgeable chaps and both with a sense of humour. If you like history and you like being amazed at what lies underneath our beautiful city don’t miss this trip.
Interesting local history tour,We booked for the two hour tour and really enjoyed hearing about it's wartime use as an air- raid shelter and it's early history as a coal transport tunnel as well as a bit about the local area. Pete was interesting and funny and they tunnel was warm enough and not bad underfoot - and anyway you get a hard hat and torch just in case. My only improvement would be for the guides to do more of the talking near the seats so those of us who don't find standing in say could have a periodic sit down - but otherwise excellent
Very interesting we’ll organised trip.,The staff knew their local history and made the experience very interesting Hard hats and torches are provided. Would strongly recommend sensible shoes as there are some small puddles of water on the path. A Sunday visit could be followed by a walk along Newcastle Quayside Market. There are often special offers on Groupon.
History brought to life,"I love History, I love Newcastle, the combination of both is just breathtaking. The tunnel is an experience that immerses you, it wows you with it’s engineering and it’s use for coal transportation to subsequently being used as a shelter from the bombings of the Second World War. History was brought alive, you could imagine the dirt, the smell, the cramped conditions and the fear of being sheltered there during bombing raids. Peter and Donald were both very knowledgable guides, their passion for the tunnel and the Ouseburn area shone through. The two hours flew over and I could have spent a lot longer in the tunnel enjoying the atmosphere, the stories, the engineering and the geology!It’s fantastic to see and experience living History."
Fantastic tour,We were given a voucher for the tour for Christmas last year so decided to use it today.  Booked online without any problem.The whole trip was awesome. Jen and Barry were so knowledgeable and made it fun too. What a thought that this exists just below our feet and you would never know. Lots of interesting facts and made you think about what it would have been like during and air raid or when the coal trucks were running down. Thanks for an amazing experience - will be recommending to others xxx
Amazing,"I really struggle with the adjectives to describe how good this attraction is. From start to finish Peter and Donald provided an experience, adventure, history lesson and entertainment which was second to none. We went through as a group of 7 which was quite a privilege. I can't recommend this enough, and then lunch at the Tyne, perfect."
W.I.visit to Victoria Tunnel,"30 members of our W.I. enjoyed a most witty , informative tour of the tunnel lying under the city of Newcastle. We were all given torches and the option to donn hard hats if we were tall and were escorted into the depths of the earth in two groups by our tour guides, Bill and Phil.They were both very knowledgeable and told some very interesting facts about the history of the tunnel, life in Victorian days, and the period during the Second World War when the tunnel was used as an airaid shelter. many thanks to them both, a most fascinating morning"
Lancashire school friends reunion,"A wonderful end to a great school reunion weekend. This one hour tour was so interesting and informative with our guides Phil and Ian really bringing it all to life. They were interesting, humourous and obviously passionate about the history of the tunnel. That passion really rubbed off. Thank you so much. Will definitely recommend to friends and come back myself."
Short trip to Newcastle,"A great tour from a couple of very knowledgeable guides, the tunnel and the history surrounding it was so interesting, it's surprising the place isn't more well known."
Great way to spend an hour,"I did the hour tour. I believe that there are longer tours. My tour guides were Dee and Phil, both volunteers. Dee walked us to the entrance the tunnel, talking us through some of the highlights of the Ouseburn valley that were pertinent to the tour before taking us inside the tunnel. She walked us through the tunnel, telling us a bit about its most recent history and its role in World War Two as an air raid shelter that protected up to 7,000 of the city's inhabitants at a time. Phil then walked us back, telling us about the construction of the tunnel, its role in the industrial revolution and the coal mining industry on Tyneside and the entertaining story about an accident in the tunnel and how William Coulson lost his life. A very interesting tour and thoroughly worth a visit."
The Tunnel to end all Tunnels,"Fantastic friendly staff and what a fantastic place absolutely breathtaking to visit. The Tunnel has to be seen to be believed. A true wondrous experience for subterranean tourists and people interested in underground tunnels that go under the ground horizontally. try the souvenier shop is packed with Tunnel related novelties for people who like that sort of stuff. Very reasonably priced too. Apparently misconception is that people think its named after Victoria Beckham but its actually named after Victoria Wood. Built in AD67 by a Roman Architect Pisshedius, the story goes it was originally meant to be another Wall but he got the plans upside down. I'm a bit of a solitary person (excuse for having nae pals) and I visited alone but its a great venue for a date I reckon, I have my eye on a tidy receptionist in the Vermont but she is more interested in smoking and getting steaming but I'm trying to persuade her there is more in life than fags and bevvy. There is Tunnels to be viewed and walked through."
Great tour.,"We tried the Victoria Tunnel tour due to the trip advisor reviews and thoroughly enjoyed it. While the subject is undoubtely very interesting it was really made by Dee and Phil the tour guides.  Both the history as an air raid shelter and from its construction were told in a really engaging way. We were on the 1hr tour (which actually lasted a wee bit longer) which was great. If we're back in Newcastle I'd certainly be keen to do the longer one. Really engaging, interesting and excellent value. Its a nice walk down the Ouse back to the quayside as well."
Great two hour tour.,"Really enjoyed the tour. Our guides Pete and Donald were both knowledgeable and enthusiastic, relaying stories about the building of the tunnel, it's use to carry coals down to the river and it's later use as an air-raid shelter during the war. Well worth a visit"
Excellent one hour tour,"Brilliant tour, guides very knowledgable and answered all questions asked. Interesting place and lots of information given. Ordered a guide book also which is very informative."
Great find,"Never knew the Victoria tunnel existed, what a great find so interesting and the guides were so very knowledgable, definitely worth a visit"
Excellent,"Fascinating tour of a unique place under the city. You will always remember the stories of what went on here, from the coal-shipping days to when  it was a wartime air-raid shelter."
Fascinating and Enjoyable Tour,"I took part in a one-hour tour on 26th of September with James and Pete, who were both fantastic. The tour was informative regarding several parts of the local area, the guides had good humour, and I discovered that being in the pitch-black dark in a tunnel below ground gives me the same thrill that rollercoasters give other people.It was a fantastic experience and I definitely plan to sign up for a full two-hour tour at some point in the future!"
Victorian Tunnel tour by 'Pete',"Thank you Pete for showing us around the Victorian tunnel on Sep 14th 2019.You made our 2 hour visit most interesting and memorable with lots of fab stories and humour added in. I had been wanting to visit for years and was so pleased that i did.I can highly recommend this tour and was so happy that it was made so interesting by our guide Pete... the 2 hours went over so quickly. Thank you again,Ella"
Interesting History lesson,"Ouseburn is an interesting part of old Newcastle & the tunnel & it’s story is well worth a visit. Diane & Dee (Thelma & Louise) ??Ask them ! Were really entertaining and never boring. They both know their subject and make you smile. But be warned, strong footwear & warm clothing is essential. Even with a constant 12 degrees it gets cool after an hour or so in the tunnel.During our tour, we had others from Wales, Liverpool, Northampton & Essex.Being from the North East some of the anecdotes were surprising, revealing & interesting. Booking essential but well worth it. Well done girls & the Ouseburn trust."
Informative and fun visit to this hidden gem,We visited the tunnel on a hot August day so were pleased to be in the cool. We found out that the tunnel is always the same temperature whatever the weather outside. We booked the 1 hour tour and wore jackets over our T-shirts but I would recommend an extra layer if going for the 2 hour tour as well as thicker socks if you get cold feet.We were led by 2 guides who firstly went through all the necessary H and S details before leading us to get our hard hats and torches.The guides were full of information and they provided humour as well-we really enjoyed our tour and learnt a lot about the history of Newcastle as well as facts about the make up of the tunnel.It did not feel at all scary or claustrophobic and our well being was checked at all times.This is definitely worth putting on your visit list. We booked ahead on line which was a good thing to do as the tours get very full and you cannot often just turn up and get spaces-especially if you are a group.
"Very interesting one hour tour with Miriam and Phil, this morning.","Two stories to the tunnel, as a coal tunnel and an air raid shelter, both brought to life by the very pleasant and knowledgeable Miriam and Phil. Really enjoyed it, and learnt a lot. Thank you both."
Tunnel,Excellent tour for locals and tourists. Our tour guides Trev and James made it very interesting.  Thoroughly recommend it. The two hours flew by.
Fabulous and interesting,"Please ignore the snowflakes who give tour any less than 4 stars.  Peter, was our tour guide and despite being one volunteer down he kept us informed, entertained and moving along the tunnel.   The time passed incredibly quickly but I learnt so much in that time. I am shocked this tour is only £8 and left and extra in the box as it was easily worth that.  Brilliant visit, wear walking shoes and a waterproof but definitely go."
Interesting visit,Having some free time in the city we looked on trip advisor and came across this hidden gem. Very interesting with engaging and knowledgable guides. We did the one hour trip and feel that was a good length of time to get the feel for the place.
Interesting ,"I thought the tunnel may have been longer, as I know it stretches to the moor, however the talk was really interesting and I’d certainly recommend it for any locals as well as visitors to the area."
First Class.,What a wonderful experience this was. The tour is so interesting and made absolutely superb by Iain and Malcolm our guides. This is something you must do when in Newcastle. We should have gone before now but it was well worth the wait.
Great.,The Guides Diane and Donald presented information so well. I didn't realise that we had been on the tour for two hours - it felt much less. Fascinating details given about the history of the tunnel.
What a wonderful tour,"A totally absorbing and interesting experience. The two guides were so professional and knowledgeable. All in all a very enjoyable experience, Thanks."
Brilliant guides,Just been on this tour which was much better than expected. Our guides (Mal & Andrew) were fantastic. They were really enthusiastic and told some great stories.Well worth a visit.
Very interesting look at the tunnels,"Interesting tour of the tunnels, great way to spend an hour and our guide Gerrard was very informative and made the tour even better"
"Interesting historical tour, and good value for money!","Booked online, and visited on a Sunday afternoon. We opted for the hour tour and we all enjoyed it. Andrew our guide was knowledgeable, friendly and funny, and it was a great way to spend an hour out of the heat of the afternoon sun (the tunnel stays at a constant temperature of 12 degrees). Ideal for first visitors to Newcastle, or Geordies alike; it was an enjoyable tour!"
Top tour finding out about underground Newcastle with Phil and Ian,"Took a tour today with Phil and Ian - really informative, interesting and enjoyable. The 1 hour tour was the only one we could book for bank holiday but it managed to pack tons in - would definitely recommend a visit. No special kit needed (torch and hard hat provided!) Hope to come back again and do the longer tour next time"
Family day out to Victoria Tunnels,"Really interesting visit to the Victoria Tunnels yesterday. We hadn't realised what history lay hidden beneath Newcastle's busy streets!Our guides, Ian & Jeff, did a fantastic job...very knowledgeable, interesting and good fun!Well worth a visit!"
Holiday,Very interesting and worth doing. A bit disappointed that the the sound effects were not working as this would have made it even better.
Victoria Tunnel,"Went today with my family, my children are 8 and 5 and we all loved this excellent, fun, insightful tour. We did the one hour tour which was just right for the children. Phil and Trev were the tour guides, they showed great knowledge and made the tour great fun with their little anecdotes and Geordie humour. This tour is a must if your are visiting Newcastle."
"Incredible, Friendly, Funny, Very Interesting. Highly recommend!!","My partner and I (in our 20’s) visited the Victoria tunnels tour today for the one hour session in the afternoon. The tour was led by Malcolm and Ian.  We thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish and have learnt a lot about the local area, both current information and historic. The tour itself is remarkable, you are lead through the tunnel and told lots of information about it. Malcolm and Ian were amazing tour guides. They were funny, friendly, very intelligent and entertaining for everyone in our group (vast range of ages). The type of guys you could imagine being popular in any crowd - true gents always making sure the group whilst underground were happy, safe and enjoying themselves. If you’re visiting Newcastle start by doing this first! You learn a lot about what to do from the guys here and get a great idea about what’s around and why. All in all, 10\10. Thanks guys! Michael & Georgia, Cambridge"
Enjoyed it,Good tour and a great job by the guides. It was very interesting.Trevor and Phil were excellent guidesThanks for a fun time.
As a second world war air raid shelter,"Very interesting story about the use of the tunnel during the 2nd world war, the conditions were not very good but then again it was safe from air raids, also the original use was also very interesting 2 hours and a very good walk along this section of tunnel that's still accessible about 1/3 mile . the original length was about 2 miles. well worth a visit."
Better damp than Dead,"My wife and I attended today,21st August, the 2 hour tour of the Victoria Tunnel. What an amazing experience. Our tour guides, Pete and Barry, were full of information and witty stories. Their knowledge of the complete history of the tunnel was outstanding. They made you feel that you were part of the tunnel’s history from Victorian times through to a World War 2 shelter. The tour was very relaxed and health and safety was foremost. We can throughly recommend this experience for all ages. Well done lads and thank you."
2 hours underground pleasure,"Just completed a 2 hour tour of the Victoria Tunnel in Newcastle. Absolutely excellent guide Pete with trainee Barry. Managed to handle a wide range of ages, very engaging and humorous as well as informative. Highly recommend  this"
Great history ,You must see this if your visiting  Newcastle. Book online perfect guide  took me  to a magical place and time hidden beneath the city
Evocative underground insight,"A historically rich and interesting narrative unfolded as we spent 2 hours learning about the heritage of the tunnel. The eras covered were: the Second World War and the Industrial Revolution. There were many connections made to the lives of the ordinary people linked to and affected by the tunnel, which only served to make the experience more vivid and relatable. Thoroughly recommended."
Victoria Tunnel,"Excellent tour, a 3 hour visit went by in a flash. The tour guides were really knowledgeable and covered every aspect of the history of the tunnel. I would recommend anyone of any age paying a visit to this hidden gem."
Newcastle’s underground heritage,"We took a guided one hour tour of the Victoria Tunnel with the fabulous tour guides Phil and Kay! There’s so much history here starting in 1838 to present. The tour is suitable for all ages, very informative and educational. It was 12 degrees Celsius underground so if you come from a warmer climate take a jacket! Highly recommend this tour - from coal transport to bomb shelter to tourism! Kay talks about the war - Phil gives you the pre war history!"
Wow,A really interesting experience - went on  the two hour tour with Andrew and Pete. Really gave a sense of how the tunnels had been used .
Night with friends,Great experience reliving the past Tour for all ages Children from about 7 upwards would find this really interésting Book though as fairly popular
A very interesting tour,An interesting tour by Phil and Andrew.  We learned a lot about how the tunnel was constructed to move coal by train from the mines to the docks and then how it was altered to make an air raid shelter in WW2. My husband is 6ft2 and had no problems with the height of the tunnel. The tunnel was damp underfoot in places but was easy to negotiate. We were visiting from Birmingham and it was worth the visit. Also interesting was the walk along the river by the urban farm and over the old bridge.
Going underground.,"If you are visiting Newcastle, try and get yourself on a tour of the tunnel? We did the 2hr tour with our two guides. Part 1 going up the tunnel getting the history of how it was used during the second world war and part 2 was coming back down the tunnel getting the history of how, why the tunnel was constructed. It is quite damp and cool underground so bear this in mind. You get issued with a hard hat and torch."
No. 1 in Newcastle for a reason,"Do this tour and you will stand in the shoes of the men who literally dug this tunnel by hand, workers who faced deadly risks on a daily basis on the tunnel's  wagonway and civilians who sheltered from bombs dropped on Newcastle during WWII. The tour guides, Donald and Pete were nothing short of excellent."
Very informative and interesting,"This was 2 hours in one. The first half told of the  tunnel in use for up to 8000 people as an air raid shelter in WW2 and was great for my grandson who is learning  about WW2 at school. The second part was the history of the tunnel in Victorian times and the reason it was built to transport coal from the pit to the river. The guide explained how it was built using excellent Victorian engineering. Our guides Donald and Pete were excellent, very knowledgeable and amusing. This was a superb experience for us all."
War baby,"As an exiled Geordie and someone who was taken to shelter in the sister tunnel,the Ouseburn Culvert,during the war I was always keen to visit the Victoria Tunnel.Thanks to Ian and Peter I managed to join a recent group during a visit "" home"".They then presented a fascinating 2 hour tour of the tunnel and its history.Very knowledgable and interesting this was all that it promised.   A most enjoyable experience."
Fun and fascinating,Great tour of this Victorian tunnel. Phil and Bill our guides were enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the history of the tunnel in the Industrial Revolution and Second World War. The tunnel itself is in amazing condition and fun to explore.
Phil and Bill nailing “Victoria’s Passage”,We thoroughly enjoyed our tour in the Victoria Tunnel! Our tour guides Phil and Bill were a great duo to lead us in and out of “Victoria’s Passage”. The tour included a informative history of the tunnel which was presented fantastically by Phil and Bill who provided many family appropriate anecdotes.
Fascinating Tour,We booked the hour long tour amd were all really interested by the history of the tunnel. Our guides were Peter and Ian and they retold the stories of the past brilliantly and really brought them back to life for us. My children aged 14 and 10 were also drawn in. The tour was great and I would certainly take the 2 hour one if I was back in the area.
Excellent insight into Newcastle's past,"Great attraction run by volunteers who are very informative and have a great way of passing on the history of the tunnels in a fun and inspiring way.  The tunnels are, I think, the last ones that are still accessible, the rest, I believe, are unstable or have been filled in.  tour guides were great at telling the story of the tunnels, why they were built in the first place and also what they were used for during WW2.  There's also a ghost story too.  Would really recommend this tour.  Well done folks."
Very informative and fascinating tour.,"The tour was excellent. It was well paced and delivered by Peter and Donald who were very knowledgeable guides with a good sense of humour. I personally would have preferred the historical information to have been given starting with the construction of it before the war years use, but that’s only a small point. It was a thoroughly enjoyable experience and good value. Thanks."
Perfect ,The tunnel has a special atmosphere and comes alive with the fantastic guides with stories about WW2 and the origin of the tunnel. Something you must do when you are in Newcastle.
Fantastic!!,"This is a MUST DO excursion when you are visiting Manchester. Take bus #22 behind the Early Grey statue and exit at the blackfriers pub. There you walk down, following the signs off Ouseburn Farm. There nearly next to it, opposite the big, stone chimney, you will find the entrance to the Victoria Tunnel. Some pubs are around if you fancy food or drink. Tell them you visit the tunnel, so you will get 10% discount. I told you this description, since it took me one hour and a hell of questioning, to find out where it was. The tour done by Kevin and Dave, was absolutely great!! They tell amazing interesting stories, full of humor and enthousiasm. When I left the tunnel, I felt I went back to the 18th century."
Excellent visit,Interesting tour with excellent tour guide. Our little cousins (6&4) loved it. Pete our guide was excellent.
"Great experience, highly recommended","This was a fascinating tour of a hidden gem in Newcastle. Me and my partner took the 2 hour tour and loved it. The guides are very knowledgeable and engaging.The tour was broken up into 2 halves. The journey from the surface to the deepest accessible point focuses on the tunnel's role during WWII, and the journey in reverse focusing on the construction and original use. I only wish more of the tunnel was accessible to the public."
Great experience of local history,Brilliant piece of well-preserved local history. Been several times already n it never ceases to amaze.
Hidden Gem - Favourite part of my Newcastle trip,"The Victoria Tunnel is well worth a visit with it’s fantastic history and an interesting tour. I don’t normally do tours but this one was exceptional, there’s so many stories and information about this tunnel that you definitely needed someone to tell you about for you to understand the tunnel and it’s history. 100% recommend to anyone who’s looking for something to do in Newcastle as it was my favourite moment of my trip."
2 hour trip - highlight of the visit,"Fantastic tour of the tunnel from beginning to end expertly led by Anne and Dave.  We have wanted to do this trip for a long time and finally got booked in.  We were not disappointed a real highlight of any trip to Newcastle.  With age ranging 12-73 it is difficult to find an attraction which interests all, this definitely hit the spot and we learned so much about the original wagon way and its subsequent use as an air raid shelter."
1 Hour excursion into Victorian Tunnels,Absolutely fantastic 1 hour trip through history. Mariam and Andrew were excellent guides. It's a pity we couldn't do the 2 hour trip. Highly recommended. If I'm ever back in Newcastle will do the 2 hour version for definite.
Excellent! ,"The two guides Dave and Trev, were both very knowledgable and friendly. The tour is a tale of two periods of time and is pitched perfectly. Very well recommended."
Fun and informative,Our family went on the 1 hour tour and had so much fun. Pete and Georgia where very knowledgeable. My daughter learned a lot and had fantastic time. Would recommend it to be a must see.
Excellent guides that brought history to life,An excellent experience with great commentary by two super guides! Thank you Dave and Malcom. Atmospheric and educational and well worth visiting.
Wonderful - thank you Diane,"Excellent tour by Diane. Well paced and exceptionally interesting. Always fascinating to know of the catacombs once employed by our cities still standing, albeit hidden away, today."
Fascinating  tour,"After a safety talk we were guided  to the entrance of the tunnel, being shown various points of interest along the way.The whole tour lasts 2 hours with about 90 minutes actually in the tunnel.We were given a hard hat and a torch each.The first  half of the tour is all about how the tunnel was used in World War 2 and the second half about how and why it was created in early Victorian times. The volunteer guides were fascinating and interesting. Highly recommended if you don't suffer from claustrophobia!!"
Underground History ,"Well I knew these tunnels existed but never got the time to make a visit. I was not disappointed. The Victoria Tunnel is a subterranean waggonway that runs under Newcastle upon Tyne, England, from the Town Moor down to the River Tyne. It was built between 1839 and 1842 to transport coal from Leazes Main Colliery in Spital Tongues to riverside staithes ready for loading onto boats for export.From here it travels under Northumbria University, Central Motorway and Shieldfield to St Dominic's. However the whole tunnel is not fully open for safety reasons but you spend a good 2 and half hours from start to finish of the tour. The tour guides are trained volunteers and are very knowledgeable on the history of the tunnels and informed us they were used as air raid shelters during WW2 and by courting couples in later years. You can make your own mind up to what they may of been doing. Well worth a visit."
A trip back in time,"Everyone in the North East should visit this!  So much of our history in one (very) confined space.We visited with a U3A group, and took the longer 2-hour tour.  Our guide Pete was brilliant - informative, knowledgeable, a good communicator and what really communicates is his passion for the Tunnel.After a briefing we  went for a walk round the fascinating Ouseburn Conservation Area, a real village within a stone's throw of the city centre.  This gives a lot of context. Then the Tunnel itself - hard hats, torches and bracingly cool after the sun outside.We learned about the Tunnels's use in WW2 as an air raid shelter, about the early days, the industrial background, the planning and construction, the glory days and the gory days.  The volunteers do a nice line in sound effects in the dark.Wartime toilet facilities feature prominently in the history, if I can get some photos to upload that explains the table decoration in the office for the briefing!I would recommend this to anyone interested in our area, and reasonably steady on their feet."
Victoria Tunnel ,Very enjoyable visit to a place I knew nothing about. Excellent example of Victorian engineering and ingenuity. Pete was a knowledgeable and entertaining guide.
Interesting and awesome,An excellent tour with knowledgeable guides who really lived the experience with their personality’s Very inspiring with no modern day help.Would recommend to anyone to go down and imagine the life these people had before and during the war.
"An excellent, informative  place to visit in Newcastle, the guides were brilliant making the experience come to life.","I througly enjoyed the experince of going down in the tunnel which was made so more intersting by the two guides who not only were very knowledgeable about the tunnel and the surounding area both on and underground.  They made it more realistic by encouring us to use all our senses, which enabled a feeling of how it would have been when used both as a mining tunnel and air raid shelter.  I would recomend going to this historic place and would visit it again with my family.  I drove and found both parking and the site easily."
Victoria tunnel tour,Excellent tour. Very interesting and informative guides Bruce and Andrew. Can’t recommend it enough.
Pre-booked Tour,"Excellent tour very well organised and extremely informative.The 2 guides Donald and Peter we're knowledgeable and very entertaining.Highly recommended this attraction, but for best return book the 2 hour tour"
Thanks again from the lads,"Thank you to Peter (with help from Daniel) for the longer, two hour tour of the tunnel.  Once again we all had a lovely time!"
Victoria tunnel tour,"Thoroughly enjoyed this Tunnel Tour under our city, very organised trip and extremely amazing. The guides were first class and made the talks about the usage of the tunnel very interesting. As locals we found it fantastic as did the foreign sightseers who were on our trip. I would thoroughly recommend the 2 hour tunnel tour to anyone"
Fantastic guided tour,"I always think you get so much more from a guided tour with a real person than any other way of seeing a place and this tour proved exactly that. Donald and Pete were funny, entertaining, knowledgeable. There are two parts to the tour - the WW2 side and the original history. I am more interested in industrial heritage so enjoyed the Victorian history more but the WW2 story is brilliantly told as well. And the walk around the valley at the start puts it all in perfect context. And there is a discount in some local cafes and pubs if you show your tickets! I can heartily recommend The Ship Inn."
Amazing attraction with excellent tour guides,"We were only spending one day and  one night in Newcastle and decided to do this attraction. We booked a 1.30pm tour for Friday and Jeff and Pete were our tour guides, the tour took 2 hours which I initially thought would be far to long.However the two hours flew by as we were enthralled by our enthusiastic and knowledgeable guides.If you only have time for one attraction in Newcastle I would highly recommend this one as it really is fantastic."
"Interesting tour, well worth a visit","This was a great tour, we did the 2 hour tour, and our guides Donald and Peter were great, very knowledgeable on the history of the tunnel, both the reason why it was built and it’s use in WW2 as an air raid shelter, loved the history of the place, only found out about it after a google search of what to do in Newcastle, so pleased we did, would highly recommend this tour, just wear warm clothing and decent footwear"
Great Trip Out & Great Volunteers,"Went for Father's day with no idea what it was going to be like/ any of the history. Pete and Claire (the tour guides) do a very good job of telling the story of the tunnel and you learn a lot about its history. Pete was great and enthusiastic which really made the tunnel's history come alive.The tunnel was surprisingly clean and I would probably go on the 2-hour tour if I was to do it again with different family members. The additional guide book is definitely worth the extra £3 its packed full of good stuff. Overall, highly recommended - keep up the good work Pete and Claire!"
Fascinating....and more,"Interesting and enjoyable tour of Newcastle’s Victoria Tunnels led by Pete complete with his wartime warden’s uniform. I went a number of years ago for the 2 hour tour of the 4km tunnels; yesterday I went with two pals on the 1 hour tour plus afternoon tea at the lovely Hotel du Vin and it proved a very worthwhile refresher. Attention to H&S (protective helmets and torches) as you’d expect these days, but some serious local history and fun anecdotes shared along the way. Although it was dark and very limited space, at no time did I feel claustrophobic, such was the pace and interest of the tour. Pete was a very knowledgeable volunteer who answered all our questions and didn’t object to his photo being taken😀! Tea at Hotel du Vin was delicious in attractive surroundings with as much tea/ coffee as you wanted. Restaurant and bar staff very friendly and helpful. Well recommended!"
Spooky!,Stick with the guides and do not venture off by yourself or you'll be in a for a hell of a time! Fascinated with the history of this place.
Excellent tour of tunnel,"We went on a tour of the tunnel led by the excellent Pete. The tour was interesting, informative and entertaining. We learnt some of the history and what it was like to be in the tunnel during air raids. Some parts of the floor can be a bit damp so I'd advise strong shoes. The tours get filled very quickly so book as soon as you can."
Excellent tour,This was an excellent and bet informative tour given by our guides Peter and Donald.  They were very knowledgeable and shared great stories.
Whats under your feet... ,"Thanks to Esther and Dave for a brilliant two hours. Bringing this bit of history of the Toon, made me realise what's under my feet? I would recommend this to local Geordies, travellers from afar and those wanting to do something totally different. Once again BRILLIANT!!"
Thanks Ester and Dave for a great tour! Highly recommend,"We booked this tour as we had seen the high recommendation on trip advisor and it did not disappoint. Fantastic history within the tunnel that you would never have noticed if you didn’t take a tour down it, the guides are volunteers and were brilliant thanks Dave and Ester (sorry for any incorrect spelling) you were awesome. If you love history this tour is a must!"
Great,Great tour with lots of interesting facts. Dave and Esther volunteer guides were great. Would recommend to everyone looking for something different.
Fantastic,"We did the two hour tour this weekend and it was amazing. I don't think the cost reflects just how good it is, I would definatley pay more. Our tour guides were fantastic, not only knowledgeable but funny too! They did an amazing job at keeping in entertained and giving us the history which was fascinating. They we also very reassuring that if the tunnels made us feel unwell for any reason they would take us out with no inconvenience to them. Just fantastic, 100% worth doing"
Excellent guides,"I did the 2-hour tour of this tunnel last weekend. It was a brilliant activity, mostly because of the two fantastic guides we had. The guides were funny, engaging, and passionate. It was a real pleasure to be on this tour. I recommend it to all!"
Fantastic,Been to the tunnel today was absolutely brilliant had a fab time the couple doing the tunnel guide  were truly amazing
Tunnel tour,This was extremely interesting and Donald and Peter certainly did a good job explaining its history. Excellent value. Be careful if your tall as these tunnels are not very high. Hard hat and torch provided. Do wear sensible clothing and footwear. It is very chilly down there Certainly recommend it
Wonderful Tour/Exceptional Guides,"Special thanks to the volunteer guides (sorry guys I forgot your names) who were knowledgeable, friendly and full of an array of knowledge. The tour was exciting and paced in a way that you could really take in the tunnels importance to the history of Newcastle. I would recommend highly and encourage anyone visiting the city to check it out."
Victoria Tunnel Tour ,"Wanted to book a one house tour (having a teenage son with me, I wasn't sure how this tour would go down), but having booked only one day ahead it had to be the two hour. I needn't have worried. Peter and Malcolm, our volunteer guides gave our group a very entertaining and informative tour. Being reasonably local and having visited Newcastle on many occasions over the years, I had no idea this was here. Truly deserved #1 listing on TripAdvisor."
Fascinating tour,"We had read the reviews of this tour before we booked, (booking is essential as numbers are restricted) but I still didn't imagine that it was going to be as interesting as it turned out.  Pete and Esther were our guides and they were a great double act, taking turns to describe the various uses of the tunnel and engaging stories from the past.The tour takes two hours, and they passed very quickly. We all learned so much about the construction if the tunnel and its various uses from the era of the industrial revolution to their use as shelters in the Second World War.  All fascinating stuff.The two guides were mindful of our comfort at all times, too.I guess this is not a visit for the claustrophobic, but torches and hard hats make it entirely safe.An excellent experience"
Wonderful Victorian engineering with an interesting history,This tour of part of a Victorian 2.4 mile tunnel built to take coal from pit to river under what was then the town of Newcastle is a fascinating place to explore with the knowledgeable and entertaining city guides. Using waste stone from the nearby building projects of Richard Grainger and bricks made from the clay removed from the tunnel it used gravity to take the coal wagons down to the river for only 18 years. It was then used as an air raid shelter in WWII and there are some fascinating tales to be told.
Interesting and worth a visit,"There was only availability for the hour tour as we only booked 24 hours in advance. If you plan to visit definately book well in advanced. The tour guides were great, Andrew and Jen. Clearly passionate about what they do and really wanted to be there which was lovely as they are voulenteers. Hour was plenty to get an idea and the overall experience of the tunnel. I am 8 months pregnant but found the access and walking easy. My husband at 6ft 3 also didnt have any issue with space, a few knocks on the head but that's what the hard hat is for :)Generally found the tour very interesting and for £7 a ticket  would reccommend as a informative, something different, thing to do when visiting Newcastle."
"Informative, interesting & funny","What a fabulous tour, well worth the £8 ticket price. We did the 2 hour tour and the time just flew. The 2 guides were Andrew & Davy, they were very knowledgeable and made the tour informative and funny. Would highly recommend."
Amazing and informative,"Booked this tour for myself and partner, despite his reluctance....for fear of rats! From the minute we arrived at the meeting point, we were greeted with warmth and hospitality, a concise explanation of what the tour involved and safety guidelines. We were escorted by Peter and Donald, who both have outstanding knowledge and enthusiasm, which came through during the tour. We were treat to a bit of history about the Ouseburn itself and then into the tunnel. It’s hard to believe that it lies below the busy matrix of roads, Metro and pedestrian footpaths, without any hint of what lies below. A great experience and a must do, not only for visitors to the NE, but locals, who want to learn a little more about the rich history of this area."
Quite an experience!,"Our hour-long tour of the tunnels was guided by a funny, knowledgable guide who told us of the origin of the tunnels. They were built  to bring down coal in trucks on an inclined slope directly to the Tyne. He illustrated his talk with some rather gruesome details of accidents that had happened in the past - making it very atmospheric when our torches were turned off & the sound of a run-away truck getting closer & closer made to imagination run wild!  Also the explanations of the tunnels use as air-raid shelters during WW2 brought that worrying time to life for us youngsters."
Subterranean history of Newcastle,I brought my friend to the Victoria Tunnels when they visited me at uni. Not the usual part of Newcastle I would show someone for their first time here but it was interesting and gave me something new to do in the rain.
Brilliant,"We had the most amazing experience walking through the Victoria Tunnels for two hours. On the outward journey we learnt about the use of the Tunnels in WW2 as air raid shelters, how 9000 people sheltered in 21/4 miles of tunnels. (We didn’t walk 21/4 miles!) On the way back we were told what the tunnels were originally used for, moving coal from one pit to the boats on the quay.  Both guides - Douglas and Pete were so informative and knowledgeable.  I would definitely recommend this attraction of amazing history."
Victoria Tunnel Tour,"Myself, husband and 11 year old son took the one hour tour in the Victoria Tunnel Tour today. It’s something we’ve wanted to do for a while and weren’t disappointed! Our tour guide Phil was fantastic. Very knowledgeable but really funny and entertaining as well and he really included our son who was the only child on this tour. We would all highly recommend anyone booking for a visit and are looking forward to going back for the two hour tour in the future to learn more. A definite 5 stars"
Fantastic one-hour tour,Fascinating one-hour tour left us wanting more. Phil was a very entertaining guide and kept everyone enthralled with stories of the tunnel’s history. Particularly atmospheric when we turned off our torches. A great local attraction. Highly recommended.
Team building day out ,"For someone who is  Claustrophobic I was worried but it wasn’t bad at all. Both the tour guides Ian and Pete were brilliant. Very entertaining. Lots of laughs as well as very informative. Fully recommend for families, friends and older children. Excellent"
Victoria Tunnel,"We had looked forward to this tour with great anticipation. It surpassed our expectations and was superb in every respect. Fascinating information and brilliant guides, who told us all about the construction of the tunnel and its subsequent uses. A must visit for anyone living in or visiting the North East. Refreshments in the Ouseburn area were excellent too. Friendly staff all round and easy to book a tour. Excellent and reasonably priced literature to accompany the value for money event. Many volunteers involved. Lots going on in this area too, in the way of guided yours. Appreciation to all."
Underground into the past,"Having been aware of this for a number of years, we eventually booked up for the tour a number of weeks in advance. If you go for the middle tour on a Sunday it is the full two hour one. Interesting insight into the area and the tunnel both of us use during the second World War and how it was originally built from Spittal Tongues. Very interesting for anyone who is interest in history, local history or even to experience something different. Definitely recommended."
So interesting,"We spent a fascinating hour on the tunnel tour, some interesting stories of the region and how the tunnel played an important part."
Great local tour,Despite being a resident in Newcastle I did not know about the tunnels until 2 years ago. The tour was fascinating (especially knowing the area) and the guides were engaging. Enjoyed learning about the history of these tunnels.
Tunnelling into history,"The 2 hour tour of Victoria tunnel is an interesting insight into the history of Newcastle. Our engaging and entertaining guides, Dee and Andy, explained two periods of the tunnel’s story: its use as an air raid shelter during WW2 and its early years as a means of transporting coal from the mine to the river.The meeting point was easy to find. From there, it’s a short walk along the Ouseburn to the tunnel entrance, where visitors are kitted out with hard hats and torches. The walk is largely level, although the tunnel floor is wet and uneven in places, so sturdy footwear is advisable."
Really interesting tour.,"Needing to avoid the city ""hustle & bustle"" on a busy RUGBY week_end in Newcastle I booked the two hour afternoon tour. The meeting place was easily found using Google maps, the oft repeated advice by our guide to avail of a comfort break was noted by the all given that we were going to be in a tunnel with no facilities for nearly 2 hours. The highlight of the tour are the guides who explain the historical facts by thru story telling, recounting the key roles of the tunnel as both a transport system for coal and then an air raid shelter. Highly recommended as a cultural treat beneath the streets of Newcastle."
2 hour tour - excellent,"I did the 2 hour tour today on a very rainy Wednesday. The meet point is easy to get to, we parked at the cycle hub carpark and walked to the meet point in about 15 minutes. Toilet facilities are available at the meet point (none in tunnels). The guides, Peter and Bruce were very friendly and fun - their enthusiasm was very apparent. The tunnels are a short (and informative) walk from the meet point with interesting facts being shared along the way. Upon arrival at the entrance we were given a hard hat and torch. The tunnels are pretty clean, don't small bad and are always around 12 degrees C. Wear old clothing and waterproof shoes just in case - if you rub against some of the walls the rust can permanently stain. The tour is divided into the WW2 element and the pre war (victorian) element. It's really interesting and i highly recommend it. I'd say you don't need to be super fit to do it and it's not even as dark as I thought it would be as everyone has a powerful LED torch. Highly recommended."
Informative and Enjoyable ,"We booked on the 2 hour tour of this unique tunnel and our guides Bruce & Pete really brought the story to life.Despite it being a cold and wet day above ground, we were dry and at a constant temperature.I really liked that we learnt about 2 very different uses for the Tunnel in different centuries. Not difficult walking and relatively well lit with the torches (supplied). Would thoroughly recommend to anyone interested in industrial/social history."
Victoria Tunnels with the Sister of Shields WI,We had a brilliant day at the Victoria Tunnels. It was fantastic to learn some of history of Newcastle.Our guides Pete and Donald were both knowledgable and entertaining. Hats off to Pete who completed his 800 th tour yesterday! 🎉🎉.They really painted a picture of how the tunnels were used as air raid shelters during the 2nd world war and what life was like for the 7000 people who used them.The 2nd part of the tour explained how the tunnels were build and used as coal tunnels.Watch out for the spooky ending 👻
‘Better damp than dead!’,Really enjoyed our trip with Bruce and co. Very informative tour. The first bit is above ground while we made the short walk from the meeting point to the tunnel entrance. It’s then on with the hard hats and torches and into the tunnel.  On the outward walk we discovered the tunnels were used as bomb shelters in WW2 on the way back we heard about how and why the tunnel was made in the Victorian era.  There’s also a bit of a scary story and a blackout!  Definitely worth going but booking is essential as the groups are limited to 15.
One hour is plenty,Quite a build up to the tour of the tunnel with stories about railways and apartment-building disturbing the tunnel. But there’s not much to see !
A secret treasure,Last minute thing to go on the tour and totally enjoyed it.  Was a pleasant walk around the Ouseburn to start and then into the tunnel with hard hat and torch. Quite warm inside 12 degrees all the time apparently.  The guides gave some very interesting information Jen doing WW2 stories on the way in and then Pete doing the coal mining stories on the way out. We even had a round of happy birthday underground.Great afternoon would recommend it to all to support this adventure.
Stepping back in time was amazing!,"The Victoria Tunnel is an unusual piece of Tyneside history where you can get to grips with an amazing feat of engineering ; a tunnel built in the 1800’s to carry coal under the city of Newcastle.  It even goes underneath the Roman Wall . Many of us have walked on top of the Wall but never underneath it. The Ouseburn Valley is already vibrant area in Newcastle, but this tour is the “icing on the cake”, where people can find out lots about the history of the area when “Coal was King” and this amazing city prospered. You will also learn about its use throughout World War 2. You must book in advance so be aware that its popularity means you have to think ahead of your visit. The Guides, Donald and Jeff were dedicated to making the whole experience a wow! Both were experienced historians with a passion for helping visitors understand the history of this amazing space. With hard hats and torches , be prepared for an unusual and educational trip back in time. You won’t be disappointed!"
EXCELLENT HIDDEN GEM,"A unique experience in Newcastle. Very interesting with plenty of historical information delivered by Donald & Jeff, the volunteers, who were our guides & were excellent throughout our 2 hour tour. Would thoroughly recommend this experience. Suitable for all ages."
Tour or the Victoria tunnels in Newcastle upon Tyne.,We had really fun morning discovering the Victoria tunnels underneath Newcastle. Our tour guides were very informative and engaging. Would highly recommend doing this tour.
informative,Phil & Andrew took us around. We were shown some of the landmarks along the river before entering the tunnel.  Between them we learnt about its role during ww2 and its history and demise. Very good and would recommend this tour.
A must if in the area,"Lovely old place, give it a go spooky and fun for all the family, scared our daughter with stories of old."
Interesting and fun,"Andrew, our tour guide was great. He imparted loads of information and anecdotes about the tunnel and Ouseburn. The 2 hours flew by The format and group size was well suited to all ages.It was great to support the local charity"
Family trip,"What to do when the grown up family come home for a few days at Easter?  Turns out that a guided tour of the Victoria Tunnel is ideal!  Our group of 10 (a younger family for 4 + 2 couples, besides our adult family group) was expertly led by volunteer guide Pete.  We started from their fairly new HQ in the Ouseburn and then headed off to the tunnel entrance where we donned hard hats (definitely needed by the taller visitors!) and picked up torches.  Once inside we heard lots of facts, figures and tales of the tunnel's construction, use for coal transport and use as an air raid shelter. I will definitely book for the longer 2 hour tour when possible and recommend this tour to both locals and visitors to the city."
Excellent visit,"The North Eastern Geological Society were treated to a visit at the Victoria Tunnel ( April 2019)Lynne and Terry, our guides, started the visit with a fascinating introduction to the history of the tunnel. They recounted events and people to bring the history of the tunnel and its war time role as a safety site for locals during bombing raids. As geologists we were treated to a detailed explanation of the route of the tunnel. They took great care to explain the iron deposits from drainage outlets and the small stalactites growing from the cement. A truly memorable visit."
Birthday visit,"“Private” tour for 15 of us by the very knowledgeable Iain and Dee.They coped well with a wide age ranging group.  Very informative, they bring the history alive with lots of tales.Just be warned don’t wear your good white trainers, the iron ore might stain them.It’s a little damp but a stable 12 degrees.It’s the number one attraction for a reason!"
Outstanding tour of the Victoria tunnels.,"Our group, Blind Ambitions were interested in taking a tour of the Victoria tunnels in Newcastle and from the first point of contact the customer service was totally amazing.I contacted Clive Goodwin at the Ouseburn trust who run the attraction by email and he was very helpful. I explained our group were visually impaired and Clive not only arranged everything but gave us a discount. Kelly Thompson the secretary met us at Lime street and was extremely welcoming giving us a history of the tunnel and relayed some vital safety information we had to be aware of then introduced us to Mal and Pete who were to be our guides for the 2 hour tour underground. These guys are truly brilliant their knowledge of the attraction and their improvised dramaisation of the events of years gone by really made the tour for our group. I have been instructed by Blind Ambitions to thank everyone at the Ouseburn trust for sutch an amazing afternoon one that I am sure will be remembered by us all."
Interesting hidden gem,A really interesting insight into somewhere completely hidden - and mostly unknown to those in/visiting the town.  Fascinating history and a great way to spend a few hours.  You need to book - for accompanied viewing
"Fascinating,informative and great fun.",I did the 1 hour tour with my 8 year old grandson(1 hour long enough for that age) and we loved it. Peter the guide gave a brilliant tour with a good story at the end which my grandson keeps reciting. Well recommended.
Great history lesson find,We went on the 1 hr tour with our kids...hard hats and torches provided. The two volunteer guides were both passionate about 'our tunnels' and shared loads of really interesting information and stories about the tunnels history and uses. Definitely one not to miss if you are visiting Newcastle.
Surprisingly interesting,"We went on the 1 hour tour today, 2 adults with 8 and 10 yr old children. We all really enjoyed it. The guides, Trevor and Phil were very informative and friendly too.Their interesting stories of events that happened in the tunnel bought it too life for all of us. Would recommend this tour to anyone."
Fascinating,"We have visited the Victoria Tunnel on the 1.30pm, 2 hour tour today.We all thoroughly enjoyed the tour with Geoff and his fellow guide (the WWII expert). Yes, is you are over 6ft tall, there will be height issues in some areas.No, we didn’t get dirty. You don’t have to touch the walls but the floor is wet in places. Also be prepared for the occasional drippy mini staligtite (?). Helmets and torches are provided so no darkness issues.Very friendly group and excellent value."
A must see...,A birthday gift for my dad and what an amazing 2 hours with the delightful guides Pete and Georgie. They were both brilliant at telling the history of the tunnel and Newcastle. It gives you a real insight to what life must have been like in the 1800's and WW2. We would highly recommend this and definitely a must see.
Surprisingly good,You don't expect a tunnel to be particularly interesting but the guides (Bill and Phil I think they were) did a brilliant job in bringing this Victorian engineering wonder to life with lots of info about the Ouseburn area as well as the tunnel itself. Wandering around Ouseburn (the cradle of the industrial revolution in Newcastle) after visiting the tunnel with all that information and history fresh in our minds was really rather special and it really is a great place to visit. Although do visit the tunnel as well otherwise you'll miss out so much! Hard hats and torches obligatory so I think kids would love it.
A Really Super Guided Tour.,"We were made welcome on arrival, after which we were led on a short tour of the immediate area with a description of what the industries and dwellings were during the period when the tunnel was created and used. We were then taken to the tunnel entrance, where we we provided with helmets and torches and began our journey into the tunnel. I can only praise the couple who led us, as we had regular stops with lots of interesting stories of things that went on during the long period the tunnel has existed. I can thoroughly recommend a visit."
Unique and interesting,What an interesting tour full of excellent information and sprinkled with humour. Diane told about the tunnel’s use as a mass air-raid shelter and Pete told us about the original project of the tunnel being built to take coal 2.2miles down to the Tyne. These guys are volunteers which made it all the more impressive!
Fantastic Tour! ,I’ve known about the Tunnel for ages and we just haven’t got round to a visit until today. We booked four adults (3 very tall) and a child (9). Price wise it was fantastic value for money. We arrived in a bit of a hurry and almost ended up at the wrong starting point. I think it would be useful if there was a sign outside the tunnel telling you where the meeting point was. We followed the sign post which directs you to the actual tunnel (which isn’t the starting point of the tour). We did eventually find the building the tour starts from. The tour takes you along the banks of the river Ouse to start with where you’ll be given a history lesson from the tour guide. Our guide today was Peter. He was great. Funny and factual. He gave loads of information on the area and set the scene for us to imagine a day in the life of the Victorian Geordie. When we reached the start of the Tunnel and actually went underground we were transported back to WW2. Our guide for this part of the tour was Georgia. Again she set the scene for us and for the next hour we experienced what life during the bombings of Tyneside were like. I won’t spoil the tour by telling you the whole story. I will however recommend a visit. We thoroughly enjoyed it. Our guides were superb. I’d definitely recommend it. I’d also recommend a visit to one of the pubs in the area to fully enjoy the Geordie experience. All in all a fab day out. Our group were tall visitors and we were all comfortable down in the tunnels. Good footwear and a warm jacket will suffice for this trip. They provide everything else.
Guided tour,Excellent tour would strongly recommend if you are a visitor to Newcastle/Tyneside or a resident. Our guides Peter and Donald were knowledgeable and entertaining. Will be recommending to friends and family.
Day out ,"We had a 2 hour tour which was really interesting our tour guides were really lovely I think there names were dave and ester not 100% all I can say is that it's well worth it in every way and we really enjoyed the whole experience of it fab place, and great tour guides :)"
Well worth it,"Despite being born and brought up on Tyneside, we’d never visited the tunnels until now. What a really interesting and worthwhile visit it was. The tour lasted just under two hours and told stories from the Victorian era when the tunnel were used to transport coal, and WW2 when they were used as an air raid shelter. Our guides, Peter and Kate were engaging, knowledgable and humorous. I would recommend this trip to anyone."
