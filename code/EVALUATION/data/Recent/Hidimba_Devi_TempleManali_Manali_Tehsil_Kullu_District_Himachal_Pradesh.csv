The daily prayer takes place every morning at 8'o clock.You can get the detail information of the temple at HPTDC office on the mall road.You can also go for a short walk to the Dhungri hills surrounding the temple.

Shoot place of 'YJHD',This is an iconic temple where the shooting of Yeh Jawani Hai Dewani has taken place. And that is the reason the place is so much crowded. They are so many people there who come to you and say ‘Kesar Loge kya?’ in a very suspicious way which is very funny.The place is really beautiful and there are people who rent traditional himachaly clothes to try and take pictures.
Ancient temple,"The temple is really old. When you are here, you tend to feel some thing supernatural. The skills of dear and sheep’s is somewhat scary."

Picturesque ,It’s a very small and ancient temple. The surroundings are breathtaking. Wish we had more time to walk through the forests through.
It's another temple ,Only reason I visited it was because as a 12 year old kid I refused to go in without my shoes. It was cold that time.30 year old me now thinks I didn't miss much at all. So place is covered with greenery which is typical Himachal for you. It's good looking structure and quite ancient is want I was made to believe.I kept my shoe in the rack and went in. You just need to bend down while entering because the door is just 4 feet tall I suppose. And there it is. The deity! Around temple you would find folks giving you pictures opportunity with yak and rabbits. Some shooting games were there as well. Oh BTW ... you can either take the road to reach here or stairs. In my opinion stairs were much worse because it kills the breath in you. I'm not from plain region so for my body to breath in hills anyways is a add on task and if you add stairs to it. Dear lord!
Ancient Temple nestled in beautiful forest,"Very old ancient temple with its own rich history. Situated b/w a forest, well maintained even after hundreds of tourists turning up each day to seek Hidimba mata blessings.Queues to get inside can be pretty long someday, from inside it looks like an ancient cave structure.Not to miss if you are in Manali or haven’t been there before, located well in the heart of manali, more closer to Old Manali area."

Located on mountain in old man Ali it is great place to visit
Best nature. Quit place. ,The visit to Manali is incomplete without visiting this historical temple. Visit there and get blessing.

"Picturesque Location, Good Trek from Mall Road","We went to Hidimba Devi temple walking. It was a good trek of 3-4 kms. Mid the lush green Deodar trees, the streets appear quite picturesque during the day. Needless to say that if you are not physically fit, it might seem streneous effort on your part, however I enjoyed this trek from Mall Road to Hidimba Devi. Entry Ticket: FreeAuto Charges - Rs. 80/- to 100/- from Mall RoadYou will find Yaks and Rabbits there.

Traditional temple ,What a beautiful temple exhibiting the traditional architecture of Himachal . It’s a must visit place in Manali
Old beautiful Temple but too much crowded,We have been to this place fifteen years before. At that time it was really a serene and calm place. But whole scenario was different this time too much construction is being done during this last one and half year around this place. No arrangement for carrying old age people near to mandir. Hawkers pursuit you on the way. Rest is OK. Temple is built in typical old age Himachal architecture and gives you different feel. Cleanliness around the temple can be improved. If you are visiting first time then must go.

Well known temple near to Manali,"This is one of the places included in your itinerary for Manali sightseeing. The roads leading to the temple are narrow but the drivers are skilled enough to take you there. Once you get down from the vehicle, there are a series of steps to be climbed to reach the temple. The temple exhibits ancient built sculpture. You would find many people selling saffron but we were cautioned that these are fake saffron and not the real one. Surrounding the climb are streches of garden with beautiful flowers blossoming here and there."

Old temple,Well maintained.. A typical devi temple.. The outside of the temple was adorned with skulls of rams with their massive horns.. Don't know why.. Probably as a part of some ritual I think.. You need to climb around 50 steps to reach the temple..
DEPICTING ERA OF MAHABHARAT,"Beautiful Location of Temple, well maintained and reminds of Mahabharat. We should definitely visit such temples. Has lots of activities which adds fun for kids. We found local people giving ride on YAK, we hardly get to see this animal. Beautiful Rabbits, so fury, kids enjoy taking pics with these little creatures. And is a kind of earning for the local people."
Amazing Temple connected to Mahabharata.,"This is a unique temple one only in India worshipping an Asura princess, Hidimba wife of Bhima of Mahabharat and mother of warrior Gatotkacha. Amazing place in green in heart of Manali near main market."
Good place,"Around 2.5 kms from mall road.Better to take an auto from mall road, would charge around 100/- for 3.You may take a walk while coming back, there is a short cut with stairs which would cut down your half way till mall road.There is a small park, Dungri Van just behind the temple. Entry fee is Rs 10 per person, worth a visit.There are number of points which you can see in Dungri Van.You can click pics in local traditional clothes available at 50rs with the vendors inside the park.There is a coffee shop on top point if the park, you can try juices, coffee, Maggie, fruit chat, popcorns there. The minus point is that juice shop does not have proper juicer and uses a mixer grinder and have to pour water with the fruits to get a smooth blend. I also discovered that he mixed a lot of sugar in a bucket of water and used that water in mixer.Worth a visit."
Hidimba Mandir,"Excellent sacred Place at Manali,infact Manali is famous for Hidimba devi Temple.Temple is maintained in a Excellent way.Apart from tourism points it has its own midas touch.Took blessings in Mandir.Each one should definitely bow head at mandir in manali Rgds"

Hidamba temple ,"Ancient temple is a must visit when you are at Manali. Amidst a forest area. Locals provide yak rides for kids, traditional Himachal costumes available for photography."
Go there with respect for Devi Hidimba,"Personal suggestion - go there with respect and appreciation for Devi Hidimba. Why? She could have brought up Ghatotkach as a demon however, despite being a Asur, she inculcated virtues in her son Ghatotkach who laid his life for Dharma. (Learn about his role in Mahabharat). What works:1. Awesome wooden architecture2. In the middle of dense Deodar forest3. Not far from the city, with easy approach"
Must visit temple when in Manali,"The temple is dedicated Hidimbi Devi, wife of Bhima, a figure in the Indian epic Mahābhārata. The temple is surrounded by a cedar forest called Dhungiri Van Vihar at the foot of the Himālayas.To reach this place one has to take autos or taxis which normally ply easily but stuck in traffic jams.Surrounding is nice but there will be queue to visit inside the temple."
Must visit..,One can reach easly here from Mall road by Auto/ taxi with a reasonable fare. It is suituted at top of mountain. Great view..
Memorable experience,"This temple is located on top of the mountain peak. You will get picturesque view all around. Temple commands great faith among tourists & locals. a must visit when you are in Manali. Also, near to it you may visit Ghatotkacha temple aswell."
Fun and jou-rides in In the lap of Mother Nature,"From the city centre ( The mall)  you can hire an auto and reach Old Manali paying about Rs 200/- and cover Hadimba temple, Club House  (Adventure Sports) and Manu temple in a half day trip. No need to hold the auto as they are easily available all around.  The Temple is surrounded by a picturesque settings of  small hillocks dotted with long deodar trees and an eerie silence. As you know this is the only temple of Hadimba in the whole world and the plain beauty of this simple construction  of black slate stones will definitely  impress you. Yak ride and many other fun activities like Archery, hit-the target etc are available at reasonable prices. Click yourself dressed in local garments available on rent. Enjoy hot snacks like Momos and Siddus ( a local variant of Momo) and see how time flies. We saw Giant Wheels and some other joy-rides also but not sure whether they were permanently installed."
Good place but be aware of traffic on tuesdays,Worth visiting in manali cause the scenic beauty of this place is worth beholding.

Serene and calm,high trees and good landscapeyou'll get tired by walking because of thin air content i think not much crowdwas raining a bit during my time of visit which made a good atmospheric feeling of moist and coolness
unique temple,This temple built completely out of wood has the deity below the surface of a wooden platform and you have to kneel or bend down to worship the deity.
beautiful temple ,Hidimba devi temple is very beautiful and old temple and the view from this temple is nice we really enjoy must Vista this place

Old marvel,"Its a famous temple of Hidimba Devi wife of Bhim one of the Pandavs, Its made as cave temple where supposedly the demon queen used to mediate ?"
Hidimba Devi Temple,There are a very few places I'd give five stars rating for but this has to be one of them and not just because of the fact that it's inside a park hidden among tall euclidean trees . But the mystery of the structure is what fascinates me . Animal sacrifices were a common religious thing in the past but this temple takes it to another level. In a place this ancient I'm absolutely positive that there was something supernatural going on there . And the best part about all of it is that you can also still feel the same once you're there
Hidimba Temple,"Ancient temple has a background of Mahabharata period, beautiful atmosphere... You will find lot of jadi-booti sellers don't know how genuine they are"
Hidimba Temple,Quaint nestled on the hills of manali this temple is sacred and very much  valued by the locals of Manali and HP wprth the visit
Verygood,Great location.in d modddle of tall trees..well maintained .felt good walking through footsteps ..park next to Temple also well maintained..
Commercialised. Spoiled.,"Summary - Even Hidimba Devi herself would get annoyed by the level of commercialisation and indiscipline seen at this temple. 😒It could have been a beautiful place for worship and sightseeing alike if it wasn’t spoiled by the people who come here to visit. There is plastic and garbage scattered all around the temple and it is even hard to stand or sit quietly at a place due to bad smell. Sellers and vendors run after you all the time trying to persuade you buy stuff, and there is no regulation at all.* You can go for Yak rides near the back exit.* There is an entry (Rs. 20 per person) to Van Vihar from within the temple premises. There you can find some benches to sit on, but that too if you win the race against other tourists. 🏃🏻‍♂️* I managed to click a few good pictures.TIP: If you really want to visit this place and return back with a smiling face, try to beat the crowd reach as early as possible in the morning."
A must see and do whilst in Manali ,On arrival you’ll be greeted by yaks!There are people offering having your photo taken with rabbits and lambs for a fee. The temple is ancient and beautiful. Can get very busy if you want to go inside but it’s a must see and do.

Holy and Scenic place,scenic place with religious importance...............gives you refreshing feeling......at the backside you can climb up  the hill and can see whole Manali Town..........Near temple Deodar trees small forest is life time experience
The wooden temple,"Hadimba temple is the most visited attratiocn point for tourists not only in Himachal but  also in India ,It is situated between deodar forest full of hustle bustle of locals and tourists alike.entirely built of wooden is a nice place to visit with family."
Beautiful and Very Old Wooden Constructed Temple,Hadimba Devi Temple is the top tourist attraction in Manali. if you are in Manali then you must visit this temple. This temple is very old and it is wooden constructed even around this temple you will find so many old and very tall trees because of these trees this place has less sunlight but it looks beautiful.
Ancient Temple,Ancient temple. Very crowded. Beautiful location. Try and enjoy the local culture by sitting and observing the local people....it's enchanting.
Hidimba Devi Temple,It is a ancient temple situated between the mountains with thick cover of trees. Great natural beauty n peaceful place. There is always huge rush here as it is very famous temple and mostly you will see big queues of people...so one need to have patience to offer prayers inside the temple.
Hidimba devi mandir,"Very near from our hotel,Place is superb, mandir surrounding are is nice for visit and shoot pics.Great place to visit near to local are of mandir, famous place in Hollywood movies , shoot many hit movies at same place is the really memorable place to visit.

Wooden temple of Hidimba Devi,"Its a serene place...wooden temple surrounded by tall deodar trees...Temple itself has great architecture...all wood and mud in between. You can njoy yak ride, archery in the park nearby"
Hadimbi Devi Temple Manali,"Superb temple in the middle of Manali at Mall Road. It is one of oldest temple of manali covered with dense forest. The temple has beautiful old story with it. The temple was beautiful, there was a long queue for Darshan at temple but in the meantime, you can go and roam around the temple in the forest. Forest was quiet and it feels good to roam around the temple. People visit this temple not only to worship, but also to marvel at the incredibly superb kind of construction it features. Dhungri festival is an annual feature fervently attended by the people of the region. This is one of the representative traditional festivals of India that helps the visitors peep into the local customs, practices, rituals and culture. Chief goddesses of different villages are decorated and brought to the Hadimba temple complex."
Heavenly at Dawn,"The time to go, is when the light changes. When daybreak pushes it's head through the blue night skies....when the valley is wakening, and the locals are walking their cows to the forest or fields for grass, and tourists are still recovering from the previous day's wanderings in bed with breakfasts waiting in damp dining halls. The early morning is also the time you get to feel, to see the temple, the trees, and magic of the Dungri forest....uncoloured and unconditioned by swarms and queues of people thrusting forward with demonic deadlines of boxes to be ticked, selfies to be clicked, snacked to be nibbled upon, momentos to be grabbed, packets to be strewn...You can breathe in the cedars, with their warm pine fragrance, and feel the beauty of this holy space, and do away with all the concrete that's around, even if that takes a brief journey of imagination. (It used to be just earth, and the steps were but of soft earth that bore imprints of little feet running towards the temple, and then bigger ones, some determined, some hesitant. Concrete does not do that. Hold histories like raw earth does.)As the day progresses, the temple complex morphs into a giant commercial buzzing bazaar. The peace, calm and magic gives way to a frenetic tourist pace. You encounter sellers, pushers and peddlers of everything ranging from dream catchers to necklaces to selfie sticks, saffron, herbs, nuts, and holy bundles of Godly offerings...Locals in their homemade hand woven pattus mill around catching eye with their brilliant white rabbits...one picture with the rabbit is anything between a 100 to 20 rupees, depending on the time of day or your haggling skills. You can dress like a local, with the pattu and kilta, and that too can be bought for a price. Or sit upon a yak, or a combo of both the dress and the yak. That seems to be the preferred and popular option."
Very Satisfying Visit,This temple was very close from our hotel and maintained with cleanliness. Devotees could make darshan without any problem and it was indeed satisfying.
nice place,nice place in the lap of nature..though a bit crowded during peak season..enjoyed few hours here....

Hidimba Devi Temple,"Hidimba Devi Temple, locally known as Dhungari Temple, also known variously as the Hadimba Temple, is located in Manāli, a hill station in the State of Himāchal Pradesh in north India. It is an ancient cave temple dedicated to Hidimbi Devi, wife of Bhima, a figure in the Indian epic Mahābhārata.People in Manali worship Hidimba devi as a deity. During Navaratri all Hindus across the nation worship goddess Durga, but people in Manali worship Hidimba devi. Queues of people can be seen outside the temple, but the crowd increases during Navaratri.Timings: 8:00 AM - 6:00 PMIdeal Time: 1-2 hrsEntry Fee: No entry feeThis temple lies only 2 kilometers away from the main city center of Manali, and you can access this destination via bus, taxi or also on foot."
Spiritual,"A very serene environment and the surroundings pleasant and quiet. It was an extremely cold day with rain and snow which made the long walk to the Temple a bit tedious - slippery underfoot. However the walk was worth the while. A small but spiritual atmosphere surrounds the temple. Unfortunately, due the numerous number of tourists trying to enter the temple, we were only permitted a few moments to make way for the others. A worthwhile visit. Do not purchase any 'goodies' sold at entrance to the park - poor quality and a waste of money. Rather give a donation to the temple."
Beautiful historic temple,"It is Hidimba Devi temple Veer Bhima' s. The temple is admist tall and deodar trees. These trees are very old but strong. U will be mesmerised by surrounding  scenic beauty. The temple is ancient and monastery like architecture as it receives heavy snowfall, so as to save the wood from getting spoiled. It is near market. Nearby this temple is temple of warrior Ghatotkatch. People who read mythology and love ancient temples should definitely visit this place."
Nice place!,"We visited the much talked temple with family friends and young children.It's a very old temple, made up of woods in typical Himachali style.There is lots of space around the temple, so that it can hold many tourists at a time.Major attraction point is the large meadows and park behind the temple where u will have to buy entry tickets.But the park is beautiful with lots of tall devdar trees and slides and swings.Children will definately enjoy there.Good view for photography too!Overall a must visit place while on trip to Manali."
Divine place,Quite old and divine place to be. This is located near to Log Hut area of Manali. The temple is dedicated to Goddess Hidamba.
Hidimba Mata Temple …… Cannot Feel like the temple,"Visited Hidimba Devi Temple with friends group in September 2018. Temple is a unique shrine dedicated to Hadimba Mata, who was the wife of Bhima (Character of The Mahabhaata). It is very peaceful place. Temple is located in center of Manali city & in the forest area. Small entry point, seating area, & small Footpath to Hidimba Temple and last Small temple. Temple made by timber with beautiful art work on wall. It is known as a temple but not feel like temple. During our visit, winter is not come, so we miss the snow fall in Manali. Vehicle are available to visit this place. Food is not available here. No Parking, have to park your vehicle on the road.It was a great experience to visit this Hidimba Temple with friends."

Small temple amidst tall tress,"This is a small temple located in a picturesque location amidst tall dense tress. You can reach here by road or by walk few kilometers if you are staying near mall road. There are a set of stairs which would take you directly at the temple height. Near the entrance you would seek vendors offering Yak ride and pictures with furry rabbit. During Feb, the place was covered in thick snow. So much so that people were playing snow besides the temple courtyard. Once you enter the temple, there is limited space inside and a small cave like opening where you can see the footprints. Located nearby this temple is the Ghatotkach temple and vendors selling woolen clothes. I did not find any decent place to eat here."
Temple of historical importance,The temple is located with dense trees around. The hidimba temple has relation to Mahabharat. There is small shopping market outside the temple. You can enjoy yak ride here. Do not buy Kesar or Shilajit from anyone. They will fool you

The trails leading up to the temple, look especially lovely in the peak winter snow. I would suggest visiting early in the morning if you wish to avoid the crowd."
Good quite Temple in the midst of deodar forest,"The trees are amazing in this area, huge at the base and so tall. I wish they had allowed as walking through the forest.

Good place ,Its a nice place to explore plz do not wear any kind of flat or heel please wear trekking shoes i have seen many newly married couples slipped over there
Temple is good,The visit to this temple was good. But I would say avoid this spot if you are accompanied with senior citizens as it is kind of little steep walk and getting into the temple would be like getting into the small cave.
Hidimba devi,The place was very calm and completely snow capped in jam 2019. consider having local almonds small ones they offer a good bargained deal.
divine SO divine,"Its so so divine beauty and before your reach this temple, google and read about the temple history, amazing and once you step into that territory one could FEEL ITS VIBRATIONS and take you back to Mahabarat story, about Beema and his wife. And thats HIS WIFE'S PLACE. SUCH A DIVINE LOVE STORY. jUST PRESENT AND KEEP QUIET!!!"
Vanvihar walk is dreamy,"We went to this place not to visit the temple, but for a walk amongst the cedar trees in Van vihar. It was like a dream. We walked among the trees, on the grass wet with previous night's rain. The air was cool and crispy. We crossed the broken fence across a small brook to step on the thick blanket of snow on the other side. There was snow everywhere. And apple trees enveloped with snow. Beyond the apple orchard were village houses, smoke coming out of their chimneys. Birds chirping, dogs barking, people talking. Beautiful view of snow covered mountains on all sides. How much more beautiful could it get? We stood there mesmerized, oblivious to the passage of time. We didn't want to come back. Reluctantly, we left the place, leaving a bit of our soul there."
Kinda beautiful ,"Beautiful place but outside this place some uncles have created a gaming zone, where you can waste your money!  Lol by wasting money i meant you could play silly games and you’ll keep performing the tasks to win the prizes. Try your luck we dint won any!"

Beautiful,This temple is so beautiful and we all really enjoyed photo's season there. If someone go to Manali please visit Hidimba devi Temple.
Divine experience,"This ancient temple ia situated around 3 Kms from the heart of Manali town which is situated inside pine forest. Temple not only gives you a divine experience but a treat for the eyes with the artistic carvings. I dont think not many people are aware of the fact that film ""Roja"" directed by Mani Ratnam got a few scenes shot here. Don't miss to go inside the temple and pray."
Nice place ,It’s a temple named Hindimba wife of Bheem...we enjoyed with snow and took yak ride and also wore tradition dress of Manali
A must for wanderers.,"It is not at all a quiet place, But somehow there's a atmosphere of Divination in it. My advice go early if you want to offer something to the goddess, otherwise good luck with queues. It has a garden on its backyard as well."
Worth to visit,Famous and beautiful temple in ManaliIt's located on small hilltop and for reaching here you have to go up for 15-20 min on steps.But it's worth to visit this.This looks really amazing in snow.
"Hadimba, last place we visited..","We started from the mall road by walking. It was 2 km hike and took about half hour.

A must visit place. No charges to visit this place. You can sit there and keep observing the beauty of this place.
Unique temple,Probably the only temple after Hidimba - a character in Mahabharatha. There is a small trek up the hill through pine woods. Vendors ask you to pose with the yak or rabbit. The temple per se is quite small
Temple with different architecture ,This temple comes in first few places to visit in manali.  It is located near to the market place.  The temple is different in its architecture. Old temple which has its own charm ..located admist the tall deodhar tress.Outside the temple is the shopping area of woolen clothing by tibetans. Also the locals there keep the traditional clothes to be rented out and even the photographers are available to click the photos in traditional himachali attire.Yak rides..

Nice place and relaxing ,"The temple is nice and there you might find yak and rabbits for photography.Nearby place has got many things like food stalls,vendors etcc.."
Hidimba Devi Temple.,"The temple is located within the city limits but high er up.One has to climb a long flight of steep stairs to reach the place or one can take a vehicle which reaches the place through a circuitous road. If one climbs up the stairs cut across the hill, then the scenery on both sides is awesome. Surrounded by forests, the sun rays play through the dark green conifers off and on while you can hear the call of monkeys and the chirping of birds while you pant  your way up. There are adequate resting places on the way so that you can take your time to climb up. The stairway starts fro the side of Hotel Rohtang manalsu.The temple generates a quiet, quaint feel.It houses the deity Hidimba who is a revered deity of the locals.The style of the temple made out of wood and stone is also different from other Hindu temples resembling a pagoda style."
Good Place to visit and warship,450 years old temple mostly made out of wood with carvings. If you are traveler in Manali you must visit and see this ancient architectural temple. Good eating and snack places out side the temple.
Goddess,Nice place to visit where different customs are followedOutside the temple yaks and giant rabbits can be seen
Most visiting place in Manali,This temple is very old. Every person visit manali must visit this place. Now days it is so crowded place.
450 years old temple,"I never know there is such temple there in India in the name of a demon called Hidimba, If you are aware of the tale then it is the Magical forest where Goddess Hidimba to stay and after she married with powerful Bheem she became a goddess and I think after that she gets worshipped but the local people say it's very old template more than 450 years old. And it's a nice place to visit a very peaceful and refreshing environment and a lot of greenery and you can also witness Ghatotkacha tree as well. It's a huge tree in the name if Ghatotkacha."
Peaceful and refreshing experience,"well managed Holy place.. neat and clean. nice scenery. In side the temple, you feel so peaceful. Nice wooden carvings.the day, we visited the temple.. had a little snowfall.. which was fun."
Heritage temple,"The surrounding of this temple is serene. However, some uncivilized people still litter and spit within the temple compound. A must visit while in Manali."
Strange but exciting,Never thought there could be temple about a demon but once you have stood your time in the queue and entered the inner sanctum you will be amazed to find Durga and Ganesh idols to ward of evil energies along side Hidimba devi.
Nice temple located in scenic place,A must visit place in Manali.. a peaceful place surrounded by pine trees..  good for taking photos and also for shopping of local stuffs

There are many attractions in the vicinity such as museum, Yalk ride, traditional dress, flee market selling Himalayan spices"
Nice temple,The hidimba Devi temple was very nice with tall temperate tree species may be chir pine trees...but location is awesome..
divine and peaceful,"this is an ancient temple dedicated to goddess Hadimba. definitely worth visiting.do not come by car is tourist season as there will be huge jams. instead, you can walk from old manali or manali town, as it is only 15 minutes walk away."
Hidimba Devi temple,The landscape is eye catching. But the temple is not as beautiful as in pics.no entry fee. Parking is also free. There is trekking to this place also.
Heritage temple,"Hidimba is wife of Ghatotkach from Mahabharata son of Bhima. The temple is old structure with roof like most of the houses in Manali. There is nothing much to do except Yak ride in small ground near temple itself, but what worth is old structure of the temple which is why it is to be visited."
Temple of historical significance,"Goddess hidimba finds mention in the epic - Mahabharata, hence this temple was of great historical significance for me and my friends. Interesting stories associated with the origin of temple."
HADIMBA TEMPLE,"Apart from religious values, all those who love and value ancient heritage, this place is worth visiting."
Nothing special ,It is just like any other temple except that it has been built long ago. The architecture is ordinary. One can visit if there is lot of spare time or else better skip it
temple,i visited recently in june with my buddy partner and his friends we visited the mandi to parashar lake but finding manali to be near by just visited here too.peacefull place in same location
Old temple... Nice surroundings ,"My third visit to the temple. More impressed by the surrounding of trees, positive vibes post visiting the temple. A must to do when on visit to Manali."
Hadimba devi temple ...very ancient temple surrounded with Cedar trees,it is just 3 km from the mall road of manali...very ancient temple ...you can see the Yak and ride on it

Nice place,"A nice place in Manali bustling with tourist activity.This temple is surrounded with tall trees which makes this place a calm and serene.The temple is nice and surroundings are clean and well maintained. One can enjoy a Yak ride, can take photos with a furry breed of rabbit and has a small market place for woolen items.Also you will find a lot of sellers selling kesar and local jadi buti.(They might be irritating, so just ignore them)"
Darshan of Hidimba devi,I have visited this old temple made from wood and in beautiful location. Every one must visit Hidimba devi temple.
pretty after snowfall,beautiful setting in the middle of the forest; beware the adorable himalayan bunny handlers that want to catch you reaching to pet and charge you 50 rupees - lol...  and the covert saffron sellers that are oddly peddling the spice like it is illegal to do so???
A few minutes stop...,We went to Hidimba Devi Temple by foot from Old Manali and we went up a few steps to reach. It is nice to view. There are women with rabbits to take photos with them as well. About 30 mins would be enough.
Scenic Calm however a bit overrated,- Hidimba Devi Temple visit is good for people who are religious and in search of spirituality.- It has scenic surrounding and beauty however it is sometimes very crowded.- Can try ethnic costumes @ 50 per person- Try Panipuri here.- Explore architecture and nearby forest.

Peaceful abode of goddess,"Perched on a hill top it is one of the major attractions of Manali. The only problem is the narrow approach roads which pass through the main market.

Very Popular Hindu Temple,This temple having great mythology as per Mahabharata. Beautiful Place and every time love to visit this place. There are really some hidden power we every time.
Primal,"This is one of the few old Himachali structures left. The temple is not much if you compare it with other grand structures, but it gives you a feeling of a primal past. It is located on the upper regions of Manali. I would certainly recommend a visit if you like such structures. The ambience is beautiful. Unfortunately the day we visited it was a Tuesday, and Rohtang was closed. So it was incredibly crowded and we had to fight through a forest of selfie sticks. But still this is much better than the average commercial temples."
Worth Visiting,"Nice place to be there very calm and serene. It is very near to the parking. One can get their phots clicked with Rabitts, Yak and lambs here. Temple is in close vicinity to Manali Mall."
Peacefull,A peaceful temple not far from the main town of manali. You must go to Ghatotgach temple near hidimba devi temple.You can have a peacefull walk between pine trees around the temple.

Hidimba Temple visits,Ancient and heritage site surrounded with huge trees and green pastures. Clean and green surrounding adds to it's beauty.
Calm and Nice place,The only temple of Hidimba. Very beautiful old style temple surrounded by thick forest of tall cedar tress. Small temple but with a historical significance. Completely built with wood and should be of at least 5 centuries old. The place is quite and peaceful.This is the must visit place in Manali. I visited 10 yrs back and the difference now is the lot of commercialization and litters everywhere.

Just like another temple,hadimba temple in Manali is overhyped. it is just an ordinary small temple but with a historical significance. We need to climb a short height to reach the temple. well the place is quite peaceful
worship,"This temple is an ancient one built almost 500 years back. dedicated to Hidimba,who is Bhimas wife in Mahabharata.it is worshiped in the form of rock as shakthi. situated among pine forest."
Devi in the Cedars,"Hadimba Devi Temple is magnificently situated amongst majestic cedars up a hill near Old Manali. You can climb up a set of stairs from the riverbanks in Old Manali  and then its a short walk to its entrance. The beautifully carved exterior is replete with ram's horns along its exterior walls. Its unusual series of domed roofs are lovely. This Devi worshipped site is well worth a look. Unfortunately the pristine environment of my visit 30 years ago was sadly dashed by the current carnival atmosphere of horribly garbage strewn grounds, cotton candy hawkers, and a Disney themed blow up water slide feature crowding the area. I was severldy disappointed in how little respect was shown for the surrounding area and that absolutely no attention was paid to maintaining this magnificent and sacred site. One can enter the surrounding woods which are a bit less polluted by cast off corn cobs and ubiquitous fast food packages strewn about.  But it behoves the guardians of this historically important sacred site to reclaim it by restoring its natural beauty and sacredness by  addressing  the overcrowded and commerically overrun atmosphere which disrespects this wonderful historical site."
