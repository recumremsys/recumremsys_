Great place to explore,"We spend a good few hours exploring this museum and the adjoining Pitt Rivers Museum. There is so much to see, despite only the ground floors being open due to coronavirus.The combined ticket is wonderful, as the two museums really compliment each other, as each has its own atmosphere and they are distinctly separate whilst flowing easily into one another.Entry is free with a timed ticket during the pandemic, and this system seems to work really well. The toilet facilities are clean and spacious.The building itself is very impressive as well, particularly the interior of the Natural History Museum. Very ornate and exotic, with more detail to be found in the actual building the harder you look.The staff are all friendly and seem genuinely helpful and welcoming.There was however one aspect which I simply couldn't understand the reasoning for. The 'outer circle' displays inside the museum are operated on a one-way system due to social distancing. This is laid out in an anti-clockwise route. However, the story of evolution, which these displays tell, runs clockwise, so if following the route anti clockwise, you reach the introduction at the end. When reading some of the information panels, the panel starts in one place, then you have to retract your steps, the wrong way round, to carry on reading. It was so frustrating, as it was impossible to follow the story of evolution which the museum has tried so hard to display. It was very frustrating indeed, as I wanted to follow and understand it all, but when the introduction and explanatory part is at the end, then it is impossible.It just didn't make sense as there seemed no logical reason why an anti-clockwise route was enforced, when a clockwise one seems such the obvious choice.Having said that, this museum really is a wonderful place, and I'm grateful that places like this have found ways to open at all during the pandemic, and the staff should be praised for working hard to allow visitors to keep coming."
Try and be pleasant with your visitors perhaps or even just not rude.,"Arrived 10 minutes later than our pre-booked timed admission ticket only to be told by a lady admissions officer sporting a New York accent, that we couldn‚Äôt go in because we are too late. She was angry with us and offhand. We appealed to the young man in the booth scanning the tickets who was charming and waved us in.We had travelled for four hours to get there. Please be a little bit kinder to your visitors maybe ?"
Amazing Knick knacks ,"Really enjoyed it here, particularly the Pitt Rivers part that had all sorts of interesting bits and bobs and oddities!"
Brilliant free museum,"Great skeletons and displays, things for small children to touch,  beautiful building which has been recently restored. Cafe good too"
Favourite museum ,"I prefer natural history over the regular types of museums. I've always gone here since I was a child and will continue to come here. My last visit was a couple of years ago so I'm due another visit soon, once the museum opens up again."
Greta collection including rare collections like the DODO.,"The museum is housed in a very beautiful building with classical architecture. The museum has several dinosaur skeletons on display. Amongst 'touchable' displays are a dinosaur bone fossil, a dinosaur egg fossil amongst others. The Oxford Dodo (said to be an inspiration to Lewis Caroll for the Alice in Wonderland character) is housed in this musuem.This is a place that will both enthuse adults and children alike."
We weren't even allowed to enter,"We were going to visit the Natural History Museum in Oxford. We are a group of around 12 and they said the museum was open to the public, so we assumed we would be allowed into the museum to look at shrunken heads. We entered in groups of two or three and we weren't there for a tour. As the first couple of groups walked through the door, however, a very rude woman stopped us from entering. We wouldn't have minded her doing this if she had fully explained her reasoning. She said that we were a group and groups had to book in advance. We don't think this is fair because a group behind us was let in and we weren't there to cause any inconvenience. I can only assume that we weren't allowed in because we are ages 13-15, which we don't think is fair. It was also raining outside and the woman had no sympathy for us. We ended up walking around Oxford for TWO HOURS in the pouring rain. This was a school trip and we were all looking forward to it for WEEKS.    I would have never expected that someone working in a well-known and highly-esteemed museum to treat people with such disrespect. She may not have meant to sound rude but she appeared to be very angry with us. Very disappointed."
not open to public,we were turned away at the door as the women told us we had to book. she was very cross with us even though we did nothing wrong. she was only doing her job but she was very cross. she said it was not open to the public. diabolical
Great free museum,"A must see if you are in Oxford, right next to the fabulous Pitt Rivers museum and similarly free to go in."
Fragile dinosaurs and a stuffed beaver,"Skeletons and casts of dinosaurs formed the major attraction in a great disply about evolution. Enchantingly, Tyrranosaurus Rex was labelled ""fragile"". Upstairs, a rather dull cafe is distinguished by a doorway to the room where Thomas Huxley debated evolution with Bishop Wilberforce - a truly historical spot, indeed."
Interesting for a wander around ,"Popped in here mostly to shelter from the rain, but had an entertaining hour looking around. Friendly staff were helpful and everything well explained. Lots to entertain children and families too. Free entry which pleasantly surprised us. Some unusual exhibits for something a bit different."
My Favourite Museum in Oxford,"The exterior is stunning the interior is fabulous like a movie designed museum, the T-Rex is there to greet you when you enter and the interior design is just spectacular, a sheer joy to visit and look at the exhibits, make sure you make a donation."
Iconic oxford museum,Family friendly museum with lots to see and accessible science with real scientific history as well as natural history to be seen
Interesting ,"Such a light and inviting hall, created by 2 large bears that can be touched...fabulous exhibits, well labelled and interesting. Definitely well worth a visit üòÄ"
Great museum,This and the Pitt Rivers museum that is attached to it are well worth a visit. Spend a few hours wandering around the amazing displays. Gets busy in school holidays but still a memorable day.
As good as it gets,"A really well presented, well kept, informative museum... all for free (or a donation... well worth it). Could go on and on about this excellent museum but just to say it is a 'must see' on a tour of Oxford. Plus an excellent cafeteria on the first floor."
Ecclectic,Wild and wonderful things that you could only imagine seeing. Fascinating and mind boggling at the same time. Went with my partner but it is definitely one to take the grandchildren.
"On a wet and windy day, come here üëç","Excellent free museum and great for kids, especially on a rainy day when you need to keep your kids busy."
Great place to visit with children ,"Great place to visit with children, they loved the dinosaurs and the vast array of animals on display, great that it‚Äôs free, lots of space and a good cafe and toilets facilities."
Best Museum in England,"To me, this is by far the best museum in England.  I love natural history, and this well-designed space presents them in a very compact way.  It is WONDERFUL for ages 8 to 98.  And it is organized on 3 levels so you can either do one level a day or all three the same day."
A STUNNING MUSEUM ,The Oxford University Museum has some amazing exhibits some unique Well laid out and clearly labelled Definitely worth a visit and a lovely cafe too
Beautifully set out Dino Museum,"A wonderful museum full of real bones, reconstructions and supporting info.  Spacious setting in a Gaudiesque building.  Lots to see and touch and explore.  Fantastic for youngsters and oldies alike!"
Dinosaurs and Geology ,"Visited along with the Pitt Rivers Museum which is adjoining. Airy and spacious the museum manages to make geology interesting (even for me) and, in addition to the dinosaur skeletons, there are large displays of British Birds. Popular with parties of young school children who, as well being extremely well behaved, all seemed to be hugely interested in all the exhibits. Worth a visit."
Amazing!,"What a treasure, the building, the exhibits, the accessibility of all was amazing. Information was put over in such an easy way, educational but not overwhelming. Well done!If I lived here I think I'd be going in every day!"
Great museum to visit with young children,"This museum is great for family with very young children. We actually went back the following day. There are some furry bears (a brown and a black) you can touch and a fox you can also touch, our children loved these a lot. For older children there are detective trails to complete and they get a sticker upon completion. On our first day they had crafts workshops in the afternoon. There is a restaurant area upstairs it was very crowded (it was half term) and we had to share table."
Ideal for families of all ages,Very well laid out museum with plenty of interest for old and young alike.  Fairly good cafe upstairs overlooking the main gallery.
Visit,This was a great museum with loads of exibits the palaeontology was well worth seeing. The school children were fascinated by the Dinosaurs.
Great collection ,Amazing collection in a spectacular building.  Loads to see and would be easy to spend hours here - I learnt lots and realised how little I know about our natural history.   Brilliant that it‚Äôs still free of charge.
Coffee and Dinosaurs',"This is a great museum for a rainy days if you don't know what to do with your young family or just somewhere to go for a couple of hours to loss yourself in all the exhibits and the coffee shop on the first floor overlooking the  main part of the museum, plus search out the Pitt Rivers museum through the door at the back of the room its magical...almost Alice in Wonderland.."
Great for families,A free visit that is really worthwhile. So much to see and all on just 2 floors. Good worksheets for younger children. A fantastic variety of  very good lifelike exhibits.
Worth a visit! ,"A really lovely place! Lots to see and do, the River Pitts museum is inside and that‚Äôs worth popping in to see. The toilets were clean and didn‚Äôt smell and that‚Äôs always a plus! Some lovely items in the gift shop, the only thing I found is that there wasn‚Äôt quite enough room to manoeuvre around the shop."
Great Natural History Museum....,"The Oxford University Natural History Museum is a relatively small museum housing a collection of animal and dinosaur skeletons, stuffed animals, and rocks & gemstones. All of the exhibits are in a single gothic hall so can be visited in a couple of hours. Note the entrance to the Pitt Rivers Museum is through the arched doorway at the back of the hall and should not be missed in it's own right. Entrance is free although you are able to give a donation if you feel like doing so. Given the museum is only a short five minute walk from the city centre, it is well worth a visit !"
An amazing museum ,A great collection of fossils and stuffed animals as well as minerals and geological exhibits. I was particularly pleased to see how much you were allowed to interact with some of the exhibits and the descriptions were very good. We had a great walk round and thoroughly enjoyed the couple of hours we spent there. A great place to take children - especially if they like dinosaurs!
Ok but the directions to Pitts River needs to be more clear,Located in front of the Pitts river Musuem. Large collection of taxidermy and fossils. Unfortunately because of they layout we believed we had seen both museums but missed out on the variety of culture
Incredible,This has to be on a par with the London Natural History museum.  It's smaller but much better suited to families with small children as there is plenty to see still.  Some amazing skeletons and stuffed animals and there's always an exhibition on.  I never tire of visiting.  Can't recommend it highly enough.
Amazing Day Out!,"This beautiful Museum far exceeded my expectations.This museum and the Pitt Rivers Museum at the back of the Natural History Museum will keep you interested for several hours if you want it to. We did it in 3 hours in the school holidays but there is plenty more to keep you occupied at a deeper level. If you have smaller children this is about the limit on their legs. But you name it they have it. T Rex skeleton, pieces of meteor, fossils, models of animals, the history of animals, geology specimens, etc etc. It is like a smaller version of the Natural History Museum in London but even for 90% of Adults you really couldn‚Äôt take in anymore Information in a day. The Building itself is a stunning piece of Gothic architecture and sets the scene perfectly for showing the exhibits. It has a nice little Morton‚Äôs cafe on the first floor that overlooks the expanse of the hall. But, if you want a bite for lunch in the school holidays get in early. Although it has around 100 seats, we got the last one at 11:30am and by 12 noon people were standing up eating. It‚Äôs not the cafe‚Äôs fault as they are limited to what space is available (coffee shops probably weren‚Äôt a priority in the 1850‚Äôs). It‚Äôs also Free to get in but we gave a contribution as by far, this half term it was the cheapest day out. We also used the Seagrove Park and Ride to get to it. I thought that this would be a pain but it was very, very easy. So don‚Äôt let it put you off visiting the Museum. Just park up, pay ¬£6.80 for parking and a return bus ticket to the Park and Ride for 2Adults and 3Children,  get on the bus (there is always one there or will be within 5 minutes), get off at the 5th stop - the last before it heads out of the far end of the city- Queens Lane (the driver helped us with this), walk back along the route for 100m turn right up Catte Street and head straight on for 5 minutes walk (into Park Street) and it‚Äôs on your Right. Hope you have a good trip!"
A great museum for all ages,I visited the museum with children and grandchildren on a Sunday morning in January. The museum was busy. The children loved the animal exhibits which were easily accessible by all of the youngsters aged 3 to 5.
My 2-1/2 year old grandson loved it,This is a small museum. Basically one large room stuffed full of natural history artifact. Great for children of all ages. Lots to see. Has activities for children. My grandson loved the dinosaurs especially the head of the t-Rex.
Very interesting and well curated,A great collection of items from rocks to stuffed animals and everything in between.Nice to see exhibits asking you to touch it touch gently. Exhibits will labelled and informative.You could spend ages and still see more on another visit.Worth going.Free to enter but donations suggested to support the work their.... Go on its well worth whatever you can afford.
Amazing museum and architecture!,"This museum is worth a visit for the architecture on its own.  The building is a simply stunning example of Victorian architecture.  It was designed specifically for the museum and is fantastic.The collection of natural history and animals is extensive and well laid out.  The museum is stuffed with exhibits which whilst slightly overpowering is really nice as it means that, due to the layout, you can compare exhibits easily eg. Animal skeletons.During school holidays then they put on activities for kids in the centre which is great to help drive their interest."
Great experience,"We were in Oxford on a course, very friendly staff looked after us. It is a great museum, lots of wide eyed children looking around.MEGA TIP: Take your time"
Lovely for kids,Great museum for adults and kids to keep them entertained for hours.They had a paint session for kids to make their own pin so it was great for kids to bring their own souvenir . Was free the time we went till end of February. Really recommend it to families
A fulfilling Wet Morning ,What a super experience. Our 4y and 8y had a truly awesome time dwarfed by dinosaurs and overwhelmed by the giant insect displays.There is much more to experience than a morning can allow and we look forward to returning.
Very good,"Loads to see, and very interesting and educational.Very well kept, well worth a visit if your in oxford. Also it's free to enter wich is always a bonus!"
Amazing exhibits to view for free!,This two in one museum has some amazing exhibits which means everyone will find something of interest. Very friendly staff and a unique layout.
Short satisfactory visit,"This was a brief visit to the museum, whilst we were in Oxford visiting my daughterThe museum had some interesting exhibits, The cafe did nice coffee and had a fine selection of cakes.However, the star of the show was the building itself.  It is absolutely beautiful. One feature that I found particularly inspiring was that each the columns around the first floor balcony supporting the ceiling were different granites from around the country."
Better than expected,I visited with teenagers who were not looking forward to going to a museum but were pleasantly surprised with the range of things inside. Definitely worth it with free entry!
A trditional museum and all the better for it!,"This is a museum with a cathedral like glass roof, towering skeletons of both prehistoric and current birds and animals and dozens of fascinating objectds beautifully displayed and CLEARLY LABELLED.Kids seemed to be loving it, it is cerainly not dry and dusty.Leads through to my favourite museum af all, the Pitt Rivers."
Lots to see,"This was a great museum with plenty to see and so many great details everywhere, like the types of stone and places the columns came. Free entrance but donations welcome and definitely worth donating to."
Oxford,Oxford history museum really nice place to explore for kids and adults. We really enjoy walking around  city and exploring. Definitely coming back.
Amazing! What a collection!,"My fossil mad son could barely believe his eyes. He declared it to be the best museum he has been to in his whole life! It was great. Free to enter and so much to see. We went o. A Saturday and whilst it was busy, it didn‚Äôt really affect us and we could easily see everything. Brilliant afternoon out."
Excellent museum - fascinated chikdren,"This is an excellent if slightly quirky museum. It is well laid out with friendly and helpful staff.  Children from 7 to 14 were kept spellbound and adults had plenty to interest them, too. The cafe is good, too."
"Beautiful building, wonderful, informative collection",So good that this museum has not been ‚Äòdumbed down‚Äô like the NHM in London . This museum still strives to educate.
Loved it! ,"Very interesting. A wonderful collection and beautiful building. We enjoyed looking at all the exhibits, would be a good activity for adults or children. Amazing how well preserved the artifacts are considering some of them are hundreds of years old."
Massive and lots of information,"Free museum and has loads of collections of birds, wild animals, bugs, skeletons, DNA working, dinosaurs, and suitable to visit if you need to teach your kids. It also has mined stones and every corner/section has bits of information associated with it. Might take more than 4 hours if you would wish to view every single corner in details. The stuffed animals are well taken care of."
Excellent Free Museum,"This museum is really excellent. It contains some spectacular exhibits ranging from dinosaur skeletons, lots of stuffed animals and animal skeletons. There is lots of interesting information on the exhibits, a fabulous museum.You also have the Pitt Rivers Museum next door."
Superb!,"We thoroughly enjoyed this museum.  It is ideal for families so definitely expect lots of small, curious people following the museum's excellent trails and getting excited by dinosaurs!  It is not a place for quiet contemplation at the weekends, that's for sure!And the added bonus of the Pitt Rivers Museum tucked away behind Darwin..."
A good effort in trying to make due with the space it has,"Showcasing several different collections of natural world topics, such as animals, minerals, plants and other, it does so with quite a lot of interaction activities such as exhibits that can be touched/felt or screens where one can drill down history to find the known common ancestor between different animals, all while trying to do the best with the limited space they possess.Overall, a good morning/afternoon family outing."
"Lots to see, well spaced out, very interesting.","What more can I say? I think this is a must-see in Oxford, and it's free!  A huge array of natural history on display, with each one accompanied by written informative explanations."
Great for dinosaur fans! ,"Great place to visit with children, lots to see and my dinosaur loving 4 yr old son was fascinated with the dinosaur fossils and skeletons."
Boring,We went here on a Sunday and it‚Äôs free which is great but it‚Äôs kind of boring and a bit gross. The London natural history museum is amazing. This one is just lots of stuffed animals and casts of dinosaurs with the odd real skeleton. There were animals holding objects. Like the white rabbit in the Alice in wonderland display which was silly. The insects are disgusting and some bits are still alive. Pitt‚Äôs river museum is just dark and chaotic. Lots of screaming posh kids. Not a fan.
Great,"Very interesting museum, big and beautiful with lots of interesting exhibits. Worth a visit while in Oxford."
We love this museum - always something new to see or do!,"We've been here so many times and make a point of heading here even if only for an hour or two on most trips to Oxford. The kids says its ""Amazing - very interactive and family-friendly"". The youngest was about 3 when we first went and we have taken other kids with us up to aged 10 who all love it. They arrange workshops on the weekends and in the holidays with lots of craft-activities related to the exhibits. We even went to a detective musical about the dinosaur extinction!They had a bacteria exhibition this year which hooked the kids and the undersea dinosaur exhibition made a great impression too. There are lots of hands-on opportunities for kids to touch things in the displays and see rocks glowing different colours under UV light."
Fascinating exhibits,"Fascinating natural history collection, well worth a visit. Highlights include the skeletons of both animals and dinosaurs (including a T-Rex) and a selection of giant crystals/minerals (incl. pyrite and a real meteorite).Well laid out exhibits, beautiful building, free of charge. Excellent."
Free entry and exiting exhibits,"Free entry, yeah! :D The exhibits are awesome. I love dinosaurs and it was great to see so many different skeletons. They even encourage you to touch some of the exhibits which is really cool.There is also an area where you can buy food and drinks. But it's not allowed to bring lunch/snacks from outside.The museum shop is great, too. Lots of lovely books and other things."
Seemingly small but more than enough!,"...they have stuffed animals you can pet, how awesome is that! The explanations and backstories are also well presented. The building itself is a masterpiece. Definitely worth visiting."
Lovely museum,"Beautiful museum and great items to see, you can even touch some of them! One of the best museums I‚Äôve visited."
I've been before but there's so much to discover,"As I said, I've been here before but I cant stay away. I'm in Oxford regularly and each time I visit I try to get round here because there is always a new exhibit to see or a new section to explore. I'm a fairly competent naturalist but I have learnt a lot from reading the cards that tell you about each exhibit. Of course with phones it is possible to take it a lot further but there is something to be said for the old fashioned way. Just immersing yourself in a place like this and switching off technology. I'm pleased to see the exhibits that you are encouraged to touch as they excite the inner child in me but also I would imagine help to engage actual children by providing a more diverse sensory experience. Anyway, if nothing else, getting a feel for the extraordinary diversity of forms life has taken on this planet should be sufficient to stir the imagination of even the most moody teenager (don't quote me on that)."
The Oxford Dodo,"It was the reason for my visit, but there is so much more to see here. They have a fabulous T Rex skeleton , interesting interactive exhibits- and a great cafe. Allow at least 2 hours."
Definitely Worth a Visit ,The museum is located in a splendid historic building and is free to enter. There are exhibits over two floors and there is also a caf√©. Natural history is not my favourite subject but this was well curated with very friendly staff and the interior of the building is a joy to walk around.
One of the best!,I live near the Harvard Museum of Natural History and take my 2 year old son there regularly.  It pales in comparison to the Oxford University Museum of Natural History.  The specimens they have here are so beautiful and well maintained.  They have a wonderful collection of dinosaur skeletons.  The T-Rex is just fantastic. We were there on a Saturday and they had many children educational activities out for all to enjoy.  The amazing thing is that this is free to the public (with donations appreciated) and they are able to maintain it so beautifully. If I lived near here I would be a regular visitor both for myself and my son and his education and enjoyment.
Hours and hours of interest.,"The lovely Mrs. C and myself visited last weekend and spent nearly three hours walking through all of the exhibits. Brilliant stuff, so much in not a massive space really. Brilliant."
Loved it!,"Great architecture, fantastic exhibits. Worth a visit if in Oxford. Lots to see, something for everyone of all ages."
Watch out for the dinosaurs!,An excellent museum for anyone with an interest in the life of the planet.I swear I saw the T-Rex move...
Great for adults but kids will love it too ,This is a great museum! We attend a day specifically for children but even still it is accessible and plenty for kids to see and enjoy! Definitely worth a visit
Interesting experience for all ages,Easy to walk to and find and close to the centre of Oxford.Housed in an impressive building.A varied range of exhibits to appeal to a wide range of ages and knowledge bases.People are encouraged to touch several exhibits.  A few even have braille labels.Worth combining with the  unique Pitt Rivers Museum housed within the same building.
Great experience,As the weather was supposed to be bad we decided to go to the museum. What a treat. Some fantastice exhibits and we were able to go around with ease
What a great place to go and it‚Äôs free,"What a great place to go in Oxford, Dinosaurs Artefacts from around the globe, take a couple of hours to get you round really interesting place and stunning building"
Excellent venue for a Conference & AGM,I did not realise this place existed until today. I will definitely spread the word and visit again. The specimens and exhibition were amazing.
Worth finding,"Had to follow the signposts but well worth the walk. Very well laid out with detailed explanations of exhibits. Can walk through to the Pitt Rivers Museum.Has a cafe on first floor, nice food"
Wet afternoon well spent,"What an amazing collection of Natural History things, and in the back, in the Pitt Rivers Museum, the most incredible eclectic collection of well, stuff, from all over the world. From Crossbows to Inuit Parkas. From shrunken heads to model ships. Man traps to blowpipes. Really quite amazing and enthralling. Utterly brilliant!"
Phenomenal Building ,Free entry but donations welcome. A cafe and gift shop on site. Need at least a few hours to get around. The little ones can touch too which adds some fun to the experience. A vast range of bugs and bones.
Excellent on a rainy day! ,"We visited Oxford for one night and unfortunately the weather was horrible. We decided to visit this museum to escape the weather.Free entry although a donation box is provided and suggested, all of which goes towards the upkeep and improvement of the museum, and you could easily spend 3 hours in here if you wished (even without venturing into the connected museum at the back, which I think was focused around human history).The large majority of exhibitions are downstairs and that is where you will be drawn, although I fully recommend going upstairs to see some live animals and a very large collection of taxidermy birds.This is great for people of all ages and varieties, whether you want to read and learn about the exhibitions or have children who will be very exciting by the dinosaur skeletons.Definitely recommend!"
nice to see a dinosaur named after my nephew,"The museum is a sorted collection of animals and other organisms sorted based on their taxonomy. It is fascinating, but not very interactive. More for teaching students than entertaining kids. One of the dinosaurs - the T. rex - was called Stan, which my nephew Stan liked a lot of course!"
Great museum,"This was recommended to me, otherwise I would not have thought of going to a Natural History museum outside London! It is fantastic. Lots of exhibits, many of which are hands-on. Well laid out, not too big, but lots to see. I saw lots of younger kids enjoying the trail provided. My kids are teenager, and although they were hesitant to begin, they both agreed that they really enjoyed it and chatted about it after we had left."
Fun outing,"Visited Oxford for the first time... and it rained. What can you do in the rain? With young children, the wife and I decided that a museum would fit the bill. We arrived at 2.30pm and the kids enjoyed the many exhibits available, including the ones you can touch, before the Science activity started at 3pm. The staff were very patient and awesome allowing my 6 year old to sit in. The one challenge was keeping my pre-teen interested. So I let her walk around and check out the Pitts museum that was inside the complex at whatever paced she felt comfortable. Long story short, the kids enjoyed it and it was a nice way to kill time when it's raining. Oh, and did I say it has free entry, where there's a donation box for visitors and patrons to keep institutions such as this funded."
Lots of huge exhibits,Very interesting and as good as the London Natural History museum. I particularly liked the dinosaurs and crystal formations. Combine your visit with the Pitts River Museum as just next door.
Step back in time...,"An enthralling place to visit, in an amazing building.  If you can tear your attention away from the breathtaking architecture, the exhibits are fascinating: beautifully displayed and well-labelled.  As a committed dinophile I love the more flamboyant items on display, but there is a wealth of fascinating things to see.  The shop is also an excellent place to buy unusual gifts and mementoes.  What is especially admirable is that the Museum caters effortlessly for visitors of all ages.I keep calling in whenever I am in Oxford!"
Great museum!,Our son has been wanting to visit this place for years having seen it on TV. We finally managed to visit. We weren‚Äôt disappointed - in fact our son said it was even better than the Natural History Museum in London. There is certainly lots to see but at the same time it is a manageable size so seeing everything is perfectly possible. It is a beautiful building too. Highly recommended.
Lots to see,"Popped in with the family on the way south. We enjoyed looking at all the dinosaur skeletons and fossils, and marveling at the size of the creatures. Plenty to see, and we liked the fact you could stroke the bears! Went to the Pitt Rivers museum (inside the NHM) to see the shrunken heads as well - gruesome!"
Excellent ,An excellent place to visit. A beautiful setting that is steeped in history. Loads of interesting exhibits with plenty of information available It was fun to stroke the bear!
it has a T-Rex!,"A good range of animals, history and of course dinosaurs. Not the largest museum but enough to pass some time without getting a little boring. There is a cafe, but not that great a selection."
Great low cost day out,Went here when in Oxford for a few days and quite pleasantly surprised. It was fun with loads to see and only a donation asked to get in. I put ¬£5 but you can go for free if totally brassic. Pretty good place and think it would be good for kids as there were lots of families there when i went that looked like they were having fun.
Brilliant,What a great place.  Amazing building - go to the upstairs and see that all of the columns are made from different stone from a llama round the country.  Its pretty small but well laid out with really good exhibits.  Definitely somewhere to have on your list when you visit Oxford.
Beautiful Building,Another fine and grand example of the wonderful architecture around Oxford.Beautiful building and wonderful craftsmanship in the structure
Love this museum,"The museum is within the campus, and free admission. I really enjoyed my visit here. The dinosaurs section is amazing, and the way they presented it is artistic. Highly recommend."
Unique ,"Not as big as some other Natural History museums, but still packed with lots of displays, and you can't beat the charm of being at Oxford University."
Kids will love it,"When we arrived the museum‚Äôs was full of kid‚Äôs  I‚Äôm not complaining, I was a kid once. This place is ideal.  Dinosaurs on the first floor. There are even live cockroaches. Not my cup of tea but kids love it   Well worth the ¬£5 donation"
Wonderful Museum & Lovely Staff,I am a third year Textiles BA student doing my final major project on extinct animals. I contacted the museum in advance about accessing specific extinct species in the museum. Today I was lucky enough to visit the museum and be shown the extinct species I was looking for that were in the museum archives. The staff were really helpful and friendly & I would recommend anyone who is curious in about what the archives have to offer to get in contact!
First visit,My first visit and not my last very good museum with lots of interesting features from fossils to stuffed animals great for all ages
Museum,Situated near red cliff library and bazaar and shaldonian theater the building is a bit old fashioned and is a part of Oxford University. It occupies the variety of bones age old art-effects and likewise things. A good place for those who want to understand the evolution process of human race
A charming Victorian style museum,Ideal for adults and children with several displays that may be touched. We loved the fossils and dinosaurs in particular.
Very good,"This is excellent, full of things to look at, brilliantly described, family friendly and wonderful for a few hours.  Highly recommended."
Great way to spend a few hours in Oxford,Very interesting and informative.  Range of all things nature and how we began.  Live displays as well
Surprisingly interesting,"I am not big on natural history and only went through this museum on the way to the Pitt Rivers Museum which is in the back end of the same building. However, the dinosaur exhibit is really worth seeing - even if you do not have dinosaur-obsessed primary school children."
If I lived in Oxford I would visit every week,"It has a T-Rex skeleton. Point made... Or read on if you wish. While it's not the biggest of museums it's one that packs a punch. They have tons of skeletons, stones, remains and taxidermy animals. You are even allowed to touch a lot of the exibits like the brown and the black bear near the entrance. If you love nature, drawing, science or what ever you will want to visit this museum for sure. Best thing is that it's even free though I do suggest you donate if you can. One disadvantage I had is that there were classes of school there when I visted and it caused a lot of noise but I disregarded that for my scoring as I assume this isn't every day."
"Extensive collection, arranged easy to browse and informative","There is so much to see in this collection, and it is extensive. The written information on the displays is more extensive than other Natural History Museums exhibits, which was great. Lots of interesting information to take in. Lots of dinosaurs to be seen in here, a highlight for me!"
What an eye opener!,"My husband and I called in with no idea how HUGE and WONDERFUL this place is,and, it's free! You really good spend a few days here and still not see it all. We would unreservedly recommend that any visitors to Oxford visit the museum and if you are local and haven't yet been,get to it!! It is absolutely amazing and the work that has gone into creating it, is beyond belief."
"Good day trip, stayed for just over an hour..","This is a good place to look around whilst in oxford, within a ten minute walk from the city centre. Some of the animals were amazing to look at that were on display, however after around 1.5 hours we had looked at everything. Great as it is free to enter, but you can contribute a donation."
"Wonderful museum, we loved it! ","The building itself is fascinating and stunning in its design inside. Very light and bright. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Nice cafe upstairs and you can walk straight through to The Pitts Museum. Don‚Äôt miss either if you are visiting Oxford, they are wonderful."
Great museum,"The museum is really beautiful inside and out, and is fairly similar in content to other natural history museums in Britain I've been to - but I always find them the most interesting! There's a range of animals in a range of formats on display, and includes creatures with‚Ä¶"
Lots of dinosaurs ,"Interesting visit, mostly dinosaurs. The exhibits are a little uninspiring but interesting nonetheless. Roof is a very impressive piece of architecture."
A Fascinating Experience,"I hadn't visited the museum for a while, and I was pleasantly surprised at what I discovered. The section on dinosaurs was fantastic, and anyone who is interested in these creatures MUST make the effort to come and see it. Everything is clearly labelled and there are some good‚Ä¶"
A great place to visit,There is so much to see and to learn and best of all there are touch and feel areas which are always a bonus to give greater experience.  Lots of local finds for fossils and bones most interesting time spent
Beautifully strange & captivating,"An easy find & a fabulous building - the stone pillars are worth taking a closer look at. The guide at the entrance with very insightful & do do do make a donation!  It is eerily beautifully captivating & macabre.. full of dead things üòä a very Victorian feel, a stunning‚Ä¶"
"Excellent coffee, great staff.","Friska has become a pre University morning habit. I'm hard to please on coffee, but their cappuccino is very hard to have one of. Friendly staff too."
Really enjoyable,So much to see! I don‚Äôt even think we managed to see it all. The dinosaur exhibits were particularly enjoyed by us. Loads to read about. Nice that you can actually touch some of the artefacts. Would definitely return.
Perfect for children,"Decided to visit after finding a review online which said it was better than the London one for smaller children - and it definitely was! I went with my baby boy and 4 year old daughter. Thankfully it is completely accessible with a lift to all floors.  My daughter only usual likes what she deems ""girl things"", but even she was fascinated by the dinosaurs, and completely fell in love with the Dodo!!  The museum has several trails for kids to choose from, she choose one where we had to find certain birds, which she thoroughly enjoyed, and got a sticker at the end for her troubles. We spent about an hour and a half in the museum, and went around it all - but at a rather quick 4 year olds pace - you could easily spend longer with older children who are more interested in the detail."
The Architecture is Stunning,The museum is connected to the Pitts River Museum.  The museum is on several floors and has a wonderful collection.  The architecture is very beautiful.
Great for kids,"My grandchildren loved the dinosaurs and the quizzes. The Pitt Rivers is a bit too fussy and crammed but the weapon section (top floor) seemed to interest them, the more gruesome the better!"
Nice museum ,"Good enough museum, has some bones from a dodo which was cool to see and there are some live creepy crawlies on the top floor which is interesting but Pitt rivers out the back is much more interesting!"
Lovely Place BUT bring a Picnic!,Loved our visit to the NHM in Oxford today. It‚Äôs not the same size of the Tring or the London version but the exhibits are well laid out and the kids loved it...The shop is a bit limited but still ok for kids...The cafe is incredibly expensive though so beware! Wraps and sandwiches are ¬£4.75 and ¬£4.95 respectively and were average at best. The whole lunch was over ¬£24 for a family of four where only two ate! It really was crazy...Bring a picnic and sit outside the building if the weather is good!Parking is a little dodgy but try to get in Museum Road as it‚Äôs opposite. 2hr parking for ¬£6 btw so be sure you get back in time for the ticket...
"Fun for all age 1, 3 and 10!",On a Sunday you can park from 11am -7pm outside on single yellow lines for FREE! Bonus! Museum is also free but suggested donation of ¬£5 which we did. Wow wasn'texpecting so much in a small building. Children enjoyed it and on a Sunday they do family activities between 2pm-4pm all free as well. Spotlessly clean and all the staff were friendly and knowledgeable of the items we asked about. Did not use the cafe as had picnic on grass outside. We spent five hours here. You can refill your water bottle for free to. Abit hot inside but it was 30.c outside.  Well worth a trip and will return.
Fabulous building,The museum isn‚Äôt huge (and we weren‚Äôt sure about Pitt Rivers that the museum runs straight into) but is well worth an hour - has loads of skeletons / models and we really liked the highlighting of gifted women through history who had been involved in science and in the main hadn‚Äôt been able to get the qualifications they‚Äôd been entitled to. Is free for entry - they just ask for donations.
Worth a visit,Manageable recently renovated museum of natural history.  We did a short walk through due to limited time on our day trip but our teen son spent a few hours in the museum and really liked it.
Better than London,"Wow, what a place, so much to see. Having visited the Natural History museum in London, which I didn't rate, I was expecting this one to be worse, but was very surprised. We spent nearly 4 hours here and will definately be back."
Stunning Collection and Building,We loved the architecture of the building as well as the collections. It was fun to stroke the bear and see the countless skeletons.
Amazing museum and a fantastic collection of exhibits,"Well to start with, this little gemis free!The exhibits are all clearly displayed in. If clear cabinets or close enough that you can almost touch a full elephant skeleton.I came with two very excitable little boys and two friends from Holland and we all wanted to stay longerPlanning a return trip soon. Too much was briefly seen or missed"
Lovely museum ,I was fascinated by the wealth of fossils found by the Oxford academics. Many of them were discovered near the Oxfordshire. My son was very much excited to explain to me about the behavior of those animals. The atmosphere drove us to think and explore. Two thumbs up!
"Great museum, shame about the cafe","Having visited one before, I recommended that my friend visit when we went - and the dinosaurs, gems, fossils and displays remain excellent and breath-taking (and full of small children, because this is a very good alternative to slogging into London!) Lots of interesting exhibitions (eg we stumbled upon the wood one upstairs, and some beetles...)My only niggle is the cafe - the food is fine, but the attitude of the staff is poor; perfectly polite when serving but no more than that, and gossiping/being rude when they could have been far more helpful to their customers. Find another cafe nearby."
Exciting!,Very interesting museum with a lot of history. The kids loved the dinasours which is always a plus!!
You will spend longer here than you think,"Went here after arriving in oxford expecting to be there for only an hours or so as we knew it was quite small; however, we were pleasantly surprised to see what can be done with so little space. The interactive centre was popular and had various activities for the kids to do on their wonder around. It was hot and stuffy so take a bottle of water with you... the cafe is a bit pricey. Some specimens are duplicated throughout the museum and information on some exhibits are a bit lacking. Saying that we enjoyed our time there. We also recommend the adjoining museum ‚Äòthe Pitt-Rivers museum‚Äô."
Full of artefacts,This Museum is full of treasures to stop and look at it‚Äôs a must visit place while in Oxford we found it on the tour bus which stops nearby.
Dinossaurs lovers ,What a beautiful building and an amazing collection for children and adults. A very good place to take the kids to spend some quality time. It‚Äôs possible to take a picnic and eat in the front
Great hour spent here,We live in Oxford area and decided to drop in. Great displays and fascinating to see. Free entry with suggested donation of ¬£5.
Interesting for the whole family,Great displays at this museum.  We particularly enjoyed the dinosaur exhibit and the fluorescent rock room. Access is free but they do ask for a small donation.
Great half day out ,"Travelled from Northampton and used pear tree park and ride, with two biyd aged 2 and 6. The youngest is currently obsessed with andys dinosaur adventures so absolutely loved the dinosaur skeletons. There is something for everyone. Lovely gift shop and cafe."
Very interesting,Fantastic  very interesting. Great how you could touch some of the exhibits. Would recommend suitable for any age group.  Also do refills of water to helps the enviroment.
Interesting,Was a little spoilt from visiting The Louve in Paris however this was very interesting and I would certainly recommend a visit.
An excellent museum well worth a visit.,Dinosaurs and Dodo plus fossils and life through the ages all displayed in a magnificent building. On top of all of this it is free of cost.
very interesting,"free entry, beautiful glass ceiling in the center of the old historic building; it houses the remains of the dodo, skeletons of dinosaurs and other animals, and colllections of gems for example. Also interesting for children"
Impressive,Great museum with plenty to see and admire. Lots of variety and child friendly. My young girls enjoyed the trail and were delighted when they received stickers and gem stones at the end of the trail.
Great morning out,"My daughter loved our hour and a half here- very interesting and informative day out with helpful, well informed staff. We would return"
Informative and easy to navigate.,Well organized museum and they have made the format in a way that everyone could understand. Nothing fancy yet has almost everything you need. Good experience overall.
Afternoon at the museum,"I drove there yesterday from Milton Keynes about 50 minutes and it was brilliant. Parked and Pear Tree park and ride, cost of ticket for car and a family of 2 adults and max 3 children, inclusive parking and bus ride is still ¬£6.80, please bring change or you can pay by card. No need to display the ticket as you will need it for the bus ride and remember to pay within 10 minutes of arrival. Buses are every ten minutes and our stop was Radcliffe. To go back the best bus stop would be the C2 by Sainsbury‚Äôs local on Magdalen Street. This for us was a first and it was easy enough. Girls are 7 and 6 and had a great time. Currently there is an exhibition on fossils and how animals‚Äô life evolved. Also between 12 and 4pm volunteers run a little ricreative corner with library, arts and crafts and trails. As you know the museum is free and suggested donation is ¬£5. We then went for a walk passing by the theatre, a lovely library with stop at ‚ÄòHarry Potter‚Äô shop üôÇ and a visit to one of the colleges entrance fee per adult only ¬£3. Definitely I would go again and suggest to all."
Another brilliant museum in Oxford,Oxford has so many fantastic things to do and this is just another to tick off the list. The museum contains some brilliant things to look at!
Impressive collection!,"If you like museums and you've seen the Ashmolean, this museum should probably be next on your list.  An impressive collection (although some are casts) of skeletons ranging from dinosaurs (T-Rex) to whales, elephants, giraffes, etc."
I love the bears!,"Very friendly and helpful staff at the entrance. Geared up for younger visitors and I was pleased to see more exhibits now which can be touched which is great for getting children into science. I love the black bear and the brown bear which you can touch. There is also an Ammonite and some Pyrites and other tactile exhibits which is great for visually impaired visitors. The building itself is very interesting architecturally. Free entry. A great museum, with a good shop, as a starter for young children. They will fill up your water bottle free too."
Dinosaurs,Some excellent huge skeletons. And the 8ft crab - yikes!Not keen on the stuffed birds and animals though
A bit old fashioned in style and setup,"Visited with a blind and deaf family member. Pleased to see quite many touchable objects. Had expected a larger museum. Many exhibits seemed a little crowded with the objects too close to each other. Nice place, but wouldn‚Äôt be back."
Learn about evolution at this wonderful museum,"While some of the displays are older, the collections of exhibits is outstanding.  Check out the dodo and look for a kakapo."
Museum of Natural History,Lovely old museum which explains some of the history of scientific discovery at Oxford Museum. There's a nice glass-sided bee hive to see upstairs.
Great,"Highly entertaining museum, even better when combined with the Pitt Rivers in the same building. Smaller scale than it‚Äôs London namesake but no less interesting."
"Interesting collection of stuffed animals, skeletons and fossils","Visiting Oxford, we passed through the Oxford University Museum of Natural History enroute to the Pitt Rivers Museum.Interesting collection of stuffed animals, skeletons and fossils / minerals.Suitable for all ages.Free to visit.The fossilised dinosaur bones (casts) are particularly impressive."
A lovely place for the little ones,"My children adore going to the Museum of Natural History! It's got lots of different exhibits and lots of them they can touch. The insects upstairs are very interesting to watch, especially the bees (we always try to look for the queen). Their temporary exhibitions are mostly interesting too, but probably aimed at a bit more grown up population. You can see the highlights in about an hour/hour and a half but you can also easily spend several hours, especially if you visit the PITT Rivers Museum too. Definitely worth the visit."
Really Cool,Great place to spend 1 - 1.5 hours in.Learned a lot and got some cool pics too!Bf and I both thoroughly enjoyed it.
So much to see but so little time,There is a lot to see on 2 levels. The layout is good and you do get to see the majority of the displays in a morning. Bets thing it's still free. Well worth the visit.
Fantastic Museum,"This is a fantasic museum that should keep all the family entertained whilst passing on knowledge.  Plan to spend several hours if your going to see everything properly and the PITT Rivers Museum is only next door, if your going to do both museums together plan for the all day."
Simply the Best,"Well I think the Oxford museum of natural history is simply the best. There are a few things there which were really memorable, seeing a Nile Crocodile close up and the display of skeletons was amazing. Lots of things for children to do, so its a really good place for families. Its free to get in and for a Yorkshireman careful with his pennies then that is really important. Some tourist attractions can be far too expensive."
Brilliant just allow plenty of time,"Allocate plenty of time to visit this NH museum along with the Pitt Rivers museum which are in the same building.So much to see, read, digest and talk about. Plenty of seats available for a little sit down if you need one and there is a lovely cafe on the first floor, The building itself is fabulous and it is stuffed full of interesting things including real size dinosaurs.It‚Äôs free to get in but if you don‚Äôt make a donation for the entertainment then shame on you as it really is worth chucking a tenner at least into the pot.Nice little gift shop too but it does get busy!Highly recommended."
Outstanding,"We really enjoyed this place.  Although it was smaller than the London Museum of Natural History, we enjoyed it a lot more.  The exhibits were great, some live bugs, some taxidermied animals and some fossils.  It was a great mix.  The dinosaur exhibition was the best ever!  Beautiful venue."
Brilliant Museum,"Visited as part of a day in Oxford, Very impressive, Great displays extremely well explained, combined with Pitt Rivers musum in the same building it is really worth the effort"
Went to see the dodo,"We went to see the dodo and found much more! The museum is a gem among the others. I consider it to be better than the one in London, even though this is not so big."
Amazing,"It was so much bigger than I thought! Really impressive, lots to see, we ended up staying an hour but we could have easily stayed longer. I would definitely recommend it"
"Tons of events, friendly staff","Tons of great events and talks here. The after-dark events are great, and have attended several lectures here that are fun too. The staff running these events have always been helpful and well organized."
Wonderful building and great exhibits,"There is something in this museum for everyone, even if it's only to gaze at the gorgeous architecture.  Visitors can touch some of the furry exhibits and there's always something going on to engage with the public.  A great way to spend a couple of spare hours or a rainy afternoon."
Quite a surprise,We intended to walk through this museum simply to get to the Pitts River museum but ended up wandering around for about an hour.  Nice old fashioned displays of animals and rocks. All very well done and had a sense of being very British.  Much character.  We were there on a Friday afternoon when school was on break and the place was filled with parents and children. It was a delight to see the children engaged in the collection and looking in awe at some of the exhibits.  It‚Äôs not the Ashmolean but worth time for museum aficionados.
Great visit for everyone,Great visit for all ages. Easy access for prams too It‚Äôs a donation to get in. Kids had a great time with the dinosaurs ect Highly recommend coming
Nice museum with nice collections.,"Don‚Äôt compare this museum with it‚Äôs much grandiose London counterpart. This museum is in fact has one huge hall with fossils and other displays. It is a bit out-dated because of the display style but definitely worth visit, collections are interesting, friendly staff and even has a small cafe for a bite and coffee."
What a wonderful museum!,"After walking and sightseeing in Oxford all morning we went into this museum mostly just to get a cup of tea in its caf√©, but stayed for several hours looking at all the exhibits. The main hall is overwhelming, very bright because of all the glass in its ceiling, it has an open floor plan with many items like minerals and stuffed animals on display everywhere, so you get a mini-tour and education through natural history by just walking around in this one area. The dinosaur skeletons catch the eye immediately of course, but take your time looking around because there is so much more to see. And there's even more upstairs.I personally liked being able to touch a lot of items, like a bear's fur and a billions years old meteorite from space.If I visit Oxford again I will certainly come back to this museum, what a nice surprise!"
Just amazing especially for the insects,"We loved the gallery with the beautiful British marble and other hard stone pillars.  MInerals and gemstones beautifully explained - a wealth of new vocabulary to describe their fascinating properties.  We appreciated the cases of all the native birds &  animals but especially insects.  Live ones in glass tanks (one crowded with cockroaches!), lucid explanations of so much insect biology, a working beehive,  it was all wonderful.  Downstairs less interesting to me as very familiar with London Nat. Hist. Museum, but plenty of enraptured children looked after by a lot knowledgeable staff."
"My favourite place in all of Oxford, especially now there's a cafe ;)","I love it, my wife loves it, my daughter loves it and we go almost every week. Just the best place to go to get away from the hustle and bustle of modern life, and just be a kid again."
Beautiful museum and striking building,"This museum is beautiful, teresting for Adults and amazing for kids, and make sure you check the Pitts Rivers too!"
Like a mini Natural history museum,"Lots to see, nicely laid out, there were lots of activities for kids- although it was half term. Little cafe upstairs overlooks the main floor."
"Great vibe, so many enthralled children but fun for adults too","We found a couple of hours to visit prompted by the last day of an exhibit on bacteria in the upper gallery.  The ground level gallery had a wide range of exhibits including giant live cockroaches and spiders.  Children of all ages were engaged with the exhibits and having a wonderful time, especially if they liked dinosaurs.  Many (but not all) exhibits encourage touching.The building itself is gorgeous."
Lots of fun for kids in a quirky Victorian building,"We visited as seniors but this place is rightly popular with families with young children.  There is a lot to like.  The building looks like something out of Harry Potter with a beautiful Victorian glass roof.  There are dinosaur skeletons, huge models of bacteria, live tarantulas, and generally lots of cool stuff.  And its free."
Amazing ,"What a gem. The trilobite displays were particularly impressive. Don‚Äôt just look in the display cabinets. So much more to see, the columns are beautiful and are all made out of different types of rock."
Wowie ,"I‚Äôd rate it 6 if I could.The beautiful building, the gorgeous displays, the fascinating facts and most of all the variety, it has everything!! Interactive exhibits you can‚Äôt help yourself from feeling and stroking and spending hours exploring"
Fantastic ,"Well worth going if only for the look on my teenage child‚Äôs face when they spotted the tarantula.  A brilliant museum with some interactive exhibits, pity the observation hive was not there today, but a very enjoyable visit was had by all.  Always very warm on a sunny day though."
Simply amazing!,"The place is incredible. There are so many things to see and experience that if you'll choose it, you'll definitely love it, we did!"
Loved it!,Free entry (suggested donation ¬£5 - it's worth it). Highlights by far for me were the dinosaurs/dinosaur-era reptiles and the dodo. My visit coincided with an exhibition on bacteria as well (only a few days left as I write this) which was interesting as you don't always think about good bacteria as well as bad. Maybe a bit overwhelming though as there is quite a lot to see even with a short attention span like mine!
"Lovely dinosaur skeletons, bugs on pins, samurai armour","The Natural History Museum is a must-see in Oxford for children of all ages. It has a lovely welcoming interior, and, along with the excellent Pitt Rivers Museum in the back corner of the building, you could easily entertain yourself (and your children, if you have any) for several hours on a rainy day quite happily. It has wonderful and fascinating exhibits, and is right next to University Parks--a nice place for stroll or a picnic in good weather. If the weather is not terrific, there is a reasonably-priced cafe on the first or second floor--  and more exhibits on the upper floors of the museum worth seeing as well. Have spent countless happy hours here with my children, we all love it dearly."
It has the only surviving soft tissue remains of a dodo.,"What more do you want? This museum and the Pitt-Rivers are in adjoining buildings - or the same building, depending on how you look at it. I suggest picking one area of natural history, and immersing yourself in it, rather than trying to cover the entire museum. It is overwhelming."
Fantastic History Museum ,"This is by far my favourite Natural History museum. Absolutely. Love it here. Yes it is smaller in comparison to let's say, London but this museum is fantastic."
Interesting visit,A grand building with a well laid out interior. Exhibits were of good quality and there were activities for children
Interesting,The museum itself holds fascinating specimens from dinosaur fossils to insects. There are interactive specimens where you can touch some taxidermy which is as very interesting. The museum hasn‚Äôt got a specific layout and it felt like just a jumbled collection out together. They could probably spend some time thinking about a flow for the visitors to follow.
Great Dinosaurs ,Well presented dinosaur and geology exhibition and much more in a Victorian glad building of great style
First impression breathtaking,"We spent a few days in Oxford (Thursday 25th ‚Äì Monday 29th April) and visited the Natural History museum twice.  The first visit, on the Thursday afternoon was very brief, we needed a snack but the cafe had sold out.  However, the first impression when opening the door and entering was quite breath-taking, a huge display of the skeletons of whales and dinosaurs.We returned early on the Friday morning and spent several hours at the museum and at the adjacent Pitt Rivers museum.  Particularly interested in a small display of the remains of the ‚ÄúRed Lady of Paviland‚Äù which were found in a cave on Gower not very far from where we live.  The ‚ÄúRed Lady‚Äù was actually a young man whose bones were stained by red ochre."
Fun Friday ,We went as four adults and six children. The children loved their time at the museum. Touching the big fur brown bear. Looking at the skeleton of the different anomaly but especially the dinosaurs. They enjoyed watching the real bees. Were amazed by the dinosaur footprints outside the museum. There was an Easter egg hunt. But as under 4s they lost interest in quiz.
Excellent for animal enthusiasts,"This is much smaller than the London one, however still pretty good displays. Free to enter and has other exhibition events"
Ideal for kids of all ages,We went here on a very cold bank holiday weekend. Really just to get in the warm and use thecafe that had been recommended to us in the viewing gallery.We were surprised how interesting and easy to explore the place was.We will return when we have more time to browse.
A national treasure,"A fabulous building, wonderfully presented, packed full of wonders. There‚Äôs plenty of interactive displays and live exhibits,  (A very large tarantula) and the cafe is reasonably priced with a great view."
Dinosaurs are so fascinating and my 5 yr old daughter loves it,"The architecture of the building is fascinating, and seeing all different types of dinosaurs was very interesting. My daughter learned about different types of minerals or stones. Those skeletons of different animals and dinosaurs are so amusing. Definitely recommended to visit this place when u go to oxford. It‚Äôs just walking distance from town Centre."
Fantastic museum for all ages,"Kids will love this museum as it is full of dinosaurs and other prehistoric beasts, but adults with a cursory interest in natural history or those more academic can appreciate too. In addition, there are interesting talks in the evenings. Handy being in same building as Pitt Rivers too."
Very informative!,"Visited on a very warm day so the glass ceiling was not appreciated in the heat(!!) However such a lovely building and for the size, so much packed into it!They also have a few displays which can be touched which I thought was great for children"
Two museums in one ,Good place to visit for all ages.  Spent most time in the Pitts Rivers museum with a wide range of odd items. Natural history seemed very popular too though with plenty of activities for younger kids.
Museum visit,"Excellent place free entry(donation advisable), plenty of natural history to learn & enjoyable experience, would recommend highly as it's an inexpensive day out with your family"
Shrunken heads and ebola,"Go see, it's a bit of everything and is a delight for people who don't want to be spoon fed an interactive experience but look and read and learn. Don't open the witches bottle...."
Super exhibition housed in a unique building,Our children are very demanding but found the exhibits in this museum easy to see and understand. The dinosaur exhibition with full skeletons was truly amazing. The exhibits are displayed in glass cabinets and with the roof fully ‚Äòlit‚Äô everything is displayed to its full potential. Very busy when we visited as it‚Äôs 1/2 term. Luckily we found parking in an adjacent street but very restricted and pricy. This museum needs more time to explore but for the time we were there we found the experience worthwhile.
School holidays life saver - Under ¬£7 for a day out in Oxford!,"As you can see from the overall ratings, you are onto a good thing visiting Oxford University's Museum of  Natural History. I just thought I would share some tips and information to help out others. I have three children (6 and under) so finding things to entertain them in the school holidays is hard work, and wallet draining at times. I don't know about other families but we have to break up the home craft / baking, park visits and scooter/walks with other adventures. Que the natural history museum which is the perfect size for my three to enjoy, and for us to cover a day out. We live about 25 minutes outside of Oxford, so drove to the nearest park and ride: Oxford Parkway (previously Water eaton). It costs ¬£2 to park for up to 11 hours, and ¬£4.80 return for a family (2 adults and up to 3 children (under 16)). If you need a buggy, take your collapsible/quick fold (there is a luggage shelf to put it on) because the buses only have two spaces and one of the spaces is used as additional seating so if those are filled up you are down to one space. When I got on there was already a lady parking in that spot. The museum is free, but they do have boxes where you can drop in some money to help fund this fantastic set up. There is plenty to do and see, and my boys really loved it when a sign said 'PLEASE TOUCH' (ie getting to stroke an American brown bear). My 1 yr old who has been walking about a month, also LOVED the museum. She happily explored and squealed with delight when she was able to touch or get up close to something. The upstairs has themes that are changed throughout the year (its bacteria at the moment, and there are lots of interactive activities for the kids to engage). We also loved seeing a working bee hive, and of course the dinosaur skeletons (there are foot prints in the grass outside). There is a cafe upstairs but I packed a picnic (as did a lot of families), and we ate outside (thankfully it was a sunny day) where there are a couple benches but if you have space for a picnic blanket in your buggy basket (or backpack) then take it with you.  Tips: * At Oxford parkway, you you can park there for up to 72 hours.* There are two ticket machines, one for those who just want to pay for the parking (as you might be catching the train, or have a bus pass / annual ticket) and the other is for those buying a combined ticket. * Don't lose your ticket, as it is your return ticket. * There is a heated waiting area with clean toilets. Its worth using them if you have little ones because once in Oxford finding clean, accessible toilets gets a little harder. But look for a M&S, shopping centre ... or hold on til you get to the museum.* When you get off from the bus the museum is about a 10 minute walk, and there are no food outlets nearby except for the cafe located up stairs."
Amazing museum!,"It‚Äôs smaller as compared to the one in London but it is packed with a lot of things to see! There were different species of dinosaurs, birds, amphibians and a lot more. When we went here there were two bears on display that you‚Äôre allowed to touch, which was very well enjoyed by kids and adults alike. The structure of the museum was also breathtaking, high glass ceilings that provided natural lighting for the whole place. Entrance is free but make sure to donate as to help preserve this wonderful place."
Great place,Had an absolute blast here with my 2 children. There are lots of activities and a lovely cafe. The dinosaur section was our favourite. It doesn't cost anything to get into the museum but we have a donation as we had such a good day!
Bones 'n' Stones 'n' Creepy Crawlies ‚ò∫,"Bones 'n' stones 'n' creepy crawlies were the theme of our day. The sister museum to the Natural History museum in London, the building and collection here is equally as fabulous, just smaller. We were taken by the elephant skeletons which look rather alien, a bit like imperial walkers from Star Wars and the gem collection in a little dark room, under uv light which makes the stones glow in the dark. It is especially lovely that there are live exhibits (bees, stick insects and cockroaches!). Lots of fun and educational at the same time. Finish off with some tea and cake in the upstairs gallery which has a fabulous over the exhibits."
Great,"This is a fab place with free entry, has tonnes of interest items and many that kids can touch to, not to big either that kids would get tired or bored, lovely building to, cafe is a tad on the pricey side but hey... it‚Äôs free entry .... pitts river museum is also to the rear and worth a visit and ashmolean just down the road .. also both free"
Dinosaur land,For those fascinated by the time when dinosaurs walked the earth this is a must see.  Children in particular will love seeing the models and exhibits as it brings the whole time to life.  Imagine the film Night at the Museum and that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs like.  The glass architecture of the building is absolutely amazing.  It leads through to the Pitt Rivers Museum which has a dark creepy feel with exhibits such as shrunken heads.  This part of the museum is a little challenging for the mobility scooter but it is possible to negotiate your way around some of it.
This i an amazing large building packed with interesting History,This Museum is full of very interesting history. Its a very large building with a few floors with plenty to see. The staff are very welcoming and helpful. This museum is near the Centre and very easy to get too with good disabled access too. Its magical particularly for children interested in dinosaurs they wont be disappointed.
Great exploring,Had some time to spare so decided to have a quick look and ended up staying for ages! Great museum with so much to see and free entry! Lots of different areas so something for everyone. Recommend to people of all ages if visiting Oxford.
Good way to spend an your,"Really great exhibit, with a whole variety of  things to see, presented really nicely so that anyone can enjoy, of all ages!"
Interesting,Lovely family day out. Lots to see and a lot of time needed to take in everything the museum has to offer. Various different facts to keep you gripped in to history and a lot of interactive features.
Excellent exhibition on bacteria,Called in to see the new exhibition on bacteria and it was amazing - lots of information that I didn't know before. It has awakend my interest to find out more
Fantastically quaint but somewhat disorganised,"I always enjoy the array of stuffed animals on show; the addicted Pitt Rivers Museum is also suitably gory, with a number of fascinating artefacts on display (including shrunken heads). However, the place is somewhat of a jumble sale, with contemporary items mixed in with the ancient - one has to trundle through the endless rows of shelves and decipher the labels to discern the objets of value from the useless tat (chiefly, contemporary African art made out of old plastic bags - that sort of thing)."
Incredible museum,"Notwithstanding the collection, which is extraordinary and brilliantly displayed (go find the Oxford Dodo - it lives up to the legend), this is one of the most beautiful buildings I‚Äôve ever been in!!!"
Jaw dropping,Incredible museum. Beautiful building and full of extraordinary wonders from around the world. Definitely worth a visit!
Lovely visit,"Spent a few hours here with the dinosaur fossils and rocks.Definitely worth a visit, but very busy with people jostling around the busier and more exciting pieces."
The highlight of our trip,"A really fun and fascinating museum -- maybe the highlight of our whole holiday in England and France. For kids and families who are interested in science, or ""just"" animals or dinosaurs, this is a magical place -- and there's lots for teens and adults too. From the gorgeous architecture (including columns made from stone from different parts of the UK) to the stuffed animals you can actually pet, we loved this museum."
Fantastic for kids,"Lots of great things to see and for the kids to touch, really well presented and worth many repeat visits."
Great visit,A well run museum with very welcoming staff. Lots to see and lots to learn.We enjoyed the bird displays as we got to see plumage and size up close.Lots of skeleton casts from dinosaurs to elephants.
Oxfords hidden little gem,"Took family visiting from up north. What a fantastic place, stuffed with some incredible pieces.  Definitely would recommend."
Some interesting dinosaur and animal skeletons,"This museum had a few cool bits in and its totally free..- Good selection of dinosaur skeletons- Other cool animal skeletons- It has a live bee hive but when we went the hive had swarmed so it wasn't available to see but I recon it would be really cool to see!On personal preference, it did have a lot of  boring plain rocks / minerals.Worth visiting!"
Hidden gem,"Ok so it's not the scale of the one in London but it's still really good and enough to fill at least half a day with small kids. Plenty of dinosaurs, bones and rocks! And it's free."
History,"Lovely place , would visit again. Lots to see and learn. Great for families, keep you occupied for ages"
Fantastic Museum,We went on a day trip to Oxford and we were blown away by the exhibits. User friendly and perfect for children (although my wife & I are both retired). A must see on a visit to the city (and it is free !).
Amazing (as always)!,"This was our third visit, and was specifically requested, by our 4 year old, as the only destination, for her birthday. It is such an incredible place, very welcoming, excellent facilities, and amazing exhibits! The dinosaurs are still a firm favourite with our little ones, but we particularly enjoyed the Bacterial World exhibition.Keep up the exceptional work, guys! We can‚Äôt wait to come again üíï ü¶ï"
Nice walk through on natural history,"We visited Oxford for one day and spotted also this museum. Although not very big (very suitable actually for common layman) we enjoyed the facilities, many many items and nice layout of all exhibits. Easy access and a lot to see. Recommend."
Never get bord,"Museum will never disappoint, I am a regular here and have been since childhood, been here with school, first dates and now with my son on a regular basis."
Interesting and family friendly,"The Natural History and Pitt Rivers Museums remain of great interest for all ages. There are items that children are allowed to touch, as well as those in glass cases in the Natural History Museum. The Pitt Rivers section is an extraordinary and fascinating collection of items from around the world.The building is worth visiting for its architecture too."
Fascinating visit,Great museum to visit and spend as long or short a time as you have available. It‚Äôs free entry so don‚Äôt forget to put something in the donations box! I‚Äôve vidited so many times yet always find something I‚Äôve not seen before .
Wow Wow Wow,"This museum is ever so slightly out of the centre but it‚Äôs worth that ten minute walk to it, to reach the sheer beauty of what‚Äôs inside.Massive sculptures of dinosaurs, a giant inflatable e-coli along with so many interesting facts about every animal on this planet. I was amazed by the sheer volume of facts, designs and models displaying the natural history of the world. They also have a little gift shop, if you fancy buying any nick-nacks that‚Äôs animal or planet related.You could get lost in here for hours upon end. It‚Äôs also attached to The Pitts River Museum, which is worth a look whilst you‚Äôre here. If you‚Äôre fancying a coffee or snack they have a cafe and toilets."
Dodos!,Nice open design - great for 1-2 hours of wandering.  Best part is the dodo skeleton and replica.  Admission fee is voluntary.
Interesting and engaging,Visited this museum which is easy to walk to if on foot in Oxford.Entrance is free but they ask for a ¬£5 donation.There is so much to look at and everything is nicely displayed with information to help you learn about the exhibits.They have lots of interactive displays which are great for children and a real beehive where you can watch the bees working.The current specialist topic is bacteria and there is an additional display explaining in simple terms how it works.There are two floors to explore in this architecturally interesting building as well as a shop and cafe.  Cafe prices were very reasonable and the staff young and friendly.You can also work through to the Pitt Rivers Museum.Great place to visit and I would highly recommend spending a morning or afternoon here.
Interesting and enjoyable visit,Interesting and enjoyable visit.  Have visited the Londong NHM and although the Oxford museum is smaller it was well laid out and plenty of exhibits.  Would recommend.
Fantastic,"From the building to every single object you find in here..MagnificentGo with children, they will absolutely love it"
Wonderful building and museum,"The building is wonderful, wrought iron pillars decorated with animals and plants hold up the glass roof.  Look for the unfinished window decoration on the outside, it's said that the money ran out to pay the Irish Stone Masons, so they downed tools and left!  The exhibits are well laid out and if you are able to go to a Science Afternoon with children, so much the better.  Have visited many times and still find new things to look at."
Science Saturdays went to,"Visited before but came as the museum was holding a Saturday Science afternoon. Wow! my son thoroughly enjoyed each activity and each adult responsible for delivering each activity, I could not fault their teaching and interaction with the children. Range of teaching methods including handling objects. Only criticism was it was advertised for children 8 years plus, my son is 9. A lot of children who were present were much younger than this and did not have any siblings age 8+ with them, so we had to wait between activities and the younger children tended to grab all objects, found it difficult to share etc as obviously they are much younger. The activities were geared and advertised for 8 years+ so this should ideally be monitored especially as I find as my son is getting older there is less on offer for this age group."
Wow!!!!,"Amazing couple of hours at this museum, really interesting for anyone remotely interested in animals. Adequate coffee shop and a shop for any needy purchasers."
Good,"It was good to have a look round, not big inside and the shop did  not have a lot stocked, but ok to buy a few bits"
Gothic wonder,"You really need to spend some time in this wonderful building to really appreciate the incredible displays and stories being told. There is such a spread of interesting exhibits and detail to be explored. From the live bee hive, to sadly departed birds and stunning photos of insects are all vividly depicted allowing young and old to appreciate nature in all its colour and variety. A true gem in Oxford"
Nature on show,"This museum was brilliant. With so much to take in, you could easily spend the best part of a day in here, especially with children or if you take the time to soak in the details of each display. Plenty of the displays allow touching. Cute little gift shop, a nice cafe to take a break. Well worth donating to keep this place available to the public. Easy to access"
Great for families,"It's free and great for families with lots of 'hands on' activities for the  children. It has a cafe, toilets and leads into the Pitt Rivers museum."
Short stay,This is a brilliant place for kids and adults as there is so many interesting things there and very interactive. Again worth a visit and you could spend long hours there as the Pitt Rivers museum is next door. So much things to see and do. My wife and daughter loved it and would go again.
Can't praise them highly enough,"So much to see and so well laid out, a magnet for children and adults alike.  But what I really like are its exhibitions - I made a special journey a few months back for the excellent exhibition on the population of the UK and last week the exhibition on the Bacterial World was on - equally fascinating and engaging, my 15 year old son and I learnt so much.  Both times we spent a good 4 hours here and could have stayed longer.  What a wonderful place!"
Perfect for the kids,"Beautiful Victorian building full of fascinating specimens! Museum is relatively small but jam packed full of information. Would definitely recommend, particularly for families with children."
Wonderful Victorian building with excellent exhibits,"As it says it is a Museum of Natural History.  Was originally designed to be used as a teaching building for the University of Oxford and still has a lecture theatre. Fascinating building with some interesting ironwork - look for the plants and animals.  The pillars are all made of different rocks from around the UK and good displays of minerals and of the megalosaur discovered locally.  Good descriptions of how all rocks are formed - sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic."
From ants to dinosaurs,"Oxford is a grat city with all these wonderful museums you can enter for free (they do accept donations). One of these museums is the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. The building is an architecture pearl. The glass roof brings lots of natural light into the main room. Even if you don‚Äôt like dinosaurs it‚Äôs hard not to be impressed by the sceletons presented in the main room. If you‚Äôre more into smaller things, take the stairs upstairs and look at insekts both dead and alive. An impressive collection!"
VERY INTERESTING AND LOVELY SIZED MUSEUM,Me and my partner had a lovey time walking around here and looking at all the history. There is lots to see and for children there is hands on things to do.
"Free, interesting and hands on",Had an excellent time in both here and Pitt Museum. Highly recommend. Free to get in.... so we have donation on exit.
Amazing Natural History Museum,A brilliant natural history museum with superb exhibits - everything carefully described.  An amazing place to spend an hour learning more about dinosaurs.  The facility is stunning on both the interior and exterior!Don't miss it!
Must see when in oxford,"Have grown up in oxford all my life, and this place was a staple of my childhood. Free entry and near to the parks for a picnic. What more could you want.  Revisited with my own children many times over the last 20 years, and now coming with an excited party of children from school(5-7years) to look at dinosaurs. They were blown away. I even picked up new information from the talk we had. Very informative and child friendly. It‚Äôs a great place to come, as some of the exhibits are touchable and interactive. This time there have a add on of bacteria as they focus on something that‚Äôs not always in the museum. There‚Äôs a great big huge E-colibbacteria hanging from the ceiling. The restoration on the roof is absolutely stunning. You really want to give yourself most of a day to look around, especially as you have the Pitt rivers museum attached at the rear. (Enter on the bottom level at the back)"
Great little museum,Not on the scale of London's Natural History Museum but definitely worth a visit. We spent a good couple of hours here. Free admission but donation suggested.
love the dinosaur footprints outside the entrance,"Brilliant museum, visited when the Bacterial World exhibition was there. Clean and great for photography.When i visited they still had some of the wonderful photos of insects from the Microculpture: The Insect Photography of Levon Biss.Large beautifully lit very detailed photos on the wall.A great day out for all."
Great for a family afternoon out.,"Always worth a visit, but even more so when they have activities for our young children. We visited with 4 children (0, 2, 3 and 6 years) and 4 adults and all came away happy!"
Highly recommended,"Visited in January with a few friends. We all really enjoyed our time here, though that time was too short. Where else are you actively encouraged to stroke the exhibits? - which is certainly the case with the black and brown bears. I will certainly be returning."
Great exhibit on bacteria,"Walked in when we were in Oxford for the day, wanted to go to the Pitt Rivers but never made it there as the exhibit on bacteria was so interesting"
Amazing,"This is a fantastic day out in the Museum. You can see a Dino, Dodo and a Dingy Skipper. There are so many different types of Animals to see from small insects to big animals. You can read all about how many years the insects/creatures have been around for and what country they come from. There is some very interesting Statements to read as well. If you don't like Creepy crawlies then it's not for the faint hearted, myself I gave it a miss and just walked straight past that part of the museum."
Skeletons of animals stand out for me- but full of awesome exhibits  ,"The dodo exhibit was interesting and informative, the elephant skeletons were amazing, showing the size of these wonderful animals, the other animal skeletons reinforced this. From Dinosaur eggs to stuffed birds and animals, so much to see, will definitely be returning"
Great Museum,Excellent and quite large museum.  Suitable for all ages.  Parking is available in the side road opposite. The max stay is 2 hours and the cost ¬£5.
Fantastic Museum,This is a super Natural history museum in an amazing building.It is the must see attraction in Oxford.Great for kids and families.The collection itself is fantastic but do look at the building particularly the roof which is made of glass tiles.Its free but do leave a donation they deserve it.
Personal favourite,This is one of my favourite places to visit in Oxford. Filled with wonderful curiosities and you can easily dedicate a day to wonder at the Pitt-Rivers collection. The natural history museum has excellent information and a great lay-out. Make sure to go past the cafe and have a look at the bee-hive. It‚Äôs my favourite feature.
Super museum,Free and fantastic very much enjoyed it should have spent more time there - Pitt Rivers is connected and also fantastic
My sons loved learning the morse code!,We went to spend a day at Oxford with the aim to view the museum as my son is a fan of Einstein‚Äôs work.We saw the blackboard of Einstein.There was a session for learning morse code.The boys had a go and were able to send messages to each other.Staff were really helpful. The commentary was interesting for folks who love physics/ science and scientists.We have lovely memories of this day.
Excellent museum,One of the best museums I have visited. Well displayed with the right level of details. Have enjoyed the information about bacteria and virus.
Great collection,Spent about an hour here. Great collection with exhibits that you are allowed to touch. Very interactive and is great for kids with various materials to keep them engaged. All displays were well labelled and detailed. Saw the famous remnants of a Dodo. Would come back for a fuller visit.
Festival of lights,"Amazing space, beautiful collection, nice events through the year. Love the ceiling and the dinosaurs."
Spectacular Building And Contents,"I was visiting the Pitt Rivers which is accessed by a small door in the back of this Museum, but as always, I did spend some time enjoying the the superb exhibits on the way through. I always like the ‚ÄúDodo‚Äù display and the story of the real ‚ÄúAlice‚Äù. The dinosaurs are stunning and, on a busy Saturday, were a centre of attention and excitement for families. In many ways however, the star of the show is the building itself, soaring upwards."
Plenty to see,Visited for part of a day.  Impossible to see it all but worth the effort.  Probably directed more to younger children
Fabulous building,"Lovely museum housed in a beautiful building. Well laid out, very informative, doorway through the back takes you to the excellent Pitt Rivers. When you come out head across the road and follow the passage way it will bring you out near the Ashmolean."
Interestingv,Very interesting museum you see lots of creatures lots of fossils it‚Äôs an interesting museum it‚Äôs worth a visit
Great museum,Another great museum. Always a pleasure to walk around this place. A must see in Oxford.Highly recommend.
Homey museum for everyone,Really nice and interesting. It‚Äôs nice that you can touch animals and the big bacteria was really cool
Natural history ,"Yes dinasours skeletons.  The University's Honour School of Natural Science started in 1850, but the facilities for teaching were scattered around the city of¬†Oxford¬†in the various¬†colleges. The University's collection of¬†anatomical¬†and¬†natural history¬†specimens were similarly spread around the city.Thousands of visitors and many school children cannot be wrong."
Interesting and varied ,This museum has something for everyone so if you are a family or a couple you will find something to look at . They also do quizs  for the kids so a good way to occupy the small ones for a couple of hrs .
A Nice Museum,"Ok so we are not museum visitors but it was a cold afternoon on our recent short break and picked this one out of a large choice. Very interesting, not stuffy and in a beautiful building ! Sure my grandson would have enjoyed it too if he‚Äôd been with us."
Sunday visit,Very interesting and detailed natural history museum. Great for children as well.  Entry is free and makes for a good 2-3 hour visit.
Fabulous museum! A firm family favourite.,"We re-visited to see the massive, inflatable e.coli that is a temporary exhibit there. The whole place is amazing though. Brilliant for young children as there are exhibits you can touch and pat and also activity packs to borrow."
Stunning .. a wonderful experience,"A must-see for everybody visiting Oxford. Where else can you stroke a bear, marvel at 3000 million year-old fossils, stand alongside Tyrranosaurus Rex and gaze in wonder at elephant-sized models of the e-coli and salmonella bacteria"
Nice venue,Been here more for events that were hosted in the museum than to view the collection. It is a beautiful setting!
Visited whilst in Oxford ,I lovely historical building filled with many exhibits from the natural world. I would say a great place to visit with children.
Very good,"Can't complain at all, as with the rest of the places I visited in Oxford I found the collection to be magnificent, cleanness great, access good and toilets very good, and of what little contact I had with staff was also excellent."
excellent collection,"I would highly recommend this as a place to visit. It was well presented and interesting, and it has something for everyone."
Great way to spend at least half a day.,A wide range of curios and historical artefacts on display. Make sure you also go through to the Pitt Rivers museum at the back.
Natural History,"Great museum, well laid out, lots of interesting artefacts and in a stunning building. We particularly liked the touchable exhibits  which bring the museum to life. The finer details of the building also impressed. Free entrance as well. I would recommend to anyone visiting Oxford."
Go every year,"I have been going since I was a child and i am now in my mid 20's. This place is amazing! Not only for kids! So interesting, i learn something new every time."
Fantastic Museum for all the family,"I got my 9 and 7 year old sons to review this one.......It's my favourite museum in Oxford we loved all the exhibits.  We loved the stuffed animals that we could touch.I loved touching really old stone blocks. there were also dinosaurs .It is an amazing museum! .... You never get bored of this museum, which we always try to visit when in Oxford.  Thanks"
"Run through, great for kids ",The exhibition is quite interesting but you probably won't send more than 20 minutes there. Mostly stuffed animals. Loved the sceletons though :)
Wonderful for kids and adults,This is one fo the best natural history museums I've ever visited. I've been many times and am amazed by their collection and presentation.
Excellent Museum,"Really enjoyed visiting here. Plenty of fascinating Exhibits, and if you like dinosaurs this place has some good ones. Nice building as well. Caf√© on First floor. oh good place for kids, hands on exhibits."
Awesome museum for kids,Lots of stuff to see and do Will entertain adult and kids for a good 2-3 hours Well worth a visit but only after all the other attractions
Amazing place!,"The moment you step in, you know this is the museum where your family would enjoy with all the animals and prehistoric creatures."
A wonderful stroll for adults and children,"This is the closest I‚Äôve come to the natural history museum when outside of London.The building has a gothic feel from the outside, a feel that continues via the heavy doors with ornate handles and locks atop the stone staircases.Upon entering the main hall you are greeted by a feast for the eyes! There are exhibits all around, on the ground, on plinths and hung from the ornate ceiling.The skeletons are fantastic specimens and casts, with a good mixture of items on show and items documented in full within the cases.Further to the exhibits, I would encourage anyone to check out the structural details too. Each plinth has a different plant sculptured into it and when in the cafe you can see that each plinth itself is from a unique to the building type of stone, adding to the geology of the experience.Throw in statues of many of the greatest scientists of the past 1,000 or more years and one could gladly spend a whole day at this wonderful, free museum."
Fascinating place,"As a retired science / biology teacher, I found this place fascinating. The exhibits were very thoughtfully laid out so that it was easy to follow events in biological history and the excellent information boards provide sufficient information to aid understanding. Highly recommended!"
Busy but worth it,"We visited here on the bank holiday weekend at the end of summer. With rain outside and a free indoor attraction it was predictably busy. Having said that the exhibits are well spaces, well placed and well thought out so at no point did we feel cramped or rushed.As a museum of natural history it is expected that there are many impressive skeletons from a number of extant and extinct species. All very interesting and worthwhile.There are also tactile exhibits that patrons are invited to touch. With my particular favourites being the minerals and rocks from several billion years ago. As a free attraction there are glass cases in the entrance soliciting donations, which we gave but didn't feel pressured at all into making."
Natural history museum fit to bear Oxford University's name,"If you expect the Natural History Museum at Oxford University to be brilliant, you thought right. The museum is delightfully packed with all things bones (animal skeletons), taxidermy of the highest quality and artefacts from all around the world. You can even see live bees busy at work in the museum! Everywhere you look, there will be something to admire, something to read and something new to learn. It's a very well laid-out museum, and I could see myself coming back a few times and discovering something new I missed my last visit.Entry is free, and there's activities for children available too."
Museum of Natural History,I had so much fun exploring the exhibits here.  The museum is laid out so well making it a joy to visit for both kids and adults.  I was especially fascinated by the rock collection and animal displays.  It was a perfect end to a long day of walking all around Oxford.
Oasis for families ( and the rest),"It‚Äôs free!!! So a good chance to financially recover from other attractions in Oxford. Oxford university collected over years a great collection of things and this is one of the depositories. Kids will love the open layout and it‚Äôs also out of the hassle and bustle of all the other tourist spots giving parents some well needed downtime. The museum itself is child proof and has a kid friendly shop and all the usually restroom facilities. Great family rest area and the Pitt rivers museum out at the back is also a great exploration area for kids and adults alike, something for everyone. Don‚Äôt forget to find the Dodo!!"
So much to look at!,"Something for everyone and well worth a visit. Well laid out and informative, could visit several times and find something new very time!"
Great day out,Have visited twice now as there‚Äôs always a good exhibition on and lots to do. Beautiful place with a good atmosphere
Must visit,After a nice walk we visited the museum of natural history . It‚Äôs surprising but it‚Äôs like a museum within a museum.
"A brilliant museum for anyone, especially dinosaur lovers","Great in school holidays, as always extra things put on for the kids - but good anytime if they are interested in dinosaurs, insects, rocks and even shrunken heads. Bees in a hive that you can see working, as it's glass! Wonderful and light with high glass celing. Great stone pillars all the way round, no two with the same stone."
Nice,"Nice museum. The architecure is really amazing, inside as well as outside!! If you have time left in Oxford, don't hesitate to take a look!"
Fascinating,So. Full of such interesting things whatever your interest this museum will satisfy it the stall and equipment are all  accessble
