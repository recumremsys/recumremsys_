"Massive temple, and then more temples and more temples","This is one epic temple! Complete with a LCD screen ceiling above the Buddha. I’ve never seen such a place before. Then there are like endless amounts of other temples to see. I was so tired of praying and lighting incense, so many gods must be happy for me today!"
Breathtaking...,"First and foremost, definitely come here during off peak period.Rented a car and drove an hour from the Yalong Bay Hilton hotel to Nanshan area. You have to park at the designated carpark outside from the main spot and you can either choose to walk inside or purchase a bus ticket for 30 RMB each person.First stop, alights you off at the Guanying statue. From far, my first impressions were that it is just a bigger looking statue, no biggie. But as you start to walk across the bridge and enter the temple underneath the statue, I was dumbfounded. A gold statue was standing in the middle and surrounding her were different open rooms with the other goddess’ statues. Of which were all further surrounded with about 30 cm tall gold looking goddess statue on the cases mounted on the wall. Some had names on it, probably for those who made huge donations to this place.After walking in the clockwise direction (no hard and fast rule on this but that’s just how I’ve been told), and walking past all the smaller goddess statue, there was a sign saying something like FOOT OF GODDESS. Definitely the word FOOT was inside. Walked several flights of stairs and as you reach the top, oh my gosh, it was breathtaking! Just standing right underneath her and wondering how did they build her! Saw many people touching her toe nails and I did just that. I believe it must be for blessings. She has 3 sides so don’t forget to touch all 30 of them..The view from there was really amazing too! Deffo great for photo taking!!After one round around her, walked down the stairs and was led to the second floor of the temple below which was showcasing similar to the smaller statues below but different names. Something more different was a dark and dimly lifted open room with about over 20 goddess statues. I believe they are made of jade. Was absolutely intrigued at the detailing on them. All in all, the workmanship of the statues, interiors and decorations were what made the entire trip worth it! Just the thought of how they were made was enough to get you to appreciate them.The vegetarian restaurant before the bridge to the Guanying goddess was really delicious! Plus if you sit near the glass panels, you would have a great view of her and the vast sea behind.Tips:• Do make tickets purchases beforehand on WeChat but if you’re a foreigner, you most probably have to purchase it via the counter with your passport. Same goes for the bus ride.• Fresh coconut costs 20 RMB there. Hmmm, I’ve gotten them for 10 RMB each from the non-tourist areas. But hey, if you’re thirsty, why not get one to enjoy while sitting near the sea and having the breezy winds blowing right at you.P.S. You can take the bus ride at a designated spot to the next few temples. The bus guide will ask who wants to alight and they’ll stop at each. But I didn’t do that, so I just sat through it and went back to the main entrance. So if you’re only going to one, you don’t really have to get the bus ticket, it’s only a short walk from the entrance to the goddess statue."
Nanshan Guiyin Buddha,"This is a must see while visiting Sanya on Hainan island, China. It is one of the tallest statues in the world, surrounded by beautiful gardens by the sea. Perfect Instagram opportunities."
Worth the Trip,The giant Buddha area gets very busy but the rest is nice to see as well. This is quite far from Sanya and takes about 50 minutes to get to from the city center. The entrance for low season is 108 and there is a weird bus system that can take you around the park for 30. We would recommend skipping the bus as the area is quite walkable but bring very good shoes. You will need plenty of water if you go mid day and there are many drinks and snacks sold in the area. If you are a foreigner make sure you go to the team ticket buying counter and keep to the far right line to get in.
Summer season,"We came here during summer season. The weather was really hot. But we do love this attraction. The buddha statue is fascinating, standing along the sea. Must come if you are gonna travel to Hainan. Visited on Aug 2019."
Nice temple by the sea,This is the Southernmost temple in China. Located in the Nanshan Bouddhism  Cultural Park. It has beautiful scenery and can be considered the second most important attraction there after the lone Guanyin standing out by the seaside.
"Huge and can get very hot, but recommendable if you have time","Came mostly for religious reason, but I agree this place is a nice place to visit even for non-believers. The architecture is pleasing. Some tips: The place is HUGE. If you’re not a fan of walking, especially while exposed to direct sunlight, then buy the entrance ticket that includes electic bus. I didn’t, and ended up walking for over 2 hours across different locations. Spare at least 3-4 hours to see everything. Non-Chinese ID holders need to buy tickets at the windows. It can get extremely hot, so dress amd prepare properly."
Impressive 108-metre in height statue of Buddhist Guanyin Goddess of Nanshan,"The majority of the  temple was completed in 1988 and is home to many Tang dynasty replicas. The main statue is of the of Buddhist Guanyin Goddess of Nansha, was built by 108 monks over the 1999 to 2005 period. Seems like a metre of statue height for each monk who worked on the project."
In sanya this is one of the attraction,"So if u are in sanya, there ain't much things to do so u can just get a car to drop by hwre. It's a temple with the goddess guan yin and that's it. The place is huge though with a lot of park to walk. Senior citizen gets in free"
Great View and Amazing place,I was there 13 dec 2019 with my coworker It was long way to walk but the view was very beautiful and worth it with my tired
Highlight of the trip,Beautiful temple with the incredible blue sea and sky backdrop! Nice! Inside the temple is also equally amazing.
Magnificient View ,"Nanshan is located in Sanya, if u took the speed train, will take an hour to reach Sanya from Wanning. The Goddess is so beautiful under the sun which allocated near the sea. It says that the Guan Yin is to protect the seaman and looking after their harvesting of the seafoods.The area are pretty and deep in, u need to wear your suntan lotion, hat or umbrella and water. Only vegetarians foods are serve near the Guan Yin Tang otherwise, u can bring your own snack. Total hours : 4hours"
"A very large, nice and well-maintained temple complex","The Buddhist statue in the sea is probably the most recognized part of this huge temple complex, however there is so much more to see here. We only came here in the afternoon, after our visit to the Yanoda Rainforest (see different review) and we didn't have time to walk around everywhere but we covered most of the vast grounds with their small train. The statue itself is massive and when you walk around it you'll find that it is actually ""3 statues in 1"", it's like a triangle with 3 different Buddha faces which you only realise if you actually walk around the statue which most visitors don't seem to do. The inside of the statue is beautiful and make sure you go up with the lift to ""Buddha's feet"", from there you have lovely views. Theo only downside to this temple is that it feels too touristy and crowded. We've been to different Buddhist temples in Asia like Fo Guang Shan in Kaoshiung Taiwan, which have retained a feeling of being temples where monks live and pray, Nanshang doesn't really give you that feeling.But it's a nice place to visit and spend a few hours."
wonderful,"trivial whit friend, very peaceful and nice place, the Bodhisattva was great and Amazing, if you are in bad mood or unlucky, go there and make a wish, everything will come back to the normal"
Worth to visit,It takes 40 minutes from the airport by taxi. The ticket price is 129 Yuan (108 in off season).Shuttle car could be a good option because it is very huge place.To visit around could take at least half a day and should plan for the specific locations.It is also better to go in the morning if possible because the weather is better and avoid crowd.There are restaurant around the place.
Nanshan Guanyin,"While the Nanshan Guanyin is impressive & the interior lavishly decorated, it comes across as a mere commercialised touristy place.  To enter the Guanyin you have to first pass through the gift shop & then on the way out again.  The queue to enter was a snaking 40 minutes long.  Luckily there was crowd control before being allowed up to the viewing platform.  The view of the South China Sea is nice though. It is disappointing that the entire place seems bereft of Buddhist teachings."
Feel the culture!,"Absolutely must visit place in Hainan as a big part of chineese culture and just a very beatiful and big park!it will most probably take the whole day to check and visit all location of the park. Get ready to long walks, numerous photoshots, put on light shoes, get a hat and grab eough water! Sounds frightening? Don't worry, you will need all this to walk trhough the park and finally meet the Guanyin Goddess! No words to describe the views from the top of the statue, but come early to avoid 40mins (which is worh waiting) queue to the temple entrance!Of course the Statue and the temple at the basement is the main sightseing, but not the only!You must also visit the Golden Temple and the Longevity valley, and many other locations! All this will make you day wonderful and fill you with pure chinese culture!"
wow,it was a bit hot there but i was blown away by the sheer size and majesty of Guangyin . the contrast of white against the brilliant blue sea was a sight not to be missed .a must see in Sanya
Good temple with good view direct to the bay,"Nanshan temple is one of the favorite place and must visit if you plan to Sanya, Hainan province...it has a tall statue of Guanyin with 3 different angles...108 metres from sea levels...you need to walk or you can use the buggy to reach the statue...but after that, 7 levels using stairs but its not that high, so dont worry...from the statue, you can see the bay...so beautiful...has many souvenir stores here..."
Hainan Icon,"If you visit Hainan, you must visit Nanshan Temple as this is the icon of hainan islands. The area is very big . But you can transportation to go around the area. The Kuanyin statue is the most famous place you must visit apart of others."
Overcrowded commercial spot,"First of all that’s not a statue/monument of Buddha! So please stop saying it’s a Buddha statue. Second, don’t buy overpriced tours for hundreds yuan, because this place is easily reachable by public transport. So, entrance is 108 RMB (seems like 1 RMB per 1 m of the statue, haha). Bus from the downtown of Sanya to Nanshan Temple is cca. 10 RMB. You can choose from many public transport routes using Apple Maps. As for instance, you may take following buses from the downtown: 16, 30, 25, 57. Your destination would be “NanShanSi” bus stop, which is just around the touristic parking lot of the Temple. What you’re gonna see when you enter: Guanyin monument, variety of parks, Nanshan Buddhist temple, Worship square, and I think that’s all. Well, the monument itself is really fascinating, but don’t forget you’re in China. Since showing off and persuading you to buy useless trinkets are cast in Chinese culture, be prepared to take a “fancy” picture with the Goddess on the background, to dine and pay three times more than a usual price; and many other things you wouldn’t want to do. Proving that’s a “commercial project” for attracting money from tourists, but not an authentic Buddhist temple, you’d find an exposition of gilded Guanyin statuettes inside the hall of the main Guanyin monument. We’ve been told everyone can pay around 5K RMB and his name would be engraved on the bottom of the statuette and placed into one of the exposition rooms. As I’ve seen hundreds of statuettes there, I could imagine how much money were accrued by these means. To conclude, I wouldn’t recommend this place since it’s quite expensive, considering it’s not an authentic religious place."
Definitely worth a visit,"This is a well maintained and beautiful area, not too far from Sanya Bay where I was staying.  I caught a taxi and it cost 89rmb one way.  The taxi driver came with me to buy the ticket (I think he got some kind of kick back) and it costs 108rmb per adult.  I grounds are beautiful and there are lots of temples to look at if you are interested.  I was mainly interested in the big statue and headed off there (make sure you wear your walking shoes).  You can go inside the big statue as it is a temple.  If you are Buddhist, you can kneel and pray, light incense and see all of the idols.  You can also go up to the viewing platform for an outside view (the line was too long for me so I didn't go up).  There are lots of places for great photo ops and there are also professional photographers who will do it for you at a fair price.  Drinks are very reasonable price, 15rmb for a green coconut or a fresh juice (mango, watermelon, orange etc).  There are restaurants also if you are hungry, both Chinese and western food available.Don't forget your sunscreen, I got too much sun because it was cloudy and I didn't realize.It would be very easy to spend half a day here if you wanted to see it all.Getting a taxi back is easy, just go to where the taxi dropped you off and there are many there just waiting.  You can also negotiate for a flat fee, I paid only 80rmb to go back."
A Touch of Divine,It is such a touching and heartfelt space to be in. The temple is actually a huge park filled with buddhist wisdom and path. It is a joy to be in such a space. Spend at least half a day to be suffice to see most of the highlights within.
best guanyin temple A MUST SEE place,"a MUST visit place in sanya.  need to be there early morning about 9am to be able to complete all the temples visitswe booked a whole day taxi at rmb280 to get therethe entry fees is rmb121 about 30 mins from sanya city where we stay ,  all temples got entrance fees except the big guan yin temple.   pay rmb30 for tram ridesstrongly recommend to buy the 3 faces guan yin souvenir which is available outside china"
"Very beautiful place, serene and out of this world","It's amazing place and very popular with tourists, surprised that I saw many western tourists visiting Guanyin Goddess Statue and walk around the temple. The view is breathtaking and the Guanyin statue is beautiful. In Buddhism, Guanyin Goddess is a very merciful Goddess, if you wish something sincerely and faithfully, it will become true. So, make a wish and do it wholeheartedly. You'll be surprised. Meanwhile, enjoy the wonder of Sanya."
Goddess of Mercy on the Sea,World largest goddess of mercy that sits on a island linked by a bridge to mainland. A must visit destination within a larger theme park of the Nanshan temple region.
Peaceful,We went on a hot day on a weekend and the queue to get in was no long at all. Such a pretty place. Inside is so beautiul - shame photos cannot be taken. Climbing to the top was nice to take in the view. Food by the temple was all veg (my family are all veg) so we were sooooooo happy to tuck into so many dishes!
Day trip,"Was a nice outing to what is a fairly large complex. Views are stunning. Bit crowded by ticketing area, however it eases up from there. Paid around RMB120 each way from Sanya Bay"
Must See Place In Sanya,Though it is far away from Dadonghai but still it is worth a visit. You can easily find buses within Sanya that leave for Nanshan Temple. A great place to relax!
All about energy,This is a place of contemplation and meditation. Come to stress out and enjoy the beautiful view. You will find yourself lighter
Must see,Beautiful! Worth going!  We stayed in Yalong Bay and instead of taking a cab we spent 17 rmb each for a train ride from Yalongwan trian station to Yazhou Train Station.  From there we took a 25 minute cab ride to the Temple.  Much better than a 2-3 hour cab ride!
Must visit,"Nice spot to walk around, but very hot out there, many places to see around there, especially that special monk temple."
One of the popular attraction.,"From City to Nanshan by taxi is about rmb130. The place is huge,it's better to buy entry tickets with tram. The trams will make about 6-7 stops which you can board n alight at different stations and temples. There are smoking corners, restaurants and toilets inside the attractions."
Part of a very large complex,"Nanshan temple is one of the many temples presented there, not necessarily the best of the bunch, and fairly far from the entrance. Plan to walk a lot, and at least three hours to see them all."
Impressive statue but HOT,"Even though there was a bit of a breeze it was very hot and humid.  It is a very impressive statue and the icon of Sanya, China.  A tribute to the ""Goddess of mercy"" it is a reminder of how much things have changed in China over the past 30 years.  It is a huge place for Chinese tourist who come here and therefore very crowded, especially Chinese New Years."
statue of guan yin,"visit the place in the afternoon, its hot. please put on sun screen, hat , sunglass and bring lots of water. i catch the ride to visit the statue and catch the ride again on the way back, would not recommend for a walk with the young children. ladies please bring wet tissue or carry a bottle of water, when you wanna use the toilet. dont expect to get clean toilet,"
Quite Hot,"Even on January, I think this place always hot all year long 😁 so be prepare friends... since go with my parents so we take their internal transportation to make easy and not too hot and tired. Good view at the end of the island"
Guanyin of Nanshan is iconic and remarkable,"This place has the iconic Guanyin of Nanshan (南山海上观音圣像) which is the landmark of Sanya and Hainan island and its the one place almost every tourist into Hainan makes it a point to visit. The statue is truly remarkable standing 108m tall on the edge of the south china sea. The statue has three faces deliberately positioned such that one faces inland and two facing out potraying that the godess protects both China and the world beyond the shores. As we entered the premise, there were hundreds of tour buses - more than I have ever seen. The tourists are mainly from mainland China. So, the place was crowded and it wasnt even peak season. I think timing wise, if we came early in the morning, it would have been a lot less people.With so, many people, it was difficult to take nice clear photos. Anyway, the grounds itself is big to accommodate the crowds. Once we get the tickets and get into the compoud itself, all around are statues and sculptures of deities. There are a few temples with interesting architectures to see. At the entrance there are also stalls selling trinkets and snacks. The compund itself is massive. Because we were in a tour group we had only two hours to explore the place. I think ideally will need about 4hrs to fully explore and see all the temples and gardens. As we did not have much time, we proceeded to see the highlight which is the Guanyin. Overall, this place is a must see when in Sanya. Good for a lot of photo op. While the Godess of mercy is the main highlight, do make time to explore the whole compound"
WORTH VISITING,A must see if you are visiting Sanya.The location is amazing. The Hugh standing Guanyin is very impressive. Although it is a bit expensive and a costly taxi ride from Sanya city. You can take home beautiful memories and pictures of the biggest standing Guanyin in the world.
Buddhist Shrine,"Beautiful Buddhist shrine about 30 min  by vehicle west of Sanya Bay. Depending on the time of day it can be quite busy. Entry, ticketing are efficient, lots of souvenirs and small restaurants. Make it a day trip, use the golf cart like train of you get tired. Enjoy the serenity of you can find it."
Nanshan Buddha,The feeling of tranquility from the look of the Buddha. Go early in the morning if you want to avoid large crowds. Staying at nanshan hotel which is a stone throw from the Buddha. The hotel provides provides buggy ride to the temple.
Sanya's Niagara Falls,It's a Big Budha. Noblesse oblige.That's it in a nutshell unless you want to know about tourist traps.
Great Sculpture!,"Located 30 min car ride from Sanya, this holly place was packed with local tourists. Audio and in person guide options are available. We enjoyed listening to the audio guide during our visit. Tramp service is also available. The statute is situated at the seaside and several other temples are located at the park that can be visited. Lots of food options, fruit stands and souvenir shops are in the park. It took us more than two hours to visit the park. Highly recommended."
Okay ,The place was very crowded but it’s wide spread. Would suggest to take the tourist car to move around. the monument was great 👍🏻
Nice view,This is a very hot n big place to visit...with a big huge kuan yin statues...surrounded by the sea...u can walk or ride a buggy car with the pay of rmb10...to n fro...
Highest Guan Yin statue in south China,Its a wonderful place where you can see 183meters tall guan yin statue. There were also lots of booth that sell souvenirs.
Buddhist praying,Started on foot from the entrance with qualify tour guide explaining how to offer our praying...U might find uncomfortable when u were told to buy something extra to disolve bad luck.U need not have to follow whatever the guide saying but do not say something negative to hurt their feeling and believe.U may choose another transport which cost 30 rmb that bring u around nan shan
Top AAAAA tourist spot in Hainan,One of the “AAAAA” tourist spot in Sanya.  This place was hot and a lot of people. I highly recommend coming early. Remember no pictures once you get into the temple. They will watch you like a hawk.  There is quite a walk to get to most of the destinations.  Remember this place is vegetarian only so remember to eat something if you absolutely want some meat.
Famous Place to Visit,Visited this place on October. The time visit was a public holiday in China. The crowd made us have to walk very far and wait for very long queue.The entrance ticket can be purchase online or on the spot when you reach there. Will suggest to take a car tour in as round trip to the whole area.
"My oh my how expensinve! Beautiful, but expensive!","Your visit to Sanya wouldn't be complete without a visit to Nanshan Temple. Making your way there will require a good 2 hours as it is located roughly 40 km away from the city centre. I would suggest taking a bus (I took bus no.25) instead of a taxi. There are other buses going to Nanshan cultural tourist area. If you want a VPN hassle-free life, you can check for various bus numbers using the local navigation app 'Baidu Maps' as opposed to Google Maps (incl. Apple maps), as Baidu is more accurate.The beach view was lovely with a cool breeze and it wasn't even cold, which worked to my advantage as I was there in February (winter everywhere else in mainland China) mind you!Guan Yin statue is truly beautiful. Other than the 3 sided statue, one can visit the surrounding sites such as the ''God of Fortune temple'' and other small temples. We paid for the shuttle bus to explore the area but, the rest was ridiculously expensive! Just take pictures outside the temples and smile your cheeks off! At least you get to say you left your footsteps there :-D"
Too expensive ,You only come for the statue - everything else is just “normal” temples. Therefore the price is way too high. 129 RMB per person. The statue was nice and pretty.
Large temple complex,"This temple is located within a larger complex of temples that you can only enter by paying a very steep fee of 121 CNY during off season or 145 CNY in peak. There's quite a lot of walking involved if you want to see all the sites, so it's worth wearing comfortable shoes. The temples themselves aren't really that special, but the grounds are pretty and you're away from traffic. Public buses are available to get back to Sanya at relatively low cost. Most people, however, seem to visit on organised trips in tour buses."
Another over rated tourist destination,"Nice clean open space, from entrance to the statute is approximately 50min walk. Lots of domestic tourist, cost 150RMB, if you like crowd and like to pay to see something big this is good. But if you like tradition with history not the spot. Over rated profit driven not a place to worship. Seen many other beautiful temple with tradition and history, donations only, genuine place to worship and pay respect."
"A very spacious park, with an equally awe-inspiring statue of Goddess Guanyin","The Nanshan Cultural Tourism Zone has a total built-up space of approx. 40,000 sq m, with the famous 108-meter high statue of Goddess Guanyin standing out as its biggest landmark and attraction. In addition to the Guanyin statue, the entire park consists of other temples, pagodas, as well as landscaping features with specific references to Buddhism.The statue of the Goddess Guanyin itself stands majestically at approx. 300m out in the sea, with a link bridge for visitors to cross over between the main park and the statue. The statue consists of not one, but three figures of Guanyin, each facing a different direction as well as having different hand poses (i.e. to represent peace, wisdom, and mercy). Underneath the lotus where Guanyin stands on is a temple hall where devotees can carry out their prayers/meditations, with a golden statue of Guanyin at the centre of the hall. Visitors can also walk as high up as to the lotus (via the temple hall) where the statue of Guanyin stands on, and enjoy a 360-degree panoramic view of the surrounding South China Sea."
Lots of walking,"Nanshan Temple in Sanya is a very huge place.  You must be prepared to walk many kms.First, before you even reach the Ticket Kiosk to buy your entrance ticket, you already have to walk about 300m in from where the transport drop you.Then after the entrance, it is a vast open area where there are hardly any shade or trees or shelter from the blazing sun if you go in Summer.  An advice is not to go in Summer as one can get heat stroke if not careful.To reach the status of interest, it is still a much further walk.  The place is full of people.There are trams which you can take (30 RMB pp) but the heat is still unbearable in Summer."
Very Impressive,A very impressive temple area that even for a western person this is well worth the visit. They promote a total of five temples in the area but if you are short of time I would just limit yourself to the Nanshan temple. You probably need to allow 2-3 hours to cover this properly.
"Expensive, poorly organized and monks begging for money","Absolutely expensive, not even an historical place, it has no meaning for the Buddhism in China, it has been built as tourism attraction with no other real purpose. It cannot be operated in the way It is run. Monks begging for money, it is not a religious place for meditating but only a tourist attraction with bad management and organization. I have visited many Buddhist temples in China liking and appreciating them and this is the most far temple from Buddhism religion one can find or imagine."
Peaceful to the mind and soul,Seeing the massive Guanyin on the sea really brings peace to the mind and soul. The crowd wasn’t too bad when I went on a Saturday. The ticket is 120ishRMB. Not cheap. Do consider if it suits you
Amazing place,"Really beautiful place. However, if you came in the summertime, take an umbrella, or prepare that will be super hot. From the parking to Buddha statue is the quite long distance and almost no shadow, but finally, it is worth. This place is very beautiful. Don't hesitate to get inside the temple, because it has really special and magic atmosphere."
"108 meters South Sea Guan Yin Bodhisattva, Nanshan Buddhist Temple, Sanya, Hainan.","Be prepared to walk a distance from the main entrance to get to the temple and viewing the magnificent South Sea Guan Yin Statue.Be prepared to wait in long line / queue to get into the temple. There are not hundreds but thousand of Chinese tourists and foreigners waiting in line patiencely and orderly to get into the temple. Bring along a foldable umbrella or hat to shield yourself from the hot sun while queueing.Prior to getting into the temple, you will be informed to take off your hat and S show of respect when inside the temple. they is only one entrance and one exit point. Every visitors once inside the temple walk around viewing and preying in an orderly and quiet manner. There was a sense of tranquility and peaceful feeling while in the temple. No-one seem to be on a rush. Worth every minute of time spent in the temple. By the way, no photography allowed inside the temple. Another must visit attraction."
Amazing Buddha experience ,I suggest to arrive the park before 8am and be the first batch to enter the park. The sun was acceptable and no crowd and queue at all. This was an absolute amazing experience that allows me to get close to the spiritual Buddha. The whole park also has many other temples which are also interesting to see. Worth going! I will definitely come back again😌😌.
"Amazing place, but super hot!","The best way to explore this place is to rent the buggy. It is Rmb700 for up to 8 people and unlimited time, so this is the best option. The driver will be your tour guide (Chinese language only). The driver will bring you to all the important exhibit and parked the buggy and let you go down and comes with you inside the exhibit. You also will be able to enter some special exhibit inside that otherwise not allowed to see. The best part is that when you are going to see the Guan Yin Statue, you can go very close to the Statue to take photo (but you can't go up, unless you queue, and the queue will take you hours)."
Magnificent view,"It's a good place to spend time and explore different area of the park. The view of Guanyin was magnificent... weather was hot, so we did not go to every station. Will revisit next time."
Nice attraction,recommend for all travelers. Join day tour and walk around Nan shan temple.  nice vegetarian lunch. Nice attraction.
Incredible big statue,"So, here we are , in Sanya for a couple of days enjoying our stay . This is a very famous place in the area! You need to buy tickets to go close to the statue. Really nice view from the city from there! It’s incredible how monumental big are the public places in China ! All was very clean and people could speak some enguias at the counter! It was very nice to come to this place! Strongly recommended!"
Nanshan temple,"This place with the three face Guan Yin status which is very tall. Should go in the morning, amazing religious place of interest"
Amazing Temple,"We was told by our concierge to visit either early morning or late afternoon because of he heat.  so we opted for late afternoon, but it did not give us enough time to get around.  Amazing place more to it than the Nansham temple. Wish we had the whole day here.  So bare this in mind it has beautiful gardens.  Take the bus when you get inside you can hop on and hop off.  Food and drink available on site and some small shops.  Great place very impressed."
Amazing Guan Yin statue built on the ocean stretch.,It's our favorite attraction among all. Looking the construction beauty of the temple and Guan Yin statue is worth it.
Most beautiful Guanyin statue built on the man made island.,This most beautiful Guanyin statue in Nanshan Temple was built on the man made island in the sea. One of main attractions in Hainan Island.
Impressive,"winterdewySingapore4910Reviewed January 31, 2017Very impressive Guanyin StatusWent with tour group. Very impressive statue of Guanyin. There's free joss sticks provided and you can donate any amount of blessing. Also one of the best organized tourism attactukn on the island"
A Must See,"Could not understand why this attraction is not rated number 1 for attractions in Sanya because the world's largest outdoor ""Goddess of Mercy"" stature is located here.  There's also a Buddhist temple overlooking the ocean where one could get a different perspective of the statue. But the statue is the main attraction which draws every tourist visiting Sanya. We visited this attraction on a weekday and had to wait almost an hour just to get to the parking lot.  The driver said he drove a group here during Chinese New Year holiday and it took 5 hours!  To See the whole park requires about 2-1/2 hour walking or you could spend another 30 rmb to get a hop-on hop-off shuttle But must deal with long lines.  You could also go directly to the statue and take an elevator to the top.  Once again,  long, long lines.   But if you can get over the large crowds, make this trip and see this majestic attraction."
Awesome place should not miss to visit. ,Although it is quite far from city but it is worth to visit when you are in Sanya. We took local bus from down town which was comfortable and it stops in-front of Nansan entrance gate. Even have discount rate for student if have student card need to show in ticket counter. It is big place so need to enter in time otherwise cannot visit all the places. Do not miss  big statue of Buddha and Artificial Nepal handicrafts building it is worth visiting.
Private tour around Sanya attractions,We had a private tour to the Nanshan Temple during Chinese New Year. It was incredibly busy time to go. Beautiful temple  setting once you get there. Our private driver/tour guide showed us around which helped us a lot otherwise we would have never had made it!
Nanshan seaside Buddha ,Good sunrise and sunsets family photos at many locations here. Had a great time walking through the temple.
Guan Yin statue attraction,"We visited this famous statue. 108 meters tall, of the woman deity for prosperity, good fortune and health. Very pretty. The guide was not as knowledgeable as we needed, but was very positive about the faith and following the statue signifies."
Spectacular statue in a magnificent setting,"A very beautiful place to visit, about one hour from Sanya on the road past the airport.  The main temple and statue are set in a very large park with interesting buildings and objects.  We were there on a very busy day, but it was still well-worth visiting."
Touristy and overpriced but one of the few places to visit on the island,"If you are staying in Hainan for awhile you might get bored with beaches and start looking for other things to do. Nanshan temple would probably be one of the best choices but don't expect much. It is a large park, newly built. The entrance fee is 140 yuan (and i think 120 during the low season). There are a few temples on site but some of them require additional tickets (very expensive, given that you already paid for the entrance). For example, one temple cost 68 yuan to enter. We didnt go. Everything in the park designed to get more money from you. In order to get closer to Guanyin, you have to walk through the shopping mall. You can easily walk in the park, but there is also a tram if you prefer to ride (for additional fee of course). You can go up the lotus and feet for a view (prepare to wait in line) but we didnt go as it is actually disrespectful to Guanyin to climb up it. If you decide to go, you can take a bus there (Google maps gives reliable information regarding bus numbers), just show the picture of the Guanyin to the bus driver and he will tell you the price (depends on location). Taxi ride is a little expensive, on the way back we took a taxi and paid around 80 yuan I believe."
"Very Huge, Nice View, Smelly Toilet","This place is the main attraction in Sanya. rated as 5As from tourism center of China. with 108 Buddha statues is the 5th tallest Buddha statue in the world.the whole area is Huge. they provide a tourist cart for travelling. in total there are 7 stations where you can hope in and out only for ONCE. however, since this place is crowded by local tourists as well.. you will get one of worse toilet in Sanya. very very Smelly !!"
Good visit,You can see the Statut from far away but it takes time until you can finally touch it.Dont pay the overpriced transportation and don’t go there on National holiday! Otherwise too crowded with mainland Chinese! Other things not really interesting for foreign visitors but Chinese love it !!
Big Buddhist park,"Nanshan Temple is a big Buddhist park west of Sanya. The entrance fee is RMB 145 per person and RMB 74 for people over 60, but remember to bring your passport to prove it. There is a bus service for this that think the walking paths are to long or too strenuous. As is the case with all Chinese tourist places, expect big crowds of people."
Worth a visit ,Really nice day up in the mountains Expect to be walking about 2 hours hike but a really nice place to walk and see views of SanyaI believe it is totally worth the visit and if u are in sanya Sanya is not big so it will be at most 40 mins depending on your hotel location I weather was perfect for us But I do need to remind if it is summer it will be extremely hot hike so bring lots of water
"A must visit place in Sanya area, Hainan, China","If you visit Hainan, you must visit this place which located in Sanya beach area. It has a big tall statue of Budha Goddess"
Beautiful place,"The statue and the adjoining areas are a treat to watch. There is a lot to walk and stairs too.. Found it a bit difficult with the stroller. Since it was peak summer, it was tiring too. Bottom line: Must visit place but not recommended in summer. P. S. Visited in June 2015"
Beautiful place,"Really nice place,with little bus like train going through,which you have to pay for(not included in the ticket)But well worth it if you are in Sanya."
Impressive!,"Huge park with a few, beautiful temples and a very tall, impressive statue of Guanyin, the Goddess of Mercy. I definitely recommend paying the extra 30 RMB for the shuttle bus. You can buy tickets for this shuttle bus inside the park. This is not included in the entrance fee. The bus drives in a loop and stops at all the best places to visit. There are many buses so you never have to wait long for the next one. My husband and I spent about 3 hours in the park and didn't even visit all the places on the bus route. If you want to spend less time in the park I would definitely recommend to visit at least the statue and the Nanshan temple. I would also recommend to go in the morning. We started our visit at 9 am and the park wasn't too crowded yet, although it was during the Golden Week."
Amazing place at Sanya!,"I have heard about the birth place of Goddess of Mercy. It's an eye opening to visit the Hainan Sanya Nanshan Temple, around the world, this is the only place that housed the male image of Goddess which everyone thought that he is a she. I have learned much history there during the visiting. It's worth a visit."
Huge scenic spot park!,"This place is less than 40 minutes driving from Phoenix Airport of Sanya. It is so big and impressive, looks brand new,it is spotlessly clean, amazing beautiful scenery natural and not, by the sea, There is not only one attraction, but it is a huge park with many attractions. Apart from the big Buddha, there is a park, a temple, a beachfront area to enjoy and much more. You need about a day to see all. If your ticket includes the train that takes you to the spots, 4-5 hours is enough. The train is suggested cause park is huge and if there is sun,  you cannot afford walking under it. In 95% of the route there are ramps for strollers and wheel chairs."
More commercial than spiritual ,Not recommended if you're expecting a spiritual experience; from the entrance onwards lots of shops selling knick- knacks. You can even line up to pay to be a few steps closer to the main statue of the buddha.
The most significant attraction in Hainan,"it is a very nice place to walk around and relax. But summer is rather too hot (around 36'C). Due to the school holidays period, I spent at least 20mins to get into the temple. It is not allowed to take photos inside, many believers show their respect in front of the golden Buddha. Apart from the giant golden Buddha, there are hundreds of small Buddha statue on the wall that surrounding the hall. Nothing much to see inside, if you wish to get up to the feet of 'Kuan Yin' statue, there will be another round of queueing. I believe the view is better, unfortunately, I don't have much time to do so. There are some vegetarian restaurants around, you can pick one and have your lunch there."
A MUST SEE ATTRACTION,Again We Went Here In Summer Now And It Is Too Hot For Us To Handle.Unfortunately We Did Not Rent The Golf Cart Here Is Very Expensive 400 Rmb For One Hour…Anyway Considering The Heat This 400 Is Nothing.We Should Have Hired.Anyway Half The Way I Was So Tired And Could Not Even Walk.It Is A Huge Place And Again Do Not Miss This In SanyaIts A Three Sided Buddah In Standing Position.But. a Must see place no doubt.
The size was amazing,"We visiting in July (low season), but the crowds were large. Definitely worth visiting, ensure you allow at least 2 hours to walk around. The tip when traveling to China is to ensure you have local currency before you arrive, it is difficult to obtain in China."
HAINAN BEST ATTRACTION,"1. Beautiful Kuan Im Pouw Sat2. Believe or not, my friend (he had stroke) can walk faster after visited this temple.3. Believe or not, 108m Guan Yin statue built for the purpose to prevent typhon."
Amazing temple,"This statue was erected to stop the bay from receiving lashings from vicious typhoons. The locals covet this statue. Don't forget deer park if you're in a romantic mood, or is it called lovers somethingorother..... Bring a lock!"
Skip - Tacky and overcommercialized,"I am certain that Guanyin herself would be disappointed in this monument, as it is not a site dedicated to worship as it is a site dedicated to capitalism. You enter the massive, newly-built complex with hordes of other tourists, passing by signs advertising how spectacular of a tourist destination it is. Is it beautiful, yes. But is it spectacular? That's another thing. A spectacular tourist attraction requires substance, and that is something sorely lacking here. Walking past gift shop after gift shop through a newly built complex is not something that is worth your 150RMB. Don't believe the brochures -- this is a waste of your time. If you want to see it, go to google images."
Nanshan temple,"Booked a day tour from hotel concierge. Paid Rmb 238 pp for transport, admission and vegetarian lunch. Worth visiting to se the 108m tall guan yin statue. It was not crowded and we managed to enter the statue within. Took about 30 min all, consider ourselves lucky. Lunch was not worth mentioning."
Impressive place,Impressive place with breathtaking views. I've never seen these kind of temple before. It worth it to come here to those who are interested in Buddha
The Chinese equivalent of Lourdes,"If you're staying in the area, this place is an absolute must, even for non-buddhists.True, everything is recent - no ancient temples - but the gardens are so beautifully landscaped and one cannot fail to be moved by the hordes of believers who flock to the area. It's extremely hot so I recommend taking a sunshade or large hat and plenty of drinking water. You also need to wear flat, comfortable shoes because you'll walk a lot !"
Nanshan Buddha,"This is an interesting place to visit if you are spending some time in Sanya, but it is a bit of a let down. The Nanshan Temple is just so-so, but the Big Buddha is what makes this tourist attraction well worth it. High ticket prices and taxi rides make this a 3 star experience, rather than a 4 star one."
"Crowded, inauthentic but pretty and pleasant","Nothing here is older than 10 years, so this is not authentic for anything.  The large crowds can be annoying, especially the ones with the tour guides screaming into low quality speakers.  The line to climb Kwan Yin was insane (and expensive), so we skipped it.  The Nepalese temple was pretty, informative and totally empty.  The entrance fee is very high for something that isn't actually real, but the grounds are gorgeous and there are plenty of picnic tables.  Bus 26 from Sanya Bay cost just 7 Yuan, but stops running at 6pm."
Became a business,"I hd many expectations about this place and I took a long way bus to arrive here. The entry fee was very expensive for a temple (145 CNY) and inside there I felt in a big business place. The photo is nice, the place is unique."
The Essential Visit in Sanya,"This modern statue of Kwan Yin, the Goddess of Mercy, sits on an artificial island in the South China Sea and is enormous. Equally vast are the number of people at the shrine, perhaps 40,000 on a dull Monday, so the queues are long, but well organised.  The hall under the statue is spectacular, a mass of gold and red and one should take the lift to the viewing platform at the base of the statue"
Superb view,"Admission was RMB 145 for tourists and an additional RMB 30 for the tram ride. Main attraction was the statue of the Guanyin Buddha. Inside the hall of Buddhas, the aura was magnificent."
Place for Budhist to pray,"Initially was thinking of going on my own via Bus25.  However after an earlier trip on the public bus with grouchy bus driver that would drive off before you get off the bus, I decided to join a local tour.  As I spoke Chinese, I joined a Chinese tour.  The tour guide was another grouchy person.  After reaching the temple, there was a local temple guide for about 1 hr, he was very zen and gave good introduction to the place, and also advised on how to pray.  Buddhist can refer to a chart to find out their guardian Budhha based on their Chinese Zodiac sign.  At the 1st temple stop, they can purchase an image of the guardian Buddha and pray.   If you don't pray, you can get a ticket for RMB30 to enter.  There are long queues to purchase and a bit rowdy.    Dont bother with the buffet vegetarian food, it is a long walk from the main attraction Guan Yin.  There is food for sale nearer the Guan Yin.   Entrace fee for foreigner individual is RMB145 peak season.  Sanya sun is strong, wear sunscreen, hat, long sleeves, umbrella.   Lots of toilet facilities.   In China, they don't throw used toilet paper in the toilet bowl to flush away, they throw in a basket next to the toilet.  So you can smell the toilet from far away.  The smell is worse in hot weather,  so I'd avoid summer days in China."
Average at best,"The place is overrun by tourist... I would suggest to go there on a day that is overcast... not too many places to hide from the Sun. The place is huge and it involves a lot of walking. So be prepared to do that. Also... 6 floors to climb through a claustrophobic staircase. Only at the end we managed to get an elevator to go down. :( the toilet inside the ""Temple"" ( statue) smells so bad you can feel it from the main room. Overall just so so considering the price RMB 145 or RMB 73 for children."
Very impressive Guanyin Status,Went with tour group. Very impressive statue of Guanyin. There's free joss sticks provided and you can donate any amount of blessing.
beautiful,"the statue was lovely, the views were fantastic and the beaches in Sanya are to die for! I cannot wait to go again later this year."
Great!!,The temples were great all of them but humanity of place and sun can kill you!! İf you r in Hainan you must visit here but be careful of sun and take your expedient!!
One great Buddhism amusementpark,"Very crowded at the entrance. In the park itself it was ok due to its size; its huge and not walkable in one day so I suggest to take the shuttletanks/train. The park is specially made for visitors to ""experience"" buddhism and isn't a really religious place with monks and nuns, but you can worship the buddha' s and pray in one of the many temples. The big statue is nice but expect a waitingline to enter the inside to go to the viewing platform around the base of the statue itself. There is no explaining or educational panels in the park to learn about the things you see or to provide some background information. So to come here on your own without a tour it might be hard to understand wat you actually see. It was a nice day out but when not interested in buddhism you might as well skip it."
go too visit the Bouddha,very nice experience vocation here and see the Bouddha place visit for all park and take pictures attention many peoples in Dezember
Be prepared to walk ,"Followed a tour booked by the hotel. Was picked up about 9.30 am. The ride to the Nanshan temple took about 30 to 40 minsIt was very crowded as that day was a long weekend and there were about 60,000 visitors mainly from local mainland china. The place is too big and will take a whole day to finish walking. We visited the Nepalese Stupa, had a vegetarian lunch which was part of the tour. The tour costs me CNH 198 because I booked through the hotel but if you book directly with them you will save about CNH20. The last part will be the Goddess of Mercy statue out in the sea After that it takes at least 20 to 25 mins to walk to the car park. There is a monorail that you can take if you don't wish to walk but will hardly see anything"
Cultural Destination with good view...,"I loved this place, its so huge and we can experience different countries culture in one place. Specially focused for Budhhism it includes Nepalese temple as well. But this place is too commercialized..."
Big Statue!,"We saw this buddha from the plane as we flew in and when we got there it didn't seem any smaller! I don't think it is a real temple and suspect it is a ruse for removing money from pockets, but it's an enjoyable spectacle nonetheless. I'd have liked to see a few more toilets and places to get an ice cream but it's good fun and worth an afternoon."
Good cultural experience!,"Don't let the entry fee put you off! Once inside the area there is a lot of different things to see, we went off the main track and found beautiful lakes and gardens. There is a wide variety of different temples to explore and the main attraction is really good, you are able to touch the feet if you really want! She represents good wealth and is a national treasure so very popular with the Chinese (I wouldn't go during a national holiday). We went with our boys and they also enjoyed the experience. We didn't pay for shuttles- the hill climbs aren't that bad and there are things to stop and look at along the way."
Thankfully we didn't pay full price,"Took a family trip here, as we have never been despite travelling to Hainan frequently as my ancestors are Hainanese. Took bus 25 from Sanya return, 10 rmb a person per way. (You can take bus 16, which apparently is cheaper and a longer journey) The trip takes around 40 min - 60 min. Return. Please note, arriving and departing is not same bus stop, but you pass the departing one walking from the arriving bus stop. Bought entry tickets. 73 rmb for children, students and elderly people 60+ years. They don't take foreign cards, so bring cash. Staff there was rude and lacked customer service. I speak Chinese and Hainanese, so this was not a language issue. The people even so, I was accused of hitting an old lady when her and her family pushed my 9 years old son out of the entry queue to jump the queue when I told them off. (I prefer my kids being in front of me, rather than behind me so I can see them) Usually people get embarrassed and apologise when I confront them. These group of people were crazy. As I hadn't done anything nothing happened. We didn't walk on the bridge to see Guan Ying.  This place was too much for us, people pushing, walking into you and taking pictures of our children. Not very much of a buddhisty feel because of the majority of the audience. If we ever come back, we won't pay to go in. We will go to the beach under the bridge leading to Guan Ying and get our pictures."
Definitely worth a visit,"From Sanya Bay Bus number 25, for 8rmb each,  this varies, about 40 minutes from centre of Sanya beach.  About 10 mins walk into ticket booth from bus stop.  We picked up the translation machines which were very good for information but a bit tricky as long gaps in info so not sure if they were working all the time.  walk out to the 4th tallest statute in the world, and it is a nominated world heritage site - it doesn't feel as religious or scared as other sites in Asia. and the peace doesn't exist due to the volume of chatter around the whole site."
Gigantic Buddha!,Great  stroll place for  wide range of age. Taking photo in the given spot never ruin the picture. You better get a ticket for tour bus to see entire temple.
"Out of the Way, But Something Interesting to Do","This is a pleasant Buddhist park worth a visit as something to do other than hang out at one's hotel or the beach in Sanya.  The park is large with a fair amount of walking from the parking lot to the GuanYin statue, though there is a small tram that can take people part way.  I visited with my young daughter and was therefore limited in what I could do; I did not go to the base of the statue.  Even in late December/early January it was hot and there was not a lot of shade cover so I would recommend bringing a hat or umbrella to guard against the sun.  It took over 30 minutes by taxi from the center of Sanya city, which was much further than it had appeared on my map.  I had my taxi driver wait because otherwise I have no idea how we would have been able to get back."
Awesome half day,Tickets are 140 regular but 73 for students. Definitely worth it. One can spend more than 5 hours wondering around the area with the main spots being the 108 meter statue and the nanshan temple.Bus number 16 from Sanya goes to the entrance of the area and it takes more than 1 hour.
Very impressive experience ,"Visiting Nanshan temple really complements yr Hainan visit, beautiful Buddhist temple, gardens, awesome vegetarian restaurant and the three face 165 m tall Buddha statue in the ocean. The place is visited by some 4 million people per year, expect some crowd."
"Very hot, very far and not much to see except the statue","The ticket is not cheap at pushing 200rmb, and basically there is only the staue to see.It is impressive, but the parking area is a mess and dangerous, also the staue is in no way a historic monument.They try to push you to buy lots of souvenirs and the park itself is far too overcrowded and noisy.Morevoer getting to and from the place is too hard, leaving the park you will be hassled by taxi drivers and in general find it difficult."
Less than my expect,"This park have 3 zones: The most famous it is Guan Yin sculpture.But it have a zone on the top of the mountain, we spent 1 hour to arrive, but we cannot found anything cause they still working to finish this part. Another part, on the right side (if you are looking the sea), it have a great traditional buildings, and at the end, you can find a unfinished pagoda.In summary for me, it wasn't a good experience cause anyone's told us, the only finished part it was Guan Yin sculpture, but I think that it could be a great if someday they will finish to build."
Amazing cultural zone,I really liked the Nanashan Temple and also the whole cultural zone with multiple temples and nice parks! Also view from top of the Nanshan temple is nice!
Team park,"I really wanted to see the Guan yin of the South Sea of Sanya while on Hainan. So on our last day my husband and I went here. We took a taxi from our hotel out to the park. The area was much bigger than i had expected and we had to buy tickets to get in. You have to buy the tickets cash if you don't have a chines credit card. The don't take visa or MasterCard. The area looks old, but its fairly new and the statue was build in 2005. I would describe the area as a team park, for chines culture. We chose to walk around, instead of pay to sit in a golf cart. Much to look at and the statue was beautiful. You would probably spend the who day here, so bring some comfy shoes and lots of water. We went here in September, but it was still hot."
Beautiful,Entrance to nanshan cultural centre is rmb145 whilst there are other fees to visit the temple (golden kwan ying) within and the use of tram. We were there only for the 108m tall 3 faces kwan ying and was totally worth it. We spent 1 hour just for the kwan ying alone. The view is breathtaking.We tried the coconut at the main entrance cost rmb10 and that was bad. You might want to try the coconut sold near kwan ying cost rmb15 as the size and shape is bigger hence might be nicer.We took public bus route 16 which cost rmb10 to sanya city and estimate rmb6-7 to go tianya haijiao scenic area. It took 1hr and 30mins respectively. There are other public buses that goes to railway station and other places but is written in mandarin.
Great temple to visit in Sanya,Was in the temple for 1 DAY takes about 1hr dive from longyan bay.The temple is a big complex with lush gardens and a giant buddha statue.Very crowded during summerholidays but a definite must see
the temple is great to visit,"we went there and stay for a day, it is very interesting, and a lot to see, many highlights to stop, we have the vege meal there which is nice."
Good day out,There was a lot more going on than I imagined and the park was a lot bigger than I thought.the area has a lot to see and the temple it self is huge. a godd half day trip
Beautiful and calming sights,"The temple and its surroundings offers one a calming an peaceful environment to soak in. The sea, serene and blue, is incredibly breathtaking. The statue is grand, and is worth a visit, particularly if you're a buddhist. There are also other temples near the vicinity where religious music can be heard from a distance as well. It was quite a serendipitous experience to explore around the area by foot, through which I discovered a number of picturesque sights for photo taking. A must visit, especially if this is your first trip to Hainan."
Very well preserved,"Definitely worth a visit, if visiting Sanya. Took us around one hour to get there from Sanya city centre (although 15-20 minutes were spent navigating traffic within Sanya). You need at least 2 hours inside because there is a fair walk from parking to get to the ticket centre. Take the electric coach which costs RMB 30, but takes you to all spots within the cultural precinct. You can choose to hop on and hop off. There are quite a few temples inside but the main attraction is the huge sculpture of Buddha. The vegetarian restaurant also serves some good fare."
Beautiful ,Quite beautiful grounds. Statue is 108 m tall and has three sides to it. Surrounding grounds and temples are worth seeing.
Nanshan Temple ,"Beautiful temple especially suitable for Buddhism, the Guan Yin temple really an eyes wide shot for tourists."
People people everywhere,"This is a popular tourist area and you can't avoid crowds. One plus point is they do have several ticketing counters and this makes the purchasing of tickets a breeze. When you enter the huge area, you will be greeted by many booths renting you a audio device for a relaxing self guided tour in the park. We looked at the map and decided that to walk the entire area under the scorching sun is too much. Just as we were discussing our route, we were pleasantly surprise to find a booth that rent a buggy with a driver. We quickly grab the offer and took the ride. We took the buggy for 4 pax and off we go. On the way we saw crowds heading at all directions. Our guide was friendly and provided an overall introduction for the park (in mandarin). The guide was also more than glad to answer any queries. Entrance fees and token for donations were the extra cost if you want to visit the interior of some of the locations. The plus point for taking the buggy was that we were given priority queues at these locations, much time was saved!The highlight of this tour was of course to view the majestic 3-faced Goddess of Mercy at the far end of the park. Sitting on the buggy, we by passed all the tourists who were walking a long distant on the bridge. We went around the exterior of the statue and were really close to see the craving on the statue. All in all, we are just glad that we decided to take the buggy ride. We cut the visiting hours more than half, save ourselves from the tedious walk and were under shades most of the time. Do remember to request your buggy driver to stop at points for photo taking opportunities."
HOT but beautiful,"Went on June, summer! Burning skin but nice scenery. Worth. Really love this place. Should pay a visit whenever you had reach SANYA."
Truly spectacular ,The temple only makes up a small part of this area. It's an ecological park also. The temple is new I think.  But it is stunning architecture. Well maintained and clean. There is a great pagoda and a breathtaking huge statue overlooking the sea. There is a longetivity valley and a nice hike through a forest to a great view.  Plenty of open spaces.  The number 1 place to go to in Sanya.  This place gets super busy so be warned. I chose to walk the area but it is huge so maybe use the gold carts to travel.  I paid 121 RMB. Plenty of places to eat and drink. Great maps and toilets. Lots of taxis and a public bus stop. I got the number 25 bus
Beautiful place,This is really beautiful place to visit . A different way of practicing buddhism. Very large different different temple to see so better you should buy a small transportation card around 30 RMB if you are not a good walker. If you are a backpacker it is not a problem to walk around all of it. Entry tickets around 120 RMB per person .
Fantastic trip all around,I first thought the ticket price is too high which make this trip not worth it. But I'm glad I decided to come. Beautiful view!
Fantastic statue of Guanyin; a must see by fare.,"This is a very large park and has much to offer beside the beautiful Guanyin, which is gigantic. There are many other temples and lush areas to walk through. Also has a shuttle bus service. There is a hotel located in the park and I wish we had sent the night, but we had limited time."
Sanya Buddha,"Very interesting to see this. A very different way of practising buddhism. Inside a lot of buddha statues, one for each virtue. Chinese people pray to each statue to receive blessing for their special request. Less serene than I'm used to. The Chinese way, also very commercial. There are a lot of stands where you can buy religious and non-religious souvenirs."
A temple revered by Buddhist believers,"We were on a tour and didnt realize it took us more than 160km from Qionghai to this temple. Extreme hot sun but you can easily buy the straw chinese hats made for beating the heat!Long walk from entrance to the temple with many devout followers of the ""Goddess of Mercy"". There is also a buggy service / tram ride available for a few dollars per pax. Recommended for families with young children / elderly. As i am not a Buddhist follower, i just admire the sea view and magnificent rocks.. buy a Magnum ice cream and enjoy the long walk."
This is a must see.,"I am not Buddhist ,,but to see this is something else. This is the Christ the redeemer statue  (Rio Brazil) for the Buddhist religion.  It is super impressive and massive. There is a free shuttle available from certain areas. But get there early and be prepared to hold your spot cause when that bus arrives and there 60 people standing there and only 40 seats civilization breaks downs so hang on to your kids."
Impressive statue,"Impressive statue and scenery. We recommend taking the little tour bus. We particularly enjoyed the ""longevity road"", very traditional and inspiring. The park is huge, lots to see and to do."
worth the ride out to see,"We went with tour group but if go again i would take taxi from Sanya as tour goes to a few sales stops on the way, peril shops, tea shops extra, plan to spend a few hours here as lots to see around temple"
Too expensive for what is is worth. But popular for Buddhist and group tours,Bus load of local tourist. Have to line up for tickets. Public toilets dirty. Need to improve on facilities. Sourvenirs need more variety.
"Go to the ""tree house""",There are people everywhere.  Welcome to china.  I accidentally stumbled upon a secret place to see the statue.  Go to the treehouse.  Go to the end of the end.  You will find a beach with nobody.  You will see the best view at least without 346 people in the background.  Remember don't tell too many people.
Grand surprise!,We were told our guide would take us to a (107m talk) lady Buddha & she was spectacular! We loved our visit & recommend a minimum of half day to see the area! (More if u are a Buddhist!)
Nashan temple,"Beautiful place for culture lovers , the history of buddhism , The temple of Nepal is,awesome , i recommend everyone to visit this place i swear you will feel different when you enter inside"
Amazing,"It's not easy to get there as the taxi drivers don't speak any English, French or Spanish but it's worth. It's an amazing place, beautiful. The statue of the Godess is huge and the gardens around it have thousands of flowers. Don't miss it."
Spectacular view,A very large place to explore and it is good to spend half or even whole day here. We only get to explore the Guanyin statue as we were on a tour group. Wonderful and spectacular view from every direction. The view is even more amazing from a higher location. There is a hotel inside the Nanshan temple and you can spend time to enjoy golfing too. Hope to explore there again.
Amazing,"The Nanhai Guanyin statue in the Nanshan Temple is very amazing. It is very tall and stand facing the sea and the land. It has 3 sides. There are also many interesting places to visit and walk around. Me and my girlfriend took a 1 day tour there. Its far from the place we stayed and with the day's tour, tour bus and tour guide is provided so any inconveniences are avoided. Be it you are a believer of Buddha or not, this place is a must go if you are in Sanya."
Very photogenic.,This is a good spot for taking pictures of the coast line. The temple is colorful and makes a good backdrop for portraits.
Spectacular,"Among the attractions on Hainan Island, I would rate this attraction as the best among all of them. The admission charge is not that exorbitant at RMB 150 as compared with some other attraction. We stayed at an apartment at Dadonghai and we took the public bus no.16 to the attraction. However, we realized that public bus no. 25 that ply the same route at a cheaper fare. One must understand that the holy site of this Nanshan Buddhism Culture Park covers an extensive area and include many other temples, pavilions, beach, pagodas and parks and it would take more than 3 hours to cover most of the attractions. Bearing this in mind, it is thus prudent to arrive at the temple early so that you can cover most of the attractions and have the time to enjoy your vegetarian lunch at the restaurant if you so wish.Exploration by foot in the Cultural Park is physically taxing but a number of the pagodas and hill parks are located off the main road and only through leg work could one locate them. I do not see the necessity to take the tram but for the disabled, the aged and the tender young, I would suggest to take the tram. I was astounded by the impressively stunning and intriguing beautiful tall statue of the Guan Yin. The fine statue sparkles in the cloudy sky amidst a scenic background of mountains and sea.  I came to understand that the standing Nanhai Guan Yin is the tallest of its kind in the world. There are free guides provided by the temple and they help to explain the ritual steps and how one should conduct oneself when praying to the Guan Yin Goddess. No photography in the temple but one can explore freely around and view the many deities at the ground and upper floors. Unfortunately, on that day of my visit, it started to rain and thunders were heard and due to inclement weather, we were not allowed to take the lift to the upper floor to touch the feet of the Buddha for blessing.I climbed up a hill and visit a pavilion on top of the hill. From the hill, I was able to view the gorgeous panoramic view of the Nanshan Temple. It was stunning and spectacular and I like the serene atmosphere at the hilltop. The beach with the many boulder stones and rocks also project a beautiful picture of the Guan Yin statue that extends to the sea. The Nepalese Temple, the Longevity Village and the God of Fortune Temple and the many Luohan and Buddhist sculptures that studded around the cultural park added much interesting feature and dynamism into the area. I like this holy place though it is a bit of commercialized."
Nothing special except the statue ,"Can you believe in a country that only 10 percent of citizens are religious and yet they charge so much for an entrance fee to a temple. The entrance fee to the temple is RMB 150 and this does not cover the shuttle to bring you around and the tour guide fee. If you are wearing a comfortable shoes, please help your self to walk a little because the statue is not far away from the entrance. There are some vegetarian restaurant inside but not recommend to eat there. Don't buy any souvenir because it is not worth it.You can take a bus from any location in SanyA and it will cost less than RMB 17, but in a peak season the bus could be very crowded as the conductor love to squeeze people in it. The area that I stay is in Tianya, and it cost me only RMB 5 to reach nanshan, however some buses does not reach to the gate of temple, you might need to walk another 2 km or you just pay a motorcycle rider RMB 10 to bring you to the temple gate."
Day of site seeing ,"Over crowded, and as you would expect in China. If you're into Chinese religious culture is worthwhile going. It does have lovely view of the surrounding area."
Beautiful),"I travelled last year in February, and visited most of sightseeings in Sanya city) It was one of the most amazing journeys in my life) everything was perfect except tge price( everywhere that is specialized for tourists is overpriced twice("
Interesting Temple,"If you go to Buddhism cultural park, you should definitely visit the Nanshan Temple! It has a great view from the platform that has an elevator"
Interesting photogenic place,The area has several different temples of different styles. I particularly enjoyed the Nepalese temple. We visited on a very hot day and hired a buggy to take us around. The cost was reasonable and by doing this we got some extra attention. i.e we got invited into a glassed in prayer room with a major buddha statue and cpl hundred small ones and a staff explained the significance of the symbolism etc to us in English. There isn't much to do here but overall it was very enjoyable to just go around the different areas. People interested in photography should love this place.
Lots to see,"A great day out. Lots to see around the park. It's more like a theme park (without rollercoasters!) than a serious religious area. There are many temples to look around, a tree house to climb in, then of course the statue. In between all this you can walk around the beautiful park. The entrance fee was around 150 but student (and other discount) was 78RMB. We took the little bus around the park for 30RMB, not really necessary if you are happy to walk a little. And it's not hop on hop off as you must follow the loop and can't go back on yourself. The vegetarian restaurant was really yummy and not expensive. The bus from Dadonghai takes about 90mins - far longer than we expected but it was worth it."
Compliment,Would like to thank you all the  staffs for their polite services.the way they talk and serve not like others China tourist spot.  Very good experience to travel there.
The tallest buddha in southern China watching you from the sea,"The 108 meter high Guanyin buddha is standing magnificently on the island, watching and protecting the visitors who come afar to worship it. If you have time, go up to the level where you can touch the feet of the statue, as it will bring you luck always!"
Attraction for tourists,"Crowds of people, extremely hot though the tickets to the electrocar are rather expensive. Fundamental Statue of Guanyin is the most impressive attraction there."
One of the most beautiful places in the World,"It is good to spend a couple of days there. It is interesting, relaxing, calm, charming and breathtaking beautiful place. In last five years I was there twice and unfortunately I see the place turn to be more and more touristic, hectic and commercial. Still it is good to visit, to acknowledge the culture, efforts and believes of Chinese people."
Awesome,"It was a very interesting place to visit. The setting is beautiful and the beach is lovely. Pay a little to enter the temple area, it is worth it."
Holy place,Very good place.  So wonderful.  Ticket not expensive.  Super panorama.  Buddhist's place.  Very much monk.
Worth the visit.  Must go up to the top,"I would find it worth to visit and should climb to the top.  However, you will need to pay to get to the top.  The view is great and the Buddha is huge."
Worth a visit for the guan yin statue in the sea,Quite an interesting attraction especially for Buddhists.  The guan yin statue in the sea is quite impressive.  For Buddhists there are also quite a few different temples to visit and offer prayers. Nan hai is said to be the home of Guan yin goddess. Vegetarian buffet lunch at restaurant is decent with free flow beer.
Okay ... it's very cool -- But don't stop at the statue ...,"Yes, it will blow you away, but don't let the temple trip start and end with the striking and impressive statue ...Put your walking shoes on and head up longevity valley ... the hike through a babbling mountain brook leads to a gorgeous temple overlooking the bay and statue ... not to be missed.Shuttles will take you around to other sites, including a delicious vegetarian buffet, a temple FILLED with golden buddhas, massive prayer walls, gardens and entrances.  We chose to walk ... and that was lovely."
Lovely statue,"Amazing craft work on this statue, definitely worth visiting and going to see. Not very crowded. Friendly people"
Lots of walking,This place is worth visiting just once. The Kwan Yin Goddess is incredibly beautiful standing in the sea. You need good walking shoes as there are a lot of walking to be done.
Overrated,"This place is a typical ""official business"" raking in tons of RMB every single day with gullible Chinese tourists. Its has none of the temple's character one might expect. Aside from a huge Buddha (108 Meters above see level) and good sea view, the rest is a sprinkle of tourists 'shops and a rip-off. Buses unload about 20 thousands tourists on the spot daily, rain or shine..."
Sanya Visit,"Beautiful place but very large and tiring, it is worth spending full day, have a very peaceful beach - watching waves is a good experience,  plenty of good veg food."
the Summer capital of china,"Amazing View surrounded by a sea..beautiful place for tourist, you will enjoy 100% visiting this summer capital of china"
More than a Temple,Very good venue. I went twice (because son #4 missed the original family outing and I thought he really shouldn't miss it). Plenty to do and see and be prepared to spend most of the day there.
Nice view from the top ,It's more of a tourist attraction than a real temple. It's too commercialised and money oriented. Don't expect to find peace here. But some interesting things like the lotus fountain. And nice view from the top
Very spiritual,"This is a really wonderful place to visit.  Don't think I e seen a statue that stands so tall and in such a wonderful location in this beautiful cultural zone.  The statue is reached either by a 10-15 minute walk, which can be difficult for anyone that suffers with the heat, otherwise there are buggies that will take you straight to it, but the walk is lovely and a shame to miss.  Statue is located on a little island in the water reached by a short walkway over to it.  You can go up inside and walk around just below her feet but the queue to do this was quite long the day we visited.  There is also a nice village to visit with temples etc. which we were unable to do because our son had back problems and was unable to walk any further that day.  A very spiritual experience and again, stopped a number of times by Chimese people asking to have their photographs take with us.  How lovely."
Amazing place!,"We were lucky that it was an overcast day; and, intermittent small showers kept the crowds down. The place is absolutely amazing! The size and detail of the main statue was incredible. Beautiful place that is a must-see!"
Beautiful park with tram (fees applied) facilty,"Highly caution not to go to Sanya in summer (june - aug) as it's just too hot for tourist to properly enjoy the trip. Else, get ready your sunblock, hat and umbrella.It's a very big park and fortunately they have trams (RMB35/pax/circuit) to frequently ferry visitors from one attraction to another (ard 10mins waiting time) . There's several temples but with 2 hrs visiting time in our itinerary, we only managed to visit the Guan Yin statue and take photos there.There's an underpass from the main circular platform to the bridge linking the walk around the Guan Yin statue but visitors are charged RMB50/pax. The bridge and platform is uncovered and not accessible by tram so visitors have to walk in the hot sun. Will definitely come back to visit this place again hopefully in winter months and spend half a day here."
Excellent trip for a whole day,"The area is just huge. The temples is so nicely built. We spent more than half a day here. The access is easily accessible by wheelchair as I had no problem pushing him around the whole place. Only thing is when exiting the place we have to push him up the slope just takes away all your energy. Senior citizen gets in free. Don't buy any praying offering like joysticks at the roadside leading to the temple. We got tricked by our tour guide into buying those at the roadside thinking it would be cheaper. The temple have already banned all joysticks from outside since don't know when and we could see that many people got tricked too as the rubbish bins is full of dumped joysticks. But besides that, this place sure is worth another visit if I'm there again."
Beautiful Temple,This temple is right on the beach.  The grounds are massive so best to take the shuttle bus around and get off and on at various areas. You can spend hours at this place.
Worth a visit,"Sprawling grounds, beautiful park, impressive  statue of Kwan Yin whichcan be viewed from the lounge of the hotel sharing the same premise. The hotel should be a great spot for retreat, meditation and soul searching. The view from the top of the temple is also beautiful."
"Large area, good for a day trip","This is a 5A scenery spot with the 108 m Kwan Yin status by the sea- very impressive.  While some activities can feel rather commercial, you're free to choose.  It's a large area with plenty worthy of a visit and good photo spots.  Certainly a top spot to see and experience in Sanya"
A must to visit if you worship Kwun Yin,A large statue of NanShan Kwun Yin is out of this world. There is public transit to this place if chose not to take taxi ride.
great place to visit,a great place to learn the history of the tample/place origin and can spend some time with family in the theme park
awesome and peaceful place.,"liked the Large budha statue and the beautiful sea made me very happy.. faced lot of troubles reaching there but thats due to my language problem,i will love to visit again"
Best place!!!,Must see place in Hinan. Divine and special vibe all around the park. Closer you get to Guan Yin Ma higher the energy you will feel.
Put on your list,We had the privilege to visit here on Chinese New Year and were given a real treat.Temple covered acres and were in pristine condition.Hundreds of thosands were here attending the Temples saying prayers for their New Year. The temples and massive Statue had to be seen to be believed. The crowds of people astonishing and  so well behaved and courteous. Movement around the venue was by Choo  Choo Trains which were constantly running to get on and off at various locations. definitely a must!!
A Must Visit,"Almost every city has an area or attraction that is well worth visiting. For Sanya, this location gets my vote. I have lived in China for three years and this is the very first time I was given free admission  to an attraction because I was a foreigner. Although I presented a USA Passport for my identification, I assume all foreigners receive the same treatment. Then again maybe being New Years - Spring Festival made a difference.The Guan Yin statue is extremely impressive as at 354 feet it is 49 foot taller than the Statue of Liberty. The grounds of the park are manicured and very beautiful. We took the shuttle and were glad we did. The area is quite large and not having to walk the entire route enabled us to visit all the attractions and sites. I have visited many Buddhist temple sites and this was without a doubt the most impressive."
Very nice,"We went there on our first day of arrival. We took a taxi there, it came up quite expensive. But at the temple it was very nice. Lots of different things to see. Cultural museum, little parks and pagodas. Very nice set up. You can take a train which can take you around the place or you stroll by yourself. But you won't get lost, there are maps everywhere! after couple of hours we took a bus back, which was very convenient and cheap. Don't be afraid to take a bus, conductors are very nice and helpful, just show them the name of the place if you can't speak mandarine."
Great,"if you already in Sanya you need to take the effort !Is well organized surroundings the park is just amazing .I was surprised of the size of this statue in shore of the sea.Is on the sea side some drive from the city full with locals of course , the view takes that part away"
Difinitely worth it,"To get there we took bus 16 (10 yuan) from Sanya which brought us directly to the entrance as the last stop so you won't miss it.The area itself is very tourist friendly and very beautiful, definitely worth the money.I would recommend arriving early as well as using the bus/train to go around inside the park as it is a HUGE place. You can get the ticket for the ride at the pickup locations inside the park."
One of the highlights to visit when in the Sanya Area,A huge temple complex dominated by a Goddess overlooking South China Sea. Take plenty of pics of shrines and pagodas on your way to the various Nanshan highlights.
PATRICK,"Very special place a little far from Sanya but it is a must to visit. Site is clean along the sea , you enjoy the calm and relaxation of the scene. Big statue of Kwan yin is in the middle of the sea but you can access to through a under walk and it is very impressiveSite is very large , 4/5 stations (temples) to visit and the whole day is needed, We visited it on December, temperature was very comfortable (around 24 Degrees Celsius) and I recommend around these dates to visit (too hot in summer)It was not overcrowded and the visit was very interesting , we learnt a lot about Chinese traditionsStrongly recommended"
Good view but the weather is very hot though,Paid my visit to this temple as part of my second visit to Hainan island. The kwan yin statue in the middle of the sea is the biggest I've ever seen in my life. The temple is very very big and it almost looks like a maze. Weather is hot during my long visit @ May - June though.
Refreshing & magnificient view,"The Buddha is located in the middle of the sea & the view is magnificient. We enjoyed the sightseeing of the whole place & you have to bear with the hot sun if u happen to be there during summer.I felt so refreshing and have a calm mind after visiting the place. You will not forget this experience once you visit this place. I do not mind to visit again when I have the chance. There are a few small shops that sell food (eg icecream, souvenirs etc)I did not go up to the top level of the temple as usually very crowded even during weekdays. Do visit the place on weekday and not on weekend."
Good view,"It was far away from the city, with deep blue sea view.  It was clean and good for relax. There is no something very very wonderful, but let you feel comfortable"
Magnificent view,Biggest Kuan Yin statue I have seen. Beautifully surrounded by the sea. Very big park with different types of Buddhist shrine from all over the world including Tibeten Buddhism.
Good to have a touch of religion: buddhism,It is well managed and you will not be choked by burning incence. But be alert with some 'monks'  dressed in amber robe who could approach you and start selling some blessed holy objects.
Must see during your visit,"this is one of the things you must see while on the island, it will take most of the day.  There are many temples in the grounds and lots of people praying, not just tourists."
Buddha taller than Statue of Liberty!,"If you visit Sanya, this is a must visit! Statue of Buddha taller than Statue of Liberty.  I was blown away when I saw the statue of Buddha."
5AAAAAs,Really is a 5As tourist attraction and the biggest temple i ever being to. Reason for saying so is that everything is Payable... even the joss sticks cost RMB 360 for only 6 sets of 3 joss sticks for only the main 6 major temples in the temple itself excluding those misc small temples/buddhas.
Okay but kind of Disney like,"The first thing other than all,the people trying to sell you things and rent scooters and things.That you notice is the size of the statue.It is alot larger than it looks. It,is a bit of a hike across the causeway and when you get there, it is a bit of an assortment and mish mash of things.Lots of people selling things . Nice view out in the ocean, but that you can get anywhere in Sanya.Once you have see it once, you probably won't do it again ."
"VERY COMMERCIAL, everything is $$$","Beautiful Guanyin statue but very commercial and crowded,  Entrance fees is abot RMB$100 plus dollars.  The food and drink stall inside the area is very expansive and poor quality.  When approaching the main gate you will be approached by ppl asking to rental a VIP buggy abot 400-600, as they will tell you it will take 4-5 hours to walk around, DO NOT be bluff as it takes about 20 mins walk to the Big Guan Yin statue.  The Guan Yin statue is very beautiful as if it stands in the middle of the sea. It has 3 sides, when approached you can only see 1 side,as you need to go up to the statue to see the other 2 as it as facing the sea.  Additional $88 RMB if you want to go inside the statue.  THIS IS WHERE IT GETS VERY COMMERCIAL!!! Once inside, you will see a big Buddah.  As a Buddist I want to pray the buddah, I was stopped as I was ask to approached the counter to register. BUT at the counter, thery will ask you to buy ""thing"" to pray th Buddah, as I tell the staff I just want to pray.  The staff reply...you have to buy something to pray if you do not buy you cant pray in the praying area.   When up in the statue , is so beautiful as u see the 3 side fo the Guan Yin statue and the open sea."
Guanyin statue,"It's a relatively huge area as a tourist attraction and therefore expect some touting and additional fee to enter some of the temple. The 3 face Guanyin statue is pretty awesome; although it looks like 1 face when we first approach it. In front of the statue, there is a restaurant which give a decent view of the sea. But do NOT go for the buffet meal as food was pretty bad."
Very commercial,"It worth a trip because of the statue....however it feels like a theme park. I would rather stay at my hotel. ( If you are still looking for a hotel I had the luck to stay at Haitang bay, great beaches:) )"
Very interesting place to visit,"Like disneyland but without rides, just temples and shrines. Culturally interesting but very commercialized tourist destination."
"Good, but...",The park is very well built and the 108m tall Guanyin is really something. In case you didn't know it has 3 faces but you can't see the other 2 sides head-on. The downside is that you need to buy tickets for most of the temples inside the park even though you have already bought the entrance ticket and there are vendors everywhere selling things which defeats the purpose of Buddhism.
Theme park rather than temple,"Overpriced, overcommercialised theme park. An unauthentic temple experience that disappointed me. Tourists were unconsiderate. Drivers of the tour 'trains' honked loudly all the time, disrupting the peace of the area."
Beautiful,A must see if you are visiting Sanya. The location is amazing. The Hugh standing Guanying is very impressive. Although it is a bit expensive and a costly taxi ride fromMost hotels in Sanya.  It's a must see. You will take home beautiful memories and pictures of the biggest standing Guanying in the world.
If you have time it's ok,"Would rate it higher if it weren't for the hordes of tourists littering, scream talking, cutting in front of us, smoking in your face, spitting and letting their children urinate where they please. This is supposedly a temple but you'd never know based in the behavior of the tourists and based on the amount of money charged for everything. Ticket inside is understandable but at one point we were told a suggested donation was actually a mandatory 80 RMB. Perhaps if the tourists behaved more respectfully such fees could be lowered? Anyway, the scenery was nice and it's worth a snap or two for Instagram, but if you are pressed for time it can be skipped. A taxi from here to Sanya summer mall was about 120 kuai."
Cool statue with an illogical and expensive setup,"""Hey! Let's build a three sided statue and then not let people see all three sides without paying 88RMB more!""Despite having a walkway all around the bottom of the statue which would have made for great pictures there is a bar and a policeman stopping you from enjoying the full experience.Most disturbing was the blatant blackmail surrounding the endangered Sea Turtles which you can ""release"" for an exorbitant amount of money.  This activity is illegal and these people should be fined."
lovely,Having seen Guanyin satue from the air flying in it was well worth a visit to see it up close.  The park surrounding is very peaceful and lovely to walk around.
"Big Buddha, big price","Like everything in Sanya, this destination seems designed to simply separate you from more money. Sure it's a big statue, and yes, the grounds make for a pretty walk. But 150rmb? To take a stroll and see a big Buddha? Now the locals do insist that they used to regularly get their butts kicked by typhoons until the statue went up, and then suddenly the storms started missing them. I just can't imagine how many can actually afford to go in and thank the Buddha personally. There were a number of worshipers though (tourists from other parts of China), so it is at least a little interesting to visit something active as opposed to just a preserved relic."
Amazing,You won't believe your eyes the temple is amazing and the grounds and the other temples are incredible. Well worth the trek and heart stopping journey there in a taxi. But remember if you are a westerner people there will be more interested in you! Also they will want to have their picture taken with you! And you will love the locals summer outfits! Trust me.
Great place to visit,"It is such a busy attraction but well worth it. We loved walking around the gardens and seeing all the lucky ribbons (forgotten what they are called). One pathway had photo's and information of elderly people of the area and their stories, we loved reading them all! The whole place is huge and on a hot day you do get tired. And don't buy tickets from people out the very front, it's a scam, buy them when entering. A must visit attraction!"
Like disneyland,"It's too man-made for my liking. But the sky was really clean and blue. It was too hot, but great for picture taking if you can stand the heat.My relatives who are religious enjoyed the grand temples."
Good attraction but very man-made,"Interesting attractions with quite a few temples. They have a very nice vegetarian buffet at the restaurant. However, the whole place is man-made.We wanted to visit the viewing gallery on the floating Kwan-yin Bodhisattva statue but were told that we will need to ""donate"" an additional CNY88, on top of the CNY150 that we've already paid. Felt pretty cheated, and decided to not go up the viewing gallery."
All about money,"The place is nice. The statue is especially worth a visit. Just don't like the business atmsphere there. Money, money, money ...  That is the wrong direction to go ..."
waouh!!!,Thanks to the taxi driver that she brought us there. It is just an amazing place that you need to visit while being in Sanya
Interesting place and Hugh Status of goddess of mercy,very crowd during Saturday. Was been pushed around when boarded the tram
Spectacular but a little disappointing,"The whole complex is stunning and spectacular. From the beautiful new temples to the statue in the sea. Great place for photographers. From a purely tourist/sightseeing point of view, this would have to be a must-see when in Sanya.As a worshipper, I would say it was a little disappointing. The whole experience was let down by a commercial feel to the place. The guides to the temples came across more as sales staff, more interested in selling candles and joss sticks at exhorbitant prices, rather than to explain the history and/or spiritual significance of the 3-faced Kuan Yin. A mixed experience.."
Worth visiting,"You can spend almost whole day there. If you are a Buddhist, you should go. If you are not, it would be a good experience. The 108m Bodhisattva statue definitely stands out as a unique feature of Hainan.However, we do not enjoy the vegetarian meal served."
a must see place!,"The temple show a giant Guanyin statue, at the end of the Island, the statue stands in front of a scenery of south china sea.the ticket price is above 100 yuan per person.the best thing to do is to book a Sanya tour from Haikou,which includes this place.I paid 300 Yuan for 3 days and 2 night package which include hotels, breakfast lunch and dinner, and ticket to several place like this place."
Impressive statue of Kuan Yin Bodhisattva,"Saw 108m tall Kuan Yin Bodhisattva.The statue is 3-sided. We were able to see only 2 sides.However, the place is rather commercialised.At the main entrance, we paid 150 rmb each.To see the 3rd facet of Kuan Yin Bodhisattva, we have to pay another sum."
Great place,"we love the buddha which is 108 meter tall, we could see her from flight when landing at Sanya,"
Fun to visit but far too commercial for my tastes,"This is meant to be a religious and cultural destination but it feels more like you are getting fleeced at every step of the way (buddha meets disney). Having said that, I do enjoy visiting and have made the trip several times. Try to go early before the crowds arrive or before it gets hot."
Money money money.,"Went in, pay money.Want to take a ride around, pay money.Want to go inside and see, pay money.Want to go for pray, pay money again.Want to go to the tallest tower, pay money again + super long and tiring walk.And oh. FYI, the statue not even completed yet.Toilet, amazingly disgusting."
Highlight of Sanya!,Statue and the Statues. There is nothing much other than the statue there in the entire area of Nanshan and the place itself is quite far from main city.The Goddess statue is huge and can be seen from the Aircraft itself. I felt the 150 RMB ticket was a waste and the place does not deserve so much. The park around it is good and clean but the washrooms aren't. I am so moved by the dirty habits of people in china that I can't explain. People spitting in open and making the rest rooms so dirty.Nanshan is a good place with a few eating places as well including the Vegetarian place which was supremely expensive at 150 RMB. We did not try that as it was not well worth the place to eat.Also no one understands English so please print maps and get the chinese translations of everything from your hotel itself. I dont know what the AAAAA rating was all about.
A buddhist theme park ripoff,"Take a piece of land, build one of the tallest buddha statues in the world, build a hotel with the most extreme and extravagant reception lounges ever, put up a lot of plaster buddhas and give everything som enchanting names from the buddhist mythology and then you are there: At the Nanshan Temple"
Interesting local visit among a big park,"Even if mentionned as a temple, you can take the chance to walk around a nice park, as the weather did not allow us for much swimming. There where a lot of tourist, visitors as a temple. On the day of our visit, ome additional  attration by Chinese playing music around the park.We took a tour organised by hotel to go to this visit for a correct price."
