Exciting games. ,"Played casino here with my GF and i must say that there are hundreds of machine and table to play to, sadly we dont have enough money to try every game.We won a bit but quitted afterwards as we are not really a gambler lol. Inside the casino is so spacious and luxurious, lots of free drinks and food too bad we cant take photo inside."
exciting !,"very enjoyable ! entry age is 25 and they are quite particular about it. casino is bustling with good crowd. i tried the roullete, slot machines and a couple of card games. lost a few dollars and made a couple hundred bucks so it was all fun for me. nice experience. the shops and restaurants are all out of the casino, it only has smoking zones and game zones. bottled water, juices etc is given complimentary. a fun visit !"
I could not leave Macau without visiting at least one of the casinos,"I could not leave Macau without visiting at least one of the casinos, since this city is the most successful gambling one in the world, with many incredible casinos. 5 of Macau‚Äôs casinos have made the list of the 10 biggest casinos in the world. So I decided to visit the second-largest casino in the world with 10,500,00 square feet of overall space! It has 800 gambling tables, 4 themed gambling areas, and over 6,000 slot machines. Seeing this miraculous Venetian inspired building, right across from the City of Dreams casino was something to remember.  But what was really exciting for me is playing on the slot machines. There is no casino in my hometown so I play online free slots that require no download and no registration. My favorite slot is 88 Fortunes by Bally and I always play online at Freeslotshub (you can see in my bio the link). I like spinning the reels and going after the 4 progressive Jackpots in the game. I didn‚Äôt get to win a big Jackpot this time, but I had a lot of fun even though there was a lurker around. Touching the slot machine gives you a different feeling, but I must admit it made me a bit nervous playing at a real land casino and I missed the bonuses of an online one. It was an experience to remember and I won some money back in the end."
Bigger Than Vegas,"This was the first stop on our day tour of Macau and we were given some time to wander around and explore. It‚Äôs like the original in Vegas, just bigger. There are many shops, gondola rides, and of course the casino.  Photography isn‚Äôt allowed in the gaming area, but our guide told us to take the escalator up and turn around for a view into the gaming area and to snap photos that way.  The gaming area isn‚Äôt as open as it is in Vegas."
If you like artifical world,You can walk in there without entry fees and see hundreds of slot machine and gambling tables  and view what large sums people are throwing away for hope to win
Must-see,This is such an amazing place where everything you see is nice and lovely anywhere you look. You would have a so-called mock-up of Venice. The best thing? The biggest casino in the world is here. Play for fun.
Huge enough to accommodate crowd,"Yes, superbly crowded on weekends, so avoid if you can. But the place is used to crowd, and indeed built for it, so dont worry!The whole interior is built to look exactly like Venice. Beautiful photo moments at every corner too!Big, upscale brands, as you might expect too.Lots of food places, and prices are generally acceptable, though not your cheap street food of course.Easily connected to the Parisian experience too."
If you don;t mind going to a crowded Casino.,Somehow I like to go to a Casino with fewer people and Casino Venetian is not the one. It is because I prefer to have a less crowded Casino.But some people like to have fun with more people!
too crowded,"last time i was in this hotel was in the year 2013, still the check in was chaotic, however when i went to the foodcourt, i was amazed at the available food choices , offering taiwanese. japanese, korean , macao , thai, and western food."
Don't miss it,Like the landmark in Macao. Many shop to walk around and great to shopping even to photo itself. If you inside you never know the time coz it always day time.
a total replica of Venetian in Vegas,"it was a total de ja vu, like being back in Vegas- a total replica. however, everything is newer, grander, cleaner..."
worst hotel with a lot of prostitute hanging around in the casino hall,"I am with my fiance and my mom at the Venetian Casino till midnite and what makes me suprise that there are a lot of prostitute hanging around looking for customer. A few of this hoe are disturning my fiance which really piss me off.. I do hope the management will do something regarding this matter. As a well known hotel, this kind of issue should not be happening. I hope you guys will sort out this matters."
Good Casino Good Hotel,"Very lovely place for adult and kidsall can enjoy their time togetherSo many kids attraction and also adult relaxing time. Both can enjoy their holiday, sure gonna come back again if we go to Macao"
Worth a visit,"Although we didn't stay at the Venetian, it was still worth a visit for the almost theme park vibe, the impressive recreation of Venice, and just to check out the sheer size of the complex.  We splurged on the gondola ride which was probably almost as expensive as the real thing.  It was a bit annoying being the photo targets of every visitor walking along the canals but the experience was cool as our gondolier was quite talented even singing some songs in Korean.  The food court was also massive making it pretty tough to pick a stall to eat at.  With most stalls basically charging restaurant prices, we went with Tim Ho Wan which didn't have a full menu but still served up excellent Cantonese dim sum."
Mediocre dim sum,Eating dim sum in the Chinese dim sum restaurant in Venetian is a bad experience for me because they are not made the Cantonese way of cooking . They are more like half northern and half southern style. To make the matter worse is the price is not cheap either.
Tourist Trap,"I recommend just having a look but as one of the most famous properties in Macau, it‚Äôs highly monitored and controlled to ensure no one makes any big winnings. They have lots to learn from Vegas."
'Nice Decor Shopping',"It is a comprehensive place for casino, hotel, exhibition, shopping, restaurant and leisure facilities which is filled with Venetian arches and man-made canal for gondola rides.  The whole place is beautifully decorated and lighted."
Very Big!!,This is a very big place . The decor is very beautiful and there are a lot of very expensive shops. Nice to visit to experience the place but if you are not gambler like me it is just another Casino resort.
Christmas buffet @ Parisian,"We actually planned to go somewhere to celebrate üéÑ üéÑbut not much choice as my mom and dad who are in 90s don‚Äôt want to go too far. Then decided to go Macau and randomly picked a restaurant for Christmas dinner. We do not expect too much of the service as it‚Äôs Christmas time, but surprisingly we were served by Ujwol and Chris(the chef) and they provide us excellent service especially for my folks and very much appreciated.üòÄüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüéâüéâüéâüéâüéâ"
Great experience,"Really impressive place, absolutely huge and lots to do. Shopping is a must if your there as there is something for everyone at good prices especially brand clothing brands. I did a two night stay and the accommodation was brilliant worthy of 5 stars and the staff are super friendly."
Gigantic,"Wow. I have been told this was world‚Äôs biggest casino. Very massive building, it has lots of shop, restaurants. Busy place, very clean, great decor and friendly staff."
Worth a look,"I am not a gambler, but the casino is worth a look for the floor shows and maybe the odd flutter on one of the games."
Big!,"If you feel that biggest is best, than this is the place for you.  It is either the world's largest or 2nd largest casino.  Either way, it has a wide variety of both table games and slots, but I would say that the table games dominate unless I missed out on a whole area of slots, which is possible.  It even has a separate area for high rollers.  With plenty of games to play with different minimums, you are sure to find something you like to try your luck!"
enjoying,"i really enjoy playing there,,that is my first time playing in casino..the staft there is very acommodating and very comfortable place to play"
Best casino in Macau,"As young westerners, we felt most comfortable in this casino. We were intensely stared at by other casino-goers in all the other casinos we entered! We were also consistently ID‚Äôd in the other casinos whereas this one ID‚Äôd us upon entry then made us feel super welcome once we were inside."
Venetian Feels in Asia,"Stunning hotel and casino, but their food court was so crowded that it took us almost 30 minutes to sit down and eat. The food was served right away but we can't sit since there's no vacant space for us to eat.Still excellent hotel and casino though."
Perfect shopping in Mini-Venice,"I have been to Casino at Venetian in Las Vegas, but this one in Macao features  much bigger shopping areas. Besides, this is far cleaner than the real Venice in Italy.You can enjoy great restaurants in reasonable prices.Take frequent free shuttle buses to and from the old Macao hotel districts."
"Its like a big, golden maze","Spent 4h here. 2 of them were willingly then We couldnt find our way out. A LOT to do in here so I still recommend it. High end shopping, spontaneous shows along the halls and incredible decor. Worth it for the art and culture alone. There is just so much to see and do here. I highly recommend a visit to the venetian."
Poker room is a racist scam,"I was part of a rigged game on Poker, was cheated by a group of Chinese, after facing all issues with the management they were on the side of the locals . Such a racist place, worst poker experience in my life. If you are not from a Chinese origin better dont go there to play poker!"
So large you could get lost!,"Now I'm not a gambler but there is so much to look at inside here.  The shops are all top brand labels so you could spend a fortune.  There are a myriad of food places to eat at from buffets, food halls and restaurants.  The hallways between places are wide but I did find the signage was difficult to find.  I imagine a map on your phone would be used if you stayed here.  The condola ride looked inviting but it's $30AUD for 15 minutes which was too expensive for a family group of 7!Not my cup of tea but can say I've been here."
Biggest in world. Ok if you are into gambling,"Must see for fake Venice, pretty in St marks square Food hall good, no western choices though As with all casinos, lots of gamblers"
Venice and Portuguese custard tarts,"The walk by the 'canal' is so realistic - just keep looking away from the shops and enjoy the antics of the gondoliers! Don't miss Lord Stowe's Portuguese custard tarts - but be prepared to queue, they are very popular."
Clean and nice,"It‚Äôs a casino and it‚Äôs what you expect, lots of tables although they could do with black jack.  Beer is free if playing but you have to push to get one."
Exchange Philippine Peso not allowed,"Change your money at the airport. At the Cotai Strip, none of the casinos exchange Philippine Peso to MOP. Just ended up withdrawing from the ATM."
2nd largest casino in the world,"The casino at Venetian Macao opened in 2007 on the Cotai Strip and is presently the second largest casino in the world with 546,000 square feet of floor space. Even for non-gamblers, its size, scale and crowds are really something to see. The casino occupies much of the ground floor space at Venetian and includes over 3,000 gaming machines and 870 card game and roulette tables. Gaming activity that you will find include Sic Bo, Baccarat, Craps, Roulette and others that are common in Macau casinos. Access points are from both the main East and West entrances into the Venetian as well as the centre escalators to/from the upstairs Shoppes at Venetian Macau. Minimum age for entry is 21 years of age and there is no dress code to visit and/or walk through the casino."
Too big and a lot walking,Hotel is huge and needs lots of walking.Casino did not provide free mineral water unlike in Galaxy Hotel.Still prefer Galaxy Hotel due to its stragic pathway.
 World's largest Casino ,This is supposed to be the world's largest casino It will take more than a  day to just walk around the casino It's an amazing hotel & I keep coming around for this amazing experience
One of the biggest casino in Macau,"You will be spoilt for choices when it comes to casino in Macau. The casino is Venetian is considered one of the biggest among the many. Whichever time you go, it is always crowded. All casinos provide free beverages n bottle water for the guests. Restaurants are easily available inside too. Is an eye opening experience if you have never been to a casino."
Just wow,Having visited venice the hotel  really gives you that kinda feel . Amazing shops restaurants and gondolas a rotating  skyline feel Italy in macau.  A must visit .
Gamble gamble n more gamble ,This is the best casino in macau....it is is super huge in size n is always filled up with so so many guests / tourists Love the energy on the casino floor Dont both wasting time going from casino to casino...just come to venetian n gamble
"A maze, but a good one","Typical of the buzz you expect at a Macau casino. Very clean and well laid out. Tables are busy at all times but that‚Äôs to be expected. Huge casino, a must visit if you‚Äôre in Macau."
Nice Architecture,Look like Las Vegas but more bigger then that. This Venetian building make my dream to Las Vegas come true even it not in Las Vegas. But the feel i get it's like Las Vegas.
Amazing place ,Vinetion has everything. You atleast need 2 days to cover this place . From Casio to shopping and amazing restuarant like cafe deco and the peacock. It's beautiful made at every corner you would like to get your self clicked. They have Venice like theme for the shopping area.
Boring,"I've been going to this casino ever since it opened. No longer. All good slot machines have gone, very little choice now,  all boring machines. Staff extremely unhelpful. MGM, Wynn and City of Dreams are a thousand times better. Give it a miss unless absolutely necessary."
Gondola ride to the gambling mecca of Macau,"Massive gaming floor at The Venetian Macao casino. Enough floor space to fill cattle trains (bus loads) full of people mainly from Mainland China. And does so. Replica of Venetian canals in the adjoining shopping mall. We know how faked it is, because the facade buildings are at 90 degree angles when in Venice buildings are on a slant.The indoor canals are impressive, as are the shops. But the casino floor is much like what you'd find in a wet market."
"Massive Casino, Same Games Though","We were excited to see the second largest casino in the world. It was huge for sure. You can go on a gondola ride just like the one in Vegas. But a lot of the games were exactly the same and we got bored quickly. If you love slots, this is the place for you."
Casino smoke free,"A must visit when in Macau. Free shuttle bus from and to macau ferry terminal. Huge casino, mostly crowded at all times. Many different kind of gambling games available. You‚Äôd be asked to make a card first in order to play which will have your name and photo (photo will be clicked at the card issuing counter) After playing you can take home the card. Water is served free of cost. Photo taking is prohibited inside. Earlier, one could smoke anywhere in casino but now they have made smoking rooms.Which i felt was thoughtful for all the people who do not smoke but stink of cigarettes after visiting.It was nice to win some money. Will visit soon."
Impressive,"Eastern Las Vegas. Very impressive building complex, at night even more spectacular. It is a very much touristic spot but a nonetheless a must see in Macau."
Very big but too crowded,"The casino is at the first floor of the Venetian hotel, very big and you can find different kinds of gambling games, but seriously too crowded. If you enjoy surrounded by people, it‚Äôs perfect to you. If you don‚Äôt bet your luck, there is a big shopping mall above the casino."
Another world,"What a visit yesterday nightI did not expect such a huge building with an amazing architecture.Inside, it is was also impressive. I had never seen such a big surface for gambling: you have everything.If you are a gambler, you found THE place here."
Excellent for shopping and fun photos,"The Venetian is an indoor street environment with boats on a canal. It is made to look like Venice Itay but also has a casino. We chose not to go to one of the expensive restaurants and not to eat Asian fast food. We had instead an Australian burger that did not disappoint. We loved the western shops that we miss because we live in mainland China. I took home, to Shenzhen, chocolate treats from Marks and Spencers."
Holiday,"One of the best professionally managed Casino. It was an experience of it's kind. Good courtesy & highly smart people to manage the whole show. Worth visiting, even though if you do not play in casino."
Huge....,Very big casino. Plenty of food courts. Nice set up. Very huge and scenic. Worth the visit. But no halal food restaurants.
Venetian is  mesmerizing place.. what an architecture,"How nicely they are maintaining this place is the question u will be having in ur mind, its a Casino, a very big mall, food courts, Mac D, etc etc etc.. without venetian trip ur Macau visit is incomplete. Its a must visit place"
Better in vegaa,"O stayed in Venetian in Vegas and it was much better. Being so big and with so few people, specially the shopping area, I missed more liveliness . The decor and the building is great, just not the correct atmosphere."
Nice place.,"Big and nice place for fun,a lot of machine to play for fun.It‚Äôs beautiful inside many shops for shopping."
Amazing Hotel luxurious hotel in all its grandness!,"This hotel with the architecture, the painted ceilings and the grand canals of Venice is an impressive experience. The queue for the gondola ride can be lengthy but the experience makes it well worth while. Truly romantic place for a weekend getaway."
It's a city,It took me quite a while to walk through the indoor streets to find the main lobby because I moved from Sheraton nearby. It's a city on its own. It would have been more impressive to me had I not been to places like the Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas.
Engr.,"The fish is very costly around 2400.00 for small fish..staff could not speak basic English. There is no price in menu book.but when I got the bill, I was shocked until now..Be careful guyz, you might be grab without knowing."
Win win,"Thank you to Venetian casino!! My wife and I had a lucky and wonderful night with you, will come back win you again soon lol"
Mr ,Great casino.. lots of resturants and great shops for clothing Victoria secret store and all brands as well.
Truely addictive !! ,"Be it this casino in macao or any other casino, they are so aptly built that one cannot escape from here easily.They serve tea coffee and juices to all in the house free."
Good casino in Macau,It so huge casino lot of  shop and resturant for lunch and dinner . Have a free shuttle bus from airport are provide.
Huge casino,"This casino is huge, it is my favorite one to go gamble. The tables starts at 300-1000 hk dollars a bet. Pretty hefty for a casino. It is very crowded on the weekends, and can easily get lost, it's huge. The casino only play with hk dollars so don't change your money to macau mop or you end up paying exchange fees twice. There is lots of shops and restaurants to check out  inside the hotel as well."
Nice place to visit in Macau,"This hotel is very big and the casino full of people, if you like shopping you can come to this hotel because they have more than 1000 shop and a lot of food you can try in this hotel. If you visit this hotel better becareful with your belonging because to crowded."
The minimums at the Casino are way to high to enjoy the Casio,"If you plan on gambling, you'd better be ready with a large amount of cash. The minimums are often at least US$ 130 while finding US$ 5, 10, 15 & 20 tables in Las Vegas are the norm. The games are mainly Chinese and European games with a small mixing of the games you'd find in Las Vegas. It's a beautiful Casino and well worth walking through. Watching the Chinese players play is entertaining."
best casino in taipa island,"The hotel is very large and the casino is quite spacious,  many visitor try their lucky in this casino"
Just another casino,"This is expensive compared to Australian casinos. Blackjack was minimum $60au a hand )$300hk) with most tables $100-$200au ($500-$1000hk) a hand. Pokies are just a place to donate money to the casino, minimal bar service areas, you really have to search if you want a drink, though non alcoholic drinks can be served by staff if you‚Äôre playing tables or pokies.Go to Macau to see the few sites outside of the casinos, unless you‚Äôre wealthy and can donate lots of money"
"I was hoping to find more ""American"" roulette tables, blackjack and slot machines.","I loved the Casino at the Venetian, I felt like I was in Vegas again.  As busy and beautiful as it is it did lack my fave places to gamble.  All or mostly all of the machines are in Asian and made it very difficult to enjoy."
Got lost in the Venetian,"The area in the Venetian is so big, I was trying to find the exit which I entered from but even after 2 hours, damn I couldn't find it. The casino is huge, the high end mall also spans a few floors. It's cute that they have the canals and gondola to mimic venice."
its always an experience at casino in venetian,With more than 12 types of games and 8 types of betting activities its one of the biggest casinos in asia. Enjoyed a lot with people winning and losing at the same table but one should always play as per their pocket in order to have good experience.
"Busy, boring ",This casino may be the largest in the world but we found it to be soul-less and expensive in terms of minimum bets and there were only 8 black jack tables. Just no atmosphere which didn‚Äôt help the winnings. Tables only accept HK dollars. Would not go again.
Best rooms,"Stayed here for 3 day had great time ,room was massive beautifully layout.casino is huge got lost few times expensive to gamble chips are min $100 aud but plenty to see and do"
Amazing hotel - an experience & worthy of a visit,"Visited on a day trip to Macau whilst on holiday in Hong Kong. Easy to get to via the Macau ferry and numerous buses available when you step out of the terminal. The hotel itself was voted our first stop and was by far the best of the day, apparently a replica of the hotel in Vegas, although larger than it's vegas counterpart, it is most impressive in size and elegance. It is absolutely huge and the array of shops inside is extensive to say the least. We took the opportunity to get tickets for a gondola ride along the canal that runs on the second floor and were serenaded along the way!Yes it is busy as everyone seems to want to visit &/or stay there but it is well worth the visit.The Venetian is a must see - especially if you have not been to Vegas - it really is an experience in itself."
Must visit - even if u r not staying there,1. Just excellent - makes u feel spell bound on the sheer architecture of the huge building2. Indian vegetarian food is available at a particular restaurant at the venetian3. Do eat at the big food court - lots of good options.4. Have the egg tarts - they cannot be missed5. Enjoy the whole feel - which has a false evening sky on top - its beautiful
AMAZING,"absolutely loved the casino even though am not a gambler, the whole venetian hotel, shopping mall, restaurants, service, d√©cor is amazing and well worth a visit its a experience on its own loved it"
Wow factor,"I watched the building of this commence in 2008. It was a ma.grove swamp at this time.When you visit you can see the video of the construction.Its bigger and better than America. More canals, more outlets. Great restaurants catering for ALL tastes.A must do. One amongst many on th CoTai Strip. Mind blowing"
Lost track of time,We spent half a day at the Venetian and the time just flew.  There are an enormous number of shops and eateries and of course a large casino facility.  You could well believe you were in Venice when watching the gondola gliding along the waterway.  Well worth a visit.
Biggest Casino in macau,Try Your Luck and Enjoy lots of Variety of card games as well as slot machine and rollatee. Biggest Table and Good Staff
Always buzzing with Energy,Easily one of the biggest casinos which i have visited and was always full of people with lot of choices and convenient because was staying in the same place
Huge and exciting,"This seems to be the largest casino in Macau. If you are in a group of people, it will be hard to find each other.  It is really huge but also super elegant and exciting. We had fun."
Top most reason to visit Macau,In case you are first time visitor to Macau then Venetian casino should be your first stop. Although there are multiple casinos in Macau which have helped it earn the name of Las Vegas of Asia. You can choose any one from several casinos as most of these hotels provide free pick up and drop from ferry and bus stations.The language in most machines is Chinese so modify the language before playing. The service is not that great so in case you want any drinks you have to go to the counter. Most beverages are free like juices and coffee. The mode of payment preferred here is hong kong dollars so get money converted and have fun.
Great Casino in Macau,Casino in Venetian Macau is impressive and is big place for enjoying the play and loose money or gain money.
It‚Äôs not Venice but it‚Äôs the next best thing,"If your in Macau then you are in the Vegas of the East. Similar to Las Vegas the Venetian is a cheesy representation of everthing from ancient Venice and Rome. While it will never compare to the real thing it does give you a taste of what is 100 times better if you make a trip to Italy and see the real thing. Notwithstanding it‚Äôs worth a visit because as they same, while in Rome do as they do and in this city it‚Äôs all about the casinos üò≤"
everything is huge,"big mall with gondolas on the upper floor, underground mall connection with the different hotels/casinos around - watch out that u don't get lost"
Luxury and style,"Spent last 4 days at the Venetian Casino Macau, at the G2E Gaming conference.The service, facilities and Casino floor were all first class. This is a must see if you are in Macau."
Quality,Genuinely lovely. Definitely recommend checking it out. They say it's the Vegas of asia and that isn't an understatement.
"Good, could be like vegas... Best","It was a good experience. Food mall inside, shopping plaza with discounts as well. I felt the sky false ceiling could be better without the visible caps and in some places faulty shadow lighting. Gondola ride is amazing anyways..."
Amazing stay,"huge and beautiful property(city by itself),stayed with family in suite room,room service food and service is the most professional.Big area so one need to walk a lot and might get confused as many entrance though good signages,reception area small with many counters close and time consuming but helpful staff.rooms are fabulous and done so beautifully.its a real star hotel you can say,second floor takes you to venice with gandola,kids area and shopping arcade.its really crowded during day time with tour buses and hundreds of tourists around in lobby and casino area,if not wrong west entrance.only thing which makes me upset was guys running around in casino and asking their card to insert for points even few don't  ask and do it and keep following you,which i fell not safe and staff do nothing."
Venetian Macao was GRAND,"Had to check out the Casino at Venetian Macao and I have to say - because I have been to the Venetian in Las Vegas Nevada - it's very similar with the gondola rides, the various in door food and shopping - but what was different was how they really ONLY let adults (18 and over) into the casino so they really do monitor.  Was great to visit - but again because i've been to the Venetian in Las Vegas I guess I wasn't overly 'wowed"""
Stroll along the shops,I visited the Venitian on my last day. I walked from the Parisian using their connected walkways. I enjoyed watching the gondolas. Sometimes you can even hear a serenade during gondola rides. I also enjoyed Lord Stow's egg tart. I did a quick shopping before heading to the airport. The area was nice but crowded. I just prefer shopping centers with less crowd.
IT'S MASSIVE!,Well worth a visit. The canals are endless and the walkways are filled with shops. The atmosphere inside was great. Had a nice cleansing ale in one of the bars. Much bigger than the venetian in Las Vegas and worth a visit if you have a spare hour or two.
Gorgeous Venetian,"Having stayed at the Venetian Las Vegas I was keen to  see the bigger version in Macau - it did not disappoint. Great selection of pokies although very limited black jack (this was the same everywhere) tables with reasonable min stakes. the big difference between Vegas and Macau is the types of pokies and tables - obviously the majority are Chinese which can be a little frustrating for westerners  who can struggle to find games they can understand  and play - having said that the bigger casinos (Studio City, Venetian, Parisian, Grand Lisboa, City of Dreams) do deliver just remeber what the currency conversion is when you are playing!"
Massive,"The Venetian Macao is the biggest casino in the world with numerous number of tables and machine slots. We had no plan to gamble, however visited the casino to get firsthand experience of world‚Äôs largest casino. The place is massive but was crowded, it was a different kind of experience watching people busy in betting their hard-earned monies. Post visit of Casino, we spent remaining time strolling around the shops, had a memorable Gandola ride etc."
strongbow,This place is massive and very busy. Lots of restaurants. If looking for AFL was in irish bar here. Great casino to visit
Playground for the Adults,Very interesting and colorful playground the Venetian Casino. The casino has about four entrances within the hotel. All security guarded. Guards are friendly and helpful with directions.Lots of tables for gambling and slot machines. Lots of money required to play too!!  Some of the minimums on the tables are mainly HKD 500. Lot to lose until there's nothing (left) to lose!
A very busy casino ,"It‚Äôs one of the largest casinos in Macau, a very busy casino indeed, especially at weekends, as my self do not gamble, it was very noisy, and crowded for my liking"
The Las Vegas of Asia,"US funds have re-established a Las Vegas in Asia to a larger area, volumes and wealth. With its buildings, the most important buildings of Venice (Duke's Palace, Rialto Bridge, St. Mark's bell tower, clock tower) have been depicted, while on the huge ground floor of the building there are plenty of gambling tables, where each visitor can easily and simplicity deposit his money. Very interesting sight, even for those who do not play."
"Very poor service, only worth going for the beautiful interior. ","Waited over 15 minutes with the service light on to get some water and no one ever came to help me. Attendants seem to be few and far between, not walking around very much. Instead they can be seen standing still doing nothing but too far away to attract their attention. Our game malfunctioned and required an attendant and this took quite some time. If it weren't for us grabbing the attention of a woman carrying drinks, who then radioed for assistance, I think we would have been waiting for a very long time just as we had to when we pressed the service button for some water.  The building is beautiful and worth checking out, but I wouldn't recommend playing here. Out of half a dozen or more casinos I went to in Macau, this one had the least attentive staff by far. I was playing for about 3 hours and failed to get a single bottle of water, even after having the service light on for so long. To put it in comparison, staff at other casinos would frequently come by with bottles of water for every single player without request."
amazing scale,"We travelled over to Macao on the Cotai water jet cost 200H.K.D  about ‚Ç¨50 .it is a quick service but remember to bring your passport to Macao as it was a Portuguese protectorate and you will need the passport ,The Venetian is absolutely huge with an impressive gambling area which you could stroll around in for a few hours and watch the betting or have a flutter , alternatively you can wander around the shops in the Venetian section which is complete with canal , bridges and Gondolas. and has a truly amazing roof which is painted to look like the sky over Venice . this hotel is absolutely massive and after wandering around it  have a look outside at the Eifell tower , getting to and fro to the Cotai boat can be done on the venetian courtesy coach"
"Interesting to visit to see what they have, for shopping or food","This casino inside tries to attract visitors with entertainment in Italian style: canal, gondolas and Italian singing. A lot of shops of all styles: clothing, jewelry, cosmetics, etc. Food zone will meet tastes and expectation of any visitor, even the most experienced one. You have choice from fast food to the most sophisticated food art. Of course, one should be ready to see crowds of visitors - this is a macro place for macro tourism."
Huge casino,The Venetian  has a massive  casino . Lots of tables n slots . Enjoy a few spins or  do some serious gambling you are sure to enjoy it  . Soft drinks are free not alcohol. No need for formal as frequented by tourist all day n night . Good  luck to all of you .
Artificial life but nice to see,Even if it looks really artificial it is impressive to see how they have reproduced this city. I prefer of course the original one :-)
Great casino,"This casino is huge! Could accommodate hundreds upon hundreds of people. Some of the buy ins for the tables are quite high but, there is also a big array of slot machines to try."
Feels like Im in Italy,No need to go to Italy because Venetian offers a lot from shopping malls and restaurants and also gondola.Very luxurious painting in the ceiling.
Grand Casino,"Larger than the Venetian in Las Vegas, but also feel quite impersonal than the buzzling, vibrant feel of a Las Vegas Venetian casino.  Awe nevertheless."
All the same,If you like casino gamble machines then it's no fun in this casino. Allmost all the games are the same. There are still plenty of table games but you can't played that all day long. The casino is big like the other casinos and there are shops inside. Another fun thing to do is the gondola.
Over hyped place,"Venetian Macau is over all good,but extremely over hyped place.Nothing wow about place.its good place"
Magnificent Tower - Venetian Macao,Take on the hop on bus when you reach Macau and they will bring you to this magnificent tower- Casio at Venetian Macao. It‚Äôs a Wow Wow wow. (Cant compare to our little Casio in the red dot). Seeing is believing.
Large casino,The Venetian boasts one of the most luxurious casinos in the world. The decor is undoubtedly extravagent. However non-gamblers have no reason to stay more than ten minutes.
Overhyped,The casino was featured in discovery channel as a feat of engineering. But other than extravagant design. It is just another big casino. The so called canal replica is nothing near than venice culture.
Worth a look,"The Venetian is definitely worth a look if you are in Macau, even if it is just to see the weird indoor canals. It‚Äôs actually super impressive when you first see it. It gets boring pretty quickly but definitely something to see. The casino it‚Äôs is super boing like all the casinos in Macau, zero atmosphere, just people sitting quietly gambling and drinking tea... it‚Äôs no Vegas..."
Worth a Visit!,The Venetian is worth a visit if you‚Äôre planning to travel to Macau. There are plenty of shops in the Hotel Casino to kill a couple of hours with window shopping. They provide a shuttle bus to and from the Hong Kong Macau Ferry Terminal. And if you want to stop by Macau‚Äôs City Center there‚Äôs a bus stop a few minutes walk from the entrance/exit of the Venetian and the bus will take you to the City Center. The buses do accept HKDs as well.
Huge Place!,Day trip to Macau via ferry. Took a cab to the Venetian. This place is huge! Stopped and deposited 100 hkd at the casino! They have a Venetian style boat and waterway throughout the mall. You can rent a boat ride through the canals. Lots of shopping to be had. And extremely busy. Lots to look at too. Very well done.
Huge!,"It's huge but about the same as the Venetian in Las Vegas. It's so tiring to walk and the shops are about the same as Las Vegas, maybe less."
Same thing as in Vegas but in Asia,"Immense, crowdy, big difference the number of baccarat tables is very high and the same for other Asian games. For the test copy paste of the Venetian in Las Vegas. Perhaps also a bit more Asian restaurants, but that is logic"
This place is awesome!,This place is HUGE - I went in at one place and came out I think on the other side of Macau (insert sarcasm).  It has every store you can think of and then some.  There‚Äôs a gondola with singers and the atmosphere is amazing as they have outdone themselves creating a feeling that you are in Venice.  Love it here but it‚Äôs crowded - so prepare yourself if you don‚Äôt like crowds :)
Huge and busy!,"We‚Äôve stayed at the Venetian many times In Vegas.  And while this hotel has a similar feel and ‚Äúlook‚Äù it‚Äôs definitely not as spectacular.  However, it seems to be ‚Äúthe‚Äù casino to be at in Macao.  The place is awesome for people watching and the casino is massive and packed with mostly Chinese people.  We were one of the very few Americans wondering around.  There‚Äôs some excellent restaurants and shopping here too.  Definitely worthy walking around and checking out the action when In Macao."
Busy and buzzy,Maybe the glitz here is more attractive to draw in visitors? Certainly it was busy and buzzy whilst other casinos were quiet. But maybe the food court attracts many?
Fantastic lobby show!,We visited this place just to see the light show in the lobby which lasted for about three minutes or so. But really enjoyed seeing this.
Minimum bet was ¬£30,"A bit steep minimum bet is $300 HK ¬£30 for your casual gamblers, very busy and Baccarat was on 90% of tables."
Not for drinkers,"Great for gamblers, but if you want a drink or a dance, go somewhere else. Close to town, easy access"
Busy but clean ,Huge casino that serves mostly Chinese clientele as 99% of the tables are for games that are unknown to the west. Unfortunately some of the dealers do not speak comprehensible English and they use gestures to guide the player... Clean and tidy however for the huge space with restaurants and Starbucks 1 min walk.
OK,We had some time left to visit the Casino and it was OK but nothing special somehow. Good thing is that all Casinos in Macau provide free Shuttles from and to the Ferry!
"One of the most best and certainly very comfy 5 star hotel I have ever stayed. The food, the ambience, the comfort level",Best of the best restaurant. Food was great staff was nice. Certainly recommended place to visit in Macao
Disappointing,"This was more of a tacky arcade rather than a casino. Rather small, situated in the lobby area of the hotel, used as a through walk to the hotel suites. It had no atmosphere and seemed rather dead."
The Best Casino,"This Casino is the best one,I ever have seen. The variety of games available is Awesome...There is no cheating or Bouncers.. They keep high standards"
it is mammoth in size!!,Its a huge casino with so many tables including high &  medium stakes table. Apart from tables it offers huge variety of machine games which are very picket friendly also.
Mesmerizing place,We didn't visit it inside because we are not up to casino and we haven't got time to do it but from outside it's just stunning with all its lights and around there are also others casino. its a really nice area if you are interested about pictures
Life is a Gamble,"Its one crazy place where you literally need to wear your hearts on your sleeves.You need to be prompt,accurate,witty and know the tricks just well."
Gross extravagance but worth a look,"We did not want to gamble but came to The Venetian for a look at one example of the extravagance that casinos embody.  This place is enormous, over the top, and every other phrase you can think of that says over done.  As a suitably cheesy finish to our day in Macau we had a gondola ride complete with singing gondolier - what else!"
Superb huge casino,"The casino was in the property where we stayed and a sweet have a 8 year old kid, they didnt allow in inside. However we saw from upstairs"
A must see in macau,This place is so big and amazing if you only see one casino it has to be this one. You don't even have to go into the casino just be amazed at the surroundings. Won't say anymore just take a free shuttle bus and go
Great Overall Resort A tastes of Venice Without Flying Halfway around the World.,"Have stayed here several times. It is a very large resort with about 3000 guest rooms, its own shopping, casino, and many restaurants and bars. Also has a very large conference center.  It is billed s a all suites hotel with the smallest room being about 70 square meters. Rooms are large and very nice. Even with so many rooms things seem to move very well here.  The highlight for many is on the second level of the hotel. They have built a mini Venice complete with the canals and the boat rides for guests. Because it covers several levels you really do not even know you are inside a very large building.  Complete with walk ways cafes, and shops. You could spend several days and never leave the hotel. Worth a trip to this wonderful resort."
Impressive,"A really huge casino-hotel-shopping mall, similar to casinos of Las Vegas (is bigger than american Venetian). Luxurious, very clean, with a lot of shops, cafes and casino. One part is copy of Venetian canals, exactly like Villagio center in Doha (Qatar). You must really visit it, if you have more time you can play! It's a must visit in Macau."
Impressive - even if you are not into gambling - stopping here is a must!!,"The Venetian in Macau - the biggest casino in the world - currently! ... and if this is not enough - here are some more facts for you: - of course gambling - what else is drawing people to a casino if not the chance of making fortune at the blackjack, baccarat or roulette table ...maybe dice . - shopping - high class shops all over the place - so if you are looking for bargains this ain't that place. If you are looking for brands - well you got plenty. - eating and drinking -very simple - from Starbucks that is very budget friendly up to restaurants that you need to wear a jacket to seat down - very fine dining places - you will find quite a lot of place. (don't rush in for the bakery and egg tarts save if for the Koi Kei ,.. ). - thrill - check out St. Peters square - right the 1 from Venice Italy , but recreated at the 3rd floor of the Venetian , with an amazingly painted blue sky and no pigeons. Also if you care for it you can take a Gondola ride on the ""Canale Grande"" right there in the casino ... really, no trick they have recreated the canals too and gondolas are floating. What can I say, I saw a lot of things during my travels but this is just crazy - amazingly done scenery. - when I've been there at noon - there was a 10 minutes violin/viola concert in the square - free of charge of course.- walk around and be amazed - well I've never been to Vegas - but this is just amazing. - hotels - several inside the casino - so if you are looking for a hotel and you are into gambling- well here is where you can have the 2 in 1 experience.  To sum it up - is a complete experience regardless if you are gambling or not - so go check it ...is not cheap but is an unique experience I recommend it to you ... if you go to Macau check out the Venetian."
Well...?,...it's just a casino .. with some chinese casino games that we westerners don't know and don't understand ! I wouldn't gamble here...!
Huge casino‚Äîmust see if in Macau,"This was our first stop in Macau. The Venetian is HUGE. We got lost amongst all of the shops and the restaurants and had to ask for directions to get out. The gondolas are a cute feature to go through the property and they have great shopping. We had a bite to eat at Italian place at the food court. Not great at all, but easy and quick. Overall, hard to go to Macau and not stop in here."
Awesome.,Once in a lifetime experience to visit this casino. Very nice ambience and lot‚Äôs of attraction. Play multiple games here. You feel you are in heaven.
"Terrible, horrible, horrendous","Well, once you see the flood of poor Chinese people into its slot machines, no need to comment anything else. The environmental destruction is notable, the casino clouds the wonderful lake behind it, that host a World Heritage site, a colonial Portuguese set of houses from the turn of the XXth century in Coloane. I have seen the lake and the pretty houses, exponents of Macanese Portuguese culture, and the beautiful vegetation before. Now it is a dump, like another part of the horrendous Venetian Disney style, on the cheap, spend your money theme park."
so big hotel,"this is a very big hotel in Macau and it is very famous also , this is the second place I have to go around , it is great , and a lot of people here , so many beautiful building"
Simply staggering,This casino is huge and very busy but outside of the gambling there are great shopping and eating places along with the gondalar rides for a bit of romance
Onr of the fist biggest Casino Hotel in Macau,"This is one of the xtra ordinary Casino (never play in the casino) with Shopping mall and hotel in Macau. Very attractive mall, design like you were in venetia. The ceiling is painted full of clouds like you were in open air. And in the middle od the mall thereis a mini river that people can take a gondola to circling the river and take picture (paying activity) Food court also available here, full of crowd, not easyto find a table. So many Branded store available here. Once you enter you might get lost to find the way out, because they design it intentionally. You must find a unexpected corridor and going down 2 level floor abd follow the paths. Love it"
Bustling casino ,The casino is very huge at the Venetian. It is always buzzing with allot of people around gambling. The security is strict for not allowing underaged persons into the casino area. A Mecca for gamblers
Gamblers' paradise,"This casino is so huge, its like an ocean of game tables in every direction.. seriously, its a paradise for people who love to gamble at casinos.. Lowest bet size is 50 HKD & highest...... a whooping 2.5 Million HKD!! There are game machines also where you can play for few cents also..Needless to mention, it's the casino which wins at the end.."
One amazing show! ,There is a light show that takes place here from 6-10 every half hour.. Don't miss it!!! It was so spectacular!!
Free Shuttle bus to Venetion ,"Transportation from airports Ferrys , Hotels and Shopping malls connects all travelers to Venetian for free Millions people in and out almost 24 hours, for sigh seeing shopping check in to Hotels or for gambling in Casinos From what I experienced, Venetian is the most crowds in MacauShopping at Grand Cannal, continues to Parisian and City of Dreams are always very excited Branded restaurants for International or Locals or food court always welcome the guest with different types of service depends on your choices"
Behold ‚ÄúThe Las Vegas of Asia‚Äù,"Culturally different, but not culturally diverse is one way to describe Macau. Except for most security detail and a few foreign visitors everyone on the casino-dotted Cotai Strip seems to be Chinese. That‚Äôs not the only difference between Macau and Las Vegas. Casino hopping from the world‚Äôs largest casino, The Venetian Macau, to their version of Vegas‚Äô Paris, The Parisian, something else stands out: No one boozes it up while betting down. The free beverages offered by cart-pushing servers aren‚Äôt beer, well drinks and cocktails, but tea, coffee and juice. A casino security guard was asked about this, and his response, a generalization about Chinese and liquor, would likely sound racist to American ears, so we‚Äôll move on. As for the games, blackjack and poker are barely played among the sea of tables for baccarat, sic bo, mahjong and pai gow. Slot machines have a USB port next to the buttons, and every player seems more focused on his or her smartphone than the spinning simulated reels. Locals, according to another guard, see gambling not as entertainment, but an investment. Hence, the people are eerily stoic. And get this: Smoking is banned on the main gambling. Also unlike Vegas, getting there is by boat. Hour-long ferry rides between Macau and Hong Kong run throughout the day and night."
A must-see on your itinerary,"You should definitely put the place on your Macau list: it is the biggest casino in the world, with gondolas cruising through the canals on one of the floors."
"Casino,great place for gambling and 5 stars hotel.","The hotel are quite big and nice,elegant with 24 hours service,but its costy.However,its perfect for short stay.I'd enjoy the place well."
Good times,"Wonderful Place. Excellent plan. Casinos, shopees.  A luxury hotel and casino resort in Macau owned by the American Las Vegas Sands company. The Venetian is a 39-story,casino hotel on the Cotai Strip in Macau."
Largest casino in Macau? ,Claimed to be the largest casino in Macau and the 2nd largest hotel (no. of rooms) in the world. And they a large shopping option here too.
Huge Casino,"Great place to visit when you first come to Macau. Huge casino will definitely blow you away. But the casino has its age, the machines are kind of old. Not good for true gamblers. Don‚Äôt forget to apply for Sands Member card to play and earn points to redeem all kinds of free gifts."
Irritating bystanders,"Visited it for 2 hours.. Filled with hyenas who hog machines doing nothing but kept asking if you every few minutes whether can you earn points for them, whether you need to change HKD, need girls, need $$$...Irritating to the max! üò©"
Wonderful complex,"We intended to gamble a little here but it was really difficult as i was unsure of the rules and the slot machines were in Chinese, but we did wander through the casino and watched a few gamblers, most of which were Chinese main-landers. The whole complex had Italian style buildings and even St. Marks Square and a lake. Inside was a shopping mall with luxury goods, canals where Filipino gondeliers would take you for a ride on the boats. There was entertainment in the mall in the form of singers and musicians. The reception area of the hotel was indeed luxurious. If you are intending to visit a casino complex i would thoroughly recommend this one. We visited about 6 casino/hotels and this was probably the best, along with Wynns. It is easy to spend a half day here."
Interesting Experience,"I'm used to the casinos in Las Vegas so this casino was much different. Security is incredibly tight and there is even a wall surrounding the casino so you can't see in. Although I am 22, I look much younger so I had to always bring an ID with me just to get inside to go to a restaurant which was a bit annoying but I know that's not on them. If you have children, be warned that you will have to go out of your way to get to some restaurants and shops as you cannot cut through the casino with anyone under 21!!"
Wonderful Human Made Attraction,"Huge Casino Area, Shopping Center, Hotel, Gondola Venesia like romantic sing a song boatmanNice experience"
Only good for quick photo taking and strolling,"Only good for quick photo taking and strollingNothing much to shop or eat here.A bit chaotic, crowded, and rowdy environmentOver-rated place..."
A loser casino!!,"I had visited this casino a few times together with my family, friend and relatives. It got black listed by all of us. No doubt the services in the casino are good, but the rate of winning in slot machines is very low!!! Can you imagine none of us had won before in this casino? Besides Venetian, Parisian is another killer!! So gamblers please take note! I will prefer Wynn, MGM, Grand Lisboa and Studio City for slot games."
Horrible,"Clearly many visitors love endless shops, fancy architecture, kitschy decorations and massive crowds of gamblers. I don‚Äôt, but the place should be visited once, so that you know what hell is like."
Huge,"We were there not to gamble but just to have a look at the largest casino in the world. Huge busy and very Chinese with Western faces at all, not a problem just a fact. Great place to visit and marvel at. Enjoy"
Well it‚Äôs a casino,Standard fare. Huge casino. Catering to all palates. Located on the ground floor centrally within The Venetian Hotel. I found to be just like any other casino.
Overwhelming Crowd,"The crowd was extremely overwhelming. So many people just everywhere. We took a bus there from Ruins of St Paul which cost us MOP6 per person. It‚Äôs around 20mins travelling from there. From Venetian, there is free shuttle bus to ferry terminal. Travelling to ferry terminal takes 30mins and queuing around 10mins. So be there early."
Must visit Casino,"It is the most visited casino in Macau. It is huge and the one can get lost in the crowd. The staff is very friendly. Though i am not into gambling, i enjoyed watching people play and win. The hotel itself is designed very beautifully."
"Wow, wow, wow!",We wanted to visit one casino whilst in Macau and decided on the Venetian. It truly has the wow factor. Having been to Venice a couple of years ago it was incredible to see the recreations of the city both outside and inside the building. Inside the mall the ceiling is painted as the Venice sky and there are actually gondolas with gondoliers on the recreated canals. The casino portion itself seems to take itself very seriously and looks to appeal to serious gamblers. There are a few eateries and restaurants but no drinking in the actual casino portion. A free shuttle bus is available back to the ferry terminal but allow plenty of time as it seemed to take forever.
how to spend money...,simply wanderfull! the hotel looks like a giant shopping mall and at the same time has a unique taste of Italy when you rent a gondola and get around the canals! casino was overcrowded but deserved a visit
Bizarre but also wonderful sight,Macau is becoming steadily more like Las Vegas with every year and the Venetian is actually a much bigger version of the Las Vegas original. Worth a wander around and the sight of gondoliers taking people around Venetian canals is truly bizarre. Definitely worth a visit even though gambling is not my thing.
True Las Vegas of Asia,"Was afraid if they let me in in shorts and t-shirt but there was no problem at all. So many people going in and out, but  you can easily find a place to play many games. I was playing roulette (dont know all the superrules) but staff told me what to do and what to not. Almost everything is covered by gold, nice Italian architecture. If you were not playing here, you were not in Macau!"
Venetian Casino,This was the most mind blowing experience.  Inside is Venice with gondola ride and square with beautiful blue sky and clouds.  It will absolutely stun you.  You will think you have been transported to Italy.  A must see for a casino experience.
"Fantastic, Fabulous!",Just like Venice! Bigger than Vegas and a great place to visit and see the opulence. Loved the shopping and highly recommend the gondola ride.
Beautiful ‚Äúsky‚Äù,"Went there to see the indoor sky & was very impressed with how the lighting & artwork made it look so real. Like most casinos I suppose, it was very very crowded on a Saturday afternoon."
Behold ‚ÄúThe Las Vegas of Asia‚Äù,"The first observation my 22-year-old son and I made when stepping inside the world‚Äôs largest casino was that we were the only white people in the joint. Make that the entire Cotai Strip. Casino hopping from The Venetian Macau to The Parisian to Galaxy Macau, we stood out like MAGA hats in San Francisco. Not that we ever felt unsafe on that busy Friday night. OK, once ‚Äì until we realized this dude was following us not because we walked away with a HK$1,770 jackpot (roughly US$225), but due to us being a novelty combination of white and American among tens of thousands of native Chinese. Something else quite strange was no one was boozing it up inside the casinos. The free beverages offered by cart-pushing servers weren‚Äôt beer, well drinks and cocktails, but tea, coffee and juice. We asked a casino security guard about this, and his response, a generalization about Chinese and liquor, might appear as racist to American readers, so we‚Äôll move on. As for the games, blackjack and poker are barely played among the sea of tables for baccarat, sic bo, mahjong and pai gow. Slot machines have a USB port next to the buttons, and every player we saw was more focused on his or her smartphone than the spinning simulated reels. Locals, we were told, see gambling not as entertainment, but an investment. Hence, the people are eerily stoic. And get this: Smoking is banned on the main gambling, not that I‚Äôm complaining. Also unlike Vegas, getting there is by boat. Hour-long ferry rides between Macau and Hong Kong run throughout the day and night."
Amazing place ,Recently went for a walk and through this casino especially to see the  Grand Canal gondolas and Gondaliers . I wasn‚Äôt disappointed the place is fantastic. Cobbled Streets a Grand Canal and even a St  Marks Place . The buildings/ shops and eateries are built in the Venetian style . In St Marks Square there was a young lady playing a violin I have been to the Venetian in Las Vegas and it is exactly the same
City Attraction,"This hostoric city centre was packed with tourists and we had to jostle our way along. It gets really crowded on the weekends. If you like Sasa, Watsons and the like, this is the place to be."
Trip to Macau ,"Nice casino to walk around, plenty to look at inside with lovely bars and restaurants. Worth having a look at if in Macau."
Large,"The biggest in the world but be prepared if you want to bet at the tables most have a minimum bet of H.K.$500.1000, 2000 to a max of $ 2000000"
Nice shows ,Great shows and huge place. You can just stroll around and just see a lot of games. There's free coffee sometimes.
It's huge!,"The casino floor is huge! It's an experience to be/walk there. A lot of gamblers, most of them play Baccarat. Downside is that poker and roulette buyins/ minimum bets are high. Maybe too high for someone who wants to play for fun. Another downside, there is no bar! The suites where we stayed were very good. Also went to the Venetian at Vegas, it's smaller but more fun."
Nice environment ,Stay here for couple of night and it is our sixth time here and it is as well the best here. If it is your first time then you should try once.
Interesting place with lot of options,"It is a place for casino lovers. All kinds of bets were possible with minimum to high limits. It is always full with people, however some times it becomes very noisy."
Not as good as Vegas ,I wanted to play some Texas hold'em. I ended up waiting 1h before i could take a seat. There was min. 50/100 hkd tables. To big when youre just wanna play for fun. In Vegas there is room for all types of gamblers. In Macau only highrollers.
Awesome. ,"Beautiful casino, amazing surroundings and excellent restaurants. Could not rate this place any higher."
Always worth a wander round,"I‚Äôve visited the Venetian in Las Vegas so wasn‚Äôt sure what to expect. It doesn‚Äôt have the grandeur of Las Vegas (the exterior in Vegas is amazing and it seems much bigger) BUT it was excellently done. The canal shoppes, gondolas etc make the experience really nice. Tonnes of shopping to be done and a great place to wander round."
Vegas in Asia,"Quite a sight to see. There are at least three floors of tables and slots, a shopping arcade. If your doing a day trip from HK , or coming straight from the Macao airport then exploring the city for a few hours before heading to HK, you could store your luggage here for flat  fee."
Amazing place,"Amazing place to meet. Didn‚Äôt went there to play, only to see the place and we love it. It is huge and very well decorated."
Biggest In Town,I am always a Venetian Guy when comes to Casino and seems this is the only place I did make some monies after ll
Chinese Vegas,"Not as good as Vegas, but if all you want to do is gamble then this is the place for you, four or so floors of tables and poker machines"
casino | the Venition Macao,"This casino is grand , you should visit it to experience the grandeur . Minimum bets are high , so you may not like to play many rounds if you loose the first few ."
Amazing place and luxorious casino,"We were a young couple looking for some fun in Macao where we spent only 2 days. The casino is absolutely stunning amd worth visiting, if you don‚Äôt want to play. We are definitely revisiting!"
Luxurious Casino,"This Venetian casino is one of the casinos in Macau. This place is very luxurious and must be visited place in Macau. Apart from casinos, this place also has river canals like in Venice Italy. To reach this place, there is a free shuttle bus from the airport to Venetian."
stands out,"still one of the charming hotels in my list. picturesque views, swanky restaurants and shops are just amazing. it's endless surprise in this city of lights."
Some serious casino business!! ,The place is unlike Vegas where you are there for fun. Here ppl mean serious business. It's extremely beautiful and the decor is wow. The casino experience also a one of a kind. Just beware to check the bids for the slot machine cuz their minimum bids on some of the machines was just too high!! :-P
Great place for shopping,"The Venetian offers a lot of shops, from Swatch to Piaget, from Zara to Gucci. And the Venetian decor is impressive with the canal and the sky ceiling."
A must ,Even if you are not a fan of gambling.. this place is a must.. not only for the casino it has but the shopping experience.. the shops are open till late.. there is a good vide around
Morning visit,Went here in the morning after arriving on the ferry from Hong Kong. Easy to get to from the ferry terminal via a free casino bus. Worth a visit.
A bit of Venice in China,"Caught a ferry from Kowloon to visit Macau which is comfortable and reasonably priced. On arriving you just grab a complimentary bus to the casino of choice in city. The Venetian is a pretty good attempt to create a bit of Italy in Macau.  A recreated Campanile from St Marks Square, copy of the Bridge of Sighs, canals and gondolas and recreated scenes inside are kitch, but far cheaper than visiting Venice!  Taken for what it is, it‚Äôs good fun. Casino itself is what you‚Äôd expect of any casino, lots of machines and tables, over the top decor and plenty of people."
Two days weekend ,"Staying a long weekend for a special occasion. Room is disappointing for the price, poor setting and cheap accessories, smell cigarette although we specified non-smoking, toilet barely cleaned. Not a 5 stars at this stage. Ridiculous and very annoying security staff in the lobbies. If you want to avoid the casino floor, you need to walk twice the distance! Nobody really cares of anything here, not recommended at all."
Interesting Experience,"Casino full of Slot machines and Baccarat tables , so good if that‚Äôs your thing.Lacked the normal vibe and hustle and bustle of Western Casino‚ÄôsVery difficult to obtain an alcoholic drink"
Pretty decor ; Pricey food,"It's not just a casino, but it's a shopping place too. A lot of branded shops waiting for you to shop if you are not a gambler. There is a food court of course, but it's very expensive. The food taste so so only.The casino is big. A lot people in it. Clean and cold. Drinks provided. It's milk tea is  very tasty. I tried it in the HK island and also others casino, but Venice is better than others.For first time visitor, it's worth to visit."
Much Larger than Las Vegas,"This was my third visit to the Macau Venetian Casino.  During each visit, I was amazed by how much larger than it was compared to its twin in Las Vegas as I wandered around.  Outside the piazza was expansive along with the imposing clock tower.  Inside the casino across the multiple gaming areas were were tables and slot machines everywhere.  Since I really wasn‚Äôt here to gamble, I made my way towards the Grand Canal shopping area. I just followed the canal as it snaked its way through the shops and crossed various bridges as restaurants or stores caught my eye.  There were a lot of high end shops as well those ones for souvenirs.  The food court area was pretty busy with a bunch of different food types and reasonable prices which explained the popularity with lots of families eating here.While I passed a number of gondola boarding docks there was no one lined up for rides as it was still early.  It seemed like the gondoliers were practicing their rowing under supervision or in one case singing.  There were a lot of photo ops here with the gondolas, canal, the painted, simulated sky and nicely designed building facades as the background.  I just had to weave around, duck under or wait until the photographer completed their shot.  Having been here at various times of the day, I recommend coming in the morning before the stores open if you want to get some photos without crowds of people.  Once you are done touring here, there were more surrounding casinos (City of Dreams, Studio City, etc) to visit or just take the free shuttle bus to the sister casino Sands.  From there you can visit the other attractions of Macau.  If this was your last stop visiting Macau then you can take the free shuttle busses to either the Taipa and Macau ferry terminals for the trip back to Hong Kong.  There were more ferries scheduled from Macau terminal, if you want more flexibility in your plans, but the Taipa terminal was the closest to Cotai."
Interesting to see for one or two reasons,"not a fan of these kinds of places, but still it is interesting to see what attracts so many people to throw their money at... not meaning only the casino, but the whole public part of the place - the shopping areas, replicas of Venice above all. The technology and design are used with great skill and efficiency, I admit, so you do not need to use your imagination intensivelly to be immersed into the virtual Venice. But after an hour or so, I was quite happy to escape the artificial replica, and spent the evening recovering in still a bit authentic Taipa village ;)"
Internal Gondola,We joined a tour group and was taken to the venetian. The hotel was very busy and many tourist. Appears to be a drop-off point. The gondola ride looks interesting although it is a short ride. Personally i dont find it a value for money but have seen people queuing for this.The interior decor is amasing. Lots of shops around if you are not a gambler. Good for a visit.
Macau trip,Loved it! It felt like we were really in Italy. Although it was a bit crowded. But we still enjoyed. The place is clean and well maintained which I liked because some place similar to this don't maintian theirs really well
Great hotel,"Being from Vegas, the Macau Venetian is identical as the one in Vegas except that it is on steroids! Huge property with all the amenities needed to enjoy a night out. Tins of walking! Rooms are large and quiet"
Best Casino in Macau,"Macau it is a strange place, as the only thing that it is nice are the hotels and casinos, plus shopping.We love everything about it.Specially the shopping options and the gondola canal with the shops around it.Worthy the visit. Next time not only day visit"
Best,"One of the best casinos I've been to in my life. So big and so many games to play, I lost a lot of money but that's the story of my life üòã."
Will kill a bit of time ,"One of those places  that people go to just to say they have been. Very busy, very artificial and not really my cup of tea. Lots of people around. If I was staying here as a guest I think I would become very frustrated. Didn‚Äôt do the gondola ride, but it costs $180HKD ($33 AUD) per person for a short ride. While walking around I did enjoy listening one of the guides singing to his passengers. Been there once wouldn‚Äôt go back. Free shuttle bus from west wing back to the Macau terminal is a big plus"
Sexist Indian security Mr Roshan,This hotel is over rated in terms of class and service. I was rudely refused entry in to the casinos over the pretext I didn‚Äôt look 21. I am 40 years old (nowhere close to 21) and had valid electronic passport ID which Mr.Roshan (security to casinos) refused to accept. These guys are jokers and need training on service and hospitality as they seem to be on some sort of power trip. In fact he even went to the extent of informing other security personnel to not let me in which was uncalled for and insulting. My husband and I chose to visit the other casinos where we had a great experience.  MGM is a far better place to stay and play. Avoid the Venetian at any cost. I am glad I did.
Too busy,"We had high expectations but it was soo busy, just another casino with lots of shops but in a nice Italian style."
A must visit!,"Amazing architecure in Macau, interior design is astonishing too! The minimum bet was lesser as compared to Wynn's."
#1 Bucket List in Macau,Last destination of our educational tour to end. This place is really amazing! would definitely visit here again.
Venice at the heart of Orient,"Spectacular hotel, casino, themed activities, dressed up service, amazing restaurant, venetian style outfits, beautiful plazas, amazing ice cream flavours, incredible food halls and more.Surreal place to stay very similar to the Las Vegas venue."
Las Vegas Of The East,"This by far is the most popular casino judging by the number of people around. Ample amount of tables, machines and slots. However if you are coming with friends, stick close to each other or you could get lost because the floor area is huge."
Amazing experience,We arrived here from HK at approx 7pm after leaving our hotel in HK at 430pm.One regret we have is that we should of left earlier as we were unaware of the sheer vastness of the casinos. The casino is very grand and vast. You need a personal tour guide if that‚Äôs even a thing otherwise you end up going round in circles. The casino itself is beautiful and just wish we had more time to explore it.The only negative I have is that it being a 24hour casino then I feel the shops should be open slightly later.
The Effiel tower looks lovely lit up at night,"The tower looks wonderful at night. Whilst its about half the size of the actual one its a nice spend of a few hours. The hotel itself is very good and has shops, casino etc and no more different on the inside then the rest along the strip."
"Cheesy and full, but good fun","We always almost go to the Canal Shoppes upstairs in the Venetian when we are in Macau. Even on a weekday it was very busy, but so large and over the top it is always entertaining. And our little one absolutely loved the gondola ride."
Drinks,On a day trip to Macau we tried to fit in as much as we could and see as many casinos as we could.  We had a drink in each one to rate them  The staff are great here and the hotel is superb
Amazing,What a beautiful hotel. The shops are amazing with a ‚Äúlittle Venice‚Äù through it with gondolas. The decor was beautiful and the casino absolutely huge!
Such a Big Place,"For the passionated for gambling cannot get it wrong. evrything is available , slots, tables, private rooms, glamour , only in one roof"
Venetian Casino Macau,"Probably the biggest casino floor you will ever see ........ and it is usually humming with activity, especially the Baccarat tables, which are the most popular in this region."
Not all that impressed,"While the architecture was exactly the kind of opulence I expect from a themed casino, the gaming experience left me rather cold.  Almost the entire gaming floor was occupied with Baccarat and Sic-Bo tables.  When I found games of a more Western conventional nature, they were $80-100 minimum per hand.  Really ended up being not worth my time."
"Big, loud and expensive","It is what it is.  The table limits are way too high, but the variety of machines can‚Äôt be faulted.  I still have not got my head around why casinos in Macau don‚Äôt use the local currency, aside from the fact that they are making money off currency exchange.  It does seem odd to me, but hey, I only visit once every decade, so no biggie.Definitely worth one visit, but that should be enough."
Big Vegas style casino in Macau,"Very big. Very busy. When I was there looked like half the poker machines were being replaced - but there were still plenty of free ones.It looked like free drinks (just small water bottles) were being handed out, but no one came near me - won't dwell on why that was."
A tacky but different experience,It is worth a brief visit to casinos to get a feel of the atmosphere and activity that goes on inside a glamorous building.  The second floor of the building contains a replica of a Venetian canal complete with gondolas.
Famous for it's clear blue skies always,"This one can be considered as the best casino of Macao. Grand and beautiful building with lots to see and those who love gambling, it's a paradise for them. We went there as a part of our day tour to Macao and really found it a must visit place. You can see clear blue sky in this casino, no matter what is the weather outside. It is a man made surprise which is really beautiful in every way. This reminds of the Venetian casino of Las Vegas, almost similar in every way. RIghtly said- Macao is the Las Vegas of the East. Must visit place when in Macao."
All casinos are the same,I was in hotel sheraton my self but you can enter any of the casinoes cuz most of the hotel lobbies are attached together .ether by bridge or passajes. Venetian hotel is a very pretty place. But the casinoes are the same in all of them hotels. Same games same tables..all of them are full of gamblers spesially in weekends. The only speciallity about this place was that I watched the world cup finals between france and crovasia 2018 there cus our own hotel didn.t have a free place to watch the games and I lost some money on the
My lucky casino ,This is my lucky casino my luck shine there I love coming here this was second time I came here üëçüëç
Amazing,"We had never been in such a big casino and we were amazed by the whole environment. Shops, restaurants, canals with gondolas! Everything was surprising. Don't miss the free shuttles to get here and to go out"
Italy in the heart of Asia,"My first time to visit a place as grand as this, imagine a building with its own sky and a place in Asia where all settings are from Italy? Then this is the spot! I love everything about the place, the smell, the ambiance, the surroundings etc.!"
A little venice is here,A really big hotel with so many attraction.They have little venice inside the hotel.We can take a gondola (boat) and portuguese people will sing their song in their language. So we can feel the venice situation. Many shops here we can shopping. Also starbucks for relax. And welcome to the most big casino in macau
Good casino but... ,"I been there with my young kids, overall all are good for me but I don't like the security guard in front of casino disturbing my kids. Thanks"
Amazing Place,"An excellent and superb resort offering accommodation, high end shopping in numerous malls, entertainment and of course several casinos. If you decide to visit allow yourself extra time to take in all the different features throughout the total complex. They offer a free courtesy bus from the Macau ferry terminal with return when needed. The ""indoor/outdoor"" sections with the canals and gondolas are excellent and of course the casinos are there if you need a bet - operating 24/7 and always full !!!!!  From the brochure/map they provide it appears there are four different casinos in the overall Venetian complex PLUS the High Roller sections  !!!!"
The Lions' Den,"It is another place where you will give 5 points if you win in the casino, 0 if you lose. Just an ordinary casino"
Amazed,Just pass through to see all the actions.. This one of the biggest casino I seen.. Lots of tables and tables limit is a bit high for my pocket
Fake Venice - fancy mall,"Most fancy shopping center. So Venice looking like, but so fake. Reminded more some Disney Studios than Venice.The disadvantages: - looked for Italian ice-cream, but could not find;- bought Tiger beer and discovered that even the cup is a fake (see the pic)."
Shopping and entertainment all in one place.,"If you want to try your luck at the casino while your other friends are shopping, this is the hotel to stay.  And for a more romantic experience you can try the gondola rides at the Venetian Macau ."
Must see,"Opulence plus , eye boggling , the most amazing place . Can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs so beautiful and just shows the money that has been spent , makes our Melbourne crown casino look like a common shed !! The paintings on the ceiling and walls are beautiful , the floors are impressive and the whole place just oozes money . Wait till you go into the shopping area with the canals and gondolas it‚Äôs eye smacking . Never seen anything like it ever . Just go for a look ."
The best in Macao,Casino in Venetian is the best in Macao in terms of experience. You would find most of the crowd here and more no. of tables for all sorts of games.
Average experience ,It was an average experience for some reason my wife 27 years old was never allowed to enter until she presented her passport...sometimes if we just wanted to pass by or would leave the passport in the room they would just not let her enter we did not face this issue at any other casino in macau.
Posh,"First class. Must go. Must see. Shopping, dining, leisure tour. We enjoyed the walk with a feel of Venetia."
So fun and clean!,We sent a few hours here having a great time.  The tables were quite busy so we chose the electronic tables which we could program to English.  It was co clean and staff were very helpful and friendly.
Big casino with variety,"Went on 21/6 Thur with my husband. Like it that it was spacious, not too crowded and non smoking. However, the membership and points are not very attrative. Points with limited uses. Much prefer Galaxy casino's membership card which gets you discount at most of the retail shops."
At a Grande,"Visited here with my family and auntie, this is very memorable moment to which it happens to encounter such cold and beautiful venetian."
Huge,I suppose its the worlds biggest casino . If not must be asia s biggest . They have free shuttles to ferry people from the Ferry terminal to and fro at regular intervals as well .
Great visit,The Venetian is my favourite in Macau. Boasts of one of the largest casinos in Macau. Great atmosphere and fun to play.
Better than las Vegas,Free entryIt's almost like Dubai mall in an ancient worldThe construction of Venice with waterways and canoes on a smaller scale is almost realisticThe artificial sky makes u wonder how they did it!!!
Nice,They have many casinos in the venetian and if you stand at one place and look around you can only see casino slot machines etc its that big. Its an experience in itself.
Fantastic hotel with huge casino,"The place is out of the world, rooms are out of this world. Each and every things makes your jaws drop...food and the staff everything is just perfect."
oh my venetian...,"we were there just because it was there for sightseeing. it was part of the tour. but since my son is stilla minor, we automatically could not enter the casino. we just contented ourselves taking photographs while looking at the outstanding interior of the mall and be amazed by the replica of the mini-venice inside. there was a gondola alright, but we did not witness anyone taking the boatride."
Fantastic Place to visit,"Huge casino and hotel complexVarious Canals with gondolas resembling Venice inside is a must seeGrand Casino offering stunning Italian designsGreat place for gambling, shopping and sight seeing"
Venice in Macau !!!,"While I am not interested in gambling the incredible architecture and the fact that you can enjoy being in ""Venice"" for a day while in Macau makes a visit very worthwhile. The massive shopping complex ( with more mid priced shops ) in the architectural guise of St Marks Square with its bridges and gondala rides ( long ques )  makes for an enjoyable few hours before you visit one of the other impressive casino complexes.The free shuttles to all casinos  from the Macau Ferry terminal makes transportation very safe and reliable. There are always staff on hand to provide any information you seek however their understanding of English can be limited at times."
Big night,"Dealers are friendly, easy access of cashier's..food and beverage were always approachable and drinks quality are very good.."
Very huge,It‚Äôs good experience.. many table / many games / many people.. Really enjoyed.. you should try for once..
Day trip,Macau is a stunning city with some amazing casinos numbering 40 in total. This is a similar version to the famous Las Vegas casino and you will not be disappointed by the beautiful interior and impressive building. Definitely would recommend a visit to the casino or to the large shopping mall above it.
Majestic building,We went here just to visit the gondola inside was amazing just like really in Italy with environment inside we dint manage to go into the casino because there is children beside but the view is really amazing with the singing when riding on the gondola.
3rd time visit,"It was very crowded on weekend with all tour buses coming in. Casino is still the same, minimum bet range from 1K onwards."
Good Casino,Visited Casino during my stay....did not go to gamble...but to have a view of how many people were coming and going each time..Too many people come to visit Macau just for casino...and tourist come to Ventian just to have a look at the Ventian Casino.
Casino at Venetian macau,Wonderful n big place n this is my 3 third to go Macau n visit again n lot of foods but expensive brands at shop n can't afford buy it
Fabulous without gambling ,We simply enjoyed walking around. We found a huge food court and a Chang beer the food was great. The atrium main hall is beautiful along with the river flowing through the building complete with boats and singers serenading the folks. Lots to see and do without gambling.
Amazing,"Going to macau by ferry from Hkg. Getting here by free shuttle bus from venetian hotel.Good views, lots of luxury shops, indoor theme, instagramble. Don't forget to try venetian gondola"
Huge!,"This place is enormous. Got lost so many times haha. Still, never before have I spent so many hours at a shopping mall / casino without even entering any shops or spending any money. The canals and facades look stunning. Definitely worth a visit!"
Familiar,Similar look and feel to Venetian Las Vegas. Main difference is that this was a lot more crowed.  The shopping was excellent and affordable for everyone.
Large & Bustling,Larger than its USA sister I still managed to get lost 3 times in the one day.  Worth another visit & manged to keep my money & stay out of the high end shops.
A mega-affair,"This is the place to be for the thrill and excitement of venturing into the unknown, at a price. Must visit for the experience of a lifetime. For us, it was a pleasure being there, with beginner's luck helping us win some money as well."
Nice,It was so fun to be around this area I felt like I was in Las Vegas the only thing that bothered me is that to play blackjack they only dealt with the machines in every hotel
Just try your Luck,"A superb casino.Very well managed and educated and courteous staff. Do try your luck. A must visit, to this place."
Shoppers paradise,Amazing resort. Beautiful gondolas. Shops galore. Big food court. Had a lovely visit.Spent a good few hours shopping into the night.
2 days trip ,"Wonderful scenery. You can go to the Venetian Cotai via free bus ride from Sano Casino in Macau. If using taxi might have additional charges. Manage and enjoy so much with the Gondola Ride $128MOP. Great performance by every artist. Feel like in Italy. Love all the shopping complex‚Äôs.  Located nearby Dream City, Parisian and Galaxy Macau. Must see attraction and it was amazing wonderful experience - From Brunei-ian"
"Outstanding architecture, so many details.","It is like being in the Venetian in Las Vegas. Many, many luxury brand stores and various places to eat. Not many bars thou. An excellent experience in Macau strip."
"Well, Good",Good place if you have quite a lot of money to spend. Played lot on slot machines. Tables were expensive and minimum budget was $25 and only 2 tables were available in that budget. Rest of them were $100 and more. Try your luck at casino
Gigantic Casino,"The Venetian Macau casino is gigantic. The decor is quite plush and it looks really grand. You will find all kinds of gambling stations here, mostly packed with Chinese tourists and quite a lot of  foreigners."
Just like Venice,Feel the ambiance just like in Venice. We win a lot just by strolling and taking pictures cause we do not intend to win in the lotteries and all the gambling stuffs.
Various shops in fantastic atmosphere ,"The hotel is beautiful. The room is very fantasy with The Galaxy view at night. The shops is more affordable than other hotel around. The also-variety of goods. Anyway, it‚Äôs too crowded on weekends."
ill mannered Casino staff,"The Casino at Venetian is very huge, have multiple tables and so many different games can be played. I tried my hand at a roulette table and didn't have a good experience. The woman dealer was very ill mannered and very aggressive. If you don't know how to play, my suggestion is just watch few rounds cause here the casino  dealers don't know English and are not willing to help anyone or even be polite to you. I then played at the digital tables where you can play without interacting with dealers and have some fun. There are other Casinos like at Four seasons, where the staff is much more helpful."
Fantastic - glitzy - over the top,We don‚Äôt gamble - but this doesn‚Äôt stop anyone from visiting the casinos of Macau. They are fantastic to simply wander through and take in all of the ‚Äòglitz and glamour‚Äô. The ‚Äòcanal‚Äô is very cool and the various eateries are great. Worth the visit.
Great place!!,Although we did not get inside the casino as we were with our 9 year but still had lot to see. The way the market place has been done up is really beautiful and gives a touch of Venice.
"One rude table ""supervisor""","Normally i would give the Venetian casino a higher rating due to its being the biggest casino in Macau. However, over the years, the quality seems to have deteriorated and cost-saving measures are now evident. Bottled water used to be readily available and on display for all guests to enjoy. But now only the guests playing at the tables have water at their disposal. Other guests have to scramble to find bottled water. On one such occasion, I approached one table (no playing guests but just the dealer and a ""supervisor"" present) to attempt to get a bottle of water. I was not aware that i had entered a ""no-entry"" zone between 2 tables. Before I knew it, the ""supervisor"" (not sure of her position but she was standing between 2 tables, as if ""supervising"" the dealers) shouted at me rudely and loudly that I am not allowed to enter the area. Realizing my mistake and  embarrassed by her reaction, I explained that I merely wanted to get a bottle of water from the table. Instead of just handing me the bottle of water, she again spoke rudely and said that i should move over to the other side to get the water.I admit that I had made a mistake but her attitude and the way she spoke to me, a guest, is extremely rude and impolite. She could have explained the situation politely to me and I would have understood but she had to shout loudly and harshly.I recommend that further training should be given by Venetian to its staff inside the casino to make them understand the concept of customer service and delight. Water should also be made readily available to all guests, not hidden and given only to favored guests. What should have been an enjoyable visit was ruined by one rude staff."
First casino in my life,My friends really wanna try casino so we booked to stay in Venetian Macao. The place is very large. Decoration is elegant and fabulous. Lots of people there. We tried some games. Lucky we lost nothing.
One Stop Hotel,"Venetia Hotel is the busiest hotel.. so so so many visitors make it a point to see this place.. the beauriful Italian scenery is the main tourist attraction.. Shots are taken at all points.. You have a choice of  fast food and fine dining restaurants . Shops, shops, more shops .... a shoppers paradiseCasino try ur luck and u may win ur next trip to Macau"
Lost,This place is really huge. You have to really note where you came from and where you are going if it is your first trip. The suite rooms are monster sizes and can be really comfortable. However the prices of the food sold at the food court is restaurant price in other parts of the world. 4 packs of hawker food takes away could cost you about USD50 to 60 bucks
Largest Casino,It‚Äôs the Largest Casino in the World. And I don‚Äôt want to missed it. They‚Äôre so busy. We spent couple of hours just for Fun‚ò∫Ô∏èüòç.
Venetian Macao casino,"i stayed at sheraton macau , but i suggest not to miss the chance to visit Venetian Macau, who loves to play casino & try your luck at best . also not to forget visiting canal on upper level of hotel ."
ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS PLACE!!,"The casino was busy beyond belief!!  It is just a cool place to visit, great restaurants and shopping is so much better here than Las Vegas!  It is vegas on steroids !!!  Enjoyed the visit and a must to see!!"
Good Casino,We spent a couple of hours here and enjoyed the experience. It was mid afternoon with hardly any people so a bit dull but overall a good place and atmosphere.
One of the largest in world,"Amazing experience to have a feel of one of the biggest casino in world. Mesmerizing experience with lot of activities. Music, fun and energy."
HUGE CASINO,Maybe on the biggest casinos in Macau and apparently very busy at most times. Also you can have a gabling break and go the Venetian mall.
Casino at Venetian,This was one of the biggest casino in Macao city and full of visiters and tourist in the city. Nice to see dirrent options for playing in casino.
No money,Quite interesting venue even when we are not gamblers. Interesting to watch the hordes of mainland nationals burn their money like they're on a mission. The associated mall and architecture is very nicely done. Not been to Vegas Venetian but understand very comparable in 'no expense spared'
Impressive,"The Venetian is just an impressive building, with the artificial canal and entire Venice setting. Overall it was very crowded, but that's what a casino is normally for. For having fun, gambling and shopping at exclusive stores."
Busy Casino,Too many tourist and noisy casino. Had a wide range of tables with low wager bet but not advisable for discrete players.
Must Visit while in Macau,"The tours to the Venetian in Macau, is more like the pilgrimage to Mecca. This place is a team park by it self and you can spend the whole day and not see everything, what a great selection of stores, it is a shopping Mecca for sure."
WOW ,What a place. Went there not to gamble but to check out the gondola and lighting on roof. This place is amazing and breathtaking. You really felt like you were in Venice. If you go to Macau please don‚Äôt leave this place out to see as when you see it you will never forget it
BIRTHDAY Luck,The casino is big and clean. Magestic interior. And I won a few Dollars for my Birthday. A must try for luck and entertainment
Crazy Fun,"If you like casinos, i dont need to say more, this place is crazy fun, try your luck and see if you win, its full of people and excitement."
Crazy busy,"It‚Äôs a small version of Venetian in Las Vegas, but the vibe is the same or greater. However, the gambling world is a serious one comparing to Las Vegas. Huge amount of money is flying into the casino, hardly paying out. LOL That‚Äôs the way it goes! We were told by our guide that all casinos in Macau rely heavily on feng cheuy, a superstitious believe, which works well for their businesses. Total revenue in Macau in much higher than Las Vegas by at least 1000%, believe it or not. As for myself, shopping and enjoying time here is more than enough."
Excellent! Excellent! 10/10,"Excellent! Excellent! Venetian Macau 10/10. Amazingly stunning to see this beautiful casino, shops, interior and exterior of this Venetian Macau.  Great casino, shoppings and foods. 110% highly recommend this 'MUST SEE' Venetian Macau!"
Another hotel amazed me no need to go Las Vegas ,This is Las Vegas in Asia I dine I shop I play I sleep hahaüòÇhas wonderful stay this place too very luxurious hotel in town of Macau everything is here and I miss Las Vegas the paintings is really like I‚Äôm in Las Vegas again üòä wonderful place to shop I stayed 3 days here and I really love there bus üöå service where take is to ferry ‚õ¥ boat ride to go hongkong jet turbo ride was quick
Amazing structure,I was there with a friend during my stopover in Honk Kong. IT was impressive how Macao Venetian is simulating Las Vegas ones and how they reproduced the real Venetia inside the huge building
Wow!,Truly an insane thing too see! Beautiful and always helps when you leave with more than you had :) Very easy to navigate around and you can see for miles!
big casino,was a huge casino. staff dont speak english at all. when we asked them to explain the game they couldnt. so if u r new then u have to use your brains to understand n play the game.
