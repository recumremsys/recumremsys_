Happening place,"This is one of the most happening place in Gurugram. The crowd is awsome, The music is good. Lot of food options here. Good place to hang out with friends."
Over Hyped,Its an attempt at imitating the western atmosphere and they seem to have done a better job of it then in the west. But that is it. If you have not booked in advance be prepared to wait it out and then be prepared to empty your wallets. A meal for two with some good malt or lager can easily offset you by 12K+. In return you dont get anything as far as memories is concerned. Avoid driving there as parking can be a nightmare and another ripoff. Its a great place to go to if you are on the companies account and entertaining some folks to rip them off through your company subsequently.....lol....Jokes apart Gurgaon or Gurugram has awesome outstanding places to go to in half the price and value for money. Where food is lip-smacking drinks out of the world and they dont rip your pocket apart.
Very nice shopping n recreation place,"Very nice shopping n recreation place for all age groups. Good food, movies, kids entertainment and hopping off course."

It is well suited to all kind of crowds as it offers almost all kind of food outlets.
The happening HUB !,Cyber Hub is undoubtably the most happening place in our very own millennium city . The vibe is always so positive and energetic.

A good place for meeting up with friends and celebrating with family,"Cyber hub is designed well as its got a nice promenade with good options of eateries, pubs and cafes to enjoy."
Music with darkness,This inside sitting area is completely the behaviour of the staff was very casual and unprofessional the food was ggod but the portion size was very small. Must work on the sitting plan and staff behaviour
Great place to hangout,"Considering the level of pollution now a days in Delhi NCR, not sure if the people would be interested in an open place with some truly worth going restaurants, but in good weather, this is one of the coolest places to be in Gurgaon.

Nice place to Explore.,"Cyber Hub, with its plethora of  branches of well known restaurants is an interesting place to visit on a ny casual evening, preferably at the week end. Although the number of visiting this place come under the category of 'Work Hard, Party Harder'"", yet this place has some charm. one also gets to try out different cuisine in various restaurants spread out. From Punjabi to Bengali to Italian and hybrid -all kinds of food is available in the Cyber Hub. It is good place to hangout with family and friends and enjoy a good meal. Some places are too noisy like Social. But there are sombre places also. Since it is situated in the heart of Gurgaon, lot of people visit the Hub. I think one must visit cyber hub as many times a s possible to have a tatse of different cuisine provided s/he is a foody."
Lively Place,Lively place to chill out especially in the evenings.  Lovely restaurants & pubs. Very close to rapid metro station.
Monsoon masti @ cyberhub,"Great place to hangout with friends... enjoyed the cafes, the desserts n coffee in beautiful rains... it makes cyberhub even more enjoyable ."
Overpriced,Is strategically built and has good food options but usually everything is overpriced and every 4th person is drunk and is misbehaving with someome. Would not recommend to go at night as commuting is difficult and the crowd is bad to go with the family. At day time is very pleasant and one can enjoy the structure and the food quietly.
Under no roof,Great places to dine out and drink too. Quite a lot of options actually. From cheap eateries to cafes to fine dine options.
Great vibe !,Great vibe to the place n lots of options for drinking n dining out. It’s bit romantic as well ! I’d advise getting there a bit early if you are eying weekends.
Best hangout,"keep going there many times, best place to hangout, many places to eat , drink, dance and whatever you wish to do"

We enjoyed the food and the place.
Must visit place,"It's one of the happening place which is beautifully designed and maintained.

Cyber hub,Visited cyber hub area a few times and found it very interesting with a mix of restaurants and bars it had a great vib going on and very cosmopolitan. Recommend a visit
Cyber hub,I've been travelling to Gurgaon for 7 years and have seen the Cyber hub built up from a dusty baron area to what it is today. Its a great place to go in the evenings or for lunch in its many and varied restaurant's. It exactly what Cyber city needed. It has a mixture or Indian and western type bars offering local and imported beers plus a micro brewery. So if your business takes you to Gurgaon and Cyber city make sure to pay an early visit to the Cyber Hub.
Fantastic place,DLF CYBER HUB is one of the most amazing places to eat and relax and have fun with your friends and family
Out of Office,A place made to cater to the offices in the first stage is now a full-fledged space of some of the best restaurants in the town. Say of Pra Pra to dhaba to HRC.This place is a mandatory place for a visit if around.
Paradise for Food Lovers,I visit Cyber hub regularly - As this walking distance from my place of work. I find the various multi cuisines and offer they have simply delightful.  This is the most happening place iin gurgaon and trust me very safe.
Nice place to hang out,We keep visiting Cyber Hub mainly for food and the ambiance.The range of food available here is awsome- you get almost all cuisines. Very good ambiance- especially in autumn and winter.
A lovely evening place,I tried a few eateries here and all were great. The place is ideal in this stifling heat as all restaurants are close together so you don't need to wall to much. There's a good nightlife vibe too. It's very clean.  My fav eatery is Delhi Heights Cafe.
Foodie's Delight,"A very well planned venue of multiple food joints with a variety of cuisines to choose from, and the choicest of Hangout joints too... alongwith stand-up comedy joints."
Fun places good vibes,"Good atmosphere, good vibes,pleasant n family friendly .. had a good eve here.. just roaming around.."
Good luxurious place,Its a place to impress your clients and guests. Took them for an afternoon lunch here.Only downside is high cost of place.
Excellent to explore as a food buff or for crafted beer,"I visited for an evening on our marriage anniversary and liked it so well and good that we took our children back because the entire hub is for food buffs. My daughter enjoyed her Japanese Sushi and we went for the beer.On the whole, it was an excellent experience"
"If you are taken there blind folded and you open your eyes, your first impression may be you are walking in Times Square","This is so unique a place that may be Gurgaon can be identified through this location in world map. It is the most happening place for young crowd and also equally comforting to all ages. As I told you will feel like walking through Times Square in New York or Champs-Élysées, Paris....almost. The only difference is this is not a fashion street but a large food court. Instead of small stalls, there are restaurants of all taste, size and shape with unlimited sitting capacity (all together).The only catch is that food is as costly as fine dining, didn’t share my bill to avoid discouraging you. But you should come and enjoy once before making up your mind.We had Chinese food followed by wonderful waffles (small side stall). We sat at the centre court, watching India playing World Cup cricket in giant screen.We left around 12 midnight and it was perfectly safe for our family.Must visit if you have stepped in Gurgaon, if not for the food but for the lights and mood....it is contagious."

Happening...,"At the first glance it appears to be like a part of a foreign city, architecture, cleanliness, culture, choices of pubs, bar/lounges and restaurants offerinf all tyoes of cuisines. It also has a sprinkling of some showrooms and shops like Modern Bazaar, Samsung/ JBL etc, Has a central amphitheater which is jam packed in case of a band performing or Sports matches on a huge telly.You can opt for stand up comedians shows or even sports Smash. 1st floor has the best pubs , dance bars etc. Off late you have typical crowd which has come just to ogle so be ready to be jostled around a bit, Best time to visit is evenings. Sunday brunches are class but a bit on the expensive side."
