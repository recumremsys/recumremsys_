Covid police mad,Lesson covid and more about the house.My husband shifted his weight from one foot to other and wow covid police came out.By the way this was my husbands birthday treat you shot yourself in the foot not worth the money.The reception at the Shakespeare hotel said not the first they heard this complaint. They have signs about keeping 2 meters apart but kept everyone at 6 meters apart not goverment guideline.If you think you need keep 6 meters apart dont open.
Birthday visit,Drove up to see Stratford for my birthday but booked tickets for Shakespeare’s birth place before we left. If you’re into Shakespeare it’s a must see but well worth a visit even if you’re not. Probably takes between a half hour and an hour depending on how much you want to read and talk to the knowledgeable staff.
Get your cultural fix,Husband and I visited for his birthday 09/10/2020. All covid precautions in place. Staff very friendly and informative. Learnt a lot about our language as well as about Shakespeare himself. Seeing his cot was a delight. Was well worth a visit
Definitely worth a visit ,On a rainy day during Corona times we were lucky to be the only visitors. The staff was very friendly and happy to tell not only informative but also fun facts about the house and the times when Shakespeare lived in the house.
Enjoyable,"The tour was enjoyable, and you can take your time with fewer visitors allowed in at once. It only takes about half an hour to do the tour. The staff were really knowledgeable and interesting."
Shakespeare’s Birthplace,Very interesting trip! Learnt a lot about Shakespeares early life and the guides were very informative. If you’re in the area definitely worth a visit!
Very interesting,"The property is beautiful, very well preserved with original period items of furniture to give you a flavour of what it was like in Shakespeare’s time.  There were guides in the principal rooms who gave very knowledgeable information as well being able to download info on your smartphone."
Great Covid measures,"Great Covid restrictions in place. Windows of house were open and rooms were well ventilated. Lots of plexiglass barriers when interacting with (really friendly) staff, and precise measures taken to keep distance between guests. I would have liked a little bit more information as the house is very small and the tour is over quickly but otherwise great."
Weekend away,Lovely trip back in time with staff who gave you an insight into the life and timesReasonable in price
Lovely house!,A well-laid out museum and a must see for any Shakespeare fans. House is lovely and staff are keen to give you interesting facts about the house.
Great time had by all.  Very good Covid19 regulations in place.,"They have set up the viewing very well in line with Covid19 regulations.  You can only book online, at least then you are guaranteed entry.  Shakespeare house was amazing, just like stepping back in time.  Very informative, and interesting day."
Well done to the staff,"Managed to maintain anti covid measures But stillMade it a memorable experience.  The staff were fantastic and really made it easy for everyone.  It was a real privilege to be able to go back in history.  A trip to Stratford-upon-Avon is notcomplete without a visit.  Have to pre-book, but that is easy to do and timings spot on. Well done to everyone in these trying times."
Enjoyable,"Due to covid restrictions, it meant we had a leisurely look round the house without it being packed with tourists. Good info on Shakespeares life."
What an absolute delight ,I recently visited with my partner and from the start it was absolutely lovely . The member of staff who chatted with us in the queue whilst we were waiting was an absolute delight and the tour itself was fantastic . A particular highlight would be coming into the garden for the first time because it is just simply gorgeous . An absolute must do even if you don’t see yourself as a massive fan of Shakespeare’s works ( like myself )
a nice little visit,"This was lovely to see, the staff were very knowledgeable and the gardens were beautiful, just a shame with the covid thing that we didn't get enjoy them as we probably normally could."
Great introduction to Shakespeare’s life and works,Beautiful gardens and some original structures... gives a great insight into Shakespeare’s early life.
Shakespeare's Birthplace,"Set in the middle of the town the building is fantastic, great views can be had allowing photography at no expense"
Disappointing ,"Obviously visiting during a pandemic, things aren’t going to be the same in regards to how much is accessible etc. But even so, I was disappointed with how much content we got to see. Aside from a few titbits of information written on some of the walls, I was hoping for some really informative talks but there was nothing. The whole tour was over in about 25 mins. Sure you get to see William’s old house but I was hoping to hear tales of his early life etc. The only one member of staff that bothered to say anything was the one in the bedroom where he was happy to talk about Shakespeare’s early life as a baby. Certain rooms were roped off with no explanation given. I was hoping for a much more interactive experience but it wasn’t to be. I would have liked to see some other areas of interest, such as Anne Hathaway’s Cottage or Mary Arden’s Farm but they are still closed due to covid, but to be honest, if they are as lacklustre as this tour then maybe we aren’t missing too much..."
Still as gripping as the first visit!,"Fantastic experience. Well present information and the guides speaking to you in the rooms, providing a valuable insight into life in Shakespeare’s birthplace and how his family life began. Second visit but with family this time and still well worth the visit."
The birthplace of Shakespeare,"We were taken aback with this historian house which we really enjoyed.   The tour was very interesting with the guides who were knowledgeable and really passionate.  I thought they could have staggered the queue as felt a bit rushed at the beginning of the tour.  Shakespeare birthplace is definitely worth a visit.  We took a walk to Anne Hathaway""s cottage to view the outside even though it was closed."
Read about it online.,Waste of money.Very little time allowed to look at the rooms. A steward in each room to talk you through and move you along. No time to linger.We did the whole thing in 35 minutes.Forget this place.
Would give it a miss in 2020,"We have visited Shakespeare's Birthplace several times and it has always been great previously - that's an important caveat as it is usually an excellent place to visit. Unfortunately though the measures put in place this year have made things really difficult.We had to book tickets for a specific timeslot in advance, which was totally fine and expected. However, while we'd normally be able to buy a ticket covering all 5 Shakespeare properties for a whole year for around £26 each, this time we paid £13 each for just this one visit to this one property. But we thought OK, we appreciate they do need to make money since they are keeping all the other properties closed for the minute, so we paid it.Unfortunately the visit itself wasn't great, and I was surprised since we have been to several other attractions with Covid restrictions in place and this was by far the most onerous, to the point where the visit wasn't worth it or enjoyable really at all.Despite everyone wearing masks, staff members would not allow visitors to pass by each other, so even if you enter a room where the staff member is in the middle of explaining something to another party, you just have to wait there until the people in front move on. So your entire visit is spent waiting for others to move on while also feeling the pressure to move on yourself by the people who have been waiting behind you.They have removed all of the written information stations around the property itself and replaced them with QR codes which link to informative videos (in order to stop people standing round reading). This could have been good in theory except signal mainly wasn't good enough to even load the videos and we didn't know about it beforehand so didn't bring headphones with us. We didn't want to blast videos out loud every few minutes so we weren't able to use them. Not to mention you still have the queue of people behind you who probably don't want to wait for you to finish each video in your own time. Holy Trinity Church (Shakespeare's grave) also uses QR but links to text rather than video, which works much better.  We were also unable to enter one of the upstairs rooms (the one displaying the signed panes), which was taped off - guessing because there was a lot people would want to look at and read in there.Finally they have even closed off the pathway around the garden and taped off all the benches so you can't even really spend any time out there. You can only walk around the pathway to use the loos. As a result, our entire visit - including the gift shop, which they've split into 2 halves so you can only access on half from the actual Birthplace and have to enter the other half from the high street (why?) - took less than 30 minutes.Given that the Trust has only reopened this one property, it was really disappointing to have the experience curtailed so much since there isn't loads else to do with the other houses shut. It definitely wasn't worth the entry price, which worked out to about a pound a minute for us. They would be better off limiting numbers further (not that it was too crowded) and letting people walk through as normal at their own pace.It's such a shame but such is life in 2020 I guess. We will be back in happier times."
Interesting but overpriced,My husband and I enjoyed  our visit to Shakespear's birthplace very informative' but we thought very expensive for what it was £13 each no consessions for OAP's. We spent about 45 minutes there but you could have done the tour in 30. This was the only house open to visit.
All closed except Shakespeare’s birthplace,Not even 1 star but lowest you can select. Do not purchase this ticket’ all the houses are closed except Shakespeare’s birthplace. I am yet to hear about a refund. The tickets are being mid-sold because you cannot use them.
"Informative, but quick and expensive","If you are a Shakespeare buff, it is a no brainier. But we found it expensive for what it was.COVID rules well enforced and really sensible. One way system great, but probably more leisurely and less rushed in mor,al circumstances.Really interesting to hear the history of Shakespeare and the building, but lacked meat to justify itself in some parts.One of those must visit places I guess, but will take an hour or less for the hefty admission fee."
Nice little cottage,A real piece of history right in front of you. Easy to get to and have a good look at. I wish I'd look that good after a few hundred years.
Interesting little visit,"Very interesting visit.  The guides here provide an informative insight into Shakespeare’s  life and are certainly suitably knowledgeable when answering questions.  Felt very safe with regard to Covid provisions – need to book in advance, booked slots, must wear masks, hand sanitizer available must social distance etc."
Great place to visit with family,"Great day out, very educational and very interesting.  Will go back again when next in the area, reasonably priced as well."
Informative,"Managed to get into this at fairly short notice.  The tour is interesting and where information is provided by the in-house guides, was informative - e.g. in Tudor times people when moving house would take their windows with them, as glass was so expensive!Worth a visit"
Very interesting ,Lovely to see the birthplace of Shakespeare as well as his father’s place of work and the very pretty gardens.
Day out at Stratford Upon-Avon,Price for 2 adults and 1 child was £35 which would have been same price for family of 4.So i think it’s bit over priced when it was just the 3 of us who visited. Tour was about 20-30 minutes. Couple of staff inside to explain its history to you. Lovely garden and house to look at. Overall i think the price per person could be alot less for what this tour is
Knowledgeable guides,The guides were very friendly and helpful; happy to answer our questions. It's quite an expensive visit as it didn't take a long time to look round but still worth doing. The shop was well stocked with a good range of gifts.
A must,"Staff on arrival were amazing A delight to deal withThis place was a great visit, staff are so knowledgable and lovelyIt’s layout makes it very gripping from start to finish"
Very informative and interesting.,It was lovely to see the garden and birthplace of Shakespeare. The history of the rooms was very interesting.
Worth a visit,"Easy to book online. Very interesting walk through exhibit. Educational, staff were very knowledgeable and engaging. Good choice of books in the bookshop. Beautiful garden."
Fantastic cottage tour. Possibly one of the most influential people of all time!!,Very interesting tour of the house Shakespeare grew up in. I found the introduction to the tour a bit disappointing. The cottage itself is worth seeing and there is a good accompanying commentary from the weblinks available. Helpful and knowledgeable staff helped a lot.
Great British History ,Booked on online where you get a timed slot to visit. Booking in was fine with security  check. Q codes for guided videos.House is fabulous piece of history.  Very informative and friendly staff (friendly people like in Yorkshire!)Spent about 45 minutes there. Right in  centre of town.Really important  that we support our history.
Expensive,"The staff had worked hard to make this venue COVID-19 safe, which is great.However, the result meant that you went through the property quite quickly, and very dependent on the speed of those in front and behind you. There felt like a pressure to move on and you couldn’t linger to look at things. Nor could you spend time in the garden.In the end, by the time we had gone in (waited about 10 minutes to enter) we were only inside for about 30 minutes. At £31 for two children and one adult, this made it quite expensive. I’m sure in normal times they’d do more to engage keen young people (my 10 year old loves Shakespeare 🤣😳) but she was quite disappointed by the conveyor belt style!I don’t begrudge them; they are a charity and I know the current times have been hard, but it might be worth expectation setting with children."
Day out with friends. ,Staff helpful and friendly as always.  Covid restrictions explained well. Was disappointed we couldn’t walk through the gardens and am not sure why we couldn’t as people were socially distancing well.
Over Priced,"We enjoyed the venue, very nice but overpriced, £35 for two adults and a child for less than an hour."
"An eye opener for students of history,culture and literature","Could not visit any other place linked to Shakespeare as they were shut because of COVID, however as a lover of English literature, I did  12 plays in secondary school as part of my syllabus. As a link to history, the culture and values of ""Olde Englande""it is a must-see, very illuminating to hear about the family history of Shakespeare which I was not aware of. Very nice place to visit"
Interesting and informative,Informative staff in key rooms bring this attraction to life sharing facts and stories about life in the house from Shakespeare's time living here. Visual display and artefacts add authenticity with QR codes to watch short video clips.
Informative,"It was a very informative trip youhave to book so make sure you book early enough  so you aren't disappointed be prepared to queue you as you have to go through checkpoints. If you have an app on your phone you can use it to find out more information unfortunately my app didn't work so we missed out on a lot of information but still it wasted an hour wondering around Stratford-upon-Avon, also if you're an NHS worker you getting for free but you have to prove that you work for the NHS"
A nice visit,"Due to Covid you have to prebook online. It cost us £35.00 for two adults and two children and we had one free NHS ticket (I had to show my NHS ID) which I thought was a lovely gesture. You have to take time to look around and read things otherwise I’m sure you’d be in and out within 20 mins. We were in there, including the gift shop, nearly an hour. The staff in each room were informative and funny and one even suggested some websites for my daughters GCSE English Shakespeare module. Covid wise it was all very well marked out, hand sanitiser available in lots of areas and not too many people going through at once."
Great experience,It was great to look around the house Shakespeare grew up in. Really informative too. Great for anyone who loves history or Shakespeare.
Brill,"Very informative. There are QR codes to scan dotted around the house, so that you can get a short video telling you about the room you’re in"
Truly Awesome!,"Truly Awesome!!!! I loved every minute, full of history!!!What an incredible man Shakespeare was! Shakespeare’s birth place takes you back to the Tudor days , full of atmosphere, the guides were so enthusiastic and full of wonderful and fascinating information."
Underwhelming,"Very underwhelming experience.  Apart from one fairly interesting lady in the birth room, the guides were not very informative.  ""Alright mate? Warm isn't it? "" was the best I got out of the others. QR codes sometimes worked but we were already in the gift shop before we knew what had happened."
very well set up,"very safe experience, small but enjoyable hour or two. Staff are very friendly and enthusiastic and lovely with children"
A comfortable doctrine ,"This might be the perfect place for someone who knows little to nothing about Shakespeare, but as someone who knows quite a lot about the bard I found the experience slightly dull and was done in less than half an hour. In place of information signs there were QR codes which I could not use, which made it difficult to learn anything new about either Shakespeare or his house. The staff were more than welcome to answer our questions, however there were few of them, and most were preoccupied with other guests. I’m sad to say that the part of the experience I enjoyed the most was the gift shop."
Really made interesting by the staff!!,"We visited the day it re-opened after lockdown and found that all safety measures had been well implemented, one way systems, masks and screens all good .. the staff were really welcoming and very passionate about their building and history and were fascinating to listen to .. they made our visit!"
A lovely informative and interesting day out!,"A lovely place, make sure you tow your camera! The house is full of history and the guides make it very interesting with facts and information. There are some stairs to climb, although they are not to bad. In the gardens, there was a live act and it was pleasant to watch. There are toilets on the grounds and a small shop as you leave. We then went over to the New Place- it was not far to walk and again was very enjoyable."
Historic ,Halfway down pedestrianised Henley St you’ll find The Home of the Bard.Excellently preserved and a must see if ever you’re in Stratford.
Good to see,Even though the attraction was closed it was good to be able to be photographed in front of it. Enjoyed a cream tea outside a nearby cafe.
Ok if you are really into shakespear,"I went hear with a friend visiting from overseas and was not the best in my opinion, it was really over prices and you get rushed round and I was only in there about 30 mins. I this k this attraction would be perfect for people to have a completely different culture and from other countries."
History & knowledge,Have read his books during college & seen few plays also . It was wonderful seeing his home which was maintained immaculate with information . We enjoyed walking around the town.
Pleasure of theatre in the garden of the house where William Shakespeare was born.,"Review covers William Shakespeare’s birthplace, Henley Street, Stratford-upon-Avon.William Shakespeare – English poet, actor and playwright and generally considered the best-known/revered writer in the English Language. And the place where he was born? This is where the bard’s parents – Mary and John Shakespeare lived and where his father ran his workshop - making gloves, trading wool and occasional money-lending. This is where the couple started married life and where William - their eldest and his three brothers and two sisters were raised. (Two older siblings did not survive early childhood.) This is where you can catch a glimpse of what small town life was like in the Midlands of Tudor England >400 years ago.The reality today, of course, is nothing like it was back then. Apart from the example of the house as an isolated dwelling showing how middle-income people lived, the view out through the windows once inside will confirm exactly where you are in time/space.So, there’s that glimpse and then your imagination – house and garden in surroundings that represent modern Britain in all its spectacular heritage industries – the place is renovated, clean, reconstructed to a fault and,  probably, with little bearing on the original/separate buildings that now make up the ‘birth-place’.Outside the front of the building the pedestrianized Henley Street was literally awash with ‘Shakespeare’s People’ those, like us, who had been attracted to the town/venue as a result of the admiration and enjoyment that his work has given people worldwide through to the present day. What would a time traveller from the 16th century make of it all?The house is a few steps down Henley Street from the modern Shakespeare Centre and typical of popular design from Tudor times – wooden frame with wattle and daub overlay – painted in beige/earth colour. Someone has, fortuitously, refrained from the more popular but contrasting white & black that seems to typify most buildings of this design/age in ‘tourist land’ nowadays. Four hundred years and the building has enjoyed many kinds of redevelopment and use. There was an informative wall board on hand showing the original/central part of the building with cottages tacked on either end with the kitchen later added at the rear. Eventually the entire building became part of a terrace of houses that stretched along this part of the street.The house became the property of William Shakespeare after the death of his father and was rented to a tenant. For a period, the original main house was converted into an inn. William with his family never lived there, although the house remained within the Shakespeare family through to the end of the 18th century. It was eventually rescued from obscurity and disrepair by the concerted efforts of a group of well-known national figures during the mid-19th century (recognizing the importance of the property to the Shakespeare heritage).Which neatly links into the house that we and many thousands (perhaps hundreds of thousands) have explored in recent (and more distant) times. It was surprisingly spacious - an impression of the enlarged/existing building that dominates to one side of the street behind a low fence of iron railings. Once inside this reflected further in the large size of the different rooms. Everything well-kept, tidy, clean … elegant even. Of course, it should be, except you somehow feel it should also represent the reality of those olden times.Explore inside and walk through the different rooms on both the ground and first floors, with the birth room above the parlour. We followed others through the passageways roped-off from the furnishings in the different rooms – exploring beds, chimney hearths, stairways, views from the windows, the ‘Hall’ where the family ate their main meals (and where a table was set with foods typical of those times) and the neat stone flag flooring – domestic museum par excellence.However, it is the garden at the rear of the house that dominated our visit that afternoon – this is where the majority people were located and where there was theatre, actors, entertainment; that feel of being part of the living heritage that represents Shakespeare and his writings in an original historical context. Look around you – a garden imitating that original design; comfortable, spacious with pathways between raised beds providing easy strolling, stopping and talking, and places at which to sit.During the visit, people were sitting in casual groups following the brief and rapidly changing theatre provided – handful of mainly young people on shallow podiums that put them head/shoulders above the audience – words, action, interaction, applause. Clearly fine-weather activities, but perhaps there are alternative wet-weather venues - for us it was the enthusiastic actors and their stories that provided that sense of history to one side of this 400-year old house in the centre of modern Stratford-upon-Avon.Many interesting features and much theatre then around the Henley Street house that helped provide an introduction to the early times of William Shakespeare - the world’s most famous English writer. But we had a train to catch that afternoon, and one with a gorgeous English steam locomotive attached. We expected to be in London that evening. Contrast this with the same journey that William took each year to keep in contact with his family in Stratford -upon-Avon – six days or more following foot tracks across country."
The Bard of Avon,"What a fascinating place to visit. This place is  fantastically maintained and every piece of furniture is well preserved. Shakespeare's Birthplace is a very interesting building in itself, and the staff in costume really helped understand what the place would have been like when Shakespeare was around. The information I learned was very surprising and completely reignited my passion for history. Moreover, the tickets were very reasonably priced."
Brings History to Life,This and all of the Shakespeare properties are fantastically maintained and managed. The docents at each property are world class.
Great place to visit ,"I visited Shakespeares birth place November time (off season) which is probably the best time to go because I experienced no lines to get in and there wasn’t many people there at all.Surprisingly the tickets were very reasonably priced. The employees were enthusiastic and happy, with so much knowledge they were more than happy to share! I live just outside of Stratford and have done for years but only recently decided to visit and I’m so so glad I did. The information I learn was very surprising and completely reignited my passion for history. Shakespeares birth place is great for all the family. The gift shop is stocked with all kinds of things in relation to Shakespeare and England. The garden is beautiful and is a really lovely place to sit and relax. What I love is the history of the place is still shown in the gardens and really brings the place together."
Awesome experience,Great experience to visit town of shakespeare. Well maintained. Neat and clean roads. Beautiful town.
Inspiring!,"Such a well preserved building! Stunning old interior and gardens, staff were lovely and very knowledgeable. Reasonably priced aswell! Closest you could ever get to Shakespeare himself."
Early spring break ,What a fascinating place to visit. All of the team are friendly and are willing to make your visit enjoyable. You feel as if you are being transported back in time. You can even experience the aroma of the time! Well worth it.
Interesting,A bit boring but good enough if u r in his townI felt it’s very basic and could be improved As I bought a discount ticket for all 3 attraction we did visited the place but not impressed
A glimpse of the past,It was fascinating to get a glimpse of what it might have been like to be the son of a glover back in Shakespeare's youth. The staff were all so helpful and the exhibits were interesting. I haven't visited these homes since I was a child so the whole process seems more sophisticated and interactive than I remember back in the 70's. As a Shakespeare fan I was happy to spend lots of time listening to the introductory exhibits but even less engrossed people found it engaging.
Must visit ☀️☀️,I love this place how everything is preserved .Nice place to visit with family to see historical place .love to visit again.
Excellent and informative,"Although the farm was closed due to the time of year, the other 4 locations were very interesting. The talks given by the tour guides were excellent.Never been interested in the works of Shakespear ourselves, but found the information gained made you realise what a great man he was.As a note the ticket entitles us to go on the tour again within a year, so we will return to see the farm and the gardens in all their glory in the summer somethme."
School trip - year 6,"This was such an interesting place to visit, which thoroughly engaged adults and children alike. We enjoyed a fantastic morning at the education centre. The activities here were so much fun and taught us a lot, including how to write with a quill. The guides were informative and enthusiastic. We were treated to actors performing sections of different Shakespearean plays on request. I would absolutely recommend a visit for all ages - I learnt a lot!"
Weekend of history,I love that it is being preserved. Staff very knowledgeable. We bought the managed to see all but the farm.
Very intetesting,All of our family enjoyed learning about Shakespeare. Fantastic historic building. Lots of lovely volunteers giving information about life in the Tudor times.  Would definetly buy the full story tickets costing £23 and lasts for 12 months.
such great history,Really enjoyed visiting here. you can feel the history in the whole building. would love to visit again sometime.
Fantastic staff,"Shakespeare's birthplace was amazing and we learnt so much from the highly knowledgeable team of staff on duty that day in February. We didn't only learn about Shakespeare and his family, we learnt so much about the period and how people lived - the Sumptuary Laws were a particular revelation!Highly recommended!!"
Fantastic value and the best way to see three historic properties,"Shakespeare's birthplace was amazing and we learnt so much from the highly knowledgeable team of staff on duty that day in February. We didn't only learn about Shakespeare and his family,  we learnt so much about the period and how people lived -  the Sumptuary Laws were a particular revelation!If there was a slight disappointment it was at Shakespeare's New Place which wasn't his at all because it had been demolished although the staff were still incredibly helpful and knowledgeable - just as they were at our final third visit of the journey to Hall's Croft which was a fascinating insight into medicine in Shakespeare's day and the esteem with which his son in law, John Hall was held.The three Homes Ticket is certainly the way to see these famous properties and we would highly recommend it."
Loved learning about Shakespeare,"The gallery that you go through first is really interesting and the garden is lovely. The house itself is really insightful and the guides were so knowledgeable. Loved having a look around and learning about Shakespeare, his family and the house itself. Absolutely worth a visit if you're in the area."
The Shakespeare ticket,"Did four of the five places, as the farm is closed until end of March. Really enjoyable. The talks were very informative, took you back to the time and found a lot out about Shakespeare and his family (even the naughty bits). Weather stopped us from walking around the gardens, but may do that on another day as the tickets last a year."
Interesting,"Interesting full of history, enjoyed our visit, staff friendly and helpful who know alot about he history of the place"
Good value offer,"£23 for all five of the birthplace trust attractions is good value for money, even if only four are open in winter. The Birthplace, New Place and Hall are all in easy walking distance. Not impressed by the audio visual introduction at the Birthplace which is a bit slow and wordy. The New Place garden is very good, with help from the National Lottery Heritage Fund. The cafe at the Halls Croft is excellent.The highlight for me was Mary Arden's house, which is about five minutes drove from Stratford. An ancient house with great stories and great volunteer guides."
Fascinating informative and well presented,"Came here at the end of January as part of a birthday trip, and despite 1 of us not being that interested in the Bard, we found the whole experience really rather good.We purchased the 'Full Story 'Ticket which gives you access to all the properties relating to Shakespeare and his family, and we managed to do 4 of them in one day. the 5th Mary Arden's farm - was closed for Winter, but as the ticket is valid for a 12 months, we can visit later in the year.Ticket price is approx. 24.00 so good value to visit all 5 properties.Absolutely loved the presentation of the story of the Bard, and we met some smashing people who were passionate about their subjects and  full of information about his homes, life, Stratford itself and his  family. it is definitely worth doing all the properties, particularly Anne Hathaway's cottage - absolutely amazing to stand on a floor she would have stood upon  herself all those years ago. All properties - bar the Farm - are within walking distance of the town, so you can have a car free day if you like. While visiting Halls Croft, you can also pop down the road to the Church where Shakespeare is buried, it is definitely worth a look. We were lucky to have excellent weather in January, cold, but dry, and enjoyed our walks between the various sites.- Anne's Cottage is about 25 mins  gentle stroll from the town, but it is all well signposted and there are some lovely cottages to see en route.Despite the time of year, it was pretty busy at certain places, I can only imagine it must be chaos in high season  - so visiting when we did was a little less stressful.Overall a highly enjoyable experience and one we would recommend. plenty of other things of interest in Stratford also, so a few days here is advised."
Busy but facinating,"When we arrived, a couple of groups of children had just arrived as well. This made it busy, and a little cramped at times. But, you have to expect this sort of thing at such a major, historical site.The museum is fascinating and the staff are very knowledgeable. We would certainly recommend a visit because it gives such an insight into one of the true masters of literature and performing arts.Would definitely go again."
All is bought to life as much as is possible.,"The small Shakespeare family home is quite a gem, and bought to life by the staff who tell so much about the relevance of every item in the home. All questions are answered willingly, and we had a wonderfully memorable visit. The attached shop is a delight for anyone in search of anything “Shakespearean’, and I loved it."
So interesting,Wasn’t sure what to expect especially as none of us are too familiar with Shakespeare and his life and works. It really didn’t matter as there was so much interesting information and the staff had so much knowledge and enthusiasm to share. Would recommend this to anyone. Might not be very interesting for younger children who have no awareness of the life and works of this amazing man
Shakespeare's childhood world,We went to Stratford Upon Avon for weekend as we wanted to visit Shakespeare’s Birthplace. It is the one of the famous attractions in the area and house dated on 16th century and beautifully restored to look as close to the original place.This is a great way to know more about Shakespeare and took us 30mins. For single property ticket cost £18 each and £23 includes 1x year unlimited visits to all five properties. The tour is worth every penny.
Very well put together exhibition,Stepping back in time to the 16th century. This exhibition is for all ages. Would recommend getting the pass to visit all 4 places linked to Shakespeare's life.
Great Experience,"Shakespeare's Birthplace it is right in the centre of town. The exhibition is informative and well laid out and prepares you for seeing the house. The guides are very helpful and informative. We bought ‘Full Story’ ticket that gets you in to 5 houses and is valid for 12 months, but Mary Arden’s Farm is closed for the winter, so we will have to return!"
Interesting and Educational,"Shakespeare's Birthplace is a must visit for anyone and everyone. Whether you like literature, history, gardens, listening to plays or just learning about British heritage, this place has something for everyone. If you are visiting Stratford; no, if you are visiting England, you must pay a visit. You know the saying ""you find out something new every day""... You will leave so  much more educated - but in a good way! Don't forget to request an excerpt from your favourite Shakespeare play from the players in the garden!"
Historical Education at a great price,Take the opportunity to spend a weekend in the delightful setting of Stratford Upon Avon and purchase a ‘5 attractions’ ticket to learn all about the life of ‘The Bard’ at a ridiculously low price. Stratford is a throw back in history with so much to enjoy and wonderful pubs and restaurants to make your stay a truly memorable one. Visit the many traditional properties of Shakespeare times and embrace the life of the days gone by. The 5 ticket purchase is valid for 1 year so you can return to Stratford and use the tickets for a full 12 months. At just over £20 it is true value for money. If you have the time a visit to the Royal Shakespeare Theatre and The Butterfly Park are also enjoyable experiences. An abundance of hotels to suit all pockets makes this an affordable weekend to savour.
a historic place to visit,We xame back again to explore shakespers birthplace and it was worth a visit . So much history dating back in time and well kept. Friendly staff on hand. We are glad we came on our visit to Stratford.
Worthwhile ticket,"If you might intend to visit at least two of the Shakespeare Trust properties then this ticket which provides entry to all five and is valid for a year is definitely worthwhile.Tip:  Buy the Trust's guidebook for £5 BEFORE you start wandering around Stratford.   Its introduction points out quite a number of buildings of significance that you'll pass by otherwise without noticing, as well as telling you about each of the properties, their history and contents."
Quite brief but really interesting,"We visited on the single attraction ticket with our teenagers and everyone got something out of the visit. The lady on the ticket desk was a little unfriendly but from then on all the guides were really interesting and engaging, especially the pair who would perform Shakespeare on request, really fun. The building itself is well restored and interesting. Highly recommend a visit."
Interesting,"Very old, interesting, staff informative,a little pricy - but when you are on holiday - you have to stop to visit.  Fortunately, there were not many people when we arrived so we did not get caught up in crowds.We stood in the bedroom where William was born.  I thought it was good they had the house layed out as it would have been back in the day."
Shakespeare’s Birthplace,"We took a day tour out to Stratford Upon Avon to see Shakespeare’s Birthplace. It was absolutely amazing and memorable. We got to see his father’s house where he was born, his bed and the a small memorabilia of Shakespeare’s plays etc. There is also a nice garden behind the house and you have to pass through a gift shop on the way out. There was a gentleman on electric wheelchair waiting for you to ask him to recite parts of any play by Shakespeare. We asked him to recite from Merchant of Venice and he did it superbly getting into the character of the play. Wonderful. Must visit and see."
Great attraction to visit,"Me and my partner visited Shakespeares Birthplace whilst on our break to Stratford. We bought the full experience ticket for £23 each which gives you access to a few attractions to do with Shakespeare, which we can also use for a whole year with unlimited access to all. So we will definitely be visiting again in the summer when the sun (is hopefully) shining."
Weekend visit,"A wonderful place to visit, we did the 3 houses and it was very educational.Had a wonderful afternoon and well worth a visit.Staff were very friendly and theres a lovely little resturant too."
Really interesting!,Thoroughly enjoyed visiting. Actors were great and staff were friendly and informative. Would definitely recommend!
Shakepeare,"Really enjoyed visiting the birthplace, learnt so much about the context and the place should be visited when passing Stratford"
A beautiful tribute to Shakespeare,This was everything you would hope for when learning more about William Shakespeare's life. The Presentation was very well done and the grounds are beautiful. What a wonderful restored effort and truly worth seeing.
Very informative and greatly preserved,"Really enjoyed touring the birthplace of Shakespeare. The grounds were very so scenic and you could peruse at your own pleasure.Inside has lots of information available from the local experts, who were also dressed up in Tudor clothing. Loved the mixture of history regarding the period and the history of the writer. The actors were very friendly and very informative. Actor outside in the gardens reciting Shakespeare's works was also a real delight I stayed a while longer just to hear him do more. Was very impressed."
Brilliant site and terrifically curated and explained,"The site itself is terrifically preserved, and set in grounds and a number of supporting buildings to help you understand Shakespeare and the context and period.  Inside the building very helpful staff in period costume help you understand the times and the lifestyle of his family and outside actors read sections of his plays, speeches and sonnets.  Terrific atmosphere and most enjoyable."
Great visit for a site seeing weekend! ,"Great visit, so much to learn about the main man himself. Great staff who are there to help if needed, also able to provide any extra information you require while there."
Truly memorable,"Brilliant in-house guides, really informative and knowledgeable but also entertaining! Really enjoyed visiting this remarkable place."
Don't miss the actors ,"Must to visit place in UK, lovely house with a small garden, staffs are very helpful and give all the informations, the actors are just amazing"
Interesting visit,"Visited Shakespeare's birthplace and it was interesting. There is an actor in the garden who will enthusiastically recite some verses from requested Shakespeare's play. Anne Hathaway's Cottage is beautiful and most interesting. Lovely to learn how people live during the era from guides located in some rooms. For eg, I found that people slept sitting up that was why the beds were smaller."
History and literature lovers delight,"An educational experience to see how life in that period was, and the house has been nicely preserved and restored. Friendly guides in some of the rooms are available to answer questions and provide interesting curious comments about the family. Very enjoyable."
Educational,Please book all 5 tours at the Shakespeare centre beforehand!! Each of the 5 tours range from £8.50-£17.50 You can book all 5 for £22.50 (adult) which is a bargain!! The birthplace it's self is nice. There are guided tours throughout the house. It's educational and pleaseantTakes about half an hour One of the ladies in there telling us about it was very helpful with other tourism info too
Lovely buildings but extortionate prices ,This place has some lovely buildings but they don’t half cash in on the “Shakespeare” connection Prices are extortionate to view anything or to buy anything So go with a full wallet as it is guaranteed to be empty by the time you leave.
History,"If you love history and Shakespeare then your love this, this place is absolutely beautiful and you just can't believe how they used to live back then. This is a must to see as you will definitely love this place"
Lived up to expectations,"This museum is well set up and laid out. The gallery of art inspired by fans through the ages was a favourite, as were the actors giving performances of excerpts from his plays on request."
Fabulous place to step back in time,"Loved this property. On entering the house we were met by a member of staff in costume who was immensely knowledgeable and who spent some time with us telling us about the property and it's occupants. We then toured the property on our own, meeting other staff on route who added more to our knowledge of Shakespeare and his family."
Quick visit,"Walked past to see where all the attractions were for our next visit to Stratford-upon-Avon ,we stayed in our motor home in the dedicated area in the Leisure Centre ,no services but good for walking to town only five mins walk, so will return again ."
Pretty,It is a very beautiful building . It seemed a bit quiet and almost over seeable when we visited but it is winter after all.
Shakespeare's Birthplace,"This was a very interesting walk-through tour.  There are guides placed throughout the house to answer questions, but I don't recall the option to purchase a headset ""guided"" tour.  Just knowing that you're in the home of literary brilliance is enough...  My teenage daughter loved it!  We walked through in less than 30 minutes.  We bought the combo ticket because we were going to see Anne Hathaway's Cottage as well.  It was the best priced option for us."
Back in time!,It is great to see and experience! You get to visit Shakespeare’s home and feel like you’re back in time!
Get a taste of history,"This is an interesting place to visit.  It is famous of course for being where Shakespeare was born.  Many famous people have visited.  One has a glimpse into how people lived in Shakespeare's time.  Actors perform parts from Shakespeare's plays, based on requests, in the garden."
Wedding  Anniversary ,"SHAKESPEARE  first home very  informative  staff dressed in period  costumes  , Shakespeare's  father run his glove  business  from the home selling  the gloves through a  window  ."
The Dents,Very expensive for what there was to see.  The staff inside the building  were excellent but they had very little to work with.   I doubt that I would spend £32.00on that again.
Wendy,Very interesting for all of us.I took our 11 & 8 yr old grandchildren.The staff and actors in appropriate dress make the whole experience  really enjoyable
Well worth a visit,"Great value for money (go for the whole tour) very interesting place with informative guides, get the actors to play parts of your Shakespeare plays."
A must visit,Staff answered and did their role plays quite well. It was an interesting experience to see the birthplace of Shakespeare
History and beauty,"My fiancé booked the annual ticket as a surprise and the day was amazing. All the staff were lovely and knowledgable, given plenty of time to wander and explore. The gardens, even in November, were so beautiful. I’d definitely recommend to anyone. We’ll be returning for sure!"
"Fake, overated, and a rip off, go to Warwick instead",pushed round quickly .so to get you to the gift shop. rip off price and overated . go to Warwick instesd much better place to visit.
Some fantastic historic buildings in Stratford Upon Avon to wander around including this,We had a stop off at Stratford Upon Avon and it was late in the day so unfortunately didnt have time before things were closing properly to go around this.  But we had a wander around Stratford Upon Avon and there are some great old buildings here.
Full of history,A not to be missed historical place. The staff are very informative. We came when it wasn't very busy and could spend some time having a chat with the staff.
great visit,Easy to get to on foot if you are staying in Stratford on AvonGot in using the combined ticket that we purchased If you can get there as early as possible to ensure that it does not get too busy and misses the coach parties that arrive later during the dayThere are actors there who do a section from a selected play of your choice
Entertainment and Education,"Having visited the four 'houses' open this time of year, I have been enthralled by enthusiastic tour guides detailing the life of the house and its occupants, despite adverse weather. Then entertained at Shakespeare's birth place by 3 players delivering sonnets and speeches, portraying characters from audience chosen plays despite, the cold enough to stiffen the sinews of any tourist."
good exhibition and tour,Very interesting and informative. We bought ticket that gets you in to 5 houses but they didn’t tell us the farm is actually closed for the winter!
My birthday.,Love visiting Stratford it’s such a beautiful place. It’s not our first visit and it won’t be our last.
Informative and educational,Great visit  learnt a lot about Shakespeare and family .Beautiful cottage .Videos of justify son loved it.
Excellent,I really enjoyed seeing shakespears birthplace and the staff were friendly and knowledgeable and shared their passion for the life and times  of the great bard. Definitley worth a visit.
Worth a visit ,Enjoyed a morning trip to Shakespeares birthplace using the full story ticket we had purchased. Very interesting and definitely worth a visit with the added bonus of the acting out of scenes from his plays out in the courtyard area.
A splash of Shakespeare ,Educational and fun. Worth buying the all in ticket. Lots of interesting stuff to learn. House is good for all ages and has interactive things for the children.
A cultural treasure,Well worth the visit.  An amazing house to visit with such detail.  Great staff and very helpful.  Such a treasure in the middle of Stratford town.
Great start,"This was a really informative start to our weekend of   Shakespeare. Information was delivered through posters, videos etc. The modern depictions of Shakespeare through art were excellent too. Surprising as well as informative."
Worth a visit,"We felt this was a 'must see' whilst in Stratford, but it doesn't take long to see everything. Short and sweet!"
An interesting place to see,"It is lovely to see the house where William Shakespeare was born and lived, in Stratford on Avon, it is right in the centre of town, the information given is very useful and interesting and prepares you for seeing the house and garden which is very pretty. The presenters who tell all you need to know make his family story come to life."
A must Visit,"really enjoyed our visit, a must for visitors to Stratford, interesting information, learned a lot of the past."
One ticket - many houses (and we can go back!),"Given the choice of paying lots for one house or paying a little bit more and an open opportunity of seeing other houses, we spent that little bit extra and managed 2 houses in the time we had. The intro video was engaging, the gardens were among the best kept I have ever seen, and the actors acting in the cold outside a nice touch. Shakespeare's birthplace was interesting especially if there was a guide with their bit of the story to tell. We loved the gardens most. I couldn't say if we've had value for money as we will try to get back to visit the other places but I'm sure it is. If you have time and an inclination to drink in the displays then you will have an incredibly immersive experience. Same if you have kids as their are activities for them to do that help engage and entertain."
The Birthplace of Genius,"Touch the doors he touched.  See where he had his meals.  Look at the room he learned his early skills as a glove maker - apprentice to his father.  There's something of a magical quality about being in the actual house where Will Shakespeare lived.For the sixth time.But I learned a great deal from the guides during this visit.  The wide wooden floorboards had gaps between them to allow heat from the fires below to warm the bedrooms.  The chamber pots were positioned on the left of the bed so those below needed to be vigilant.  Beware 'getting out of bed on the wrong side'. And the foot long staves that lined the wooden frame each side of of the bed and helped keep the blankets from falling off either side, could be pulled out in the blink of an eye, and used to bludgeon intruders — to stave off danger.The modern extension on the side of the timber framed house, has a wonderful video presentation and a great of historical facts about Elizabethan theatre and life at the time. You simply cannot go to Stratford and not visit this house.  It would be like going to the Louvre and not seeing the Mona Lisa.  Like going to Rome and not seeing the Sistine Chapel.  Going to New York and not seeing the Declaration of Independence.  The human race does produce exceptionally brilliant specimens now and again — the least the rest of us can do is pay homage."
Definitely worth doing all,Was a bit sceptical as I’m not an avid Shakespeare follower however was pleasantly surprised by the two locations we visited...birthplace and family home but not Ann Hathaways house. The guides in all locations were very knowledgeable particularly at the family home which had been altered/ rebuilt over the period in question. The garden was fabulous there. Would recommend a visit.
Expensive but worth it,"I was travelling with my American friend who really wanted to 'do the sights'.  So Shakespeares birthpace was a must.  It was easy to find but the best thing about it was the knowledgable staff.  They were all very approachable and gave us loads of information.  Also the trio of actors were really good, they asked th.e audience for favourite plays and then performed scenes from them.  The shop was very busy and a bit pricy but we bought things anyway"
Informative visit,"Lovely house, exhibitions were interesting and the staff were very knowledgable. Was lovely to see live performances of some of Shakespeare's plays taking part in the gardens."
History brought to life,"What makes this visitor attraction is the quality of the ""players"" who are full of stories and historical anecdotes and really bring Shakespeare's world to life for all ages of visitor."
Part of the Shakespeare tour,This property is the birthplace of Shakespeare and due to that is a tourist magnet. I found it too commercial for my liking. We visited in October and found it reasonably quiet. I can imagine in peak tourist season it would be very cramped. The rooms in the house are small and coaches full of tourists would see this place over run. The museum at the beginning gives a good history of the place and Shakespeare. For me the best part was the wall which showed Shakespeare's influence on the English language. The gardens are small and well laid out. There are actors who will act out Shakespearean scenes and the guides are only too happy to answer any questions.
Interesting especially if into Shakespeare!,Interesting display and video 15 minutes showing various old and new performances along with lots of info re his works and life.  Lovely peaceful and tranquil garden and interesting old house with some people inside who knew their info.  Disappointed with the courtyard actors who seemed to be happy to sit around and chat for over 39 minutes without performing.  Eventually gave up and went out through the shop.  Good value ticket for 4 Shakespeare sites available.
Very interesting,"Very interesting place to visit, with lots of facts dotted about and some staff giving further information on key items"
Super duper,Fascinating visit. We picked the yearly ticket even though we only wanted to go once - it's cheaper to do if you want to visit 2 or more of the houses. Great interactivity in the rooms with the hosts and will easily gauge whether or not you want to talk - appreciated that!
Interesting and inspiring,My husband and I visited Stratford upon avon and Shakespeare's birth place. This was an interesting visit. It worked out a lot cheaper to pay for all attractions but we unfortunately run out of time so we chose to see Shakespeare's home. There was lots to see and learn about and actors on site who eagerly performed scenes from different plays which we thoroughly enjoyed and which inspired us to actually go to the theatre to see midsummer nights dream at some point soon.
At least he was actually here!,"Shame about the weather but, hey, it is October! The house and guide were great. Got to buy the multi-ticket though. Garden even out of season, is great."
Interesting historical space,"The staff were very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. You can buy one ticket for all the Stratford Shakespeare attractions which lasts a year and they ask for your email in case of loss - very efficient and cost effective system. Shakespeare’s birthplace has interesting exhibits and beautiful gardens. Experts were on hand to answer questions and give some information on the rooms. There was a small performance space where Shakespeare was enacted. Very enjoyable. I shall be making use of my annual ticket and will return."
Old or what,"We called in Stratford yesterday for a day out and to see what everyone was shouting about,the place was very good indeed,lots to see and a lot of old buildings, unfortunately the weather was rather inclement,and we were  a little bit wet to say the least.We called into to Shakespeare's birthplace to see how much things were,wee managed to get a lot of information from  the staff but we didn't actually go in,but according to the information  we  recieved it was a lot cheaper to purchase a ticket for all five visits,than to do it all individually.also they lasteda year from the ate of purchase.We will go on our next visit soon,watch this space."
To See Or Not To See,A short film gives details of Shakespeare’s life then you go on a self guided tour of the home where he was born.  Period furniture and costumed actors are throughout the property.
Everything you hoped it would be,I hadn't visited the site for over 12 years and it was good to see that the trust had upgraded the information and looked after the site with the care it deserves.  The visits were definitely worth while. The guides were incredible informative and approachable in all houses.
A Must,"Why would you visit Stratford and not at least discover something about William Shakespeare? There are 3 sites within walking distance of the town centre and 2 further which you need to drive to.  If you only want to do 3 then buy tickets from the Tourist Information Centre near the river, next to Pen and Parchment pub. They only sell single site or 5 site tickets at the attraction.We started at The Birthplace.  The queue to get in seems to go rather slowly. The first bit has an audio visual show which gets crowded and various artifacts associated with Shakespeare's work. The big item is a first folio. Outside is a pretty garden and the actual house where it is believed he was born. Listen to the tour guide in the first room to understand how the house was used. There are other interesting talks in the glove workshop and upstairs. The visit takes about 30-45 minutes."
"medieval,quaint town.",Enjoyed a bus trip through Cotswolds and Stratford. Good to have a commentator to learn of history. Great to go into his parents home where he was born and see house he died in. This town is all about him and his history. A nice day out or visit overnight not so rushed.
Cool,"My favorite of the three houses that we toured there. The house was staged with furniture and items to look authentic to that time, and included interesting artifacts like the original window and an original panel of the wall. The garden outside was beautiful and the guides inside were very helpful. They clearly loved their jobs."
Essential Visit,"This is a 'Can't Miss' site, especially if you have seen Anne Hathaways' Cottages. The detail of each room seek to bring back life in those times. There are guides/attendants in each room to answer questions and offer more details.My favourite part was listening to the young attendants in the courtyard delivering Shakespearean soliloquies. They will do any one you request, but they also have the popular ones (Hamlet, Macbethh, All The Worlfd's A Stage, etc) ready."
A must see ,"Well, this is a must see whilst in Stratford upon Avon but it is just another medieval building lovely as it is.  Have a trip down the street and grab a coffee or ice cream and hear the stories being told about the great bard."
Birthday weekend away,"Excellent, good value for money. Really interesting but go for the full story ticket as you get to go to Shakespeares birthplace,  his New place, Anne Hathaway's cottage, Hall's croft & Mary Ardens farm. The ticket lasts for 12 months."
A must-see!,"So very interesting to learn about Shakespeare's life, mostly lived in this home.  Informative, friendly guides throughout the home."
Stunning,We bought tickets for total 5 locations. The exhibition was really great and the commentator were really experienced. The tickets last for a year for multiple visits.
Amazing historical place,We only had a quick few hours visiting in the town as I was at a all day conference but wanted to see some of the iconic sites. It had closed for visiting by the time we got there but really glad we could see here.
Great visit,Lovely welcome at the front desk watched the video then went to house one of our group couldn’t make the stairs so went to wait outside where she was talking to one of the volunteers who said they could get her an iPad with a film of the upstairs which proved difficult to find but they kept going till they had it then set it up and talked it all through with her and another lady who also couldn’t make it. What a very nice experience and such a heart felt and knowledgable group of people. It makes such a difference to a visit. They didn’t have a cafe but one of the volunteers recommended a place which was excellent.
Historically Engaging ,"Visited today and pleasantly surprised to find it wasn’t busy! We spent a good couple of hours absorbed in everything Shakespeare here! Loved it! Started off in the Shakespeare Centre which was a good introduction before we walked through a lovely, colourful garden (for this time of year!) to the Birthplace itself. All of the guides were friendly and happy to answer our questions. We really enjoyed talking to Joe in the glove shop as we learnt some new things about Shakespeare’s life. A very interesting visit...Thank you!"
Another experience,"Amazing atmosphere, it was such an amazing experience. So many things to see and learn. Would definitely visit again."
Great place to visit in typical English Setting,"Very quiet place.  Shakesphere's paternal house was well maintained as was the garden outside.  The walk along the street to the new house and other locations was lovely (though it was raining a bit).  Could not visit Hathaway house due to time constrating, but will definitely make a trip again in future to enjoy the place with more time to spare"
Great day out,"If your interested in local history then you'll love this place,  full of Shakespeare's stories and history,  we throughly enjoyed our day out here and some of the restaurants are just amazing"
Shakespeare's Birthplace,This is an interesting place to visit.  The home is well-explained by several characters (docents).  A highlight of the garden is a stage where young actors are ready to perform  a scene from any Shakespeare play on request.
Town visit,Popped by during visit to Stratford. Really nostalgic and so good to see how life was for our great bard. Marvellous spot
"""Historic Site Not To Miss""","This site is a must see when in the Cotswold. The home has been well maintained and preserved by the foundation. The Guides are extremely knowledgeable and are more than willing to share historical information and answer any questions. William's father, John, was a glove maker who had his shop in the house. He also was a wool trader, but not legally, so got into a bit of trouble. So do listen to the guide in the glove shop about John's history and redemption. Again, take your time and enjoy the history told by the guides. Highly recommended site."
Interesting place as start to the houses,We loved visiting the birthplace of Shakespeare and reading about his family.  We enjoyed the Shakespeare recitations  in the garden. Enjoyable.
Museum is well done ...,"After leaving Wales we drove to the medieval town of Stratford-on-Avon. The classic Tudor buildings and cottages with thatched roofs was a treat to see. We toured Anne Hathaway’s childhood home and the William Shakespeare Birthplace Museum. Worth the time, even if you are not a real fan of Shakespeare."
Combined visit 5 homes .,"This was the best deal .Over age 60 .Combined £21 .We decided start Shakespeare birth place then 2 others in town .Followed by 2 with a short but scenic drive out .However you can also do an even better ticket .Do all 5 plus Hop on Hop off open top bus .If you don’t do all visits in 1 day ,you can use it again the following day .So don’t rush your time as it’s so informative and interesting.The Shakespeares birth place ,the actors in the open area were amazing ,humour out and so very good .Worth sitting down on the benches and take on the atmosphere."
The “Full Story Package” ticket is good value.,"We visited here, Anne Hathaways cottage & Halls Croft with the package ticket for £22.50 each. There were two more attractions included for the price which we didn’t get to. Individual entry for each place is a bit steep in my opinion but this ticket is good value. Interesting places to visit with very good knowledgeable guides on hand."
a bit of history,This is a must see very interesting and well set out. you can imagine the people living there and I am so grateful for the fact this place is still standing for us to enjoy
Praise to the citizens who kept this shrine!,"Whenever we visit a site like this, where the historical significance of the building has been intelligently realized with engaging content, I feel deep respect and gratitutde to all of those who made it happen.And so our Shakespeare day, which ended with the RSC, began here. At the ticket counter, I recommend buying the multi-site pass, it will be worthwhile.Entering, you are treated to a great short video presentation dealing with important aspects of Shakespeare's art.Continuing through the entry building, you get to marvel at several artifacts, including (be still my heart!) one of the three existing copies of the First Folio.A stroll through the gardens will bring you to the actual house in which Shakespeare was born and raised. It's well preserved, doubtlessly in large part due to its having been converted to a tavern later in Shakespeare's life. Staff attired in Elizabethan costume will elucidate on the career of Shekespeare's father and will answer any questions you may have.Upon exiting the house, you'll enter another garden area where you should take a seat and enjoy at least one presentation by #shakespearealoud, a small group of actors who will delight you with well-realized scenes from some of the plays.A rather large and well appointed gift shop, as one might expect, completes your hour.It was better than I'd hoped."
Well worth a visit.,"Each room and the gardens to the home are well presented. The bedroom with the cradle, the meals area and lounge indicate that his family were quite well off."
Well preserved and interesting.,"Visiting Shakespeare's birthplace was very interesting. The home complete with a pie on the table seemed authentic and realistic for the time. To visit the church where he is buries, the theatre where he performed and The Other theatre  were other highlights of the visit. We also glimpsed Anne Hathaways cottage. Well worth the visit to Stratford on Avon."
Excellent,The whole area was so awe inspiring the place just oozed Shakespear. A nice touch was that there was a group of actors putting on small playlets and they included lots of school children in these events
interesting day,"the three places we visit to do with Shakespeare were very good , the talks were very interesting. the gardens were really lovely  the weather was a little wet but this didn't spoil the day."
To Be or Not To Be,"A definite ""must"" for those who are interested in Shakespeare's life as well as his works.  We saw a 3 person play in the courtyard which was a lot of fun.  And Anne Hathaway's home is an added bonus. If you dare to really enjoy this experience, pretend that you are alive during Shakespeare's time and walk around as that character.Don't miss the Hathaway garden!"
A Must See,This site is an easy walk from the Tourist Information Office. It is very well laid out and there are plenty of guide glad in period costumes to help you understand the many facts about this site. Take time to listen to them and ask questions. They are more than glad to help. This site can be included on a ticket available at the Tourist Office or purchased on site. Expect to spend an hour to get the full experience.
Very old,Interesting and informative and gives a great view of how they all lived in Shakespeare's time and how he was brought up. Well worth a visit.
Well Worth It,This is Shakespeare's childhood home.  It's fun going through the house getting a sense of life in the 16th century.  There's a nice little museum and actors play out parts of Shakespeare's plays in the garden.  The biggest thrill is just knowing you are in a place that was the home of the greatest English playwright.  It feels like something you have to do if you're going to visit this part of England.
History brought to life,First visit to this place and we hope to return in the Spring. A must visit for anyone who loves historic buildings or who has an interest in Shakespeare. Costumed staff demonstrated a wealth of knowledge. Really enjoyable but get there when it opens to avoid the masses of overseas visitors and school parties!
nice display,The 5 pass made for a good value. Interesting details provided by staff located though out house. add words to make it.
Loved it,"Really interesting to see, buy the 5 place ticket deal or this seems expensive. Also includes 12 months entrance so good if close by."
Its rather boring,I fully expected a Shakespeare Play  to be on  or even 14th Century food being served in the Cafe  there are good staff there but there is no good atmosphere  14th Century was bustling with chatter  and Gossip  its totally lacking in enjoyment i think it needs a complete upgrade to 14 Century life
no time to get inside but very nice,We ran out of time after finish our business with our car. We walked past Shakespear's birthplace. Next time we will visit if we are at this town.
"Great place to visit a must really , need to buy a full ticket even if you’re going to visit only 2 places it saves you ","Great place to visit , a must really along with the others , didn’t want to do al 5 as the other 2 are miles out of town"
Must-see in Stratford-Upon -Avon,The Shakespeare Birth House has so much interesting memorabilia and history for the Shakespeare enthusiast! The garden is beautiful also!
Shakespeare’s Birthplace in the heart of Stratford-upon-Avon,Almost everyone who visits Stratford-upon-Avon will visit Shakespeare’s Birthplace and wander the surrounding streets to see the home he grew up in (opposite Hotel Indigo and Guild Chapel) and the School he attended (next to the Chapel) and visit the Royal Shakespeare Theatre for the full experience.The combination of these places allows a form of mental time travel through being in the well preserved environments of long ago.
Excellent and memorable start to the day,We were first in on a sunny Saturday morning. I must say that every member of staff we spoke to were so friendly and kind and especially welcoming to my son who is a toddler. A particular thanks to the gentleman who was in the glove workshop who recited Shakespeare and poetry for me which is something I’ll always remember. He also recommended some excellent Shakespeare books for me too. The shop is lovely and well stocked too. I am very impressed with the value of the ticket and I hope to return before too long. Thank you so much.
A proper look around Stratford-upon-Avon,We recently visited Stratford-upon-Avon with friends for a proper ramble around this beautiful town. We booked the All 5 Houses tickets prior to arriving and found this to be the best way to purchase these. A fantastic weekend looking at the heritage and houses of Shakespeare and his family.
Walking down the memory lane with Shakespeare,"We grew up reading Shakespeare in school so when I got the opportunity to visit Shakespeare's birthplace at Stratford-upon-Avon back in April 2018, I couldn't say no. It's a short trip, about an hour's drive from Birmingham airport. The entire village has its own English countryside charm. There are beautiful shops and restaurants around the main house. There's something enchanting in the air. We bought our tickets on the spot for entry into his house which is converted into a museum. The house might not look very appealing from the outside but it's very beautifully maintained from inside. There are wall book stories, audio-visual displays, pictures, books, his personal belongings etc. My personal favourite was the live reading/enacting of Shakespeare's sonnets right in the centre of the garden - you can request the artists to play your favourite sonnet -If music be the food of love, play on. For an ardent Shakespeare fan, it would only be fair to sum up the visit with one of his quotes...‘For where thou art, there is the world itself, And where thou art not, desolation’RC"
Worth A One Time Stop,See this one time for the bucket list. Won't change much over time. Long long lines of people. The UK has been besieged by tourists.
well worth another visit,we came here to get more info on Shakespeare. The staff were very friendly and very knowlegable. Well worth a visit to see his birthplace
Interesting ,Am glad got to see a little  of such a amazing man who did is still influencing today in the arts etc.Enjoyed  having  guides giving  some history.
Fantastic customer service and a brilliant visit ,"I can not recommend visiting this house highly enough! Our visit was excellent. Due to my visual impairment, I had contacted the site in advance and had received an email straight away from Hannah arranging an audio description tour. Upon arrival we were met by our guide Edwina who was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. She was absolutely marvellous and really brought the house alive. In addition. The actors were fantastic as was the gardens. One of the best accessible museums that I have visited"
Knowledgeable staff,It's best to get the combined ticket if you are visiting more than one Shakespeare location.The staff have good clear information with a bit of humour thrown in.
Mrs gilmore,Enjoyed having a look around been twice the whole place is lovely what with the old buildings even had a nice lunch in a couple of places
Shops and Willy's birth place,"The trust are doing a great job on these sights. This was an amazing building, with lots of interesting facts. I liked the garden sculptures. However, it's busy..as Willy's family home is smack in the middle of a pedestrianized shopping area... So you have to handle the contrast... Between history and commercial trading."
Good value,"Enjoyed the 5 venues very much, we only had a day to fit them all in but just managed it. It was very informative."
Return visit,"We have visited a few times now, but I really enjoy the atmosphere and the friendly and knowledgeable volunteers."
Bard,"This is the place where Bard was born. Great place to dive into history and fascinating world of William Shakespeare. Guys and gals in the house are very kind and talk lot of stories about the place and the history of it's famous tenant. If you become a member of Shakespeare Birthplace Society, you can enter the rest of the places related to Shakespeare free."
Beautiful house,"This is a really beautiful place to visit, I couldn’t enter as I’m on training but as soon as we finished we went around and came across this.It’s around £20 entry and I would come back and visit for a couple of days to enjoy this town more."
Intresting place...,"Very intresting place at the heart of Stratford, very busy but not over crowded, on the day we attended we watched 2 ladies perform some Shakespeare Scripts and thought that was brillaint!Hopefully will be back over Christmas to tour the other houses."
Unplanned Visit,We were staying in Coventry for a football event and decided to take a trip to Stratford-upon-Avon. Absolutely lovely place the food market was amazing. We decided to visit Shakespeare's birth place and loved it. Will definitely visit again and see the other houses.
A pilgrimmage site for all Shakespeare fans,"The best thing about Shakeseare's Birthpace is the use of very knowledgeable actors around the place. I'd been trying to get to see the place for years during my many trips, but had always run out of time (they close at 5pm, so it never really fit my own schedule). I'm very glad I finally made it; I am a lifelong follower of old Willy Wagglestaff, but I felt it was one of those places I can say, ""OK I've done that now."" The folks in the rooms in costume were great, though, and I wish we had had the time to linger longer."
Very informative attraction,Visited Shakespeare’s Birthplace yesterday with my wife and our newborn. It was a fantastic experience - as most of you would have studied shakespeare this is a great experience to understand our national bard. The only negative is that you cannot take a pram/pushchair around the house. Very understandable as it is very narrow and historic. But just a warning to be prepared to carry your little one around the house.Thank you to all the actors and historians who were working at there yesterday. Everyone we met was fantastic!
Awful value for the price,"£17.50 for what takes no longer than 15-20 minutes is appalling. here appeared to be zero artefacts of Shakespeare himself but lots of stuff inspired by him, even a Star Wars poster ffs.  The guides were nice enough but even then for instance the ""birthroom"" was where they thought he may have been born.  A tourist trap that I wish I had avoided."
Worth every penny,"Apart from the difficulty staff at the first home had issuing the tickets (the trip advisor purchase is a voucher not tickets -     if you tell them this it will be quicker), everything was great. The homes are interesting, informative and great to walk around. I would recommend buying a hop on/off bus tour ticket as the car parks at the homes are small or non-existent.Even two 15year olds loved the trip."
Nice but short,Nice to suit house but we thought it very expensive at 17.50 each for a quick walk around. You can buy a ticket to visit the farm cottage and new place and see all three which is much better value.
Great attraction ,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Shakespeare’s birthplace, the tour of the house was fascinating, the exhibits displayed were very interesting and there were actors reacting scenes from various Shakespeare’s plays."
T’is Exceptional Value methinks ,"This ticket really is a must buy. It gives you a full year’s worth of learning about Shakespeare, his birth, his life in Stratford-upon Avon delivered with amazing knowledge and enthusiasm by Shakespeare Birthplace Trust staff. We went to his birthplace, New Place, Hall’s  Croft and had a lovely Sunday stroll to Anne Hathaway’s cottage too. We can return anytime in the next 12 months for Mary Arden’s farm and to revisit any aspect of what we’ve seen already. It contributed to a joyous weekend. Highly recommended"
Holiday,"Beautiful house, staff very knowledgeable. Very atmospheric house, lots to see.Original cottage garden, with many herbs and old trees. Performance space in the garden, where young actors performed Shakespeare."
"""Some are born great, some achieve greatness and some have greatness thrust upon them."" (William Shakespeare)",This historical site in Stratford upon Avon must be one of the main reasons visitors flock to this picturesque part of the country. On entering lots of information about the great man himself before you enter the cottage of his birth. We were led into the cottage by a lady dressed in 16th century attire. She gave us a detailed and interesting account of Shakespeare's life at the cottage and on looking around was able to look at and examine lots of artefacts. I couldn't help feeling chuffed that I was walking on the same flagstones that Shakespeare walked upon. I was actually walking on and through history.
Impressive place and town ,"We absolutely loved it, what a fantastic opportunity to revisit Shakespeare town, places he grew up and worked.. we took full advantage of it and purchased all tours, it’s worth it, you need a whole day or two to see it all, we got Annual membership, so will be back for second time 😉"
Great experiance.,"Make the most of shakespeare experiance by getting a ticket online which allows you to visit all 5 houses, its well worth it, and if you have children they will love the farm."
Shakespear experience,"All I really want to say is, what a great history have, I can only recomment Stratford on Avon to anyone who is proud of our litral history."
Good visit ,Was nice to see the history resolving around the poet. Was a nice half an hour touring round and viewing the history boards. Would recommend if you was interested in history and Shakespeare.
So informative,I learned so much and saw more than I ever imagined I would. Don’t miss the opportunity to see where Shakespeare was born and  to learn about his life and his work.
Excellent ,"This was such an amazing experience, this site along with all the others included in the full ticket price was and is well worth the money and time spent, we learnt so much over the few days we took to visit the 5 different Birth trust sites included and feel we have more to learn, we got a free 24 month pass when agreeing to gift aid and we will be using this again I’m sure."
From outside ,"Only saw from the outside, but love the look of this old timbered Tudor building.  Rent in the adjoining gift shop which was bursting with tourists buying Shakespeare artefacts."
Its eye opening,Its cheap for a full story family ticket and you can visit throughout the year. Which is excellent and the history behind everything is truly eye opening.
Excellent tour,This was a lot better than I thought. Very informative especially the glove maker. Gardens lovely and a small performance going on as as well  very friendly staff
History at its best,This is a great tribute and excellent facility to one of the worlds greatest writers. The tour is interactive and provides a great insight to life in his time
Excellent visit,"We started with a mini museum, followed by a 15 minute cinema, entertained by competent guides and actors performing Skaespears work and lovely gardens. Highly reccomend but get there early. Within 90 minutes the venue was quite busy. Thank you to the Actresses on the day, they involved me and it was great fun, Thank you.  Enjoy!"
JUST FANTASTIC,"I’ve visited Shakespeare’s birthplace on numerous occasions (I hope that says something)Everytime I visit I see something different.Thats the beauty of this fascinating landmark.The guides are so well up on the history,so it’s worth while listto these guys for a very informative tour."
Brilliant ,"This is such a great place. Not only the house but also the walk through museum beforehand. So much information. The house and the info is so great. Definitely worth getting the ticket that allows you to visit the other places, like New House and Anne Hathaway’s Cottage (stunning!) plus it lasts a year!"
Birthplace of shakespeare,Brilliant place to visit if history is your thing 2nd time of being here loving the atmosphere / the sheer enthusiasm of the people that work there brilliant
Walking Through History But Not Sure It's Worth the Price of Admission,"As a lover of history, I enjoyed visiting the home of the legendary playwright. However, once inside there really isn't a whole lot to see and you can buzz through the house in 10 minutes. Not sure if it's worth the $20 price of admission even with the small museum at the start. However, it becomes much more palatable if you purchase the $27 ticket that allows you to visit all 5 Shakespeare properties including Anne Hathaway's Cottage which I found much more interesting and enjoyable. If this is the only property you're visiting, taking a photo of the exterior might suffice."
Literature’s iconic birthplace finds more stories,"Before entering you can enjoy displays of the immense  chronological  work and impact of his penNumerous Phases and words used today are quoting Shakespeare The “3” cottages are well wornAmazing knowledge when engaging the docents on history. Enjoy the now removed Visitor’s Windows on display with many other famous people have visited that house, and scratched their names into the windows in the house - forever leaving their mark on history. Some of these people include Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Charles Dickens, and Walter Scott. Outside short skit performances are “audience participation”The garden is manicured but small. Walk down the street to very large outdoor garden if that is your likingThe book store is a must with delicate to amusing soveniers"
Bard Bonding,"Spent the a great couple of hours hours here and thoroughly enjoyed it. When you start the tour round spend time watching the video wall, it really adds to the visit and reminds you of the reach of Shakespeare.The gardens are lovely and the addition of actors reciting parts from his plays while you are there really adds to feeling of history. There is a real feeling that the Shakespeare Trust that look after buildings care deeply about what they do and want you to enjoy it as much as they do. Well done to all those who put in the effort. 👍🏻"
Bored from Bard,"A bit too busy for me really , sorry. Far too many people making this visit a bit frustrating . Think about your visiting time before you decide."
Excellent,A fascinating attraction. Interesting and informative. We bought the full ticket which allowed access to 5 Shakespeare attractions. Well worth the extra few pounds. Would recommend
 Very interesting visit and history,"Started our trip to Stratford here and bought a family ticket for £59 to enable us to visit all 5 Shakespeare locations. The birthplace was quite busy and I would have liked to spend more time reading the history boards, but felt a little rushed through by the lines and lines of other visitors also making their way through the house.  Beautiful garden also with a couple of actors acting a few scenes from different plays in the garden. Very cool!"
Very interesting with nice gardens,Visited this site as part of our bus tour. Really enjoyed the tour and how the site is laid out. Fun watching some of the actors outside performing some Shakespeare dialogue.Very informative and interesting to see the house and learn about the family history. Well worth a stop and visit.
Very informative and beautiful gardens.,Every half hour they have an informative session on Shakespeare’s birth place and gives you a very good idea of his life. You visit the beautiful manicured gardens. A must for every visitor to Stratford upon Avon.
Good as part of the full story package,"If you like your history delivered by actors in period costume then this place is for you. I'd rather look at genuine exhibits at my own pace. This is Shakespeare's father's house. Shakespeare was probably born here but no one can be certain. The house is furnished as it might have been in Shakespeare's life time but there is very little that has anything directly to do with him, which isn't surprising as he became famous later in life, so nothing remains from his early years. So basically you get an impression of what life would have been like for him. If you are interested you can find out something about glove making, his father's profession.Make sure you buy the ""full story"" ticket which gives you entry to all five Shakespeare Trust locations as the price just to enter this museum simply isn't worth it. Some of the other places are much more interesting."
Shakespeare’s houses,"Visited Stratford recently with my teenage daughter. We visited all of the Shakespeare houses. Anne Hathaway’s cottage & Arden’s farm were the most enjoyable. The member of staff at new place who gave an introductory talk was very informative & easy to listen too. Worth catching the talk otherwise you may not fully understand the history of the place. All in all a very enjoyable day. We booked the combined tickets online, just be aware that the cottage & farm are out of town. They were a short drive from the centre, but too far to walk unless you have plenty of time."
Good,"Amazingly informative. Lovely experience. Not great for little ones. However, great staff. Definitely worth it."
Brilliant ,"A wonderful visit the guides are passionate, friendly and know their stuff, would recommend getting the ticket to visit all 5 properties as it’s well worth it."
History at its best!,"We bought a ticket that included visiting everywhere in the Shakepeare Trust. It works out much cheaper. This place tells you all the history of William Shakespeare. The staff really know their stuff and to see the house with its rooms, momentoes & gardens, is amazing! I've never seen a Mulberry tree before, so watch out for it."
Must see attraction in Stratford,"Shakespeare's birthplace is in the middle of Stratford and is a true representation of life in Shakespeare's day. Must see attraction but long queues in the mornings - so an afternoon visit is desirable if you hate queueing.New Hall is where Shakespeare is meant to have lived for some 18 years. However it is a disappointment in that the actual building no longer exists, having been demolished a century or so ago.Shakespeare's schoolhouse is another must visit place (close by New Hall), but it is not part of the Shakespeares' birthplace ticket. You have to pay separately at the door but well worth it. You are invited to attend a typical class in the school which shows the learning style of the day.Anne Hathaway's cottage is a delightful place and also well worth visiting, although it is some 3 miles outside of town."
Shakespeare’s birthplace,"Expertly furnished rooms, well written, historical information and knowledgeable guides. Plus beautiful gardens and live Shakespearean actors! SO good!"
SHALL I COMPARE THEE,"Today we were treated to an unusual pleasure. At Shakespeare' s birthplace, we encountered a guide, who was able to deliver to us the sonnet, Shall I compare thee to a summer's day, in beautiful, perfect German. This gentleman was a graduate of German and French, who loved the potential of his role as a guide, to speak in many languages. We were delighted with him. It felt as if he had just stepped off the stage in Hamburg to perform for us. Danke"
Historic place well kept,"It seems to be the only place linked to the life of Shakespeare, a great writer but small place with high commercialisation, may be to attract more visitors, but the surrounding town is very scenery and canal side is worth the visit, so one must go with enough time to enjoy the canal arear too"
Its historical place with more commercialisation,"Its historic place being birth place and only place still in original shape for famous writer and historian, but the commercialisation of place is high, may be just to earn more money. The town surrounding it is far nicer and worth the visit too"
Amazing,"If you are into Shakespeare, then this is a must go. But of course, an amazing place comes with a pricey ticket. I would suggest to go for the full package (more value for money) and spend a day there. Unfortunately, I have only time to visit one place and thus, have to pay for the high price."
Brilliant!!!!!,"Fantastic value ticket for 5 venues ,ticket also lasts 12 months . We went last year and visited 2 and we will be going back this year to do the other 3"
Another wonderful gem,"Visited on 04/08  with the family, including 13 + 9 yr olds. Very interesting and definitely worth the 5 centre family ticket. This is a must for the Shakespeare experience and clearly very popular. The house is part of a full walk through with educational centre to start before entering the gardens and actual house. The house and staff are excellent and you do get the ambience of the time and how hard life must have been. From the house you reenter the gardens and we took advantage of two very articulate and interesting actors who recreate some of the Bards works. Excellent!"
Shakespeare Lite,"A great introduction to Shakespeare, with a lightweight, 15-minute introductory film, on loop, which gives an idea of the impact that Shakespeare's work has had. A room can be booked for non-English-speaking groups, where a translated version of the film can be shown."
Interestimg,"Shakespeare's house was huge and medevial. I hoped to have the opportunity to discover the Elizabethan house so on that point, it was disappointing. Still, I learnt loads of things about Shakespeare and the house's gardens were cool.If you go to Stratford upon Avon you must go there.P.S. the entrance tickets are quite expensive."
Birthplace of a literary genius,I cheated somewhat and didn't pay to get in! I just enjoyed looking at the beautiful timber building being selfie-d to death by tourists. Its set in a beautiful street with lots of lovely shops and a museum or two. From the river its not more than a gentle 5-10 minute walk.
Wonderful- Time and Time Again,"In the centre of Stratford on Henley street is this wonderful house. You can enter and experience how Shakespeare would have spent his younger years in Stratford. The staff in each room of this fascinating home are knowledgable and pleasant.If you prefer to wander and not speak to anyone there are plenty of boards with information about Shakespeare’s life.Recently they have added a Shakespeare exhibition before entering the house covering Shakespeare across the years and as represented across the world. You can view historical artefacts and get acquainted with his life and works.In the garden actors roam and perform Shakespeare on request for you. You could happily sit there for hours, listen and watch.You exit through the gift shop which has memorabilia for all budgets.  Ticket prices for the house are around 17.50 for adults and 11.50 for children, but you can visit unlimited times for a whole year. What is even better is that you can buy the houses pass online for around 22.50 for adults and 14.50 for children and this all paws access to all the Shakespeare properties.  Again with unlimited return for the year. There is no immediate parking as this is on a pedestrianised street. However, there are multiple carparks in Stratford. We use the one at the visitor centre. It is about 15 minutes to Henley street but it’s a nice walk up through Stratford and allows you to get your bearings. Mobility wise, there are stairs to view the upper part of the property and the floors are old and uneven. Finally, the pennies you pay go to the conservation of this landmark, so it’s seems that little bit more worth it to preserve our heritage."
Great expirience,This is a great experience and very informative. The staff very knowledgeable. With plenty of entertainment to enjoy. The shop was great too. Staff were helpful and friendly. The price was reasonable with other attractions.
Bard's birth place ,"Brilliant insight into Shakespeare's life. The interactive elements very good at are the re enactors, and guides throughout the property"
Large Queues,"I’m not sure I enjoyed it more than the other Shakespeare attractions mainly because of the large queues and crowds, so you only really get a quick walk through of the house, the guides were engaging and informative, but it is busy."
A very special day ,"What a beautiful place, and very reasonably priced especially with the tickets lasting a year. So if you don’t get everything done you can always come back.The visitors centre, where you buy your tickets is lovely and clean and the staff are friendly and helpful. Walk through to the gardens and there are actors performing acts from Shakespeare, a real treat. The gardens are beautiful and very well kept.The house itself is steeped in history and there are guides dotted around who will tell you bits about it. A lovely visit, we will return."
Very interesting lots to see,"We visited here while in Stratford , we found that it would of been even more expensive if we hadn’t of purchased a family ticket to allow us to visit 5 different sights in Stratford although we only visited 3 of them on this day the tickets do last a year so we will have to go again to see the 2 we missed , it is worth a visit we went on a fairly busy day but enjoyed the day there this was worth a trip if you want to know a bit more of Shakespeare and his life"
Hard to write a review,Me and Becky visited and it is the birthplace to Britain’s most well known bard and that is it. Think Stratford is quite rightly milking this fact
Shakespeare houses - all worth a visit,"Shakespeare's birthplace is scared ground surely for any fan of literature.  The house is fairly basic if you are familiar with 16th century architecture (if not, it will be a treat).  In the garden actors recite sonnets and enact famous Shakespeare scenes which are hugely entertaining. Mary Arden's House has a Tudor Farm, complete with real-life kitchen where they cook potage over an open fire and have live falconry.  Ann Hathaway's cottage has a beautiful cottage garden.  Hall's Croft and New Place lhave ovely gardens too. Once you have seen one tudor house you might find them a bit 'samey' but they all have something different to interest you.  The guides are also very welcoming and have loads to tell you about the houses. (Whilst in town don't miss a trip up the theatre tower for a decent view of the river and South Warwickshire.)"
Shakespeare birthplace,I felt that this was a big disappointment and there was very little to see. It was expensive for what you got. Expect to queue if you go at peak times.
Nice history place,Great place to explore especially if Shakespeare had been part of your life at some time or another. Spoke alot of his life and childhood etc. Stratford upon avon itself is also beautiful and a good place for just chilling out.
"Well worth the visit., even if you’re not into Shakespeare",The introduction film is interesting. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Such great history on display. Loved the Shakespeare actors in the garden.
Bring Shakespeare to life,Use the park and ride to get into centre max cost £3. Need to return by approx 18.30. Start at the birthplace. Definitely watch the 15 min video in the exhibition. Easy walk to New Place and Halls Croft.  Buy the official guide at your first stop as leads you to see other Shakespeare related buildings. Ticket for all places good value and definitely helps to use consecutive days. Guides at Anne Hathaways Cottage especially good and answered all questions. Did not go to the farm. Loved all the gardens and many Shakespeare references.
Really nice piece of history to explore!,"Honestly, I didn't expect much from this - as I've been to many birthplaces of people in my lifetime, and generally find them dry and dull.  But not this place.  It was really very good!  Especially as we'd already spent a day at Mary Arden's Farm - which meant we had learned a lot about Shakespeare and his family - so were able to tie it a bit more together.  We found the staff interesting and helpful, as well.  If this is all we'd visited of the trio of historic houses, I don't think we'd have been quite so interested.  But if you visit all three, you start to get a more developed picture, which makes it all that more interesting.  We also found that if your child is a member of the Young Archaeologist's Club, there are discounts available.  Which is very nice.  Plus, so is being a member of YAC!  So, if you have a child interested in all things historical and archaeological, find your local YAC group!  :)  Then, head on over to Stratford-upon-Avon, and learn a bit about Shakespeare!"
Great attraction,"Booked this within an offer of the five Shakespear venues, what value and with the bus that drops and picks up at each venue it was great managed this with Anne Hathaways house and Mary Ardens house as well as the other places on the list.  Fabulous a must do thing on any trip to Stratford"
Worth visiting ,"This is my second time visiting Shakespeare’s Birthplace, and it’s truly a fantastic experience. The staff are knowledgeable and helpful, and it’s great to see the place where the Bard was born. A must if you’re visiting Stratford-Upon-Avon!"
Best of The Bard.,"Stratford is gorgeous, even if you weren't visiting for Shakespeare's house etc. Beautiful lake, RST and various installations in the park area. My teenage daughter was very impressed that some of the older buildings now housed modern shop etc and were put to good use. We bought tickets for all five places to visit but only managed three due to time, really need a couple of days to fit it all in. Fascinating insight into his life, loves and works. We stayed in a Premier Inn,(there's two of them in Stratford) which was great, good food, bed, shower and staff."
Got to see but very busy,You can’t go to Stratford without visiting the birthplace of the great man. Now a shopping promenade set around the history building. Lots of tourists and tourist traps. Can be expensive due to the massive number of foreign visitors. Recommend non the less!
well kept,Lovely old house to look around only down fall is it can get very busy with  groups going round but enjoyable place to see
Overcrowded and overpriced ,"Thought this might be an interesting place to visit on our holiday. £22.50 each, a little steep to be ushered around in 20 mins and no guides to give any info."
Revised ,When to see this when I was 11 with a school trip and was just as beautiful 55yrs later did not get inside this time but the atmosphere was beautiful
Touching History,"A fantastic experience, actually being in the place where Shakespeare was born and feeling so connected with his life. The house is beautifully preserved and so are the gardens, especially the ancient mulberry tree. The guides are friendly and helpful, and actors in the garden bring the Bard's words to life for you, making the whole experience really immersive.Unfortunately it's probably not possible to avoid the crowds and the school groups at any time of the year, due the popularity of the attraction, so probably best to go in the summer when the weather is good and the garden at its best.The All 5 houses ticket is well worth getting and certainly represebts excellent value."
Very central,"Definitely worth buying the ticket that gives access to several sites. A very interesting building, the staff are very helpful and knowledgeable."
"Go Early! quieter, calmer and more time with the guides","Not sure where to start on this, the building itself is absolutely breathtaking. entry to the birthplace is via a visitor centre where you can purchase tickets and guide books. we got to the property really early (just before 9am) and had a lovely walk around the exhibition before being overcome with tourists as we ventured towards the house itself. unfortunately this particular group were quite rude so we held back and let them get a head start on us - we were so glad we did as we had a lovely talk to the guides around the house and learned some of the history of the property and interesting facts about Shakespeare's family and early life.  outside on the day we visited were a group of 4 very talented performers and they gave our children a lot of fuss and even performed a request (macbeth of course). felt magical and the people who work here really seem to care about the visitors."
Great value,"The ticket covering all 5 locations is excellent value - and it's valid for a full year! We saw the Birthplace Museum, Anne Hathaway's Cottage and Mary Arden's Farm, and all of them were really interesting in their different ways. Quite apart from the history of each location and the various exhibits, there were so many activities going on: Shakespeare sonnets and play extracts performed at the Birthplace Museum, the staff at the Farm cooking and eating a Tudor dinner, with commentary from the master, and all the mistresses staying in character - we could have spent hours more at each location if we had had the time."
Worth a visit ,"We went here at May bank holiday weekend, we didn’t go inside but it was nice to see the birth place of William, there is also a Christmas shop and a gift shop."
the bed in which he was born,It was fun seeing the bed in which the Bard was born and to talk to the staff and learn fact about life back then.
A partially informative visit with a poor start,"I suggest access to the Birthplace could be improved by allowing faster entry for people who have pre-paid tickets. The Birthplace itself is a mixture of contemporary and period which doesn't allow visitors to get a feeling of living at the time the bard was born. Nevertheless it still offers a glimpse into the 'environment' the bard lived - which to us was precious. The costumed attendants inside the house were most helpful and they gave us an insight of what living in the house would have been like. However, we did feel somewhat cheated as, despite being a historical heavyweight, the Birthplace fails to give the visitors a feeling of what it was to live at the time (something that Hall's Croft achieves much more successfully). I suggest this is because a big part of the Birthplace (entrance hall / exhibition, gardens etc) is painfully modern - something that could easily be remedied. Remarkably there was no information whatsoever about the way children (in this case, the Bard) would have spent their days at home. We were shown were it's believed Shakespeare was born, where the family room was, where John Shakespeare's workspace was - but what did William do as a child at home? Did he have any toys? What were they? Did he have to work? In the end, that's why we, as visitors, are there - to gain an insight into Shakespeare's early years!"
Another Great Experience,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit.  There were guides throughout, dressed the part, ready and willing to tell us the story of the time and what happened each room. We were especially interested in the glove room.  It was very well done."
I.learned.so.much,"The hubs had to train to Manchester for work so I went to Aylesbury to visit friends. We drove and parked at the park and ride (so cheap, so easy) and spent a glorious day in Stratford-upon-Avon. I cannot even begin to describe the day. We started at the birthplace which was just all the feels of England. Tudor-style buildings galore, awesome hands on experiences in each location for little ones, and just soaking in some beautiful Englishness at its finest. The birthplace is beautifully restored with period furniture. The gardens are to die for and the gift shop are 10/10. The onsite free tour guides are so knowledgeable and full of personality. We meandered about town and made stops at the birthplace, Costa coffee (British Starbucks,) a lovely pizza place, Trinity Church (sooooooooo worth it,) and Anne Hathaway's cottage (a gorgeous 20 minute stroll outside of town.) Just....please...do this trip. You won't be disappointed."
"Overcrowded, uninspiring, overpriced",Title says it all. £18 to battle through school children and see a house that shakespeare may have been born in but doesn't contain any actual Shakespeare artefacts.
Wonderful History,"It was wonderful seeing Shakespeare's home and the beautiful gardens. While we were there a small part of Romeo and Juliet was being played out by two actors, who were quite funny. A must do."
A must when visiting Stratford,It was amazing to actually be in this building. The staff were helpful without being intrusive. A must if visiting Stratford
Not to be missed if you visit Stratford,This should be your first stop as it sets the scene for every other location.  Buy the ticket that gives access to all 5 of the family homes.
Quick visit to Stratford,We were only here for a couple of days so booked this in conjunction with the red bus service which at 3 per hour allowed us to hop on and off at all the five Shakespear venues.Ideal and great value for money on the individual ticket prices
Great overview of Shakespeare's life and works,"The tour of Shakespeare's birthplace isn't just a walk through his home. It begins with a great museum that has several artifacts, including an early bound copy of his works, and an audiovisual display with readings from his plays. Once through this area, you enter a garden courtyard outside his family home, and from there enter the house. Guides are there to tell you a little about each room (and to stagger groups so there aren't too many inside at any time), and you go upstairs and down. Each room is furnished as it might have been during his lifetime. Outside again after the house tour, there were a group of actors in costume enlisting members of the audience to play parts in scenes from his plays (it was a lot of fun). Very nice place to visit."
Interesting place ,We went with friends and kids. Found the place to be really interesting and easy going. Good give shop although one of the shop assistant was very unhelpful to not just us but quite a few people. Was disappointing she was there as spoiled the very nice experience up to meeting her.
Stratford's favorite Son,"As we didn't arrive until after closing, we only saw the house from the street. Still it was somewhat awe inspiring to stand at the site where one of the world's greatest literary figures was born."
Must See Place,"Smack bang in the centre of the town this is every visitor's destination of choice, mostly for photographs and selfies! There is much more to see in the town to do with Shakespeare.we booked aprivate guide it was hugely informative and much more enjoyable."
Fantastic day out,"WE went here for the day, very intresting, we went to 4 of the houses, not the farm. The staff were great ver informative, ground lovely. easy to get to. disbaled parkling at the back of the shakespeare birth place.The history and presance about this place/ town was magical.Thank you for a great day we will be back.WE used our tesco clubcard vouchers for a annual ticket for all houses etc. well worth it!"
So much history!,"We visited Shakespeare's Birthplace and were really impressed with the video display and the artifacts - a great deal of time and effort has gone into preserving all this history and information.  Would suggest buying the 5 location Shakespeare's Family Homes ticket at the TI Office to save some money, instead of buying a ticket at each location.  Concession (Seniors) tickets are available."
Steeped in history,"A great visit, I hadn’t realised that Shakespeare was not poor. The house reflects the status he achieved and some of his lifestyle. Whilst the house can be crowded at peak times the garden is pleasant and when we were there 2 actors were performing extracts from his plays. A wonderful experience for Shakespeare fans."
For the fans,"If you are in SVA, likely it’s because you’ve heard of Shakespeare. It’s nice how they have constructed a theme park using mostly his reputation and literary works but you will enjoy the references and the memorabilia knock-offs scattered all over. Good way to spend a day."
A Treat for Lovers of History and Literature,"Shakespeare’s Birthplace - All 5 Houses is really great value and a must if you love history and are a lover of Shakespeare. Not only is the experience amazing from a historical perspective (a lot of it preserved in its original form), you get to ‘walk’ in Shakespeare’s footsteps, learn a lot more about his life and also learn about the world in which he inhabited and wrote his masterpieces. It is an enchanting step back into another world, another time and it gives you a true sense of Tudor England. I highly recommend this experience - it is unforgettable."
Back to Ancient times,"It was facinating seeing the birthplace of William Shakespear. You get plenty of information from the guides inside the house dressed in clothes from that time period. We also experienced actors performing parts of Shakespears plays, some set in modern settings and situations.A wonderfull experience."
Nothing spectacular ,Go only if you must. Good for a day trip but nothing there that will blow you away. Shakespeare homes are great but don’t feel bad if you are unable to fit this into your schedule. Give time to other places and experiences in England.
Very interesting,Loved the guys at the end would did a scene from much ado for us!They were the highlight but rest of place good as well.
Insight Vacation tours,Excellent. Makes Shakespeare’s boyhood experience come to life. Must see the graffiti in the windows of his home and much more.
