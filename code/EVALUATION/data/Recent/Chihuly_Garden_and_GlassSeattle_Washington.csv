A must see,I’m local to the Seattle area and anytime I have family or friends visiting from out of town Chihuly is a must go! Sometimes I take them there more for me lol.
Views,Great views and strict covid precautions taken. Bit of a wait for the lift but safety comes first. Wanted to change our time slot due to bad weather and the staff were super helpful.
Breathtaking,Beautiful handmade art that is so breathtaking! Vivid colors and to top it off a live demonstration was provided!
Interesting attraction,This is about the same inside as the Chihuly museum in St Petersburg FL. but the outside or garden is worth the trip to see.
Good experience but not a good value,"The glass blowing is amazing but overall its a pretty short experience. The cost is very high, so ultimately I would not recommend doing this just from a value standpoint. If money is no object then it is a pretty cool place to spend 45 min to an hour."
Very colorful place,"If you love glass art then come to Chihuly Garden. Lots of different glass installations around every corner. Loved garden,heard it lights up at night. Did not enjoy employees chasing people because they lowered their mask to drink water. It was a hot day. There are mini talks in different rooms and glass blowing demonstrations. Buy tickets as a combo with needle or citipass, you will save some money."
Beautiful Gettaway In The City,We really loved this experience. I am a big Chihuly fan so this was at the top of my list of things to do in Seattle and it did not disappoint. I hope to return in the future!
Amazing museum—vivid colors and forms,"I was visiting Seattle solo and bought the combined Space Needle/Chihuly gardens and glass ticket.  What a fantastic afternoon.  The Chihuly gardens and glass were amazing!  A great solo activity.You start in the indoor museum, which walks you through Chihuly’s career.  It’s very impressive without being overwhelming.  One of the first galleries shows beautiful vases inspired by baskets; in this same room, there’s a gorgeous wall of another Pacific NW work of art, the Pendleton blanket.  And then there are some jaw-dropping galleries:  one with a boisterously colorful ceiling of flowers; another with a huge line of “Mille fille,” in a dazzling array of forms and colors; one with a big boat full of colorful balls and other forms; another full of enormous vases.  It is visually stunning, and there’s just the right amount of information to accompany each gallery.  Then you step into the gardens, which are beautiful in and of themselves, with Chihuly’s forms of various sizes dotting and complementing the landscape, all in the shadow of the Space Needle.  What an artist!  The photography opportunities are outstanding, too.You end your visit with a gift shop (per usual for museums); this one had a very nice selection of Chihuly-inspired stationary, calendars, etc., and I obtained a couple of gifts.A really nice visit.  Put this on your “must do” list for Seattle.  People of all ages and types will be amazed by the art, either for its color, form, or technical achievement."
Wow,A must see and visit. Combine your visit with the space needle.  I recommend taking time to watch the videos and to take in the glass blowing demonstration.  The shear scale of the art is amazing. The garden area is a beautiful balance between natural and man made art
Good for artistic eyes,"I purchased the space needle and Chihuly garden combo tour - so the entrance fee to Chihuly gardens was just a few dollars extra. We did the space needle one evening and were able to use the ticket the next day for the garden. We were told you can use the ticket within 24 hours. The glass art and sculptures were amazing and unique - defiantly good for the artistic eye. We completed the tour in less than an hour. Travelled with adults, seniors and teenagers. Would not have paid full ticket price for this tour."
Amazing glass sculptures,"If you are in Seattle, you really need to visit Chihuly Garden and Glass. Absolutely amazing glass sculptures and beautiful gardens. One of the highlights of our trip."
Great Experience,"I was initially skeptical, but this exhibit was far more interesting than I anticipated.  The artwork is well displayed.  I particularly liked the outdoor garden pieces."
Beautiful museum and garden,"The artist and his glass works were unfamiliar before visiting Seattle, but I really enjoyed this facility and it’s outdoor gardens. The artist’s work also appears at the Bellagio hotel garden in Las Vegas."
Awesome restaurant,"Now, this review was based on a visit a LONG time ago (a little before covid), but let me just say, the service in the restaurant was amazing. My sister ate some of the bread off my hamburger, and as I complained to her about it, a waiter actually came over and got me free bread. To replace the bread my SISTER ate. Everything else was absolutely beautiful and a sight worth seeing."
Great place,"tbh i really just wrote this so i would be the 20,000 5 star review but fr this was a great experience and there was this place in the museum where they were making glass sculptures like you in a restaurant where they make the food in front of u all in all nice experience"
Someplace unique to see,"I would not have chosen a place like this to see on my own. Not into museum, but this place is AMAZING!  I’m glad the opportunity came with the space needle and we chose to go."
Absolutely Beautiful!,"It's been on my bucket list to visit the Chihuly Garden in Seattle for a while, ever since I visited one of his traveling exhibits 15 years ago. I was not disappointed. Each room in the museum was more vibrant and stunning than the room before it and I've never seen anything like the garden itself. Chihuly's work is so gorgeous and unique and it was a privilege to see his permanent exhibit. I had two friends with me who had never heard of Chihuly and humored me on this tour and even they walked away in awe of his talent and imagination!"
Long-awaited visit to Dale Chihuly's permanent exhibit in Seattle.,"Since leaving the Chicago Park Garfield Conservatory glasshouse in 2001 awed by the Chihuly glass sculptures we had vowed to visit his Sea-Tac studio or workplace. His ""Garden Cycle"" of exhibits has since been take to 10 other garden settings  around the US and is currently in New Orleans Fortunately, we were finally able to travel to Seattle and we knew he had established this permanent exhibit in 2012 and visiting the Chihuly Garden and Glass was one the top activities of our to-do list.  We bought our tickets on-line.  This visit took place pre-COVID so please check their website for the current procedures and precautions. It was everything we had expected and hoped for when it came to the displays of Dale Chihuly's glass sculptures. His artistic vision - clearly not impaired by the loss of his left eye in a 1976 car accident - is unique and awe-inspiring.  The colors and shapes are further enhanced by the settings, indoors and outside in the garden, the use of both strategically placed lighting as well as darkness, and mirrors.  Be sure to read the descriptions of each of the exhibits in the galleries.  The massive  100-foot long hanging sculpture of the glasshouse is almost too large to take in a single glance.We were able to catch a part of the glass-blowing presentation; we have seen glass-blowing before but the skill needed to see and manipulate the molten glass to create such beautiful objects never fails to fascinate.Be sure to dine at Collections Café; we had an excellent lunch there during our visit."
One of the most spectacular places I have seen -Chihuly Garden and Glass,"The glass show is incredible, not seen anything like it anywhere I have travelled. I was mesmerised by some of the exhibits, truly spectacular"
WOW,A must see in Seattle. I could have spent all day in the gardens! Such beautiful works and picturesque scenes.
Beyond expectations,"This is an exhibit unlike any other we've seen, and we've been to the Corning Museum of Glass which is excellent. The vision, imagination, skill, artistry and dimension of this exhibit cannot be communicated in a few words. You must experience it to understand what this is about. The artist has taken us to new worlds and given us race of sentient beings in the form of glass and color. But the scale is what you must see. Truly extraordinary."
"Beautiful, but not Exceptional","The Chihuly museum has some beautiful works of art in it, and it's in a super convenient location if you're doing multiple things downtown. However, I'm not sure there's enough material to warrant the cost.I would definitely NOT recommend coming with younger children."
incredible Experience,"This place is absolutely amazing.  I have never seen anything like it.  The artist  is incredibly talented.  The gardens are amazing.  We watched a glass blowing presentation that was fun and  informative.  This is a dying art...so glad to see that is is still being taught.  If you are interested in the Space Needle, it is right next to it and you can buy a combo ticket.  This is a must while in Seattle."
incredible glass art,Went through the garden and inside in about an hour. Fyi- they are exceptionally strict about face masks so be careful and pay attention so it doesn’t slip below your nose.
Beautiful museum doing state-of-the-art disinfection,"This has always been one of my top recommendations for visitors, I love the glass art.  I read all about their ""Elevating Clean"" initiative to make the indoor spaces as safe as possible, and I have to say I'm impressed.  They have invested heavily in technology, including UVC and far-UVC, for cleaning the air, surfaces, and even visitors.  They seem serious about requiring everyone to properly wear masks, and are disinfecting continuously.   Kudos to them for doing everything possible to operate safely in these trying times!"

Horrible,Avoid this place at ALL cost!!! The security will kick you out regardless of wearing a mask! waste of money! The same people here work at the space needle and will track you down. It is crazy.
Pleasant surprise,"We didnt plan to visit but combo ticket was better value. So glad we did, some lovely peices and amazing colours. Lots of space and not rushed, even grumpy teens enjoyed strolling a while."
Incredible- more worth a visit than the space needle ,If I had to choose one or the other I’d choose this over the Space Needle. Get the combo tickets- that’s an icon so you have to visit but this is the real deal. If I come to Seattle again we’ll be going again. I’ve never seen anything like and probably never will again. We have 7 & 10 yr old boys and they were pretty impressed too. Younger than 6 might be more stressful than worth it though.
"Okay, but not worth the price.","This review was during COVID. While the art was pretty cool I just didn't think it warranted the price tag of $35+ per person. I've been to much better museums for way cheaper and that had more to offer. That being said it was still 'ok' but it was one that was observed in like 15-20 minutes. The pictures are alluring, I'll admit though."
Beautiful and overpriced!,"I was really looking forward to the Chihuly glass exhibit during my Seattle stay. I had seen the stunning works of glass at the Biltmore several years ago and thought the exhibit would be worth my time. Alas, I was wrong. I did enjoy the few exhibits and small garden, until I realized that only 1 hour after entering which included a 10 minute demo of glassblowing I was at the end of what my $32 ticket had purchased. Not worth the steep price in my opinion. The theatre is worth a sit for a few of the videos showcasing his inspirations and installations but overall I was very disappointed at how much this experience cost for how little I actually got to see. You’ll have to make the decision for yourself on how you’d like to spend $32 per person."
An experience seared forever in your memory,This hour or so is a spectacular one-of-a-kind adventure that stays front of mind forever after. The glass exhibits are breathtaking. Chihuly Gardens has to be on the “must experience “ list in Seattle.
Amazing art and display,"Your eyes will be in overload, but don't miss the outside displays.  Awesome and amazing. You feel like you know the man personally through his artwork and hobby"
Beautiful!,"My husband wasn't planning on enjoying this, but we both loved it. Will see it again most definitely."
The finest Chihuly collection in the entire world is in Seattle,"Dale Chihuly is an American glass sculptor and entrepreneur. His works are considered to possess outstanding artistic merit in the field of blown glass, moving it into the realm of large-scale sculpture.  The technical difficulties of working with glass forms are considerable, yet Chihuly uses it as the primary medium for installations and environmental artwork.His work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide. He has been the recipient of many awards, including twelve honorary doctorates and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts.  The Chihuly Garden and Glass is a must visit when you’re in Seattle."
inspiring Beauty,"Chihuly Garden & Glass in Seattle is open from 10 am till 7 pm. Adult admission is $21 (13+) while a youth ticket is $14. Some people prefer the combo ticket (Space Needle & Chihuly) $42 adult and $26 youth. The City Pass offers another options. While you are considering those options be aware that admission after 4 pm to Chihuly is discounted.Rooms are curated in terms of themes. Mini talks about each room are given by the staff. There is the marine life, flowers, chandeliers, Japanese culture, etc. which are all spectacular. The staging of the is a work of art in itself. The atrium of glass holds demonstrations on the hour and there is an exquisite cascading lei of flowers morphing into butterflies from the ceiling. The theater plays 5 Chihuly behind the scenes videos explaining Dale Chihuly's design process. Be sure to ask about there free photo which will be emailed to you.You are allowed hand held photos or videos. Most rooms are staged in dim light so a low light camera is necessary. That became a problem for me. I should have done more research before I visited and brought my low light camera. There is a book store which sells authentic Chihuly pieces. Bring a check-book and be ready to spend a $1,000+."
Beautiful,"So beautiful, very well displayed! So colorful and interesting. This was part of our visit from Atlanta, so I have seen some of his work at the Atlanta Botanical Gardens."
Lovely glass artwork that extends into the outside  garden area,World class  glass art by Dale Chihuly that is amazing inside and outside. Beautiful by night or day - a must see! For some seasons they have a hot shop set up so you can watch how its made.
Perfect Way to pass the time,"Had a marvelous experience at the Chihuly Garden and Glass facility. I have always been an ardent fan of this glass maestro but this was a unique experience. Truly a wonderful way to pass the rainy Seattle afternoon. I recommend you go early to avoid the crowds but take plenty of pictures! If you love his glass work, you will not be disappointed with this experience. Traveled here June 2018."
"Wonderful, so beautiful and not too crowded!",We bought a ticket that included the Glass exposition and the Space Needle for 1 price.We went ealry May and it was not too crowded. Super beautiful garden and glass sculptures. You can spend about 1 hour walking around and taking photos of the glass exposition!A MUST SEE
My favorite place in all of Seattle,This is a small but powerful exhibit. I listened to the free audio tour on my phone. It took a little over an hour. We also ate at the attached restaurant for lunch and it was also fabulous.
Impressive beautiful place for tourists and Seattlites alike.,"I am a glass blower and it's hard to impress me, but I was blown away at the Chihuly Garden. The outside garden in particular was a lovely blend of nature and glass. It's one of the premiere art spots in Seattle, so if you want to guarantee a mind blowing experience, give it a try. It's well worth the money to get in. I know there are some package deals you can get to bring the price down."
Simply Stunning ,This is a gorgeous museum and right next to the Space Needle! If you have never been to one of his museums this is the one to see. It’s got numerous rooms to see and lots of exhibits to marcel at. They also take your picture in a few places and give you print outs or digital copies.
Chihuly Garden and Glass,The collection of glass art is amazing. Plan on spending at least two hours seeing the exhibit inside and outside too. Bring your camera.
Absolutely Beautiful,"We were amazed as soon as we walked in.This guy is so talented, his glass sculptures were fantastic.Only wish we could have bought something but way out of our budget.Well worth the visit."
Captivating,"It's one thing to see pictures of the exhibit but to see it in person, it's really magnificent. Between the indoor creations to those outdoors in the garden. Just wow, really something to make time to see in Seattle, can just spend an 1 even walking around observing."
Everyone should see Dales work!,The exhibit and setting enhance the beauty of the vibrant glass sculptures..So nice that there is an indoor and outdoor viewing area!Love the cafe as well with all the kitschy wall and table decor-this is a must see when in Seattle!
Willy Wonka of Handblown Glass!  Magnificent Art!,Colors are breathtaking!  Highly suggest watching several of the short movies in Theater.  (Located to right of outdoor glass blowing exhibit.)  make sure to wait just a few minutes for the next short film.  It will give you another perspective into his techniques.  Also suggest purchasing a combination pass or passes depending on how much time you have.  We purchased Seattle Space Needle and Chihuly Garden  and Glass pass.  You will have several options.
Make time for this one! But don’t touch anything!,"Affordable experience, especially when you combine it with the space needle. Take your time, admire the time and detail that went into each piece. It’s worth it!"
A beautiful day and a beautiful place!,"I’d heard a lot about this place, and being a Washingtonian, had never gone!  We bought a combo ticket to see the space needle and the glass museum, and the blown glass was amazing.  The colors, the gardens, and the experience was beautiful!"
Awe inspiring art pieces,Never been a fan of museums/arts but this one blew my mind. There is live glass art workshop which we can see and there are videos on the origin of such art.The gift shop also allows you buy a few art forms and the shop under space Needle also has more options of glass workHighly recommend a visit. There are photographers there who could snap a pic of visitors and upload it on the app
Great place,"My nephew, his wife and child came to visit me and I took them to the famous tourist areas in choosing three Space Needle.  While waiting for our time to tour the  Needle we enjoyed a visit to the glass exhibit.  It was amazing and I cannot imagine how much work went into each piece.  Highly recommended,  tie it in with the Space Needle visit because it is right below the Needle."
Chilling out with Chihuly,His glass works are large and uncanny.  This a beautiful display of the works in glass from Chilhuly.  There were modest crowds and plenty fo time to see and walk around.  The garden was remarkable and I can see these works in my own garden.
Beautiful,"I was delighted to find this venue. I have visited the museum, and enjoyed this display as much. It is a must for a visiter in Seattle."
Beauty is fragile,"Beauty is fragile and colorful in this museum. A garden full of flowers that do not wither, it's a must-see when you visit Seattle. Situation next to the Space Needle, it's very easy to find. Tickets are discounted after 4pm but I recommend you go early so that you can catch the garden under glorious sunlight. And don't forget to watch the movie; it shows how the chandeliers came to life."
Stunning beauty ,"As I moved from room to room throughout the exhibit I found myself overwhelmed with so much colorful amazing beauty. It was absolutely worth my time to visit this exhibit. The web based audio guide was extremely well put together and described each room in detail. I would say, this is a must see...  PS, my iPhone photos do not do this any justice."
Chihuly Glass: Shoorly Yasss!,Exquisite display of the brilliant artistry and vision of Dale Chihuly. Indoor rooms with beautiful arrays of colorful sculptures. Refreshing garden stroll outside through mix of landscape plants and inspiring blown glass. Allow one hour plus time in the marvelous gift shop. Ask for the senior discount.
One of a kind!,I live in Seattle. This museum is so unique that I take all out of town guests to see. I like the collections that are on display in the cafe also.
An Experiance,"This was a beautiful museum to see, even those who are not huge fans of art this is really cool to check out. you can see Chihuly's work with different color glass and you can get a good deal if you do the glass museum and the space needle"
The glass artwork has to be the best in the world,I would definitely advise people not to bypass the unique glass work exhibition. It is breathtakingly beautiful and the imagination in glass-work art and colourful scheme has no second place anywhere else.
A lot of Glass.,"I had successfully avoided seeing this exhibit on prior trips, but on a recent trip, it wasn't really an option. Since others wanted to see the glass, I decided to join. I'm glad I did.Now, I've already seen the installation at The Bellagio in Las Vegas. It is kind of the same thing, but there is more to see at Chihuly. There are huge glass sculptures that are quite amazing. The exhibit is not very big, but there is a lot of information abut the artist, and there are a lot of variations of the glass sculptures.It was beautiful, and a little redundant, but it was worth it."
Filled with Awe!,"This installation is amazing.  Such beautiful colors and amazing glass work.  It is hard to explain how beautiful this is but you should see it.  It is not that large so take you time and enjoy each of the rooms.  The audio tour is quick, but you can stay longer in each room to enjoy what you see.  Make sure to look at the artwork on the walls in addition to all the glass.  Outside it especially magical.   I was filled with joy at being there.   In the gift shop are bookds you can buy to see each piece in its best lighting.  Just amazing.  Can't recommend this enough.  Also in February in Seattle you are given 1/2 price museum entry with a card given to us at the hotel.  You need a card per person."
Stunning a must see,I am sure there are lots of glowing reviews of this gallery. This time though I want to recommend their cafe. The service and the food were above par and quite delightful.
Chihully,"What an amazing place, much netter than I expected, go in the afternoon  when it lights up. Take a camera as there are some decent shot to be taken of some amazing glass displays. The exhibition of glassblowing is definitely worth a watch."
amazine,what a great exposition!!!  it was really amazing.  there was some demontration of who it's made and the sculpture were just WOW!
Fantastic collection,I love blow glasses and hence loved Venice. I went to Biot in Provence to see how they are made. But this exhibition was a unique experience. The displays are amazingly beautiful. Absolutely loved it all! The staff being very friendly and the place being part of the CityPass were bonuses.
"Exceptional, seriously exceptional","Make sure to budget plenty of time to visit the Chihuly. The beauty, imagination, creativity and workmanship on display is unbelievable. When you walk into the first gallery space from the ticket station your first reaction may be an intake of breath followed by an “oh wow”. The lit glass and all black gallery space create a singular focus that also allows for beautiful pictures. You are also invited to wander outdoors in the gardens which must be wonderful in summer when the plants are in leaf. Adjacent to the outdoor gardens is an airstream trailer converted into artist workshop and demonstration area with demonstrations scheduled throughout the day. As you exit the gallery there is a theatre with a series of short documentaries about Dale Chihuly which I found important to watch to learn about some of the background or context to the installations on display. Staff are around to take pictures which can be sent at no cost via email. Complimentary coat check a well as a gift shop stocked with all sorts of treasures. As with the Space Needle, taking public transportation rather than fighting with traffic and the cost of parking  reduces unnecessary stress."
Beautiful,"I did not make firm plans to go to this museum while I was in Seattle because I was not sure if I'd have time to, however, I'm glad that I was able to find the time to go. I arrived around 4:00 pm, which was great as tickets are discounted after 4 pm. The museum took about an hour to go through, and that included a glass blowing show. The glass was beautiful - I never thought you could do what Chihuly did to glass. He created some stunning art with it. The glass blowing show was interesting also. They have a gift shop that sells some of  the glass artwork (for a very hefty price, of course)."
Stunning!,"Worth going to. Chihuly exhibit at its best, in his hometown. The lighting, the artwork, the setting-its all well-done and lovely."
Beautiful,I visited this place a day after visiting the Space Needle. Never thought to visit this place but wished I would've did it as a combo package with the Space Needle. It would have been worth to price. I do reccomend seeing it. Very beautiful. They show short movies of Chihuly creating his work which was interesting and they also take free pictures of you during the exhibit.
Outstanding!,"Chihuly is a master of color, shape, composition, and done with such excellence and wild creativity!  I don't think anyone could come away from this experience without a wonder in their heart and a smile on their face!!!"
Unbelievably wonderful ,The colors.  The shapes.  The process.  The artist.  And to top it off it was museum week so 50% off!! What more could you ask for?
Unexpected treat,Didn’t know what to expect as I hadn’t done much research but this place was fab. It was amazing to see and get up close (no touching) to the sculptures. Loved the way that they ran through the building then into the garden where there were demonstrations of glass blowing. Definitely worth a visit if you’re in Seattle and note that you can get combination tickets if you’re going to do a few things in that area.
Stunning!!,One of the highlights of our trip to Seattle. It was all fantastic but was especially impressed with how the outdoor gardens looked so amazing in winter and highlighted the stunning glassworks even without the benefit of flowers. A must-see in Seattle!
Absolutely inspiring,I was in a Seattle grey day funk and was totally revived after I visited this exhibit.  I found it totally amazing and inspiring. That someone could create art that made me so happy is fantastic
Amazing!,This is a must-see when you are in Seattle. The creations are amazing. If you are visiting the Space Needle you can save a little on the cost by buying a ticket for both.
Good for the soul,Went to visit this at the end of the day and wish I had more time to linger. Marveled at the towering displays of glass and the size of some of the creations. If you love art glass this is a must see and if you stay until dark the outdoor sculptures are lit. You can then cap off the day sipping a drink from the top of the space needle only a short walk away .
Stunning Art Display,"The Chihuly Garden is a spectacular display of art on a large scale.  The color and whimsy of the garden are appealing to families of all ages.  With an explosion of color and creativity, this is a stop you should add to your visit to the Seattle area."
Incredible,Beyond belief. This place is a must.  You cannot believe the workmanship and the beauty of the glass work.  I would absolutely recommend.  Take your camera.  You will not be disappointed.
Beautiful,This exhibit is worth seeing if you appreciate the artistry of blown glass. Chihuly’s work is amazing and the outdoor garden displays are lovely.
It's ok.,"I visited with my sister in law and 2 young children.  It's expensive and there isn't much to see. The glass was also pretty dusty which was a disappointment. The video was interesting, but no chance of watching the full thing with the kids along. There's plenty of Chihuly glass all over Seattle; skip this and save your money."
Must see in Seattle,The glass sculptures in this museum are stunning.  Around every corner & through every doorway is a new surprise.  I gasped. I oohed & ahhed!  I enjoyed myself so much I'd go again & again.  I took my teen sons who also thought it was super cool.
Absolutely beautiful,This place is truly a gem in more ways then one.  It enlightens your senses and it is hard to imagine how talented some people are!
Amazing sculptures in glass,"To see what has been done with glass in this museum is amazing.  Not a large place.  The shear effort to produce the sculptures sometime overwhelms the visual artistry of the works, but this makes for an additional aspect to viewing the art."
Interesting museum that celebrates a single artist,"I'm not entirely sure I should call this a ""museum"" or an ""exhibit,"" but it features the glass works of Chihuly and is very interesting. There's also a small cafe at the back (don't need museum entrance to eat there) which I loved and ate in several times while I was there."
Definitely worth a visit ,Went here after 4 o’clock to get the discounted rate- more than enough time to see everything. Artwork was amazing and glass blowing demonstration very enjoyable
Amazing works of art,Great visit.  We combined the visit with a trip to the top of the space needle and it was also fantastic.
Chihuly Garden,"When in Seattle, you must visit Chihuly Garden ofGlass! This is an amazing spectacle. To see the glassSculptures it makes you wonder the amount oftime that goes in to each and every creation there! Itis truly a sight to behold"
Didn't know looking at glass could be so cool!,"Was very well done and worth seeing.  Great date activity, we spent about 2 hours exploring the various exhibits."
Stunning - do not miss it.,"Incredible collection of Chihuly glass. The conservatory is the most spectacular part, with huge sculptures hanging from the ceiling."
A must see for any visitor!,"You have to see this to believe it...  Amazing creations in glass and on a huge level. Both indoors and outdoors, the designs are spectacular.  They also have a coffee shop/restaurant."
breathtaking glass artistry,"artistically brilliant, it is amazing what he does with glass. really enjoyable. there also is a glassblowing show lasting some 30 minutes in the garden and its very interesting as well."
Quick Tourist Picture Spot,Cool spot to see some very colorful art and take some fun photos. I wouldn't bring kids here. Got to watch them make a glass vase which was cool! It's a quick visit! Can be done in less than an hour.
short but beautiful museum visit,"Chihuly’s museum is definitely worth a visit, especially is you are on an adult trip! I have been twice now, once with friends and once with children. The exhibits are on the smaller side but are breathtaking and worth every penny of the cost. It is something you will want to spend time to see so I would recommend going with adults or older kids so you can take time to appreciate the artistry. Also, portions of the exhibit are outdoors so if you are lucky enough to get a day with sunshine in Seattle even better."
Stunning work,This place is small but absolutely worth the time and money. The glass art is spectacular and the location is super convenient and right next to the Space Needle (and other touristy places). Highly recommended!
Wonderful Museum,A must to see for such beautiful and amazing glass displays! Enjoyed a glass blowing demonstration and toured the garden. Great little gift shop too.
A Great Place to Visit,"Although it is a bit pricey, it is well worth the cost.  The glass displays are all hand blown and are incredible.  There are a number of rooms to visit with different displays in each.  After visiting all the rooms you can go to the gift shop and purchase hand blown gifts and other gifts.  There is even an outdoor ""garden area"" where there are a great number of hand blown glass objects representing a variety of plants and other outdoor objects.  This is one of the great places to visit in Seattle."
Beyond Amazing!,"My wife and I walked through the displays and were absolutely amazed.  We highly recommend.   The colors, inside and outside, are fantastic."
Art I love!,Second visit here having been in 2016 and still loved it. The man is a genius and the setting for exhibiting his work here is brilliant.  A great way to spend an hour wandering around. And the glass blowing demo is very informative and interesting to watch
small but beautiful,"so many amazing sculptures with so much detail. directly next to the space needle and walking distance from mopop. pieces are gorgeous. go after 4pm for half off admission, even more worth it!"
Vacation Seattle Washington 2020,"Amazing, beautiful and just so breath taking I want to say to see this and the space needle was 250 something for 5 people so it's a little pricey but money well spent! I would pay to see it again. The lines on a Monday were none we were there about 11am our spouses even really enjoyed going. Its indoors and outdoors so we did take a light jacket."
Beautiful - a must do,Wow. So stunning. We arrived at 4pm which was a bonus; the garden was changing in the evening light and there were fewer people around. Plus tickets are cheaper from 4-6pm.
Must see in Seattle,This was my second visit and my husband's first. He was blown away by the incredible exhibits. I recommend this to anyone coming to Seattle.
Glass sculptures were amazing,Great art exhibition - inside and out in the garden. Beautiful colours and interesting exhibitions- really enjoyed it. Would highly recommend.
Fascinating,"It was amazing, you could see the brilliant mind at work. Very eloquently displaced. One could spend hours in there admiring the art work."
Breathtaking ,Situated under the Space needle this is a must visit place. The ambience and sheer brilliance of the exhibition is breathtaking. Genius at work. Two hours here passes by with ease as you stroll from one piece of work to the next. Make time to visit.
"Beautiful, but pricy","It's not a very large museum. It's mostly a few huge, but beautiful, installations. Wish the museum was larger and showcased more individual works. Given the installations are permanent, and covers most of the museum, I seldom return. Overpriced."
A Seattle Must-see,"Dale Chihuly is a legend of the Seattle arts scene. His interior installations are wonderful, but seeing his glass art in a garden setting brings it to a whole different level. It's a lovely way to spend a few hours. Visit in nice weather, since Seattle has no problem raining on its visitors."
Nice visit,"Interesting sculptures and great photo opportunities. As with any museum, the gift shop was overpriced."
The man is a Genius,"The glass is truly amazing. If you have been to the Bellagio in Vegas, you have seen his work. He has a local gallery where he trains artists. The Chihuly Garden is out of this world."
Awesome,I've seen Chihuly glass in several locations now and am always struck by the beauty of colors and shapes! A must see.
Glass Art,"Being able to see the glass art in different ways was great.  I enjoyed being able to take your time looking at the glass sculptures at various angles.  Visiting on a sunny day is the best, have not seen it when it was raining."
So good,Right next to the space needle well worth a visit so interesting and clean the glass effects are amazing
What a Gorgeous place to visit,"This is amazing!! Love to see all of his vision and creativity in one place. The style, hard work, ideas - just incredible."
Not to be missed! Spectacular!!!,Some of the most beautiful glasswork you will ever see! Magnificent! The staff was super helpful and were happy to store my carryon while I was in the museum.
Best -lace to visit,"We were amazed by all the glass art inside and garden area.  Impressive!!!  Even the cafe was impressive not only the food but the way it was decorated.The artist Dale Chihuly’s personal collections were put on display inside the cafe.  All kinds of collections like old radios, old cameras, shaving brushes, ceramic dolls, masks, etc.  Chihuly glass and garden is a must see in Seattle Washington"
Amazing Experience!,Beautiful.  Amazing experience.  Start to finish!!  My family and I enjoyed every part of the exhibition.
Expansive overview of the artist's work,Stroll through the museum and the outdoor gardens to immerse yourself in the wonder that is Chihuly glass.
Wonderful!,"We were not sure about going to visit here but decided on the Citipass which included Chihuly Gardens and Glass. We loved it.  The art glass is amazing. Definitely recommend if you are visiting Seattle.  The museum is fantastic, the demonstration of the glass blowing was wonderful and very informative.  The gardens were very nice even though it was drizzling, we walked through it and very very delighted.  The gift shop is nice too.  Many good gifts there but like most gift shops it was a bit pricey."
A fantastic place to visit.,"Oh, my word! To my shame, until I bought my CityPass, I hadn't heard of this place. I'm so glad I chose to visit, as it's superb.From the first view of the forest, to the splendour of the gardens, every piece leaves you breathless.There was even a free photo taken which was then emailed. Highly recommended."
Beautiful Glass Art by World Renowned Artist,"Dale Chihuly has his work displayed all around the globe. He grew up in the Pacific Northwest.  Look for the angels in the Persian Glass Ceiling.  Walk clear around the Glass Garden to see it in full.  The lake with the canoe filled with glass art is breathtaking.  Add to your experience by going to the Collection Cafe.  Chihuly is a organized “hoarder”.  😃  Each table has a shadow box filled with something Chihuly collects. Vintage Christmas Ornaments, antique tin toys, vintage fishing lures, etc.  Make sure to look up to see his collection overhead and go into the bathrooms to see his collection of bottle openers."
Wow...Amazing,My favorite activity while in Seattle.  Wish we had seen it at night with lights.  Heard it was excellent.
A must go,Buy the combo ticket with the space needle to get a discount. Both this and the space needle are totally worth a visit! The museum and the collection is stunning!
Must see when in Seattle,Great museum! Everything was beautiful. The talks about each room were very informative as was the self-guided audio tour. Definitely go early in the day to stay ahead of the crowds.
Stunning and mesmerizing,"I'll admit that we only decided to go here because it was close to the Space Needle and seemed nice. Wow, this was one of the highlights of our trip!  The glass art is stunning, the colors vibrant, the garden so artistic and beautiful. The display of making glass art was educational and fun. We went with our kids (6 and 8 years old), and they enjoyed it too (although they were walking faster than I was, as I was taking it all in)."
Beautiful way to spend a few hours,"Right by the space needle and Museum of POP, this attraction was better than I imagined.  His artwork is spectacular.  Even my husband, who went along begrudgingly admitted to enjoying the museum.  Only takes 1-2 hours to do."
"Not exactly cheap, but ...","This is a museum to visit at least once. It is a rather small museum and it should take no more than two hours so to “see it all. I did visit the museum when it first opened and I can say not much has changed since then.Now don’t be put off by the price of the ticket ... the display of blown glass artwork with notes & explanations from Dale Chiihuly on what drove his creations is well worth the price. The ambiance, the lighting in every room, I think, adds to the art pieces.. If you get a chance do attend the live blown-glass demonstration ... AND ... if you want to do go up the Space Needle as well, I think it’s a better deal to get the combo Museum / Space Needly ticket."
The quintessential tourist place of Seattle,"This is the museum to visit if you are visiting Seattle, especially for the first time. The museum is small, it will take you no more than an hour or so to finish both the museum and the outdoor garden. You can easily pair this with the Space Needle or the Science Center as well. Don't let the size fool you, it houses great content. The blown glass artwork, combined with the ambiance, the lighting, creates a mesmerizing world. Every room was a surprise. My husband and I also attended a session of the live blown-glass workshop, which we found very interesting.The museum gift shop lacks diversity, go over to the Space Needle gift shop if you want more affordable, blown glass wares."
Amazing!,A must see when visiting Seattle! Chihuly takes your breath away with beautiful vivid artwork in unusual settings. I can't wait to come back!
Gorgeous and instructive,We spent half a day exploring this installation and every minute was worth it. It's beautiful beyond words. A must visit for all aficionados of beauty. The ceiling and bridge are breathtaking. Every afternoon there is a glass blowing demo which showcases the effort required to produce these delicate glass items.
Stepping into a color world beyond belief,"The indoor and outside display areas are two distinct exhibition. One is what you would expect from Chihuly. The other steps you into a world fantasy. This exhibition is worth the admission for the dreamer in all of us. You will see splashes of color, design and form."
beautiful but . . .,This was really neat to see but I felt for the money the exhibit was kind of small. It doesn't take all that one to see everything.
Incredible Museum,"Went here for my fiance's birthday; it's astoundingly beautiful.  I don't think I've ever to this point called anything a must-see, but I would not consider it a stretch to use that term for Chihuly."
Fantastic!,"Fantastic, unique museum and gardens. We never knew about this artist or this attraction. We bought the ticket paired with the Space needle, which balanced our visit. Beautiful! Intriguing! And be sure to watch the short films featuring the artist and his work at the end! No way to describe it... you just gotta go!"
Great visit - some the same as the Chihuly touring work,"I loved being here.  Gardens were lovely, though I did feel that much of the exhbit was the like the traveling exhibit that I had seen in Boston.  The glass is amazing, and the videos were well worth the time (maybe one of the best parts of the museum if you've seen his stuff before).  Certainly worth a peek while in Seatlle."
Stunning Display of Blown Glass,This is a.stunning museum of artistic blown glass... everything from small bowls to spectacular chandeliers. There are many displays of this artist work presented to maximum visual effect. The glass garden is also stunning with the Seattle Space Needle in the background. The photos say it all really.
Seattle Must See,"If you are going to be in Seattle for any reason, you must visit the Chihuly Garden. I've been to several exhibits of his work at art museums, etc. Nothing compares to this experience. Wonderful doesn't begin to describe the works inside. Go. Just go."
Stunning!,If You are in Seattle this is definitely worth the visit.  These incredible glass displays leave you thinking how on earth did all this glass get blown and carefully placed so beautifully!  The outdoor gardens left me wanting to incorporate glass somehow into my yard.  Stay and catch a film presentation about Chihuly.  Watching him at work on his displays is so impressive.  FYI you can buy a ticket for both the space needle and glass museum and save a few dollars.
So cool to see ,This was so cool to see al the amazing glass art. Didn’t even realize it was a glass garden. Easy visit if your in the area don’t pass it up.
Amazing and worthwhile ,The glass art work is amazing and definitely worth the hype! I am glad it was listed as the #1 place to visit and happy to have included it on my trip.
A beautiful garden of glass in amazing colors.,"Knowing we'd be returning to Seattle for the first time in ten years, we knew just what sites we wanted to hit first: Chihuly and the Needle.  And it was just as beautiful at Chihuly's this time as it was the last.  The sun was shining and the colors of the outdoor garden of glass were striking.  What a talent this artist is.  It's a must-see.  Get a combo-ticket and also see the Needle."
Wow,I didn’t think I was going to love this as much as I did! We had seen some Chihuly art at the Phoenix Botanical Gardens and decided to add this to our space needle ticket...so worth it! We had my 12 yr old niece and my newborn baby with 3 adults - all of us loved the art!
"Good, but not fabulous...","We had a nice time, it’s all very impressive.  However, it’s an art museum for one artist, so know that your not getting a lot of variety.  It was also a bit crowded in August, which is a busy tourist season in Seattle."
My Favourite Part of Our Trip To Seattle,We were told to go here as a recommendation and we are SO glad we did. This was by FAR my favourite thing we did in Seattle. It was AMAZING. I can not recommend it enough. You will be blown away. (Pun fully intended.)
Captivating!,"Have been to the Chihuly exhibit by the Space Needle more than once and it captivates me every time!  The displays are imaginative and the interplay of color, materials and light/darkness completely engross me.  That we are allowed to take our own photos is very generous and they turn out as if you are a professional.  The various displays, both indoors and outdoors capture the imagination and provide wonderful experiences.  After all, the experience is what you pay to come and see!"
Beautiful Glass Garden ,"Chihuly Glass Garden was beautiful! If you’re into Glass art like me, you’ll be in stunned looking and these huge, beautiful, glass sculptures. Especially when you walk through the garden area, glass art plus the earths natural beauty makes an amazing touch. I actually saw a bunny eating some of the kale in the garden. So cute! Definitely recommend taking a stroll through chihuly if ever in Seattle wondering what to do next!"
Beautiful Surroundings,"I found it to be really beautiful.  I have long admired his work, but learning about the depth of his artistic interests was a revelation.  It is worth the time to sit and listen to the commentator so you can learn the history of his creations."
Amazing ,Amazing glass sculptures from the most talented glass artist in the world. Includes videos showing how the glass is sculpted.  Make sure you walk through the gardens.
An amazing exhibit of glass art.,"The glass art displayed here is truly incredible. The imaginative, ground-breaking examples shown here will open your mind to things you never thought you would see in glass art. Amazingly beautiful and captivating displays. Well worth a couple of hours if you are in the Seattle area."
I never thought you can be so creative with glass,Before visiting chihuly I never imagined possibilities with glass. Must visit for someone who is having eye for art.
Beautiful glass art,Do not miss this great place if you're in Seattle. The glasswork of Chihuly is unbelievably beautiful. Take lots of pics!
Go see this exhibit!,Loved this exhibit!  Take your time when walking through.  Walk around every piece multiple times.  I look forward to going back to it when the sun is out.
In the sky.,We had a fantastic time looking at glass work. Our door gardens amazing with different color glass work. ( Balls )
Amazing small arts museum,"Great creativity, excellent glass blowing skills and a nice central setting in central Seattle makes for an enjoyable visit to the Chihuly glass museum. Highly recommendable."
Very nice Museum,"We have seen Chihuly's work before but did not know the Artist or background of his works.This museum is very well curated. The indoor and outdoor exhibits give context and shows his works at their best.  I particularly liked the outdoor garden exhibit and they are so unique.  The glass blends into the landscape and makes you feel like you are in a fantasy world.  The glassblowing demos are at set timings so do check out the schedule and sit in if the timing matches.  There was also a museum photographer on site to take pictures which you can download from their website.The museum shop has very unique gifts but I found that to be on the expensive side.Everyone including my 2 teenagers enjoyed the visit and after this visit, I am now able to recognize and appreciate the numerous installations of his glassworks in hotels and buildings around the world."
The best Museum!,I like museums but get bored - this was a perfect museum for me.  Beautiful art indoors and outdoors!  Vivid colors just got me.  There is no museum like this I have ever seen!  It is a must and a short tour.
Rightfully the #1 Attraction in Seattle!,"When I visited the sprawling Seattle Center on my January trip, I just had to carve room (ample room) for the Chihuly Garden and Glass, perhaps one of the newest attractions and for sure the most hyped. I certainly made the right choice, as though there even was a choice in the first place—GO! It’s an absolute necessity to visit when in Seattle.—Admission is a certain price or an included perk of a combo ticket (e.g. ticket to Space Needle + PacSci Center + Chihuly, or a CityPASS). Research the price that would give you the best value for your situation. I don’t have the prices solely for the Chihuly Garden and Glass on me now, but I believe they are quite reasonable. The entire place is on the Seattle Center grounds, so parking is handled by the whole center, not the Chihuly “portion.” Parking is not free, if I’m not mistaken.—There is an on-site cafe (Collections Cafe) and a gift shop, both of which looked enticing. The cafe is on the more upscale side, which I failed to realize prior to stepping in. They offer full lunch/dinner services, rather than a quick snack or pastry. Nonetheless, I appreciated the presence of those resources for visitors.—Dale Chihuly HAS to be beaming with pride at the care, attention, and breathtaking design of this museum. (Let me just call it a museum, just to maintain uniformity as much as I can.) Every part is GORGEOUS. What a remarkable tribute to Chihuly’s creativity, wow. Indoors is an extensive layout of distinct yet ever-similar bursts of vivid glass, and each different work is clearly separated by being housed in different rooms. There are no walls or fences to shield off the art from people, letting folks get as up-close and personal as they’d wish without touching it of course. I won’t go into too much depth about the art itself, because I want it to speak for itself. Chihuly is just a mastermind at his art, and it is something no one could afford to miss.—One of my very favorite parts (despite the January temps) was the strolling through the garden. Can’t forget about that word in the title! I adored the subtlety of the Chihuly art interspersed with the diverse plant life and flora; it couldn’t have been better designed. I captured some of the most aesthetic pictures of my trip in the garden, which I’ll share with my review. Simply spectacular!With those details said, I implore you to visit the Chihuly Garden and Glass. It can deserve an entire trip to Seattle JUST to explore this natural and manmade wonder. Chihuly, Seattle, and I myself are all proud it is number one on TripAdvisor! Go see it ASAP!"
"The best glass exhibition I've ever seen, and I have seen quite a few in Europe and elsewhere.","My daughter (17) loved swapping glass blowing tips with the three ladies who were demonstrating in the courtyard.  Try to catch one of those demo sessions if you can.For people who said the courtyard was better at night, I can only imagine.  It was wonderful for photography during the day."
pretty museum (but expensive entrance fee),"the installations here are really nice to look at, but the entrance fee is quite high. to save money, the chihuly entry after 5pm ticket is quite worth it. i don’t think it looks that much different in the evening (especially since the average seattle day is already quite cloudy)"
Must visit,It was the highlight of our trip to Seattle. Awesome is the word!! It amazes you. It was even more beautiful at the dusk. Glass works that are displayed there are intricate and just breathtaking
Must visit if you are in Seattle,"One of our most memorable visit in Seattle... The Chihuly glass art sculpture was amazingly beautiful, and the outdoor garden was definitely a hit on our group!"
Amazing Glass Work. Loved it!,Visited this place for the first time during a recent trip to Seattle. Absolutely amazed by his sophisticated work. Loved it! Highly recommended.
A must see in Seattle,I highly recommend visiting the Chihuly Garden and Glass.  Each room and the glass creations are beautiful to look at and create a lot of peace.  I would visit again.
Must Visit in Seattle,I am so glad I decided to visit the Chihuly Garden and Glass in Seattle.  It was just awesome!  The glass creations by artist Dale Chihuly are beautiful to look at and make you feel at peace with the world.  I think the entrance fee is a little on the expensive side but it is all worth it.  A must see in Seattle.
Fantastic,I experienced glass craft with my daughter for the first time. It was so wonderful and the harmony of colors was fantastic.
Interesting designs and colors in glass,While a little expensive there is a lot to see and enjoy. There is a glass blowing exhibit where you can see how some of the designs are made. Self-guided tour so you can take as long as you like. Everything is indoors with the exception of the glass blowing exhibit so you can enjoy even with Seattle weather.
Chihuly glass,"Spectacular! So pleased I didn't miss it. This glass in at Atlantis the palm in Dubai and is the Reception ceiling at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. You need to look closely.....note the cherubs in amongst the rest on the ceiling. Apparently his ""nod"" to the classics. Absolutely gorgeous!"
a gem,We loved visiting the Chiluly Garden and Glass museum at the Seattle Center. Such a unique museum - and beautiful to experience.  So glad that we went.
A celebration for the Eye,"If you like glass art, this is a place to visit. On the grounds of the Seattle Center, near the Space Needle, it is one of the area's attractions.  It is a bit expensive;  so go with that in mind. Spring to Fall is the best time, for mild to warm weather.  There are places to sit, so there is no need to rush."
Color and Beauty,Not a huge place to visit but right in a touristy area so please don't overlook it.   The colors are so vivid and the entire museum is other worldly.
A homage to a local artist and his students.,"Blown Glass has a particular charm, each piece is uniqiue and possess qualities that apeal to most discerning tastes.Chihuly created a style and reinvented the art with bright colors and organic inspired creations. The garden expresses this well and showcases the art and passion of the artist."
Magical Glass World,"Although it is a bit pricey, this is well work money spent.  It is awe inspiring to see these amazing glass works.  If you are visiting Seattle, this is a must do!!  While Chihuly Glass works is now all over the world, this contains unbelievable collections and themes in one place.  There is a restaurant at the end that isn't worth the price however, each table is full of Chihuly collectibles (toys, keys, etc).  Its worth a peak and perhaps a coffee/drink."
Good place to go if you are interested in beauty in life,It's a place that you will refresh your eyes by different sorts of glass exhibits. They are either shiny displayed in rooms or being put together with trees or bushes in the garden. Brilliant ideas and amazing displays. Also impressed by a few documentaries in the museum introducing the artist Chihuly and stories of him and his exhibits.
Loved it,"So many beautiful installations, and a demo on top of that....!It was a pleasant way to spend the afternoon"
Breath-taking!,"Such a wonderful and gorgeous place to be. If you love glass, spectacular colours, and organic shapes, you must come here! I wish I came at night because the lighting really makes his glass sculptures come to life. (Tickets are cheaper for the evening too.)  Keep watch over your clumsy or energetic touchy friends/ kids there -- the glass is too easily accessible in my opinion and is not to be touched. Photos are not a problem. We saw everything in an hour -- it's a small museum and wheelchair-friendly. There is an audio tour available free online on the website which added to our learning experience of his creations as we walked from room to room. A bit crowded on a Saturday afternoon. Enjoyed the glass-blowing demo and short film. Can buy his small glass items in the gift shop for ~$6000!"
Great time!,This museum is awesome and we loved our time at the museum. The work is amazing and everyone truly enjoyed their time their!
Well thought out,"I had seen the traveling exhibition in Richmond VA a few years ago, and have to say aside from the wonderful docent talk we heard in Seattle, you get the same historical approach and themes in the traveling exhibit. You’re not punished for being a no - Seattlite !"
Best museum Ive visited in a while,This museum is a must visit when in Seattle. All family members enjoyed the stay and cant wait to visit it again if we ever go to Seattle again.
Way better than expected,"This place is beautiful.  The colorful glass art is exquisitely arranged and is pleasing to the eye no matter who you are.  There was even a glass blowing demonstration which gathered a lot of attention.  Truly, you could just be mesmerized by all of the outstanding glass arrangements here both inside and outside.  I thought it would just be some touristy thing to check off.  Wrong.  This place is beautiful."
Wonderful Photo Op and Fun Cafe Visit: Ideal Two Hour Stop.,"Went with a friend and a five-year-old. The pieces are of course truly beautiful to behold...but when you have a five-year-old who doesn’t have their imagination captured by the statuesque and intricate glass work, taking in the outdoor glassblowing demonstration is more the right speed. Most importantly, make sure to stop by the wonderful Chihuly café, with lots of tchotchkes — it was the ideal mid museum tour break. All tolled, we spent two hours there and that was about the right amount of time. We managed some stunning photos, which makes the visit worthwhile, especially for those who come from out of town.Make sure to make time for the Chihuly café. It has an ideal children’s menu and really interesting artifacts to talk about hanging from the ceiling and planted within the tables."
Just straight magical,"Its so magical i suggested going in the evening when dark, its better i think and cheaper. Great place to take pictures and practice it."
Every visitor probably finds a favourite display,"I'm not surprised that this attraction is ranked as Seattle's favourite amongst TA reviewers.  After a single visit, I'm totally in agreement, and am still in awe of the exhibits on display.  But where to begin?  I suppose it's fair to say that it's really a celebration of master glass craftsman's Dale Chihuly's work.  And what a body of work - highly colourful, thematic, larger-than-life, often quirky (perhaps even completely impractical), but always remarkably beautiful in design and construction.  It was wonderful just walking through the galleries admiring each individual piece and thnking I'd found my favourite piece, at least till I saw another one I really liked.  But while each exhibit was fantastic, I feel some credit should also be given to how much thought went into  the corresponding lighting effects - some pieces were best displayed in natural light whereas for others, the room was deliberately kept dim.  The museum also featured some of the sculptor's design sketches and it was quite interesting to see diiferently he saw it on a piece of paper versus in his mind's eye.  During my visit, there was also a glass sculpting demonstration by one of the staff which I found to be bith educational and insightful."
Amazing! ,"You can’t come to Seattle and not see this, truly a great couple of hours, the artistic joy is great."
Amazing sculptures,Even my 5yr old was amazed by the beautiful glass sculptures. Worth a look while you’re in the area. Not to be missed.
Stunning ,"Just beautiful, absolutely a must visit if you are in the area. Try to visit later on the day is less crowded."
Awesome!,"The glass art work inside is displayed beautifully!  Many exhibits to see, and most are awe-inspiring.  I’m not that much into art, but this was well worth the entrance.  They also have glass blowing demonstrations throughout the day.  The pics show you how pretty the place is."
An absolute wonder - don't miss if you are in Seattle,The Chihuly Garden was so delightful.  I think any age would enjoy it and it is easy to get to in downtown Seattle.  It really is a jewel and should not be missed.
So beautiful! ,We had a city pass and this was included with it. We had a great time here. The art was absolutely beautiful. Highly recommended if you're visiting Seattle!
Chihuly is a must-see!  Don't skip it.,"Recommended by several friends and online sites, we didn't have time to do the combo Space Needle and Chihuly, but VERY glad we wend to Chihuly.  Be sure to watch a glass blowing demonstration.  5 minute movies in the theatre were also very informative.  Great picture-taking opps."
Gorgeous ,Bought a combo ticket with the Space Needle. Loved the exhibits and stood in awe at all of the sculptures. Impressed with the videos detailing his life and works. Amazing gift shop! Pictures do not do it justice!!
Beeeutiful,"Situated just beneath the Space Needle, this facility offers a nice respite from standing in line to ride the elevator up!  It contains numerous gallery spaces featuring the work of world-renowned local Dale Chihuly, whose iconic glass pieces are easily recognized and displayed world-wide."
Breathtaking Brilliance,"We visited during the ""evening experience"" which was a few $$ cheaper and, I imagine, more gorgeous (outdoors) because of the  the night. But whenever you go - GO.  Brilliant and beautiful and breathtaking in every imaginable way.  Thank you Dale Chihuly for making our world a more beautiful place."
Beautiful glass garden,This place is worth visiting. Loved the beauty of the glass garden! I truly enjoyed it. I recommned it.
Wow. Just ... Wow.,"Thought we'd pick this place up when we visited the space needle on our obligatory firts-timers tour of Seattle. But this turned out to be the highlight of the day. It's just a beautiful adn moving place, and it's worth the time and money to see it."
Beautiful glass art,A lovely exhibit to walk through. The glass art is amazing and always blows my mind to see. If you come with children please let them know not to touch exhibits as our experience was tainted by a child throwing a fit when they were asked not to touch the exhibit.
"Color, Light & Form","Truly an outstanding museum. The indoor and garden exhibits were both spectacular presentations of breathtaking pieces.The glass blowing demonstration was fascinating. I find most artistic mediums fairly easy to understand, but glass blowing is still strange and wondrous to me."
A must,"Located next to the Space Needle - the Chihuly Gardens I would say has been one of the most breathtaking art installations I have seen. With pieces inspired by native Americans, childhood memories and the artist's travels - both glass art and drawings displayed are breathtakingly beautiful and filled with energy. There's a live demo on glass making at specific times, live guides and an outside garden wherein glass were included as part of the flora display. A must!"
Seen it once still the same,"We came for the reduced admission after 4pm so we could see the outdoor glass sculptures illuminated in the evening.  I think this was the best value for this museum as it still gave visitors three hours to wander around until closing.Tickets were easily purchased at the electronic kiosks outside the entrance or in person at the desk.Once inside, we wandered through the same rooms we did from our previous trip and nothing changed.  I would have thought they might update the exhibits but looks like they continue to maintain the same year after year.  Loss of one circle due to the lack of change.Each room had a theme (Native American, chandeliers, etc) that was reflective in the choice of glassworks.  The one with the sea theme also had a professional photographer who would take your photo for free.  Each photo was matched to a card which I scanned at the kiosk by the gardens and then emailed to myself.  Of course you can also take your own photos as there was no restrictions on the use of flash.In the garden, one can easily incorporate the Space Needle into the background of your photos.Overall we completed our walkthrough in less than one hour."
Unique!!,"The glassworks are absolutely beautiful and creative!!  Fun indoor/outdoor activity!!!  The food in the cafe is a little pricey, but good."
Mesmerizing,I have been waiting to this exhibits for several visits now.  It is breathtaking and we were fortunate to be there on a beautiful sunny fall day.  Everywhere you looked was awe inspiring and we were reluctant to leave.
"A ""Must Do"" When in Seattle","The Gardens are an incredible display of beautiful glass art by Chihuly. The presentation is spectacular and it makes for a very pleasant afternoon or evening visit. If you are doing an event, it is a perfect setting and really embodies the best of Seattle with its views of the Space Needle."
Interesting experience,"Plenty of glass objects with most fantastic forms and colours, nice combination of living flowers with glass ones."
Great Artwork,I enjoyed seeing the art of Chihuly here. There is an online audioguide available that you can listen to descriptions of each of the rooms you walk through. Take time to enjoy the glass and not just go to talk pictures of it all. The only thing I would say is that the admission is a bit on the high side.
Amazing Glass exhibition,"On our first trip to Seat. tle, our daughter and son in law wanted to take us to to the Chihuly Museum. I can’t begin to describe the sheer beauty and magnificence of the glass works. It is truly worthy of a stop if visiting the Seattle area."
Chihuly Garden and Glass in Seattle WA,"If you Seattle WA, visit the Chihuly Garden and Glass exhibit. What a great experience. Right next to the Space Needle! Make time to do both!"
Memorable,"Loved the glass, the exhibits, and the marvelous videos showing how the glass is created and shipped all around the world. Took us about 1 1/2 hours to do everything."
GORGEOUS,"Absolutely gorgeous works of art!!! Amazing, beautiful, colorful, creative glass creations that everyone should take the time to see!!!"
Definitely Must do,"If you are in Seattle , take the time and visit this glass museum, it is breathtaking and amazing, I have teenagers and they enjoyed the craftsmanship and unique glass sculptures.  ** Buy the combo package with glass museum and the space needle it will save you $10"
Breathtaking display of Chihuly's Creativity,"The selection of his pieces, large and small are wonderful.It is like attending a feast of the Master's works in a large and well lit space."
Go in the evening!,So I went with my family on a quick trip here and also the Space needle! I would say go after 4pm since the lights at night are so lovely! We booked an Airbnb walking distance (15mins) from the garden. Parking around it is quite expensive so if you can keep the car home or not drive is best. Overall a great experience.
A must do,Loved this garden! The art is incredible and so unique! Will definitely go every time I'm back as it's that beautiful
Chihuly Garden and Glass,"This attraction is best viewed indoors during the day and outdoors at night .  Inorder to get the best pictures of the glass art during the day I would stick to taking pictures of the glass art indoors . Taking photos  of the outside glass art during the day was average.  To get the full affect of the experience you need to visit the outdoor art  at night. You could take the tour with a narrator or visit on your own. We opted to visit on our own because there were other atractions nearby that we wanted to visit.  Overall, I think the art was great,  however, unless you are fascinated by glass art, you may not be that impressed."
A Must See,So stunning and even better at dusk and when it gets dark. The garden walk around is lovely.Beautiful colours and setting
Amazing.  Don’t miss it ,I think one of the best tourist things to doIn Seattle. Lots of Chihulys works. Interactive with daily glass blowing demos.  Beautiful gift shop.  Movie theatre explaining his work.  Can download audio if you want. Plan 45-60 minutes here Had teenager with me who was happy taking selfies with gorgeous backgrounds of glass.   But that’s pretty much what everyone was doing!Make me appreciate the Bellagio ceilings even more. I’d love to see these gardens at night.  Tip: it’s on the same plot of land as the Space Needle so you can visit both at the same time on a discounted ticket.
Should not be missed,"Our surgery at Swedish had to be rescheduled and Nick, the Silver Cloud desk clerk told us about Chihuly. It was awesome, amazing, well worth the effort. Don't miss the glass blowing demo.   I wish we would have watched it twice. Don't hurry and rush through it take your time and enjoy.."
Learned about blown glass,Very interesting display of blown glass.  I enjoyed the demonstration of the blown glass and the demonstator was very informative and answered lots of questions.  It was fun to learn about this art.
Nice attraction. Does not take too much time snd is esthetically pleasing too.  ,"Looking for a relaxing ,fun beautiful attraction Chihuly Garden is a must. Take a walk through the city and enjoy."
Simply Stunning!,One of my favorite museums ever.  To really do this place justice in touring this gorgeous display of art and creativity through the inside and the gardens allow at least 3-4 hours and take a break in their lovely cafe and garden. It's a lovely way to beat the rain in Seattle.
Must see!,"In my opinion, the Chihuly Garden is a must-see in Seattle. It's right at the base of the Space Needle so it's very convenient and accessible. You also get a combo deal if you get both tickets at the same time. The museum itself is pretty small - you have about 4 or 5 rooms with the art (some of the pieces are massive though and it's still worth seeing because of how beautiful they are!). At the end, you get to the glass room where the pieces are hanging from up top. This is the picture spot as it is very dark in the other rooms of the museum. They also have an outside garden where there are more pieces and when I went, they were also doing a live demonstration of glass blowing which was very cool!"
Breathtaking glass art,The story behind this fantastic glass artist is fascinating and inspirational. Chihuly’s sense of color and light is clearly exhibited through his sculptural pieces and the large “chandeliers” are so very impressive! A must see for anyone - young or old!
Outstanding.  ,What a talent !  This was a great addition to seeing the Needle.  We enjoyed taking photos in garden The reflect the needle :)
Amazing Museum if the fine art of Glass Blowing,"I had been looking forward to the visit to Seattle so I could go this museum. It did not disappoint.  Chihuly creates amazing works of art with blown glass. Although he no longer blows the glass himself, he has the vision to put it all together, whether it is a chandelier, garden pieces, bowls, or whatever. So much color, shape, and form to look at. The only negative to this place is that I wish there were more pieces to see. It takes about 1-2 hours to get through, and there is also a live glass blowing demonstration."
Unbelievable Beauty,"This is the most amazing gallery ever. There are glass flowers and displays that are just too great to describe. I especially loved the display because I saw one work by this artist in Vernon NY at the Casino that is absolutely divine, so to see hundreds of these works was a real treat."
A PLACE OF DELITE AND FANTASY,"An afternoon at the Chihuly Garden and Glass will not disappoint.  Enjoy the colour, form, and surprise around every corner."
Original Art Meets Beautiful Setting,"The exhibit is fascinating from beginning to end. In addition to learning about Chihuly, you can view many great works that are one of a kind. The flora is not the real attraction, but the manicured gardens are filled with plants and colors we have never enjoyed previously.  Don’t miss the live demonstrations from local artist, and catch some of the shorts in the theatre.Enjoy!!"
Amazing glass garden,"Whenever out of town guests visit, I always take them here because it's a highlight for everyone (and I don't mind seeing it again and again).  The glass sculptures - from chandeliers to sea creatures to plants - are simply stunning.  I've taken photographs every time I've visited but two-dimensional pictures do not do justice to seeing them for real in 3-D.  There's now a glass blowing demonstration on site, which is worth catching if you're there at the right time. I highly recommend visiting this place - it's a garden like no other!"
Seattle's  local beauty,"This  is one of Seattle' unique local attraction.It houses the art of Chihully a renowned  artist from this area,I love this place  from the inside out. This a must visit in Seattle,I take family, friends here,this also a great venue for parties,wedding."
Breathtaking!,"The gardens and glass exhibits were beyond beautiful. We visited on a day when glass blowing exhibits were taking place and that as well was very interesting. I would highly recommend this, however not for small/elementary children."
A must place to visit in Seattle,"I live in Seattle and did not see this place for two year of opening as I thought it is not worth the ticket amount. Then a guest visiting me in around 2015 asked me if I can take him there. We went and it was awesome. From then on, I have taken every guest of mine to visit it. I strongly recommend it. Though I can share lot of pictures, I prefer not to because; If you do not see any picture and just go there, you will really enjoy it more."
An Awesome Experience,Visiting the Chihuly Garden and Glass Museum was the highlight of our trip to Seattle.  Our only regret was that we had not allocated enough time.  We will visit again.
Must see,"We saw a traveling exhibition of Chihuly’s work many years ago, but this permanent exhibit along with the gardens is a must do. One of the best parts is the theater which plays clips of various stages of his work. Made the whole experience so much richer!"
A must do,This was one of our highlights when visiting Seattle. The glass work is truly spectacular and mind blowing. There is also the opportunity to purchase  items inside the store. I highly recommend a visit here. We prepurchased tickets online before going so just walked straight in with no queuing.
Nice little stop off but glad we didn't have to pay on top of the space needle.,"We visited the glass gardens as part of our ticket purchase for the Space Needle.  I'm glad we didn't pay seperately/specifically for this or plan to visit this place alone as I found it a little boring.  The glass is beautiful and amazing what has been created, but there was not much else to do and I was really disappointed there was very little seating to stop and just take it all in.  As someone who suffers with a bad back, despite it all being on flat ground, there is still a need to be able to sit down for a few minutes.  There was a demonstration going on outside but it was too busy to see and again not enough seats.The gift shop is nice but very expensive."
So beautiful!,"This garden (not sure exactly what to call it) is beautiful! Dale Chihuly is the famous glass sculptor who created everything. There are three main parts, the garden, the glasshouse, and the exhibits where you see beautiful sculptures and colorful glass. It’s a quick spot, about an hour to see the whole thing but it’s so worth it! TIP: You can get admission to the Space Needle, Chihuly, the Aquarium, and two other attractions for one price with the Seattle CityPASS. It can offer great money savings if you’re visiting all the popular spots. OR if you aren’t going to the Aquarium you can buy tickets to both the Space Needle and Chihuly Garden together and save a few bucks."
Awesome!!!,"I have loved his art for 20 yrs, and finally got to experience a large amount of his art work in 1 day. Was the best experience ever."
Amazing and awe-inspiring,Incredible pieces of glass that make you wonder what you are doing with your life. I would recommend understanding and/or watching a demonstration about glass blowing to fully comprehend the intricacies that go into these large scale wonders. Not recommended for the clumsy.
Fantastic ,Great place to visit.  Beautiful glass art.  Expensive gift shop though.  I would recommend this to anyone
Stunning collection,"This is a fascinating place!  Chihuly’s work is fantastical, vibrant, breathtakingly beautiful.  The galleries are themed, wi5 the Persian ceiling room offering samples from each of the several themes represented throughout the museum. The garden is perfectly conceived, with many of the  glass pieces placed to evoke natural growth amid naturally growth. An added treat were two glass artists sharing their production process and finished product.  The museum is set among several other tourist sites, but this alone is well worth a visit. It’s pricy, but given the incredible beauty on display it’s fairly priced."
So Vibrant,I always enjoy coming here to see the artwork.  The colors are so vibrant.  The gardens are breathtaking
Just WOW!,"Frankly, if I did nothing else on this trip but visit the Chihuly Garden and Glass, I would have been happy.   The exhibit is just amazing, both indoors and out.   Very lovely.   We were able to see a demonstration on glass blowing which was an added bonus and really interesting.    Plus there are short movies of Chihuly working and installing many of this more notable exhibits.    The cafe is worth a visit for a light meal and the gift shop is dangerously fabulous!!"
Great experience!,"The glass art of Chihuly is truly amazing. As Finns we were also pleased to learn that he went several times to Nuutajärvi Finland to get inspiration and to learn from the glass blowing artists over there. He also studied in Murano, Venice in Italy. But the works he has created are different from all, he has developed his own style and creations linked with nature."
Fabulous space to view the various phases of Chihuly’s Work,We spent a lot of time during our four day stay in Seattle visiting diode Chihuly ensues. This site was by far the best to get a retrospective on his work and to glimpse new trends.
Blown away!,Awesome pictures and curated very well! Very convenient to go after visiting the space needle. Wonderful exhibit!
Serene,My husband and I just found this to be a peaceful setting! Looking at the beauty of the blown glass took our minds off all the cares in the world.
Glass blowing demonstration made the trip,"I have seen Chihuly installations before and this location is a wonderful show.  There are guided tours and speeches about his work as well as 5 - 6 short films to watch.  The cafe was being used for a private party so we could only look in to see the flowers adorning the ceiling. We especially enjoyed seeing the garden outside.  The highlight of our trip however, was the glass blowing demonstration that two of the students put on. They were done for the day but one glass blower offered to demonstrate a bubble and then they both got into it and did the bubble and a twisted vase.  It was very personal and really made our show."
Glass art that will blow your mind,"I wasn't expecting much, but it really blew me away. Of all the things in Seattle that are 20 bucks and completely for tourists, this is the one that you should do."
So awesome!,"This place should be visited by everyone who visits Seattle. The one in Tacoma, first original Chihuly Place is quite spectacular as well. Years ago we got to meet him there. He really is quite an artist genius."
Lovely lovely,"The glass exhibit was lovely, words fail me at the exquisite exhibit, I went with friends and we had an amazing time, we got the $23 admission from 4-5pm and it was just enough to see most of the art."
Breathtaking!,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Chihuly gardens. We bought our tickets when we arrived and were able to enter immediately. The glass works are so attractively presented both inside and outside in the gardens. There were quite a few people, but it did not seem overcrowded, and it was always possible to see each piece of glass on display. The gift shop is very good with lots of unique products for sale. Don’t miss the short films about Chihuly which are shown back to back in the theatre."
Jaw-dropping beauty!,"I've seen some Chihuly glass work elsewhere, but this exhibit is by far the most spectacular!  From hand-sized glass bowls to giant chandeliers to whole walk-through gardens of plant-like blown glass--there are forms and colors to dazzle the eyes and imagination.  This was much more than I expected.  Well worth the time to visit and take it in."
Love museums but this isn’t worth the money,It’s very cool but it’s definitely a tourist trap.  If you’re on a budget you can definitely skip this.  Space needle is also a tourist trap but it’s cooler.
colorful,Visited this place twice- last year and this year.  It is  worth to visit .the colorful display will make awe .
Amazing!,Beautiful place to visit. The sculptures were so amazing. Worth paying a visit. Also its besides the space needle and de pop museum son you can do the 3 attractions the same day.
Beautful and Vast,"When we toured the Chihuly Garden & Glass Museum recently, it was with the sole intent of visiting the Space Needle. We originally had no intention of visiting this beautiful museum.However, we did purchase a dual ticket as the museum is next to the Space Needle.  We were glad we did visit this glass menagerie of beautiful sculptures as the Space Needle in itself was a disappointment.  The Chihuly Garden and Glass is by far better and should be considered the MAIN attraction in this are.We were fortunate to visit when the weather was perfect in Seattle, making it all that much better.  The natural light of the beautiful sunny day lent to the beauty of the sculptures.If you're in this area and want to see it and have only the choice between the Space Needle and the Chihuly Garden and Glass, I would definitely recommend the Chihuly Garden and Glass!"
Spectacular glass exhibit,"I have seen Murano, Waterford, Corning and other glass works exhibits but never anything like this.  They scale, design, vivid color all add to the incredible beauty of this artist's genius.  Well worth the admission price.  You won't see anything like it elsewhere!"
Beautiful glass art from a Washington native,"The glass museum is great to visit either day or night. It takes about an hour to go through the full exhibit and garden. Plan more time and look at the schedule if you want to watch the glass blowing demonstration, which is pretty neat and will help you understand how Chihuly creates his art. I really appreciated the elements that were inspired by the Pacific Northwest - I didn’t know before coming here that Chihuly is from Washington!"
OH MY WORD!!!!!!,I LOVE glass and am a glass fuser as well.  It was a stunning array of beautiful creativity!!!!!!!  I can't say enough.
Stunning exibits,Wonderful exhibition.  Well worth the entrance fee.  Best visited when its not raining in order to fully appreicate the outside exhibits
Amazing! The ticket was worth it! ,"I didn't want to spend all the money for the ticket, but it was worth it. The glass figurines left me speechless! The outside garden was amazing... A bird dropped its poop on my head! A sign of luck?"
Fun in Chihuly,"If you are looking for a fun activity in Seattle check out the Chihuly Garden, it also great because it is right by the Space needle and they have a bundle deal so you can do both with a discount!"
Beautiful Place!,I absolutely loved the beautiful glass art work here. Give yourself plenty of time to walk around so you can enjoy seeing every piece.
Glass - Go See It!,"This visit truly emphasizes what a ""work of art"" is. The beautiful pop colors glow through out the exhibit. Towards the end of the exhibit, a massive floral ceiling display is complimented by the Space Needle above - very cool!"
Incredible!! ,"Such an incredible exhibit that we weren’t expecting. I think the indoor is the best, but still so cool to walk around and see everything. There was also a small presentation by some lovely ladies actually showing the glass blowing process which was super cool! Absolutely make the trip to see this."
Seattle is a glass town. So when in Seattle...,"Very nice glass garden!Chihuly always does such an incredible job creating these dynamic feasts for the eye. He’s the glass artist to see. No one compares, although he has many glass blowers doing glass for him. He’s created the inventive explosive world of glass. Everyone should see his work first hand sooner or later."
A feast for the eyes and the soul ,"Chihuly is stunning! A magnificent display of incredible art glass creatively placed in room and after room. Depth of color, ingenuity and glass making pushed to the brink of what your mind could ever imagine possible!! Highlight of our trip to Seattle bar none!"
Magical,What a great place to walk around and enjoy absolutely beautiful glass art!  Pretty dramatic and fun! Staff very professional and friendly!
Exceeded expectations ,We had a lovely visit to the Chihuly museum. Absolutely stunning exhibits and loved the outdoor area.  We bought a combination ticket with the Space Needle and they were great activities to choose for a rainy day!
Breathtaking museum!,The glass art installations are amazing. You could spend as much or as little time here as you need. Recommend watching the video of Chihuly making his art towards the end -- it's mind blowing! Pro tip: if you go after 4:00p it's $10 off.
impressive blown glass art,This is a must see in Seattle. An enormous amount of sculptures in the museum and the gardens. This is an art school that is unique and knock you down beautiful.We have visited Murano in Venice and this surpasses it .
Gorgeous Art Pieces,The outside light just intensifys the brilliant colors in the artwork  Take your time and really appreciate the shapes and reflections of the glass.
Mesmerizing,"Spent a couple hours in the Chihuly Garden and Glass Museum.  What a beautiful place.  The colors and shapes of the glass is mesmerizing; particularly when you view the pieces through the mirrored glass.  I thought the place would be a bit larger, but I certainly wasn't disappointed in the artwork."
Impressive Display,Had relatives come to town who had heard of Chihuly and wanted to visit the exhibit. We got there just before a large tour group and got right into the exhibit. The glass displays were impressive but the added lighting turned the displays into breathtaking art. The exhibit is well worth the expense.
Worthwhile Activity,Consider visiting later in the day.  It is less crowded and the glass looks brilliant in the twilight.
It is top rated for a reason,"This newer museum in number 1 on TA because Chihuly is a truly gifted Seattle hero. His fantastic works were displayed in a modern venue with gardens. The exhibits started with his early works, of course. But even more impressive were his later works. Don't miss this."
"GET THE BUNDLE DEAL , IF YOU DOING BOTH NEEDLE AND THIS.","Bundle deal was $60 ish for both the Needle and the GardenWasn't really sure what to expect of this garden cause I didn't' even know of it. I ended up purchasing the bundle deal for the needle and before our time slot to go up we decided to stop by and check this place out.Like I said I wasn't really sure what to expect , once i got in there I realized it was just a lot of art glasses which is pretty dope to check out. This garden is literally a giant paper weight museum , if you don't know what a paper weight is , GOOGLE IT.Finished the entire museum and kept on going , it was like I said cool to see , but I personally would not pay separately to go to this garden. If it was FREE though , that's a whole entire different story."
Chihuly Garden,This is a must see....beautiful and one of a kind glass work! The art pieces inside are so detailed and amazing! Be sure to have your camera.
Amazing work of art!,"Locating right next to Space Needle, one must not miss this museum.  We enjoyed the vibrant colors and creativity of the beautiful works of art. There is also a live show of glass making in the end. The only downside is that entrance fees is pretty expensive."
Wow - amazed - beautiful and worth a visit,"Ok wasn't sure what to expect except glass work - it completely surpassed my expectations.  Has an film area where you can learn about Dale Chihuly and his incredible skill with glass - and his contributions.  Each room was like a feast for the eyes..beautiful colours and settings, plus an outdoor area where the glass work has been worked into the gardens.  It was well worth a visit and very enlightening....we got our ticket in concert with the trip to the space needle.  Both places are worth a visit for glimpse of Seattle history over the past 50 or so years....and yes you can take photos inside the exhibit."
Amazing ,"Beautiful all the work with the glass, there are people doing pieces of glass and the store have beautiful things too. Loved it!!"
Great glass house and garden!,Really enjoyed the museum and gardens.The museum is small but showcases well the progression of Dale's work and creativity. The garden is especially nice. I love the glass amidst the plants and trees.
Amazing art glass....blew my socks off,WE had 2 hours to view the amazing art glass. We ran out of time. This was the best place I went to in Seattle
"loved, loved , loved !!","If you love gardens you will love this ,its so amazing the glass blown sculpures incorproated in with the gardens. simply outstanding."
Beautiful but small,Came here on my own because I love chihuly's work. I am familiar with him from my time in Indianapolis where he made the centerpiece for the children's museum. I have also watched a documentary on him. So of course being in Seattle I had to come see his museum. It is $32 to get in but they do offer a military discount and bundling with other Seattle activities. I probably spent an hour and a half here. The artwork is beautiful of course. Who doesn't love fire blown glass?! The only downside is I felt it was rather small for the amount of money it cost to come in. But I did get some lovely pictures of his pieces. his work God's way too much to buy anything out of the gift shop.
Wonderful Collection and Experience,"Great collection of glass pieces and unique display.  It was well oriented and included various styles of his work. Integration into the garden mirrors other installations, but the colors as shown in the picture make this layout unique."
New Appreciation for Glasswork,This was a great find after visitng the Space Needle! The museum has photo opportunities that are free with your ticket too!
Best Chihuly exhibit!!,"I love Chihuly's glass works and have seen them several places throughout the country but this was the best yet.  Both the indoor museum and the outdoor gardens are magnificent (it helped that it was a beautiful sunny day).  Worth the time and the cost, especially if you are a Chihuly fan."
Spectacular glass art,Went to Chihuly Museum for the first time recenlty - it was fabulous!  I'm sure I could visit there every day for a year and be blown away (pun not initially intended but left in) every time.  Much of the art is inside - and very well displayed through the creative use of light.  The outside pieces would look different at various times of day/year and would be equally enthralling whenever seen.  The creativity and imagination of Mr Chihuly and the glass sculptures he (and his students) have created were spellbinding.  I have never seen more beautiful (and technically difficult) glass art.  I could see Mr Chihuly's influence in the work of other contemporary glass artists that I have seen over the years. Visiting this museum was the highlight of my trip to Seattle.
Amazing,"Loved the exhibition. We’ve seen Chihuly glass in lots of places in the uk (Kew, V&A, Claridge’s) but to see the variety here was exceptional. Super interesting introductory talk and some live glass blowing demonstrations. Well worth the visit."
Great exhibit,"This is a great exhibit of Chihuly’s work.  There is a ticket for the space needle and this exhibit bundled, which is a good value, and they are right next to one another."
Beautiful as ever,"I’ve been to the gardens several times, but took a friend who is an artist and had flown in from Virginia she knew about this venue and wanted to go. It was great and as she knew about glass design it was interesting get her perspective."
Blown glass,What a beautiful exhibit!  The work was so stunning and amazing.  It is not huge but take your time and go through and really look at the breathtaking work that was done.  then we enjoyed a beautiful lunch there.  I would suggest you put in a reservation as soon as you arrive as it is always busy.  the crab cakes were delicious.
Worth it,If you love Chihuly this is worth the stop. We were there on a sunny day and the garden and green house were beautiful. The indoor exhibits were also amazing!
Beautiful,Beautiful museum with a free audio guide. Great place to take pictures and not particularly big. The museum isn't filled with too many descriptions to read so you can listen and learn as you walk through the different stages of Chihuly's career. For a budget traveller I recommend going during the cheaper hours. Go early -- there's always a line.
Beautiful displays of glass. ,"Was blown away by the glass designs and displays. Every turn found a new amazing piece of art. Stunningly displayed, each piece is perfect. Loved the garden displays and the way the glass complimented the plantings. Just wish I could take them all home with me."
Amazing!,"OMG! This museum is an absolute must for people who love glass and the work of Dale Chihuly! My husband and I spent an entire afternoon in the museum and garden, amazed by the beauty of his work. We enjoyed the video that featured him working and the various installations he had done around the world. We were fortunate that the rain had stopped so we could walk outside in the garden and view in amazement the garden of beautiful nature and his glass combined in a breath taking interaction. This museum, for lovers of glass, is a must!"
Amazing work of art and colors!,"A must see in Seattle just next to Space needle buy combo ticket online ahead is much cheaper, so much to see, we enjoy the video about glasses making."
PRt of the city pass,"We decided to go to the Chihuly Garden after we went to the Space Needle and boy were we surprised, ever time we turned a corner we were amazed at the glass collection.  It was a myriad of colours.  Wow is all could say.  This is a must see in my books"
Vacation ,"The Chihuly Glass Museum was truly breathtaking!  This man is so amazing, his inspiration will inspire anyone!! This is a must see!!"
Magnificent display,"I thoroughly enjoyed visit. Room after room of wonderful glass displayed. Glass above a glass ceiling. Glass between flower beds in the garden, glass bowls on pedestals. Masses of beautiful glass forms everywhere.  I loved it"
Stunning art work,"As many have noted, the price was steep, but it was good. We bought the combo ticket at Space Needle to save money. It wasn't too crowded for a Saturday. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because the internet/wifi/signal was so weak I couldn't enjoy the narrated tour on my phone. If worked at my home, but not once we entered the building. I scanned the codes on the poster, but it was always three rooms behind where I was. It is great to see once, but I don't need to visit again."
