Skyway,"Fun bridge to drive over and great a great view of Tampa Bay,  Traffic can get dicey at times,  just watch out of out of state plates and you might survive the trip"
Amazing architecture!,The Skyway bridge is a fantastic piece of architecture. Before you get there you’ll see it looming in the distance and as you get closer you are more and more impressed with the design of the bridge. Right before you go onto the bridge there is a rest stop with extremely clean and new facilities.  No toll :-)
Flying high on the Skyway,"It's a beautiful  bridge and the  view is spectacular.It's a toll bridge but a small price to pay for the view.I am not a fisherman, but the old bridge seems to bring those fish people."
Cool Bridge,The Sunshine Skyway Bridge is a fun bridge to cross.  Very cool to get to the center and pass by the spires.
What a drive,Driving across this bridge was an experience that was worth the drive. No tolls were required. We went slightly out of our way to cross the bridge and were pleasantly surprised by the bridge and the views we received from it. If you are even close to the area the drive across is well worth it.
"Just a fun, beautiful drive on a sunny day!","Lots of fishing and swimming spots, the USCGC BLACKTHORN memorial is worth stopping by on the North Side."
Moves fast and majestical.,"Awesome experience.  For starters, traffic was not backed up (and we were on this bridge at 5 different times across a 6 day stay in Tampa).  Secondly, the views are jaw dropping.  Finally. it's a bit of a rush driving over it.  Knowing how steep the climb is, it gave us a little bit of an adrenaline rush to be honest.  Awesome experience."
Great views from skyway,"Awesome drive with great views above Tampa Bay / Gulf of Mexico.  Places before and after the ramp up and down to pull off in rest area for views and/or fishing (the fishing piers are remnants of the old 2-lane bridge, parts left up on both ends of the Skyway).  Nice easy drive in dry weather, traffic was smooth.  There is a $1.50 toll (prices as of 5/31/20)."
Beautiful and Exciting,"If you love heights, gorgeous views, and large bodies of water, this bridge is for you! After years of seeing it in pictures, it was thrilling to finally have the opportunity to drive across the Sunshine Skyway Bridge. Unfortunately, this bridge is not walkable, but the drive is lovely."
Amazing!,"This was spectacular.  It was like an amusement park ride.  I was driving it is was difficult to keep my eyes on the road and to be honest, a wee bit nauseating.  Definitely a must see."
Yikes!,"If you’re afraid of heights, take an alternate route. 400 ft above Tampa Bay at the apex.  Just stay in your lane."
Unusual style bridge,This bridge was a welcome difference for the commonly bridges we are use to seeing. It’s certainly an example of great engineering.
Up close,We traveled under the bridge when on a cruise ship and wow was it an amazing experience. We saw it on way back when it was all lite up so pretty
Easy and very driveable,"Beautiful architecture and very driveable. No traffic issues, to contend with. No delays, of any kind."
Breathtaking and surreal,I'm not the nervous type but I did get a slight chill up my spine the closer we got to the bridge!!! It truly is a marvel of engineering and worth the ride!!!
Fantastic Bridge,A unbelivable bridge structure. The middle of the bridge has a steep incline then flatens out then has a steep decline to eliminate a need for a draw bridge
On To be there on a cool winter morningA Clear Day,"Like the classic movie, on a clear day it seems you can see forever! To be there on a cool, clear winter afternoon with the sun over the Gulf and cloudless over land, it is a sight to behold."
Spectacular Bridge,This bridge is very interesting and unique. Traveling across it gives you a great view of Tampa Bay and the activities on both sides.
A must see from a boat.,I had all the grandkids take turns driving under it.Great memories!  Beautiful pictures and great fishing. This is a must do.
Tall and beautiful bridge,"The bridge is beautiful, high, it is a pity that in the middle there is no normal viewing platform. And so the view from there is amazing"
Great view,"I love Tampa's bridges. Traffic always seems to flow easily. Nice view of the piers, and nice water view from the top"
Worth the trip to and from Tampa and St. Pete,"Make sure you get off heading North and go to Pass-a-grill, a small community just like Florida was in the 50's and 60's."
My favorite bridge in the Tampa area!,"Did not know you could rate a bridge, but here goes! We moved down here 2 years ago and the Skyway bridge is about 15 miles from us. It is 450 feet high over the Tampa Bay and is about 12 miles long. I go out of my my to go over it as it is a beautiful ride into St Petersburg over the Bay. No big wall to block the view and the cables are in the center so view is great! It kind of skips on islands to your destinations. Parts of the old bridge is used as fishing piers plus there are parking areas on the sides for relaxing and picnicking. Love crossing it!"
Sunshine Skyway Bridge,Picturesque highway with stunning bridge. Bridge was tolled at $1.50 each way cash or Florida SunPass if you have it. Be aware that the bridge could close in high wind situations.
Fun ride on a motorcycle,"I was worried about being scared on the back of a motorcycle going over the bridge. It wasn’t bad at all. Even though th3 bridge is tall enough for cruise ships to go under, the grade is slow enough that you really don’t notice how high you are.  It cost us $1.50 in toll."
Fantastic views,"Great going over this beautiful bridge with views either side.  Very impressive bridge structure, although it closed the one day due to heavy rainstorms and winds, so beware as you may have to go all the way around if it is closed."
Beautiful bridge,Lovely drive from St Petersburg to Bradenton.  Bridge is great.  Toll is only $1.50 each way.  Well worth it.
Stop at the South pier,"Sunshine skyway bridge is an architectural masterpiece spanning the entire Tampa Bay, connecting St. Petersburg on north with Bradenton on south.It's one of the longest bridges in world. At the highest point it has two pylons, beneath which if you're lucky, you could see cruisers passing.Stopping on bridge is forbidden, but you can do that on one of two fishing piers, which have their exits marked. The piers are on each side, but I recommend the SOUTH one - look for Mantee County rest area.The south pier is longer, and gets you closer to the central pylons. Beware, it's a fishing pier and you have to pay the fee for entering it. For 1 hr tourist sightseeing without fishing it's around $3, more if you're going to fish."
Very pretty spot,"Visited the bridge and there was a beautiful h on one side and fish pier on the other.  Lots of birds at the beach part, jumping fish was a lovely suprise."
Great view,Glad to say we crossed this bridge while in the Tampa area. Nice clear day allowed us to have great views in both directions
Motorcycle ride in the Sky!,"Well, we all know Florida is FLAT!  But we that live in Bay area and ride a motorcyle know that we have a altitude Gem for riding.  Best time to ride across this ""Mountain in Fl"" is early Saturday or Sunday morning, especially as the sun is rising and the traffic is light! You will enjoy the view, and the breeze!  Convertable can also enjoy this ride and time of day!"
Great views,Enjoyed going over the bridge for the views. be sure to stop at either end of the bridge for the view of the whole bridge and picture taking
Commute Daily ,Love the night colored lights at night. Great views of the Bay. I commute to work from Tampa to Sarasota on 3rd shift and I always look forward the the different colored light at night.
Higher and higher.,"If you never been on a high bridge, this one will tack you  their , It's a magnificent view, but keep your eyes on the road, and i hope it's not to windy up their ."
Cool.,This was pretty cool to cross but scary as well.  I wanted to look around but it was really windy and while driving a rental car I could feel myself getting blown all over the place.  I was freaking out.  Next time I will be a passenger and get some good pictures.
Nice short cut!,You pay the price to go thru the bridge and it's only a dollar.But it saves you a lot of time and petrol.
beautiful,"we went across the bridge on our way to anna maria island. This is a really nice bridge traffic keeps at a nice speed. We returned to Tampa is the night and it was nice to see the bridge in the different colors. It was very beautiful, we were told they change the colors for holidays."
Gorgeous. Simply Gorgeous...,"...especially at sunset, which it was as we sailed beneath it at the start of our cruise. An architectural gem augmented by the varying colored lights make it truly striking. Sorry about the quality of the images; They were taken through a dining room window on the cruise."
Crossed the Skyway Bridge on my way to Miami,"Living in the Tampa Bay area, it was convenient for me to cross the Skyway Bridge on I-275 as I was heading south to Miami. There was no traffic on the road leading to and no traffic getting off the bridge. Very convenient and easy."
Drove across the bridge,I drove across this bridge and it was a smooth ride.  A marvel of engineering and a sight to behold.  Great way to cross the water.
Wake me on the other side!,"Went over twice, the second time by accident, enough said!... I'll go around if a 3rd is necessary.."
You have to drive it,drive it and also stop off at the rest area at the south part of the bridge and take a picnic   - its restful looking over the bay.
Definitely worth driving over,"This is an amazing bridge. If you are a passenger in the car, you have excellent views of the bay. I would suggest taking turns driving if you can so all get to experience it."
Beautiful,A beautiful bridge Everyone should ride it. Worth visiting pier. There is a strong wind at the top but the views are great.
Beautiful,"This is a beautiful sight at night, we sailed under it and wow what a sight.  It is lite up and the colors change ."
It's a bridge,There's not much to see here. It's a bridge. It's kind of cool and long but you can feel it move on a windy day.
A Must See In St Pete,I absolutely love this bridge. It was amazing seeing it from a boat. You can view the fishing piers and people kite surfing. It's even stunning at night with all the lights on it.
What a view !,"We have used that bridge at least 15 times in past years. Always a WOW experience. Good way to appreciate the Great Florida landscape and sea view. Fantastic view. When you drive south, watch your right for the big US flag far away. This is Fort De Soto. Enjoy !"
Day or night beauty,The views while driving over the bridge are amazing especially when a cruise ship goes under. The yellow bridge lights at night are always beautiful but now with the led lights it make it even better- and they change colors so most trips are different !
Nice restroom,Very very nice/new restrooms and a decent bait shop. But no fish were biting. Not sure if I’d try this spot again.
Awesome fishing for the whole family,Every time I fish here it is amazing. Always catch no exceptions. The bridge lights at night are amazing.
Beautiful view,My husband and I were headed to a concert and decided to take the scenic route.  On a clear sunny day it's beautiful!! We are headed back this month to see it lit up at nighttime.  I hear that it's lit in Christmas colors.
Part of our road trip,Fun drive over the bridge. Plenty of places to get photos. Saw cool places to fish if thats your thing.
One high ride,"This bridge was really high up, the views are amazing however don't drive over when it's windy. The sounds of the wind as well as the shake of your steering wheel as you grip it to make sure the breeze doesn't blow you away can seem slightly scary."
Beautiful and well maintained,"My wife could not stop talking about it, she absolutely loved it, you can see it from miles away and it gets even more beautiful as you get closer."
Amazing Bridge,This bridge connects Manatee and Pinellas Counties. It’s a quick way to go from the tip of one to the other without having to go around Tampa Bay. Hillsborough County also owns land under the bridge. The bridge itself was built in the late 1970s due to the unfortunate accident of a ship hitting it in the early morning hours. It is a story that should be read and is easily found online. Many lives were lost. Once you have gone over the bridge you should turn around and on either side or access roads two parks on either end. On the south end is a fishing pier. It is made out of the entrance ramp to one of the old bridge spans. There is a memorial plaque but I’m not sure where it is located.  Sometimes people take horses out to one of the parks and let them run through the salt water. If you are not from the area it might be a good idea to Google the bridge and see what other amenities are available. This is a really large bridge and all the ships coming into the port of Tampa Bay go underneath it. If you are afraid of driving across bridges this is not the bridge for you. Unless you have a high occupancy vehicle you will not be able to see over the side at the top.
Best view in Florida!,"The bridge itself is aesthetically appealing, but the view from it is unmatchable in our experience. Water views in all directions, just wonderful!"
Always spectacular!,I will never get tired of crossing this absolutely beautifully built bridge.Toll booths attendants are helpful.
A magnificent site,"Our cruise ship sailed underneath the bridge at night, and it was all lit up red white and blue for Veterans Day... stunning!"
Beautiful structure!,I have driven over this many times. Beautiful views form the top. Drivers can be a bit crazy going over it. Everyone is in a hurry! I also remember the original bridge that was torn down after the accident. Part of it is a fishing pier.
So cool,"Such a cool bridge to ride over, and you could see for miles.  We drove over it, and back 3 times because it was such an awesome view."
OMG that's a BIG bridge.,"Vewy Scawy!!  OK, well it is a bit of a thrill to go over.  When you first see it, you think wow, I'm gonna drive over that.  A must crossing to check breweries and attractions in Bradenton and Sarasota...  Adventure on!!"
One of Favs,This bridge has an interesting history and the architecture is pretty cool. Definitely worth the dollar for tolls.
Fan of Bridges,"I’m a fan of bridges. Big bridges, small bridges, old bridges, new bridges, covered bridges, one-lane bridges, floating bridges and suspension bridges. You get the idea. The Sunshine Skyway Bridge is a handsome bridge and the engineering is impressive. I had a unique opportunity on a recent weekend. I was able to sail under the bridge on Friday and Saturday followed by driving over the bridge, both during the day and then at night on Sunday. The new attraction regarding the bridge are the recently installed lights, which were pointed out to me while boating under the SSB. Far more impressive than seeing them unlit, during the day, is to see the effect of the lit lights before crossing it from the South. Brilliant red and white lights are fixed on alternating pillars with blue lights on the edge of the bridge deck. It’s a huge tribute to the Stars and Stripes!  My only question? Will they be red and green at Christmas?"
One of America's must-drive-bridges,"How does one write a review about a bridge? Well, actually, I'm very much a fan of cool bridges. The Vincent Thomas Bridge, Golden Gate Bridge, New River Gorge Bridge and Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge spring to mind, among others. Actually, the Skyway kind of resembles the latter and it ranks right among them. It's a toll bridge, unfortunately, but being a symbol of Florida, you really should drive it. We drove it north to south and then exited on the Gulf side. There's a fishing pier, which is acutally part of the original bridge, from where you get a pretty good vantage point for photographs, not to mention great birdwatching (ospreys, egrets, terns, etcetera)."
Nice views ,Great views and you’ll see if going to the airport into Tampa. I wouldn’t go out of my way to see this as a must do and to be honest top 7 in Tampa?
Beautiful Bridge,One of the nicest looking bridges. It was nice drive over the bridge to view the waters and trees. It was nice afternoon drive over the bridge.
Beauty and Experience!,Traveling over this gorgeous bridge provides a view of Tampa Bay like no other.   You can see city skylines and the beautiful Gulf of Mexico from a bird's eye view.
Tremendous view,"One of America's best harbor views...to see an ocean going freighter,tanker, or war ship from right on top of it is a sight to be seen...one you will not forget."
Must see ,Best bridge in Florida. Make certain it’s not backed up or construction is happening because you will there d for hours
Cruising under the bridge!,"We cruised under this spectacular bridge on a Carnival cruise to Havana.  A ""must see""!  If you ever get the chance, do it!! Plan on being outside on the top decks around 6 pm (it usually takes a while to get from the Tampa docks to the Skyway Bridge, but you feel like you can reach up and touch it!!"
Amazing,We crossed the bridge by chance and we were not only surprised by the height but also the view of the sea and the palm trees with a beautiful sunset.
Dont stop at the top,this beautiful bridge attracts suicidal people..please dont hymp..its a permanent solution to a temporary problem
What A Beautiful Sight!,"My husband and I enjoy visiting one of our favorite spots in Treasure Island called “Gigis Pizza”!  It’s a great place and we enjoy taking the route that takes us over the skyway bridge!  We enjoyed the beautiful new lights that have been installed recently as we headed over this past weekend.  The view is gorgeous! Upon approach you see a beautiful angle that soon changes as you climb to the top where you can see the lights of campers on the shoreline, houses and yes boats beneath!  On your decent yet again a view that just does not disappoint! It’s gorgeous no matter the time of day but especially romantic at night!"
The Sunshine Skyway Bridge is amazing!,It's breathtaking during the daytime and the upper gold lighting at night is too.  Now more colorful lighting has been added to the underneath sections so it's even more magnificent at night than ever!
Weekend Trip to Calidesi Island,Saturday we took a Quick Trip to Caladesi Island and spent some Quality time with family and ate at the local Resturant in the island. On the way we took the skyway bridge and it always amases me about the Engineering behind this Bridge. You have to sit on the passengers seat and admire the views and beauty of this bridge. The drive is so serene and peacefull.
Skybridge ,This is a good size bridge.  Don't go if you're scared of heights.  The view's are amazing. Nice afternoon drive.
Its A nice new bridge,very nice bridge to drive on there are some great views that is about all one can say about it because you cant stop to sight see
Always a beautiful sight,Still amazes me this bridge is so huge and stunning to see and drive over this beautiful thing.  When it gets too windy....yikes they will close it down.
Very cool! ,"Doesn’t take much to get us excited! During our travel back to Orlando from Clearwater, we had to experience bridge. Just beautiful. Be sure to Google it’s history to learn how it came to be. Interesting albeit sad."
Beautiful,My husband and I were in St. Petersburg for 2 days for a wedding and we were looking for things to do. We stayed at a hotel down the road and were interested in this big bridge we could see from there. So we looked it up on trip advisor  and decided to check it out. It was a Beautiful ride across and back. Something quick to do. Came back to our room and read up on it. Very interesting history. Definatly something to check out if you are in the area.
Drove across this bridge on our way to St Pete!,This is a cool looking bridge!  I took a few pictures while my hubby was driving.  Very striking architecture!
Always impressive,"I remember driving over this bridge the first time in 2004, and being in awe at with the height and length, just as I was with the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. There is a fishing pier at each end that we would fish from, along with bathrooms and a small convenience store."
Great views across the bay worth the toll just to get this,It gives great views across and over the bay its worth the toll  just to get the views. The rest areas also are worth a stop for the views as well
Cool Bridge,Travel over this bridge often on holiday! Always a funny experience because it's one of the only times my mum's ever quiet for longer then 5 minutes due to her fear! Fantastic.
Great at night,We always come over this bridge when coming to or leaving Tampa. It's great at either through the day or just as good at night.
"SUNPASS WILL TAKE YOUR $$ THEN REPORT YOU DIDN’T PAY - Tampa, St. Petersburg, Bradenton area","This bridge is an amazing piece of architecture.  The views are beautiful.  However, BEWARE of the tolls!!  We paid in cash without getting receipts on two different trips across the bridge for a total of four payments.  A month later we receive a BILL from SUNPASS stating we didn’t pay once,  and they have a picture of our license plate.  I responded TWICE to this stating that my husband was driving, and I handed him the cash.  He then handed the cash to the attendant.  We were NEVER offered a receipt.   SUNPASS sent generic emails back to me, and now have increased the amount we “owe”.   THIS IS RIDICULOUS!!  SOMEONE IS POCKETING THIS MONEY!!   If you are going across this bridge and haven’t purchased the annual pass, which most tourists don’t, be very careful.  If you are paying cash - DEMAND A RECEIPT!!  If someone in your car has a cell phone, VIDEO THE TRANSACTION!!  If we ever go back, I will video, demand a receipt, and if possible put charge on a credit card."
It's a beautiful bridge,"I drove across it.  It took a while. Traffic wasn't bad, water was beautiful and the weather was overcast."
It's very high!,I have driven across a couple of times now and it does feel like you are driving into the sky. It is very stationary as it is made of concrete so no worries there.
"Massive, Gigantic & Impressive! ","Always an eye inspiring site! Its massive stature is awe inspiring! An important add to your ""To - Do"" list! GetSome!!"
MYway to see the SKYway,Viewing this behemoth in a boat from the water is the best way to get a real good look! They are soon going to light this up at night with LED lighting and it will be even more beautiful to see when this is finished!!
Go out of your way to cross this bridge,"If you are in the Tampa area, head over to this bridge. It has places to park and view the bridge at your leisure."
Beautiful and majestic,"Love riding south and watching for the boats. Checking out the fishing pier, heading south to our favorite beach.When heading north toward St Pete, after the decline, be sure to keep your eyes looking for the bunches of kite skiers! The colors are magnificent in their variety."
High and Wide,Fantastic drive over this high bridge across wide Tampa Bay... Beautiful view of the cool blue water...
A Bridge over the Bay,The bridge offers a nice view of the bay. There are reset area that offer relaxing views. On the south bound side there are historical markers. The rest area also offer great picture opportunities for pictures. You can also access the fishing piers (these were once part of the old bridge). There is a toll for the bridge and a separate fee for the fishing pier.
Amazing place,"We were driving from South Florida to Clearwater beach and passed through the Skyharbor bridge. The view was breath taking, blue lake, cypress trees, nice and modern rest area, great place for a picnic or kayaking or fishing or making awesome memories. Definitely recommend a stop to see this place."
Drive it at sunrise or sunset,It's a beautiful iconic drive when you're in the area with rest areas on either side. It's a beautiful view of the area.
Spectacular Views,Go over this Bridge Slowly to Take in all of the wonderful views!!  It is a great spot to get pictures with great water shots!
fantastic,omg this was something else.  really high bridge. scary but in a nice way.  loved every minute of the ride acress
Sit Back and Enjoy the View,A little scary as you are climbing up the bridge but it’s part of the experience- the height and views give an edgy anticipation as you crest the top of this thing!  Wow. I liked it!First time across the bridge. There’s another bridge north of this one; I was surprised to learn that there were 2 impressive long bridges in this area. Florida - I wouldn’t mind retiring here.
Amazing,This is 5he first time I have been on this bridge.  It was amazing to see the height of the bridge.  The views were amazing.
Easy driving,Great Brige! Wonderful view for passengers and even the driver can sneak peaks at the beauty of the bay and shoreline. I have uses this bridge too many times to count but each trip is breathtaking for the view
Mileage Saver,"I was already in St. Petersburg going to Rays baseball game at Tropicana Field.  Made no sense to go north, then back across the bay to Tampa if I was driving south to Fort Lauderdale Airport with the rental car.  The bridge is both beautiful and a major time and distance saver, well worth the $1.50 toll that is charged."
A Symbol of Florida,"The Bob Graham Sunshine Skyway Bridge, often referred to as the Sunshine Skyway Bridge or simply the Skyway, is a cable-stayed bridge spanning the Lower Tampa Bay connecting St. Petersburg, Florida to Terra Ceia.The original bridge opened in 1954 and was the site of two major maritime disasters within a few months in 1980."
Beautifully Done,Always a pretty drive over this incredible bridge. It was constructed so well and it is incredibly put together. Super amazing how the cruise ships go right under. Def check it out.
Beautiful Bridge,"The view from this bridge is fabulous, exciting to drive over the span. Nice to look at it at night."
Breathtaking Views,"If you're not the driver, you should soak up the sun and views from this great bridge. The Skyway also had places to fish and relax over the intracoastal waterway."
fabulous,"loved the spectactular view from the bridge. I am afraid of crossing bridges, but this one wasn't too bad"
Worth the drive to go see (drive over) this if in the area.,"We took I-275 south intentionally as we headed back home to southwest Florida, just to experience this bridge. Expect a toll (either direction and Sunpass accepted). Reasonable fee. We've been on this bridge before and observed some pretty aggressive drivers, today was nice and quiet"
"""Up & Over""",My son and I traveled across this bridge on our way to a recent ballgame at Tropicana Field. Definitely a majestic structure out in the middle of the bay. $1.50 crossing each way seemed fair considering the expense to maintain a bridge of this magnitude.
Nice and High Bridge,"The Bridge is quite high but we can not stop our vehicle on the bridge, Bridge has nominal Toll. There is another side road or service after immediate exit  at both side. The service road beside the bridge also has entry fee. Most of people go there to catch the Fishes."
Great View!,"This is a very nice bridge to travel across.  However, be warned that if you are wanting to take pictures and/or really enjoy the view, do it from the passenger position (front or rear).  Drivers going across this bridge can sometimes be very aggressive and inpatient.  There are also times when the wind (due to the height of the bridge) can be an issue.  Other than those minor issues, it is a very nice bridge with an awesome view whether traveling North or South.  It is especially nice when you can time crossing while a cruise ship or barge is going under the bridge, gives an entire different perspective on how large both the bridge and ships are."
Impressive but Scary if raining! ,"Impressive bridge - difficult to imagine how it was built cause it is so long and sooo tall! Great view if not raining. We traveled across it the first time and it was raining hard! I felt like we were going up into the clouds and it was scary! The rain also made traffic very slow but somewhat thankful for that. On the return visit, it was clear day and it was a much better view and experience."
Been There Done That,This really is a great structure and you can see it from many different locations - from St Pete to Anna Maria Island and on a really good day I think you can see it from Apollo Beach.  You really get a feel of it’s size when a large ship passes by when you are crossing the bridge but the chances are rare.  But you should drive over it just to be able to tell people “been there done that”
"A beautiful landmark, an amazing feat of engineering",You start to appreciate the ridge many miles away. It’s amazing how  beautiful it is And how well its maintained. I do not think about the St. Petersburg area without thinking about this bridge.
Awesome Experience Anytime of the Day,"Cross this bridge at least every couple of months and it never fails to amaze.  Depending on when you cross there's a different look because of the light.  In the morning or evening the rays of the sun work magic on the two spires.  Going in either direction the road leading up to the actual bridge crossing teases you with what you're about to experience.  Okay, so it's just crossing a bridge, but it's a lot of fun especially the first time you cross it and when you think about the engineering required to design and build it.  If you're on vacation it's a cool sight or if you've just relocated to the area it's a thrill to experience it.  It's also fun to continue on going North and cross over into Tampa.  A different bridge, but closer to the water and if you time it right you can see airplanes taking off and landing from TPA (Tampa Intl. Airport).  There are rest areas on each side and there's a fishing pier on the old road too."
An Adventure each time...,"Love going over this bridge... there is such a feeling of freedom... view is spectacular, especially @ Sunset... a fun thing to do is roll down ya window & scream... it releases SOOOOOO much stress... BE AWARE OF FOLKS AROUND YA...  DN want to cause stress to someone thinking ya in trouble... ENJOY the view!!! Drive this route to visit friends at least twice a month... relaxes, view FL from a diff prospective ... try it ya gonna enjoy the experience ..."
Great views from the top,You almost feel like you're in the clouds. It is very high and I take it going to the airport.It's steep like going on a rollercoaster only better.
Impressive...,"TripAdvisor suggested I review this as something that “doesn’t get a lot of reviews” ahhhhhhhhhh, bless. I’m not sure how one can rate a bridge but I loved it.  My wife, on the other hand, hated it...but then she’s scared of heights. 5 stars as it’s impressive, views are great and it did all the things that bridges should do (eg carried you from A to B; didn’t fall down etc etc).Toll was only $1.50 for a family car, which was very reasonable.  You can pay in cash (staffed booths) or card and the chap who served us was really friendly.If I can get my wife drunk enough to agree to go over the bridge again, then I’d definitely use it...much nicer than the circuitous land route on I75 southbound from Tampa."
Scenery,Its beautiful to walk and fish and catch some rays.Don't forget a chair and umbrella it's right in the glaring sun.Bait shop and bathroom is a definite plus with refreshing cold drinks. It does cost to get on the bridge to fish and sight see.
Breathtaking Drive on The Skyway,"This bridge is majestic and stands tall over the bay. It’s span, height and views are unique but what makes it more interesting is it’s history. The bridge was reconstructed and built after a major tragedy that caused its collapse and the loss of many lives. I appreciated the re-purposed portion that became a fishing pier."
"Up, up and away","You have to go over this bridge at least one its a great, a fantastic bit of engineering and boy dose it take the time of the journey"
Wonderfull view  - worthwile to drive,I highly recommed to drive this Bridge in the morning or evening. Wonderfull view and smooth ride. It requires toll.
My favorite Florida bridge.,I never mind a drive up to Tampa or down to Sarasota because the beauty of crossing the skyway bridge always is a delight!
Worth the drive!,"Drive over the bridge and back.  If  you have time, drive out ( or park and walk) out on the  old bridge spans."
Good View!,I grew up in Florida and this is the first time I traveled over the bridge since it was rebuilt.  Very nice.  They have great bathroom facilities on the causeway if you have the need.  These are protected by 24-hour security which made the area safe.  The old bridge is a fishing pier that you can drive on as well.  Excellent usage of old roads.  They are constructing bathroom facilities on these fishing weirs as well.  Very happy with this upgrade.
Ride from Apollo Beach to St. Petersburg,Beautiful views by day or night as we crossed over the Skyway Bridge.  Currently doing some construction but no lanes closures or delays.
WHAT A SIGHT TO SEE,I have lived in Florida for many years now. Every time we go onto the Skyway we are in awe of the construction of this bridge. It's just massive. Beautiful views.
Wow,"Amazing bridge, loved going over it on our trip to the USA, you don't realise the scale of it till your near."
The most beautiful bridge in the world,"I remember when people had two choices to travel from St. Petersburg to Bradenton on US Route 19--drive through Tampa and around Tampa Bay or take one of four ferry boats operated by the Bee Line Ferry Line that took from 40 to 60 minutes to cross the bay. The ferry operated from 1926 to 1954, when the first Sunshine Skyway Bridge was built. It was destroyed in May, 1980, when an ocean-going freighter collided with a bridge support during a sudden squall, resulting in the structural collapse of the southbound span and deaths of 35 people when their vehicles plunged into Tampa Bay. The damaged span was demolished, the surviving span was partially demolished and converted into the world's longest fishing pier and the current bridge was built. Opened in 1987, the cable-stayed concrete is considered a symbol of Florida. The six-lane bridge, which carries 60,000 vehicles a day on I-275 and US Route 19, cost $244 million and is 29,000 feet in length and stands 190 feet above the water. The beautiful structure, unlike any other bridge in the world, has won many engineering awards. And drivers of passenger cars pay only $1.50 one way to enjoy the experience."
Beautiful views,"I hadn’t been close to the skyway since I was a young girl. We’d go down to see my mama’s sister and Aunt EllaMae would always find some reason for us to go across the bridge. This was long before the bridge was damaged. I guess the some of the old parts were salvaged into fishing piers. We took a ride out onto the north southbound pier just to see what was going on. Make sure you tell the bridge attendant what your intentions are- sightsee or fish, there’s different pricing.Any road, there were many many fishers on deck and many many seagulls. It was great fun watching the catches, misses and wildlife. I hope you enjoy your trip on the bridge :)"
Attractive bridge,The bridge is cable supported over Tampa Bay and is quite attractive. Often has construction occurring. Traffic generally moves well
Exciting experience with a great view,"The new skyway bridge is beautiful, exciting, and has a great view. It's not just a bridge, it's an experience! After the original bridge was knocked down by a freighter ship that was out of the channel, a terrible catastrophe,the New Sunshine Skyway Bridge was constructed to replace it. It has numerous added safety features to prevent this type of issue from ever happening again. This instills confidence in us who travel it out of necessity. It also is quite a bit higher than the original span which adds to it's breath taking views of Tampa Bay and The Gulf of Mexico. It's really like an ""E"" ride at a theme park in many respects. A wonderful example of engineering and architectural design. When in the area and if convenient, check it out. It's more than just a bridge, it's an experience you won't soon forget."
Beautiful Drive!,We enjoy taking the Sunshine Bridge for may reasons.  First of all it is the quickest way to get to and from South Tampa to Anna Maria Island.  The views are absolutely beautiful.  We enjoy watching people fish on the old bridge.  We enjoy watching the different ships and boats travel in the bay.  It's a more enjoyable drive than your average freeway.  It is a toll bridge but it's worth it for us.
Breathtaking views,Stunning to drive over the water from St Pete area to Anna Maria Island! it was a great way to begin a family vacation
One Pretty Bridge!,This bridge is one of the most beautiful in the country!  A nice place to fish and a dramatic ride across it.....especially on a motorcycle! This bridge connects Tampa/St.Pete to Sarasota and south.
Fun drive,"Worth the trip, great views! Read up on the history and the collapse back many tears ago.Some say it's haunted."
Fastest way between St Petersburg and Bradenton,Without this bridge anyone traveling between St Petersburg and Bradenton would have to trek further east to get to I-75.  It's a toll bridge.  $1.50 each way for automobiles.  You are up pretty high and get a great view of where the Gulf of Mexico and Tampa Bay meet.
Great Driving Experience,I have traversed over the Skyway Bridge many times. The bridge has such a great design and wonderful view of the bay. I used to side trip occasionally to go over the bridge when going back and forth from Miami to Gainesville when in college.
It's a bridge ,Rest areas on both sides. There is also a fishing roadway which was the old bridge. Tell each direction.
A good drive,"A good drive to the sunshine bridge. The only negative part is you cannot stop and just need to drive past the bridge, But there are places nearby where you can park, and just chill out. My best pic in Florida has been near the bridge, parking my car and the view of the river is just amazing"
"Travelling again here, now from north to south","As we dedicated this holiday to visit 6 beaches all the way between South Carolina and Florida, after visiting Clearwater and Folly island, we decided once again to cross via this amazing bridge, due to it's angle, which you do not realise when you are on the bridge.We stopped at a nearby rest area before the bridge to have a great view of the bridge and noticed lots of other people did the same despite the scorching heat.Hopefully we will be back here."
lovely drive,Some beautiful views driving over the bridge but can get congested at times. Places off of it where you can go fishing which is nice as well.
Best place to watch Kitesurfing,"Best place to watch kitesurfing in Tampa Bay. If it’s windy and you want to watch this exciting sport, head to Skyway Bridge North Rest Stop. You’ll see the kites."
Cool bridge,"Ok it is a bridge but a very cool one. Beautiful and well kept. You can pull off and fish on the beach, we saw folks boating and picnicking. No fee to cross the bridge which is nice."
Beautiful scenic drive ,It’s a beautiful drive. Take it if you have the opportunity to do so. I would not make a trip over the bridge if I were not traveling in that direction though.
Nice Drive and perfect view,"It is worth it to drive along the bridge, it might seem intimidating but the will take your breath away even though we are not alowed to stop at the top. however slow down and take the chance. it is amazing"
Beautiful,"This is the most beautiful bridge in the Tampa Bay Area.  On a sunny day, the view of the blue water is gorgeous!  Great bridge to take for scenic route drive.  Don’t miss it if you are visiting the area!"
If you're a bridge person...,"A marvel of construction.  The lines of this bridge make it almost a work of art.  It's also very functional, saving southbound travelers from the west coast about 1/2 to 1 hour of drive time."
Awesome bridge... not much else to say,"Not much to say about this (just a bridge after all) but the view is very nice and it looks super cool at night. The toll of $1.50 is very fair, at least in comparison to tolls back home in North California ($6 for a bridge that's 6 times shorter!!)"
High bride great views bonus if you time it when cruise ships go under it,Fancy bridge great water views. It’s spectacular if you can plan to go over that bridge between six and 6:30 PM you might get the wonderful opportunity to see Carnival or Royal Caribbean cruise ships going under it. It looks like they can’t fit under it . kind of freaky pull into the rest area and just wait and watch
Beautiful,"What to say about a bridge? I have been over it numerous times! The view is great!! The rest areas are nicer now and clean! Not many bridges are a destination like this one! We live about 60 miles South of it and always look forward to going to Clearwater because of it! If you like you can fish from the North or South on the old road! Or just  stop and take photos! Be careful crossing because you tend to look at the view all the time! If I miss our home state of Indiana,  I change my mind when I cross this bridge! Nothing like that up there!"
Wonderful view,Intersting engineering and monumental brigde.  The scenary and view are ver nice.  It´s a good way to visit Saint Petersburg
Blowing 25 knots.,My poor wife. I wasn’t thinking of her intense fear of bridges when we started on our route to home. Even worse I paid zero attention to the strong breezes either. So we got to within sight of the bridge and could really feel the gusts as well as see the whitecaps on the bat. It’s a beautiful bridge. We drove over it successfully.
IT IS A BRIDGE… WHERE IS THE WOW FACTOR?,"Passing over this bridge, I do appreciate the view… but that is it. Come on, people… this is a BRIDGE connecting on side to the other.This is an attraction?… not in my humble opinion. I recognise that this is a bridge with a nice view… but it is a BRIDGE. 90% of the bridges around the world have fantastic views, and this one is no different.Summing up… and a surprising comment from my side: IT IS A BRIDGE!... ohhh, at a fee for the toll."
Impressive,I think is one of the highest bridges in Florida. There is some places around in which you can stop and go fishing.
A wow,"It fast approaches off the highway and then it takes your breath away....between the water, the views and the structure you don't know where to look!  So worth the price if the toll...."
Great view,"Great view from bridge, we took bridge into Tampa area from Everglades National park visit. Seemed to be a direct route and the bridge was very nice with a great view."
Beautiful bridge,It's a beautiful bridge and a great way to cross the water. Too bad they continue to charge tolls to use it.
Vacation,It’s an awesome view of Tampa Bay and you see Anna Marie island at the top of the bridge. It was fun!
Beautiful Views,Beautiful views going north east just before sunset.  Cost was $1.50.  Beautiful views going north east over the bridge just before/during sunset.  Cost was $1.50 for a pickup truck.  There are places to pull off before the approach and enjoy.
Cool bridge,"We live in Miami and have family on the west coast of Florida north of Tampa. We can choose to use I-75 or take a little longer ride and use the Sunshine Skyway Bridge. Almost every time we go north my spouse convinces me to use the bridge because she “likes” it!  It is interesting, architecturally and gives you a good view of Tampa Bay."
Beautiful drive!,"Only on a nice, calm day without traffic would I drive over the bridge.  Apparently it’s closed during high winds.  It’s a beautiful drive if you enjoy a scenic route around Tampa.  Large fishing pier located off of it.  Great views of the bay.  If you don’t like heights and bridges, this isn’t for you.  Be prepared to pay a toll as well."
If you get the chance...Run the SkyWay 10k!!!,We live close to the SkyWay and travel it often but nothing was cooler then running a 10k over it!!! It's an experience that i would suggest to anyone of any athletic level.
Huge span!!,"This bridge is huge! We passed under it during our cruise out of Tampa, and I was amazed at how high this bridge was. Our 11+ story cruise ship passed easily under with plenty of room on each side. After the experience of travelling under this bridge, I have placed travelling over the Sunshine Skyway Bridge on my bucket list of things to do. It will be interesting to see the views from a loftier perspective."
Fun bridge to cross and experience !,"The skyway bridge is amazing ! It. Never ceases to Astonish me ... how it was built , it’s history , and it’s story. Beautiful views whilst crossing ! My children love looking for dolphins and sea gulls ! Always a thrill"
Great View!,"A recent move from St. Petersberg to Bradenton by family has put this bridge on the route every time we visit. The views from the bridge are really great and the height gives a good perspective. Definitely not a bridge to be on with any significant wind. Personally thought the view heading to Tampa from Bradenton had a better look out over the water than the other way. Yes, it is ""just a bridge"" but it is a bridge with a great view."
Great views,"This is a toll bridge, it has great views across the bay, and we have sometimes spotted the odd dolphin, but in the end it’s just a road. There are rest places available with restrooms, but not my first choice of picnic spot."
Crazy steep bridge!,"We decided to drive from north tampa over the bridge, we then looked round back into tampa the other way. It’s crazy steep, really smart driving over it, there is a stop the other side so we stopped for a picnic, took some photo etc. It was a good thing to do,seems a bit odd driving over the sea for so long."
What a great view!,"This is a really cool bridge and I’ve been crossing it through my  life when visiting Tampa from SW FL. Some people worry about the size of it but it is safe, beautiful and a great experience!!"
Road trip,We were driving towards tampa when deciding to pull over at one of the rest stops to stretch our legs and fly our drone a little! It’s a beautiful bridge. Lots of seating areas around the bridge on the north and south side. Also has fishing piers on both ends as well.
Beautifully amazing architectural feat!,"When you see the bridge from far off it seems so far up in the air, as you get closer it feels like you are going up a big incline but doesn't seem as intimidating once you are going over it. The panoramic views of Tampa Bay are stunning and worth the ride over the bridge. There are rest areas on either side, the South side just reopened after renovation, the North side is closed for renovation now."
beautiful drive!,"this is one gorgeous bridge! it's only risk is high winds. do not, i repeat do not, go over it on a motorcycle when it's windy!"
"Beautiful Bridge in Tampa,Florida",When driving thru the Sunshine Skyway Bridge take your time to drive and see the splendorous ocean view. The view is breathtaking so slow down and drive thru it to enjoy it.
Fascinating bridge,"This bridge has a diverse history.  While on the long drive across you can enjoy the scenic bay area coming into Tampa Bay.  HIking trails line the road, as well as fishing piers."
Not a destination in itself but spectacular to cross!,"Whilst on a driving tour around Florida it made sense to go over the SSB to avoid a long detour around Tampa Bay. It may not be a tourist destination bridge as such (unlike the Golden Gate), but it does afford some spectacular views, and is aesthetically easy on the eye. Traveling from north to south it suddenly rises up to an unusually steep crown (unusual to us anyway, I can’t think of anything similar in the U.K.), and then sweeps down the other side in a long curve towards the southern shore of the bay. Simply spectacular stunning views of the water!"
A great drive to see the huge Tampa Bay area and to see one of the great bridges in Florida,"This is an iconic bridge and one that you have to drive to see and enjoy first hand. Not only is the view beautiful, you get to see the skyline out to the Gulf the city scapes of St. Pete and Tampa"
Beautiful! ,We didnt even know we were gonna drive over it until we approached it. Very big! Lovely drive and view!
We drive it all the time . ,This is a beautiful structure that we travel over all the time. It takes a dollar fifty to go each way on it. There's also a fishing pier close to it and it is awesome. Although a lot of people don't know they will close the bridge down due to high winds because it can get pretty dangerous. Another note : DO NOT stop on the bridge unless you haven't a choice because if you do you will go to jail .
Different way back from the beach.  ,Decided to take a different route back to hotel in Tampa after a day at the beach.  Well worth the $1.50 toll to cross.  Nice views of the bay.
"Scenic drive, little traffic",Nice cruise with water on both sides and palm trees along-side.  Pretty smooth sailing with regards to traffic for only $1.50.
If it's your first time in the area this is a great view!,"Coming or going, this bridge is always a highlight when I pick up guests from TPA for a visit. No matter the weather, the views of the water, the pelicans and osprey and sometimes the big ships, make for a great entrance to Florida"
Great view!,There is nothing prettier than watching the different cruise ships sail under this wonderful structure.  Good views of the old bridge with all the fisherman parked on the bridge.
A Great Bridge! ,"This is one of my favorite bridges to travel across. Whether coming to the Bay Area from the South or leaving the Bay Area, I love this bridge and enjoy the views."
Hard to believe,"When you travel over this magnificent structure, and look down from the top, you're going to think that huge ships can go under it. They can't. Aircraft carriers can't and the newest of the massive cruise ships can't either!"
Great ride,"Took us to the other side and back again , we drove across enjoyed seeing  the boats and people fishing ."
"Very nice bridge, a must on the Tampa Bay","Coming from the south into Tampa Bay you will cross this magnifent bridge. It may not be ""as famous"" as other bridges in the USA or elsewhere, but it is Florida's nicest. It is a long crossing and there is a rest area in the southern end for you to appreciate the Bay (and bridge)"
Our ride on Sky way Bridge,This bridge connects St. Petersburg to lower Tampa Bay.  It was built in 1987 which passes through 3 counties.  There is a toll of $1-50 which may be collected or charged to your sun passes. It has 3 lanes on each side & is approximately 4.25 miles long. It does cross Tampa Bay & has a lovely view of the bay.  We saw it at night & during the day .  Enjoyed the sunset & also during the day.
One of the most dramatic bridges in Florida,"This is an amazing feat of engineering (a French firm). It's always a thrill to cross it when going south from St. Petersburg to Palmetto, Bradenton, and Sarasota. Absolutely glorious. It changes relative to the light, the sun, the water, and at different times of day. Favorites for me are earlier in the morning or at sunset. I've been many times solo, and also with friends and family. For those who have a fear of heights, you may want to address that. Cautions are put up if there are high winds."
Beautiful bridge,Its a beautiful bridge that will grab your attention even if you don't know about it at all. We were just driving in and around Tampa when we spotted this bridge and clicked a few pictures of the bridge.
Awesome,"We have crossed the Sunshine Skyway several times.  It’s our favorite way to go into St. Pete and Tampa.  Beautiful views of the bay and gulf, but also the bridge.  Worth paying the $1,50 toll each way."
A Florida Landmark!,"It's definitely not a bridge you want to cross if you're afraid of heights. I was scared to go over the former Skyway bridge back in 1984 but for good reason. It was 4 years after the southbound span tragically collapsed. Most native Floridians will never forget that day. I'm one of them. Fortunately, the newer bridge is super safe. I also love the design of it. It's said that Bob Graham's bridge design was inspired by the Pont de Brotonne in the Normandy region of France. They are almost identical.So I'm writing this review after our cruise out of Port Tampa Bay. We were fortunate to get a different view of the bridge while cruising through the bay on the Norwegian Pearl. We went under the bridge as the sun was setting. It was the coolest thing I've ever seen. I even saw crew members coming out and taking pictures of it. It was a sight to behold. I'm looking forward to seeing it again on our next cruise out of Tampa. I have a whole new perspective of the Sunshine Skyway Bridge now. I may even drive over it one day soon on the way to St. Pete. It certainly is faster than taking any other bridge."
Monumental Staple of the Tampa Bay Area,"The history behind the bridge is interesting and the architecture is state of the art. It is just a bridge though and not much else. Fishing on the piers around it is fun, but expensive for my tastes."
I love this bridge!,No matter how many time I cross this bridge I am amazed. It is beautiful. The views are beautiful. Take the time to go this way when you are traveling.
Astonishing views,"Like driving over a Baby Grand Piano’s strings.Breathtaking views, stop at the south rest stop ( heading S) for some water-side picnics. Worth the $1.50 each way ( bring cash, CC not accepted, SunPass accepted) #beautiful #tampabay"
Week end drive,Beautiful drive on a sunny day. Water view was amazing. Clear blue sky and water. So peaceful. Sunset was amazing. Watching from the fishing pier is the best alone time. Very romantic also.
Fun drive,"Not a day long event, but worth the drive if you are in the area.  It’s way up there.  And don’t jump off the top!"
Big modern bridge. So what,"This is a big modern bridge with unusual center cables supporting the deck from overhead.  Nice photo but other than that, no Big deal.  Unless you are a bridge enthusiast.  TIP: make a point to stop at the pull off and park mini beach park at base on west side where you can get photo make u- turn and avoid toll returning."
not for the near vertigo driver...,if you dont like heights go around this bridge...if you have ever had vertigo or near vertigo this is not a voyage for you
Amazing view! Always enjoy crossing this Tampa Bay Bridge,Every time I have to cross this bridge I like to take pictures of the structure. Great engineering design and colorful structure.
Beautiful,Great view of everything! The water and city! Really cool looking bridge. A whole new experience to drive over!
Not a bridge fan,"I went over this bridge years ago, I do not like high or long bridges so I am not a fan. Got a different view this week as we went on a cruise out of Tampa. Amazing from below, the height is crazy from the water level."
Great Views!,"Definitely the prettiest bridge in all of Florida. Really unique designs that give stunning views of the harbor and the surrounding areas. There's also a help line all the way at the top of it, in case people get depressed and want to jump. Very well designed and great concept."
Great View,"Love this bridge it's modern looking and the view from the top is fantastic. The only problem is people, especially locals, drive like idiots so you have to run 80 just to keep from being rear ended. If you could drive a leisurely 60 instead of 80 you'd certainly enjoy it more."
Great view,"This is the I-275 toll bridge to get fro St. Petersburg to Bradenton. It is the highest bridge I have ever driven on and one of the longer bridges I have crossed. Traffic goes about 75, so as the driver, you need to be paying close attention to the road. Passengers have a great panoramic view of the area. My wife doesn’t like heights and gets very nervous. If you are in St. Pete or the west Bay Area and headed south, you have to go considerably out of your way to avoid this bridge."
Its a bridge,"what more can I say...its a bridge, and for $1.50, it beats driving around the bay.If it was in NYC, the toll would be 5 times more."
a beautiful bridge with a beautiful view,"An impressive architectural bridge expanse. The water is gorgeous shade of aqua blue & green, you just want to dive in or stop along the fishing piers or rest areas to enjoy a picnic or the views. It now costs  $1.50 each way or get a pass"
"Amazing bridge, great view","Beautiful, tall, bridge, no stopping on bridge.  But if you are not the actual driver, you can get quite a view.  Toll is $1.50 each way on bridge.  Definitely worth checking out this amazing bridge!  Use caution during bad weather or high winds."
Cool Bridge,We made a point to travel over the bridge on our way south. The toll is only $1.50 and the view is spectacular!  There are also fishing piers on both ends that appear to follow the old causeway from the old bridge.  There is a rest area on the south side that you can stop at to take pictures.  Nice example of a suspension bridge.
Amazing architecture,"This bridge is an architectural marvel. It’s rather scary because of its height. In clear weather you can see long distances. However, in fog, slower speeds are called for. Same thing when winds are strong. Most recent toll price is 1.50 USD."
Bridge Review,"A beautiful bridge both ways, spectacular views. There are NO places to pull over on the bridge. There is a rest area on the Northern and Southern end with both being accessible from each direction (Northern one currently being rebuilt and therefore the building is closed). Each rest area is also an entrance to a fishing pier, limited beach areas and picnic grounds. Yes, you pay toll each way."
Really Nice View,"What a fun ride over the bridge. The view is wonderful, just wish there was some place we could have stopped to take some photos."
Nice toll bridge,We had to drive over at least once. There is a toll from either direction you get on. There are a couple of spots to pull over.
"Easy drive, saves time, dramatic view","A striking modern bridge that is in sight for miles. Saves hours of time traveling down the west coast of Florida. Very reasonably priced, as well."
Amazing view of Tampa Bay and the Gulf of Mexico,"These bridges have a history that spans over 6 decades when the original bridge was opened in 1954, joining Pinellas County to Manatee County back in 1954. Later, two bridges spanned Tampa Bay. Unless it's very foggy, windy, or during an extremely stormy weather, I always enjoy the scenic view and sunsets while crossing this bridge. It brings a connection from Pinellas to south Hillsborough and Manatee Counties much closer, saving a lot of time driving."
A must see,Breathtaking!!! A must see if you are in this area of Florida!!! A bit overwhelming for a bridge phobia person that I am!!! Amazingly beautiful
Always enjoy the trip over the bridge.,"The highest point gives you views of both Tampa and St Pete on a clear day. The causeway on the St Pete side is generally full of life boarders, horse riders and people enjoying the afternoon."
Glad I’m not driving!,"Love the view from the Sunshine Skyway bridge, not the height. I have driven it, but I’m always in the inside lane. My husband doesn’t really care, the rest area is pretty cool, day or night. The night lights are beautiful & the rest area is well maintained & supervised."
Stunning Bridge,"Definitelly a must see when passing through tampa even if a little pout of the way, drive down the southern fishing pier for wonderful views. there are tolls that accept cash for those without the sunpass."
It's a bridge,"It will get you from St. Petersburg to Bradenton/Sarasota.  It's a bridge, what more do you want?  Oh, BTW, it's $1.50 toll each way."
Terrifyingly high,I hate heights and going over this was panic induced. Luckily I wasn’t driving but holy crap it’s high. I can’t imagine having to travel over this daily.
Traveling from Tarpon Springs to Sarasota to play golf with friends.,"It's a cable stay bridge.  There's one in Boston like it. (the Zakim Bridge).  It's interesting - from afar it looks like the sail of a ship.On a clear day, you can see ""forever"".  Super views.  I don't cross it often, but when I do, I always get a ""kick"" out of it and the engineering and planning to get it done."
Excellent Views and Understanding of Tampa BAy,We drove a circle from Tampa to St Petersburg then across this bridge to go north and back to Orlando.  It is a feat of engineering.  Nice to see old road being used for fishing and recreation to the west of the bridge.  This shows how long it is from the St Petersburg peninsula to the other side of the bay.
Visiting Tampa,It was very exciting for me to be able to experience the skyway bridge it was breathtaking I could not believe how tall this bridge was and the history behind how it came to be.  Marvelous adventure for me and my guy
Views,It’s a bridge with good views. But not one that I would consider a tourist attraction in its own right! So wouldn’t recommend a diversion to drive over it.
Definitely don’t miss this,"On my way to Tampa, I took a detour to drop my friend Julia off in Gulfport. We had to go over the Skyline Bridge, and while familiar with Florida, I hadn’t been over this and wow! It’s a beautiful bridge but it also lends a view to streaming vistas of the bay all around. It doesn’t take that long to go over it but there’s gorgeous views the whole way across!"
Drive to work,"I work in sports television and have traveled this bridge probably hundreds, if not thousands of time over the last two decades and every time I find myself looking to the sky and thanking God for  living in Tampa Bay."
What a View!,"I drive over this bridge to get to Sarasota from St Pete Beach. It is gorgeous and the view is spectacular. Such a pleasant drive.One caveat. When it is windy...oh my, can be scary! In fact, sometimes it is actually closed when winds are too wild."
Strange to rate a bridge,"Huge bridge, I guess it's a thrill if you like heights. It shuts down in bad weather or visibility but on the weekends you can see people windsurfing and parasailing, also you can ride horses just off the start of the bridge on the north side. Great views of the water and pier. Cash and EZ pass only to cross. Usually moves swiftly in rush hours."
A ride up to heaven,Took grandchildren for a ride and ended up on the causeway leading to this bridge. Had to pay a toll but the experience was worth it. The ride up to the center of the bridge was like goung to the top of a roller coaster. But the ride down was nothing like one. Perhaps a bit anticlimactic but exciting for us all to do together. Cheap thrill.
Stop at the South viewing area!,"The bridge is a toll bridge $1.50. Which is fair. Entering from the South, take the time to stop at the South scenic stop. Lovely view of the bay.Recommend"
Sunshine Skyway Bridge,"It is an impressive bridge, but still just a toll bridge.  Did not stop for more information due to time constraints.  The story of the original bridge is very interesting."
The only better view is from a helicopter ,The landmark bridge is an architectual beauty.  We love the view day seeing land and water from sea level to lofty heights at the top.  The night view is stunning as the cables are lit and moon light shimmering off the water.Another favorite is to stop at the rest area to view kite boarders flying in colors across the water on a breezy day.$1.50 a value for a memorable drive.
Engineering marvel ,"Beautiful and explasive, this tool bridge ($1.50) takes you from Tampa to Sarasota.  Tall vehicles might have an issue in high winds."
Definitely Worth a Drive for Amazing Scenery,We were on our way to St Pete's Beach from Tampa and noticed the signs so we decided to take a side trip to drive on this bridge So worth the extra time It is very scenic and beautiful and worth taking the time to just drive on it A Must do you won't regret it
Friend visit,We crossed the bridge with out incident  we weren't in any hurry so we enjoyed the view and the engineering team  that built  this wonderful  beautiful  bridge
Considered #3 of Top 10 Bridges in World,"This bridge is nothing short of spectacular.  It connects St Petersburg on the north to Terra Ceia to the south, and affords some amazing views.  Whenever we have guests for a few days we take them to see the bridge. It is over 4 miles long, is 4 lanes wide and part of routes 275 and 19. It is the longest “cable-stayed” bridge in the world. Pedestrians and bicyclists are not allowed.To maximize the experience we try to hit the Skyway just before sunset so our guests can enjoy the views. Each end has a picnic area, so we pull in and have a picnic while we watch the sunset.  There are great photo ops from here.  Then we come back over the bridge when it is all lit up at night. Guests are always in awe.When heading south one can see the old bridge on the right, the ends of which have been converted into fishing piers  (see separate review). You might see a variety of ships but you will not see the large cruise ships..... the bridge is too low for clearance.We have a transponder so I am not sure if there is a toll just one way or both ways, but I think it is only $1.50.  Since the Skyway is rated #3 of the top 10 bridges in the world, it is worth a visit. I never tire of driving over Tampa Bay because the views are awesome!"
Gonna be a hell of a ride and view ,"Boy this is really cool bridge and lovely drive. Feel is amazing and view will please you, you won’t realize the height until you see the bridge from way outside. A must drive if you visit Tampa and St Petersburg, Do not miss it.. also please stop though the picnic area to have that pleasant vide if water.Tip:1 if you wanna have a ‘heavenly feel’ like going in to the clouds have a drive at early in the morning. You won’t regret.. Tip 2 :You can always Trina round from the picnic area to have one more drive back.. so that do not pay the toll again. Definitely a worth drive for all those road trip lovers.."
Beautiful view from the Skyway Bridge,"I know it is just a highway going over the bay, but it is beautiful and interesting. I always drive out-of-town visitors over the Skyway Bridge, then turn around and go back. It is interesting that the previous bridge was destroyed when a ship hit it, and the ends of the old bridge are still in use as fishing piers on both sides. Imagine the long drive around Tampa Bay without this bridge. It is an educational site if you're in the area. There is a fee in one direction."
"Up, up and over the highest view in the Bay area","Cross the Bridge going south to feel the experience and catch a brief view of Tampa Bay. Then get off at the fishing pier exit just south of the bridge's end, and go back north toward the Bridge riding on the old Skyway road that is now a fishing pier. You will see the best view of the Bridge itself. The pier roadway used to connect to a lower Skyway Bridge that was hit by a ship and collapsed mid-span. The new Skyway Bridge and roadway parallels to old bridge route today."
A Magnificent Bridge ,Fortunately we got to travel to Madeira which means we got to go over the Skyway Bridge. The water shines brilliantly as you approach the bridge. There are some fishing piers and small parks to stop at if you’d like. The construction is unlike any bridge I’ve seen. You get the feeling as you approach the peak of taking off in an airplane. I also love seeing the oil tankers approach the bridge. They routinely do maintenance of the bridge which promotes the feeling of safety. Love the bridge!
Bridge,"Beautiful view, very high. For those who don't like heights stay In the middle lane. Easy route from Tampa to St Pete and Clearwater."
Uh.... it's a bridge,"Well... if you like bridges, I guess its nice. They do have two fishing piers that we go crabbing from in the summer time. But... if you're Just going to see the bridge... to me its just another bridge that takes you over the water."
An engineering masterpiece - and what a view,An amazing site as one approaches the bridge and a majestic ride over this lengthy span. And such considerate planning to leave sections of the old bridge for fishing and recreation. The view of the bay are worth the ride itself.
Beautiful Bridge $1.50 crossing,Nice shape great views bridge is a work of art. Easy on efficient toll booths well lit and easy to drive. Very high in center to allow ships. Great shortcut from St Pete south....
A beauty,This beautiful bridge stands proudly at the entrance to Tampa Bay. I have been over it and under it many times. Be aware it is subject to closing in high winds. In the sunshine it truly glows...hence the name the Sunshine Skyway Bridge.
Beautiful ,"Being from Ohio, this is not the type of thing I see everyday so it was very cool for me! There is a toll to get onto it, which was about $1.50 I think. We stopped at the north pier once we crossed the bridge to get a closer look at the bay. Beware if you stop and stand on the side of the road at the pier, there are fire ants and they will bite you! Hard lesson learned!"
What a bridge!,This is a fantastic engineering achievement - not only the main part of the bridge itself but the long sections either side which link the 2 land parts of the area. Yes it’s high but it’s not as steep as you first fear as you drive up to it. I don’t like heights but felt very safe and it had a great view.
Well worth the toll fee,"Great way to travel down the coast in the Tampa area, fabulous architecture but I guess it could be a bit nerve racking on a windy day well worth $4."
Cool bridge,Always cross this when going across the bay to Sun City Center.  Watch for high wind warnings but mostly enjoy the view.  There is a toll to use the bridge
A Marvel,"I am giving a 5 star for the beauty and marvel of it, I would give a 1 star because of the fear.  Thank all that be that I did not have to do the driving.  I could barely look so if you are afraid of the entire thing falling in the ocean I would suggest don't do it.In my world nothing should be driven over that is over 400 feet tall and I don't know if that is at the tallest point.  From a distance it is stunning and going back over it I did not feel much better.  I did find out there is another way to St Pete from Tampa and you can go around it but you still have to do a flat bridge and it takes about 2 hours.  If you are afraid the entire thing will collapse whilst driving on it, I might suggest as others you just look at it instead of getting on it.  If you are fine with something like that it is worth the 12K feet across."
What A View!,"This ride in your own car, will knock your socks off, unless you have a fear of heights, then you might need a change of other garments! A cheap thrill for only $1.50, and a must do if you love engineering, or just cool structures!"
Fishing Pier,My hubby loves this cute place you can see beautiful things on your drive there. The price to fish there isn't expensive and once you pay you don't need a fishing license. You park along the bridge/pier. otherwise if not fishing it is the longest tallest bridge to ride over in Florida
Summer outing,The skyway bridge provides an amazing view of the channel. Just going over it is beautiful.  The architecture of the bridge is such a difference from all our other local bridges. If you're not in a hurry I must recommend stopping off and visiting the fishing piers on the sides of the bridge.
Skyway 10k,The skyway is one of the most revognized structure in TB the rest areas were both taking care of and clean .. it was a pleasure running over this structure and can’t wait until 2019 race will be running the bridge again
Great relatively modern bridge built from the Skyway disaster from the 1980s,"There are great views from the bridge and if you have some time, you can drive onto the old bridge that remains from when the center span was knocked down in the 1980s from the Exxon Valdez oil tanker.  The old bridge has been made into two long piers that extend out into the bay opening into the Gulf, mostly for fishing.  It is a nice bridge that you can cross for only $1.50 which by today's standards is quite cheap."
Cool views!,We drove on this bridge when going to the Tampa airport. We saw dolphins as we were looking at the water. It was a smooth bridge and also long.
The best view of Tampa Bay,"The Sunshine Skyway Bridge crosses over Tampa Bay as State Road 275. The bridge on the south cross through Terra Ceia and comes back on land at southern tip of St Petersburg. This bridge was rebuilt several years ago, after the original bridge was hit by a large ship sending many cars and passengers into the waters of Tampa Bay.On a sad note, The Florida Highway Patrol maintains a presents on the bridge and in the area to try to detour the number of ""Co-called Jumpers"" that use the bridge as a way to end there lives. Yes the bridge does have a toll, and people in the area that use the bridge often have the electronic Sky-Way pass to cover the cost of the Toll."
Must Drive the Skyway when in Tampa/St.Pete,Fabulous views and super fun drive across the sunshine skyway. One of my favorite landmarks in the country. Also love to fish under the bridge and cruise around the bay and river. Don’t miss it
Top Speed Highway Bridge with a Few Glimpses,"Not really a site, but a large high speed highway that does offer some great but beautiful views as you scream over it.  There is a small park and restroom stop at both ends, but they are not destinations.  Great and unique are adjacent abandoned bridges that offer deep water fishing.  You don’t see these piers often.  This bridge connects St Pete and Pinellas county to Bradenton on the way to Sarasota, so use it if you’re headed there.  It does require a toll of two bucks or so."
Breathtaking,The drive across the month of the Tampa Bay Harbor will take your breath away. The bridge itself is a true masterpiece.
breath-taking views both as one approaches this magnificent bridge AND as one looks out of your vehicle  when high upon,Great thrill as this bridge is approached and certainly absolutely fantastic as you look out from the bridge . Never spotted the cruise ship as it nears this bridge but I know it does as I was once on a cruise that did exactly that.Reduces distance when requiring to cross Tampa Bay ... a super-duper asset.
One of Florida’s Wonders!,"If you come to the Tampa area, you have to go over the Sunshine Skyway. It’s breathtaking in its majesty and worth the toll. It’s more than a bridge. Parks along the way are perfect for picnics or swimming. Don’t miss it!"
Great experience for $ 1.50,"This is absolutly a must. When you are in or around Tampa by car, make the tour on I 275 to St. Petersburg. Great bridge and excellent view. You should not miss it."
Nerve wracking!,It is a cool bridge but very nerve wracking to drive up! It is a great view though when you get across and/or to the top!
Our path to Tampa and St. Petersburg...,"We live in Manatee County on the south side of the Skyway Bridge. Lots of time we have the choice of which way to go to Tampa either via 75 north or 275 north. We generally take 275 because of the view and ease of drive. On the Northside of the Bridge the eastern side of the park we often see people playing in the bay, picnicking or even riding horse away from shore. On the west side people are wind surfing using kites. The rest stops themselves are being renovated and I believe the northside it shutdown at the present.If you like to fish, the north and south rest stops also are the route to the old approaches and are now a State Park for used to fish. Skyway Fishing Pier State Park 7x24 $4/car $4/person."
Ride over the bridge to Sarasota,The Skyway Bridge is always a beautiful sight. Gorgeous water and to see the old bridge that was knocked down and now a fishing pier was a treat for the out of towners.
Impressive!,The view is awesome. The are rest areas in both directions. Bathrooms were very clean. Some people like to go fishing in the area.
Nice bridge,My father helped build the original Skyway Bridge that was hit by a cargo ship in 1980.  Have not been back to the bridge since the tragedy that claimed lives of the people just trying to get to their destinations that day.  Brought back a lot of memories.
stop at the rest stop,A neat bridge because of the construction.  Very unique.  Don't just go over the bridge stop at the rest stops.  You could spend some time just taking in the views of the gulf and Tampa bay.  FREE LIKE ANY REST STOP. Just park and enjoy.
Love it but use caution,I love this scenic drive but always recall the collapse of 1980 when 35 people fell to their deaths.
Phenomenal View,"Love this bridge! Awesome view from top and feels like flying on the way down, especially on a sunny day."
Highway to heaven,It was out of this world and it is a beautiful sight and a soothing  ride and relaxing..and you can see far away and you can  see the beauty of What God made For us .and the bridge has good structural.
Favorite Bridge ,I love driving over this bridge. The view of the bay is awesome. If you drive over it when’s it’s dark out it is beautiful! There are areas that you can fish from.....someday I will be able to do that
Beautiful Bridge,"I recently had the opportunity to travel over the Sunshine Skyway Bridge on a dusky, cold (for Florida) evening. This bridge, which spans over four miles, and the original Sunshine Skyway Bridge, have interesting, often tragic histories. After the original bridge collapsed in 1980, it took five years to replace it with this new bridge. It is ranked as one of the Top Ten bridges in world."
Spectacular view,"It’s a beautiful bridge with an amazing view. I wish they would double the toll and only collect one way or the other, rather than both. The Sunpass is a helpful feature but most people have it now, and traffic backs up. There are really nice rest stops and areas for fishing, photo taking, or just enjoying the sights."
Manny V,an amazing piece of engineering and architecture beautiful as well. it is a shame that for who ever is driving across can't enjoy the views.
Awesome from any angle,"I have taken over twenty cruises from Tampa Channelside and its always a thrill going under The Skyway. Its a good 3 to 4 hours into the cruise till you are directly underneath the bridge. Even at night its lit up bright in all its glory. Usually a Highway Patrol sitting on top watching for any kind of a drop. Amazing that the bigger ships can not make it underneath . This puts a limit on the newer ships so that all we get are the older smaller ones, but still lots of fun !"
Great view of the Bay!,"This bridge is a marvel of engineering and aesthetics, providing fantastic vistas of the Bay from a great height. On a clear day, one can see almost forever! Some eschew it over a fear of heights, but most will not find it scary."
Don’t miss the bridge,Bridge is spectacular and look up to see a good number of Osprey. Possibly you’ll see a couple carrying home a fish in their talons. Also check out the kitesurfing at the northern end. Also must be good fishing on the piers along side the bridge.
The Bob Graham Sunshine Skyway Bridge,Also known as The Bob Graham Sunshine Skyway Bridge it offers spectacular daytime views of Tampa Bay between St Petersburg and Bradenton.   The Travel Channel lists this bridge as one of the top ten bridges in the world.
Must See,"The bridge is a fabulous architectural wonder, towering over Tampa Bay. I recommend you pay the toll to cross the bridge to enjoy the beautiful scenic Bay."
"Tolls on bridges like this, up north, cost you 10 times what this does.","Can you get a better, and longer, bridge ride than this for a buck fifty? Nope. Not in New York City, where we're told everything is better. This bridge ride is long, tall and scenic. There are parks on either end from the old bridge this replaced. Enjoy the ride."
"Beautiful by Day, Scary by Night","We love driving over the Sunshine Skyway Bridge.  It is an awesome drive by day and a little spooky by night.  Either way it is great, and the best way to go south from Tampa."
Beautiful bridge drive ☝️👍,I love driving over this beautiful bridge It’s a must see and especially if you drive over at sunset ❤️🙏😊best view ever
Sky Blue Sky,Passed over this twice on the way to/from Ellenton. A magnificent feat of engineering and fantastic views across the bay. It’s a bit hairy with the top down and you get the feeling of being on a rollercoaster. A must if you are in this area.
Up up and away!,"The Sunshine Skyway bridge is a great experience crossing the Tampa Bay making it easy to travel from the Rubonia / Gillette area south of Tampa, over to Saint Petersburg (ideal if you want to visit the Salvador Dali museum on the coast at St Petersburg).A long sweeping drive takes you up to the bridge after the ($1.50) toll giving lots of time for your passengers to take pictures - the rest areas at either side of the bridge were closed when we visited, but it looks like it was still possible to go fishing at those points, so I suppose stopping off for a picture would still be possible!Once you get to the bridge you drive up a steep slope - the top gives great views and the yellow struts/suspension elements stand out from the bright blue sky- then you are down the other side with great views of the bay at St Petersburg. It’s tempting to slow down, but the other users want to zoom along, there are two lanes, as obviously they are all going somewhere!"
Bridge,Its a bridge. I drove from one end to the other. Its a pretty highh nridge for Florida. This nridge crosses the Tampa Bay.
It's high,"But then why not.  Rebuilt so it's gotta be safer than older bridge's.  Enjoy at sunset, its hard to not stare at the sky."
Scary to drive over this beautiful bridge,I wish I could enjoy it while driving but it freaked me out the first time.  It does get easier the more you do it and it’s a beautiful sight while sailing under it.
Be Sure To See The Blackthorn Memorial,"This gorgeous span offers a fishing piers and rest areas to have a picnic, etc. The USCGC Blackthorn Memorial must be seen. Take a few minutes next time you go across to stop and take it all in."
The Magestic Skyway Bridge,Driving up or down the bridge one feels on top of the Bay💛A wide open view that makes you feel on top of the world!!Best of all is going under the bridge ! Awesome when cruise ships pass under ...one can see the details and the armor that keeps is standing so beautiful..one feels like almost touching it but not really...is still way high. I have taken numerous fotos and is never the last.
Great fishing and the bait shop even rents out rods and reels!!,"An amazing bridge and the old bridge was open for fishing on both the Pinellas side and Hillsborough side. We tried both. Fishing and wind was better on the Hillsborough stretch. You meed to come at night, it it is  magical"
Better than the alternative,"This handsome bridge was built about 20 years ago to replace one that was hit by a ship resulting in fatalities.  I give it 5 stars as the only alternative is a significantly longer, circuitous route to the airport."
Scenic bridge,"I travel across this bridge anytime I want to go over to Pinellas County. The view is gorgeous. If bridge heights bother folks, this is not the bridge to travel."
Amazing view,"Got there while visiting Tampa as my first time. A must go for Tampa. Unforgettable view and experience. Perfect spot for fishing, also."
Love the view from this place,"This is one of the most scenic points in the Tampa Bay area. If you time it right, typically around 6:30 to 7:00 p.m., you will go over a cruise  Ship that is leaving under the skyway bridge. It is an awesome picture."
Very Nice View!,"Always enjoy driving over the Skyway, the view is exceptional and it's probably the closest thing to a plane ride, but driving with a view from the Sky you can be your own Pilot."
Wow...,Every time I drive over the bridge I get butterflies in my stomach. The view from top to bottom is beautiful!
Amazing Architecture,"Best Bridge on Earth. Amazing view of St Petersburg Florida. Nice fishing peer along side as well. If you plan to cross Tampa Bay, why not use the skyway bridge."
