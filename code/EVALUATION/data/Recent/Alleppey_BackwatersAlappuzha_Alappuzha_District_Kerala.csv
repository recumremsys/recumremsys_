Explore Alleppey Backwaters by local ferry,"The best way, inexpensively to see the ever-changing life along waterways. The ferry ride is relaxing and allowed us to see and experience Alappuzha’s beautiful backwaters. It offered a brief glimpse into the local way of life on the river. The ferry winds through both narrow and wide bodies of water. You will see angler laying out nets from their tiny boats, stunning birds of prey and smaller river dwelling birds darting around. We also used the ferry every day to travel into the city centre from where we stayed (7 minutes ride) as well as some carefully planned day trips, to neighbouring townships all for very few Indian Rupee. Travel like & with the local community, get off the ferry and go exploring. Latest ferry schedules are available from the Government of Kerala State Water Transport Department."
Relaxation medicine,Been there many as i am living in Alleppey.  One must be there in his lifetime to feel the breeze and silence of the nature. Avoid March-May time though due to extreme heat
Just relax,"Sunglasses are a must. You will find plenty of boats, where you can hire one for taking you around the backwaters for a couple of hours or higher. Check and take the boats that have good reclined seats. Once on the boat, just relax down and enjoy the greenery around, view of coconut trees, and cool breeze.Time of visit: Not recommended when it is very sunny.If you are planning to reach Allepey on a private car from Kochi, I would recommend taking the road that is parallel to the sea, not the regular highway."
Lovely...must do,"Venice of the East...beautiful & mesmerising.Backwaters are all over the place in Allepey.Take a shikara, canoe or hand rowed boat & simply move along to see the beauty.Houseboats can be tried once."
Too good,"Its a lovely experience. You can book a houseboat or shikara or canoes,all are good. The smaller your boat, the smaller backwaters it can go in. Thats where the charm lies.Having experienced houseboat & shikara  before, we chose shikara this time. Also, got down at the rice fields , which are below water level. Lovely vistas."
nice boating,on the  boat we were very much enjoyed by side seeings and buying fish and frowns and in the boat good kitchen and arrangments are very good
Shakira trips,"Did 2 trips in a Shakira boat - there are loads available and the rate was 500 IR per hour. We did a 3 hour and a 5 hour tour, both good - but the 3 hour tour was probably best, going down the narrow channels. The large houseboat are a bit of an expensive scam, as they don't go…"
Be careful how you pick your boat,The backwater cruise is totally awesome.  We did an overnight boat and found the pace so very relaxing.  Our boat was organised by Expertise Travel who were very on the ball.  However we were a little disappointed in the level as we asked for the most expensive option and were…
"It's OK as a thing to do, nothing more. Very polluted! ","If you read the travel books this place sounds amazing. It isn't, it's kinda OK, I was totally so what about the backwaters in terms of the scenary and freaked out about the pollution.  So there are three ways you can explore. On one of the many house boats. There are millions…"
Beautiful and serene,Lovely place. We took the one hour sunset ride organised by our hotel lake palace resort. Beautiful and mesmerising. Will surely come back to stay in backwaters someday 
Incredible relaxing 24 hours,Spent the time on a houseboat operated by Evergreen tours. The three person crew looked after us so attentively. Food was to a very high standard and the crew ensured we had adequate alcoholic beverages. The scenery and our integration with our surroundings was terrific. Highly…
WANT TO BE BACK SOON IN BACKWATERS,"The journey through the backwaters of Alleppy was great and interesting.  We had a coconut stop on the way.  The initial part of the journey was through dirty patches of water, but soon the water-body became clear, vast, scenic and everyone on our boat enjoyed the journey,  We…"
Great stay,Fabulous! Johnson is very helpful and our room was big and clean. Loved the houseboat but the canoe trip much better.
"Beautiful scenery, clean houseboat, pristine waters!","We were served coconut drinks when we checked in at 12.00nn onto the Gayathri II houseboat on the Alleppey. There was also a fruit platter filled with oranges, apples and a pineapple. Lunch followed soon after with the main dish being fried fish (meen varuthathu). We then sailed…"
Amazing views of back water,Very good view of backwater and a relaxing atmosphere. It's very good to roam in that backwater with a shikara.
Relaxing journey!,"This was the highlight of our trip to Kerala. We hired a shikara,which is a small boat rather than the houseboat which we felt that, though the rooms have AC, but we didn't like the closed space. The open shikara was a good choice and the breeze was amazingThe cheapest way to see the Alleppey backwater is to take the train from Ernakulam south station to Alleppey which cost Rs 70/person and takes one hour and 30 minutes. You can also take uber which cost Rs 1400 oneway. Upon arriving to Alleppey station take auto rickshaw  to the Oxygine resort. There is a goverment run place in front of the station where you can buy the the auto ride for Rs 106 whithout having to huggle with drivers. In front of the Oxygine resort,which is the starting journey for all boats, there are many Shikara and houseboats available for hire.  Maximum cost is 500 Rs  per hour and recommended cruise time is   four hours. Best time to start the cruise is 3 PM to catch the sunset. This is the cheapest option compared to tour operators who charge an exorbitant price. Other options online like Alleppey houseboat are also unreliable. We reserved with them via WhatsApp but upon arriving to the agreed pick up point they changed the price as well as the option they give us via WhatsApp. Totally unprofessional."
Wonderful experience!,"It was a very nice and comfortable stay on the 'Southern Panorama Cruises' houseboat. Rooms were very nicely designed and had soothing ambience. Staff was extremely courteous and well mannered. They ensured to provide all the amenities to us and for my infant. Food was finger licking good, with candle light dinner.One advice when you are travelling with your kids....go for premium room as its AC is operational for full time (otherwise its from 9 PM to 6 AM only), which is very much required in humid climate. This facility can also be checked at the time of check-in and confirmed based on availability.Overall it was an excellent experience!!"
Nice trip,A must do if your viisitng Kerela good experience the staff on board were very accommodating and the food was much better than expected. In all a worthwhile experience
Rush hour of houseboats in the river,"The general idea is nice. You rent a houseboat for the night. You board at 12:00pm abd start cruising from the river to one of the canals, back to the river, then to the lake. You stop for lunch and continue cruising till 5:00pm. You have dinner, stay to sleep on the boat. Get up in the morning,  have breakfast and cruise back to the starting point.  We had the whole boat to ourselves with a cook. The food was great. The room was nice. The route was not interesting enough.  All the boats sailed on the same route.  The only difference is probably the price"
"Wonderful experience, but....","This place is mesmerising.Dont get me wrong, its overcrowded with boats but as tourists we have created this problem. We spent 4 hours here and loved relaxing watching the world go by.Our boat was arranged by our hotel and turned out to be double the cost. I suggest making your way down to where the boats leave from and negotiating a price with one of the locals.For us it was mixed feelings about the backwaters. Wonderful but sad to see the plastic in the water.Its everywhere. There are steps being taken to ban single use plastic here but the problem will not stop. Locals are regularly seen throwing plastic and other rubbish.into the water.They live in such a beautiful place but are killing it with their thoughtless actions."
journey by house boat enjoyable,travelled by luxury houseboat accomodation very good food was cooked in the boat very tasty and delicious the captain explained everything very well all through the journey it was a day trip
Go by Shikara not houseboat,"The backwaters of Allepey have been on my bucket list for years and I've finally done it. Originally we intended to get a houseboat for one or two nights but having researched it, we opted for a three hour day trip and thank God we did. Our boat was able to go down canals that a…"
definitely worth a visit!,"One of the highlights of our trip to Kerala. Didn’t know what to expect, but we really loved the day on the water. It’s a beautiful area, with stunning views."
A relaxing overnight trip,"A great way to pass a day and night on the beautiful and interesting backwaters of Kerala. Breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea and snack and dinner included. Bring your own preference of beverage as you won’t find any on board except for tea, coffee and water."
Aleppy,It's nice to see everyone to enjoy the waterfalls in front of you.it is a good location to stay at there.
Scenic Boat house ride,"It was a family day out, and hence decided to spend the day cruising through the backwaters of allepey. The route we chose was the Vembanad kayal, it was a very scenic experience and the service in the boathouse was good. They obliged to our requests for stops at various…"
Rainy season travel,"Alleppey is  a good place to start exploring Kerala Backwater canals, I traveled in the rainy season  , 4 rainy days in 3 weeks , rain for an hour and clear the rest of the day. Sun screen was more important then umbrella .But its hot and humid , really hot. "
Allepy house boat,"It's a must try in life time, wonderful backwaters connected to wembanad lake ,all day full cruise and at evening boat cruise at parking bank where you can meet the local people,who are very nice and friendly ,even you can celebrate your honeymoon specials like candle light…"
"Beautiful, relaxing , experience","We had a boat, captain and chef for a couple of memorable days cruising the waterway. We are planning on returning for longer, next time."
Exciting adventure ,"We hired a comfortable boat for a two hour tour in Allepey. It was very interesting to pass through canals where people led their every day lives. On top of that we started out at 4pm, so we returned exactly at sunset. "
Awesome experience of canoe in the wakwaters ,We got up at 6 am to see the sunrise at the lake in the backwaters. Fantastic ! We did canoe for 2 hours in the canals and watched the beautiful scenery and finally had a typical breakfast with egg curry and coconut. 
Trium Houseboats ,"We had this arranged by our Indian friends who love in Chennai.  This was part of a package arranged over 4 nights, 5 day trip. Highly recommend booking with Trium Houseboats, very reasonably priced and the crew were very attentive and looked after us, mooring overnight in a…"
Great tranquil visit,"We had a day trip on a houseboat & it was so tranquil and peaceful. Absolutely beautiful way to spend a few hours soaking up nature at its finest. We had lunch on board and enjoyed that with a beer (you can bring your own & they keep it chilled for you). Would recommend,…"
Restful overnight cruise,"We thoroughly enjoyed our overnight cruise, reading other reviews I would say choose your provider carefully. We were with My Trip houseboats, 5 of us in a 3 bedroom with ensuites houseboat. We had 3 staff on board. We had our cameras, books and the desire for some quiet…"
Great fun but a bit sticky.,"One and a half days on one of these converted rice barges is about enough. All very comfortable and great crew but at the end of the day it is a lot of chugging about with not a huge amount to look at apart from Indians going about their daily lives. But, this alone was quite an…"
Excellent service and well looked after ,This place is located in Alleppey away from the town. When we arrived on the houseboat for our 4 hour tour they greeted us and served us fresh lemon juice.The crew who ran the houseboat that we went on for our tour looked after us very well. We had an excellent time on the houseboat where the chef cooked a brilliant lunch for us all which was delicious. This was a once in a life time opportunity to go and see the backwaters in Alleppey.The service was excellent and we were looked after very well.We did a 4 hour tour in a houseboat and the views were breathtaking and beautiful!The staff who organised this trip for us did an excellent job. I would throughly recommend this trip to all my family and friends who want to experience an adventure on a houseboat in the backwaters of Kerala.
Must Do,"If you do nothing else in Kerala, you must enjoy the backwaters. We were on a beautiful boat for an overnight trip at the end of 3 weeks in Southern India and it was bliss. Despite the number of houseboats on the water it was so peaceful. The staff were amazing, the food was delicious and the service exceptional. The scenery was so interesting, seeing the local communities go about their everyday lives was a privilege."
Good View on a Day Cruise,We did a day cruise ad it was really a great experience with amazing views. We booked the houseboat ourselves
Aleppey trip,"Alleppey tops this list of best tourist places in Kerala with pictures. Its backwater trips, houseboat stays, and serene beauty attract a fair number of people to its territory. In fact, it is the most popular place to experience Kerala’s backwaters. Lord Curzon’s depiction of Alleppey as the Venice of the East is not hyperbole. Alleppey houseboat vacation is what people look for on their visit to Alleppey. There are expanses of paddy fields, quaint chapels, interesting fishing villages, and lakes filled with water lilies which make Allepey one of the best tourist places in Kerala for 3 days trip itinerary. The fascination of Keralites with coconut and banana leaves in their food will prove to be a good experiment for you if you have never had it before. The cobbled pathways and cleaner roads comparatively will take you on an old-world tour."
Amazing relaxing experience,"Had a wonderful time cruising the backwaters of Kerala with Evergreen Tours who had been booked to provide this part of our tour by the local agent. A really lovely boat, very comfortable viewing seating and separate dining end, and the bedroom although quite a tight fit was more than adequate. With just two of us together with the captain and cook we had one of the most relaxing experiences of my life! The food was excellent and the pace of the boat just forced us to relax, (especially with no wifi!!). Saw fish eagles, lots of kingfishers, cormorants, egrets etc.Only criticism was a lack of directions for our pre dinner evening walk once docked and we ended up lost and walking back across paddy fields to find the boat again!"
Kerala - My Trip HouseBoats,"We had booked a heritage deluxe houseboat for an entire day and night. It was an amazing and unforgettable experience for us, ConsOur houseboat got delayed by half an hour which should not be the case. As checkout is at 9 and they get good 3 hours for everything.It was little dirty. Considering what I am paying I expect much more cleanness. I could see some spider webs etc, lizards, and we had booked a double decker one, so top portion was not at all cleaned. AC service was provided only in night (though it was told before) but there was no fan in houseboat and it was hell hell hell hot. For us as it was double decker so it was little better. Please confirm on this if the houseboat has a fan or not. For us when we complained they gave a small cooler but it was pretty useless. So don’t rely on these.There were no soaps tissues provided. No dustbins in bathrooms. All these minute details were missings.Pros: Amazing amazing amazing experience. There were in total 3 members in houseboat. One cook, one captain and one for other works. They were nice people. When we entered they served us with welcome drink . It was pretty tasty. All the meals were very tasty and they paid heed to any suggestion we gaveThey were very punctual with time, There usual time to give breakfast is 8 but we requested for 7 and our breakfast was ready by 7.We needed a cake on the boat for some celebration and they provided us with one. It was very tasty."
Good for Day Trips,House boats at night are a waste. The amazing View is great all day & would recommend to do only day tours & not to stay in the house boats. The boats are parked all night & it gets quite boring. Mosquito repellent is a must to carry.We learnt that the water that is used in the house boat (to clean & washroom) is the same river water that looks really dirty. Drinking water is different. Recommendation : DO NOT STAY in the houseboat. Day trips are Wonderful.
Kayaking in the backwaters,Amazing place...did kayaking and explore the villages in the back water...you can also rent a houseboat and enjoy a night stay...It's scenic and beautiful...
Quite Enjoyable moments in the boat house,"We had booked in waves and dale boat house through online. Everything was good. Happy Satisfied experience.Though i was expecting shooting spot  visit in the ride but it was not there was the small disappointment., may be each boat goes in a different route also from different destination, apparently I came to know about that spot by an YouTube video. My 6-year-old son complained that there is no DTH connection to the TV they have provided in the room. But we thought its fine not to watch TV for one day."
Alleppey houseboat,It is must to visit kind of place and only boat house shall be opted for one to enjoy this place.you may also go to alleppey beach in evening.
Awesome experience,"Visited in Year end holidays of December 2019. These backwaters are simply awesome. The houseboats are top class, well maintained and clean. The boys served delicious meals with authentic Kerala fish fry and other dishes with mouthwatering coconut based curries. Hospitality at…"
Peace and Tranquil,"Lovely overnight stay on the backwaters in a house boat. Booked by Kerala tours, the boat was large clean and had the basics. The food was amazing and simple the fish boat at the local hut supposedly caught that day was cooked up for us, but wasnt cheap. The bathroom a little…"
Must do activity in Kerala,absolutely gorgeous and mesmerizing experience. But remeber to book in advance just like hotels to get good deals and value for money.
Boat ride ,Gorgeous views and very serene settings in evenings. Beautiful boats and some gorgeous settings to see. Very peaceful !!
An Experience To Remember ,Remember !! You are in Alleppey. There is no other great experience than taking a backwater trip via Shikara boat or house boat. You can book boat via government centre or near jetty points. Price depends on how you negotiate but normal charge would be between 300-700 INR per…
Perfect sunset visit.,"We went for sunset ride for 1 hour organized by our hotel lake palace resorts. He took very beautiful route. We did not had time to go for 3 to 4 hour ride. I did not want to stay at houseat as nothing to do after 6 pm. You can see house boat traffic on back waters. Since we are vegetarian, no point of us to stay on house boat as people generally go for fish. But a visit of 1-3 hour is must as per y hiour time permits. 1 hour evening sunset ride was beautiful. You can choose options from 2-3 hours morning or evening depends on your schedule."
Absolutely Stunning,"Seeing the backwaters was one of my favourite parts of traveling across India. If you are an active person, I would personally recommend taking a kayaking tour. It's a great way to explore the narrower canals."
"Still scenic, but now busy, questions I would pursue for a trip are….","We have been to the backwaters of Alleppey previously some 8 years ago. Our first visit, also overnight, was a brilliantly sunny day and the colours of houses, people in canoes and boats with palm trees and rice field back-grounds was stunning. This time, not so much. No doubt the overcast day affected photo opportunities. But there are so many boats now. Some channels were just too busy. And while our lunch stop was well situated overlooking rice fields our overnight stop was alongside local housing. Not unsightly, and actually the local life provides some of the best photo opportunities, but I would rather be ‘with nature‘ than near people on this trip. Reasons of limited open ground, paying for overnight mooring etc etc were offered as reasons we couldn't move. Where the boat will park overnight and what route you might be taking to get to some quieter areas will be questions for further trips or perhaps one or two operators are or might start working different areas. All questions I’d ask if recommending to anyone for the future. Having said all that don't be put off making a visit, overnight is different and can be quite stunning."
Poovar is much better,Backwater boat ride is good. But these backwaters are just a trailer of the beauty that exists at Poovar.
Serene,House boats of different sizes. Different rates. Vegetarian meals can be requested. Boats do not move at night. Very relaxing.
