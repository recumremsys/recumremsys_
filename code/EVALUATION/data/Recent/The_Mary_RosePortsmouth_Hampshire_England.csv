Incredibly impressive ,"A visit to the Mary Rose was a highlight of our trip to the Portsmouth Docklands. So much love and care has gone into the restoration and preservation of this ancient historic ship. I particularly enjoyed seeing the artefacts they recovered, the ancient barrels, plates, wooden jugs, surgical instruments and personal effects of all those who perished when it sank. The facial reconstructions, the details of their way of life aboard the ship and the historical significance and link to King Henry 8th. To ensure Covid-29 safety, you are issued with a rubber stylus for the touchscreens and staff were polite and aware of social distancing. It is a display I would readily go back to in a few months and do all over again, especially as science progresses and the restorers find new facts. There is a coffee shop inside but the prices are high, so eat before you go!  There are free toilets on site. (A few tips if you are thinking of visiting: book to see more than one attraction at the Portsmouth Docklands: if you can afford it, take the slightly more expensive Ultimate Explorer Ticket because you will need plenty of time for each attraction; it is just so amazing and the displays are all fascinating. The ticket allows you to go on the harbour boat tour, and in two days we did it twice!To everyone involved in the Mary Rose, all I can say is, well done and please keep up the great work you do to preserve our history."
Utterly entrancing visit to Mary rose,I am so pleased the visit far exceeded my expectations. I knew very little about the Mary rose.  I'm pleased to say after my visit I now know a huge amount. The museum is amazing. They have done such a good job in preserving what's left of her and showcasing it so sympathetically. The additional atmospheric noise if creaking wood and sea and the projected pictures of what life on board would have been like were thrilling. A small thing we noticed were the visitor walkways on all 3 desks mirrored the shape of the decks on the Mary rose. Depending on how much you like to read and take in (We love history) then allow 2-2.5 hours inside. You end with a lovely gift shop and cafe. We refuelled in the cafe whilst watch the aircraft carrier in port.
Thanks Barry,"This has to be one of the best presented exhibitions in the world. The story of the Mary Rose, it’s place in history, it’s location and recovery are all beautifully told. The shear amount and variety of artefacts that were found and preserved is incredible. Do your self a favour and pay a tenner to have someone like Barry guide you through the whole story. Thanks Barry."
Excellent...,"We had an afternoon out with friends and living just 30 miles away we decided to visit this attraction... I wasnt sure what to expect because  its just whats left of the original ship..But its so much more and we're so pleased we went. Its almost atmospheric when you see it for the first time, there's so much more to see that makes it really interesting. Infact there are other attractions that should visit here to see how to do things properly.Highly recommended."
Fantastic,Probably the best exhibition I’ve ever seen. The whole set up is informative and done in such an imaginative way giving you a real feel for how life would have been onboard. If you do nothing else in Portsmouth you must visit the Mary Rose!
Stupendous,"More  tha two hours whizzed by. The museum is quite breathtaking, guides are well informed, only one was disinterested, the exhibits are wel ldisplayed. It needs more than one visit to take it all in"
Must See!,"This is a ‘Must See’ Attraction if your are visiting the Portsmouth Area. The work and detail that has gone into this Experience is incredible. So much detail on the Mary Rose has you captivated the moment you walk in. The Cabinet Displays were beautifully presented throughout. Cannot understand a few comments on here regarding the entrance fee, This project took years of painstaking work to where we are now with the Mary Rose. Trust me the entrance fee is worth every penny."
Excellent place to go!,"We had a fabulous day out at Portsmouth Historic dockyard visiting the Mary Rose museum. Car Parking was clearly signposted as we drove into Portsmouth and we parked in the designated car park about 6 minutes walk away from the harbour area. We had a Covid friendly welcome (seriously, a warm welcome makes a difference), browsed the shops, used the toilets, had a cup of coffee outside in the sun and entered the museum itself. I cannot speak too highly of the excellent displays of artifacts and the ship itself! You could take it at three levels - a quick overview, a more detailed explanation or a really detailed object by object explanation. Imaginatively displayed, good signposting, great views of the ship and a good gift shop too.  Even a small cafe - but the area has others.  It was quiet mid week. We spent three hours there and then wandered around the dock area seeing the Victory and other ships from the outside.  On one visit just seeing one ship is going to be enough!"
Excellent work,"Haven’t been here for a few years and was thought the work that had been done was excellent. Highly recommend it. Very helpful and knowledgeable staff. Current restrictions all adhered to, plenty of hand sanitising stations. Very clean and well worth the money"
"Sadly, a tourist rip-off. Not worth the money",The Mary Rose is fascinating . . . . . But the ticket price at £34 per person is daylight robbery and does not represent value for money. Also the website is virtually unnavigable and clearly intended to trick unsuspecting punters into spending as much money as possible.Buy a book and avoid this 'attraction' like the plague.
Amazing,Worth a visitStaff amazing & knowledgeable Value for moneyDisabled friendlyUnbelievable amount of relics on show
Amazing,"Second time at visiting the dockyard and finally able to see the Mary Rose and museum, it was closed on our previous visit. Was unaware of the number of artefacts that were retrieved"
A Must See,"This was our second visit to the Historic Dockyard and to the Mary Rose. The whole set up is just breathtaking. from the first explanation of the sinking through to seeing the ship in all its glory. It's stunning to image that this ""exhibit"" is almost 500 years old. Don't miss this it is worth every penny of your visit. The museum is easily navigated and with thousands of items fro the ship on display with stories attached to every object."
Fantastic You can spend hours here,"Very safe during Covid. clean and sanitises available, numbers limited.  The ship is really bought to life.  Films are projected onto what's left of the ship showing different aspects of life on board.  Artifacts are displayed and explained, characters bought to life with facial reconstruction, there's a shop and a cafe too.  Toilets both inside and outside the building."
Mary Rose. Unmissable.,"Last time we visited the Mary Rose they were still keeping it wet,  we only saw some of the items retrieved .This time it was amazing, the work they have done is amazing. It is now dried out and displayed in a air controlled environment.It really show what life must have been like on a ship at that time, and to think that of 500 crew only 35 survived.Everything is explained so well. The items retrieved are in remarkable condition, the carpenters tools are so like the hand working tools of our fathers.We spent 1 hour as they closed at 5 but we will go again as there is so much to see.I think out of all the viewable crafts this is really a must. If I could only go to 1, this would be it."
Amazing saved ship!,"We waited till all children were back in school so that it would be quieter. I went on line to book a time and date on the actual morning  for our visit the online book system was easy to use. I bought tickets for 3 attractions and lasting a year so we can revisit. Sadly there was only a £1. discount for being a senior. Tickets would be costly if you bought the one time use one attraction at £24. so spending an extra £10 was very cost affective. The Mary Rose -what a wonder there is a short film to see as you enter and then there are displays on each level. There are cases with items recovered from the sea bed and from within the ship. Sadly they have a skeleton of a dog that was found inside the doorway of a cabin he had awaited the return of his master. Stories of people and their roles on board and small video clips of what life may have been like on board. There is so much to see as well as the remains of the actual ship it is well worth a visit and yes we will go again maybe next year. Great for all ages there are lots of stairs but there is also a lift, never saw any audio guides so most displays are very visual."
Weekend away,We had to wait outside for a period of time due to the ticket readers being down.It is well worth seeing this exhibit which shows all the things recovered on his wreck but the history o it and the history of the people who were on it as well.I particularly liked the holographic videos that played on he wreck in the different places where the sailers would have worked.
very unusual,It wasn't what I expected. There were many films . The floor gave the impression of being on the waves. Each floor was a new experience.
Amazing,"Remarkable and awe inspiring museum. So much to take in, it really needs more than one visit. However I would strongly advise anyone with mobility issues to wait for the end of Covid restrictions. Under normal circumstances there is a buggy service from the Dockyard gate. We asked for a wheelchair as I am very elderly, which was willingly supplied, but the route is very very hard going, unclear, part cobbled, etc."
Excellent!,"Very interesting attraction, I didn’t think I would enjoy it, it was great and well worth a visit, highly recommend!"
Great experience,Definitely worth a visit. Got to see the remains of this lovely Tudor warship and many of its artefacts in a museum of 3 or 4  floors.
Wow! Wow! Wow!,Left speechless by this amazing exhibit. The commitment and dedication that has resulted in this outstanding display
Expensive but worth it,"I really enjoyed this and I am normally the person who walks through museums really quickly only stopping if something REALLY stands out and grabs my attention. It was was well worth a visit. I won’t ruin it for you but a really imaginative way of bringing this to life and you are not bombarded with facts and figures so it doesn’t feel like you have to work to understand what you are looking at. Very well presented, impressive and interesting."
A must see,The Mary Rose Exhibition is in the Portsmouth Historic Dockyards. It is a must see. The exhibit is well laid out.
Amazing,An amazing trip into the past to view Henry VIII flagship. Plenty of staff who know the ship inside out and the exhibits are fantastic on all floors. Definitely worth a visit
Anmazing experience,"Amazing experience, highly recommended. The ship itself is a wonder, but the museum is also so well thought out.  The lives if the poor souls who were lost have been virtually brought back, its completely fascinating."
A fascinating insight into a remarkable story.,"We visited this exhibition in the latter part of our first day on our weekend visit to the Historic Dockyards,and although we had already taken in many of the other excellent  sites within the Dockyards this one is something really special and not to be missed.Due to the current Covid situation the staff do limit the amount allowed in at any one time and we did have a short wait of about 15 minutes to enter,although due to the limited amount of people in there together you do tend to spend more time viewing the various exhibits and reading the fascinating stories that go with each article on display.All in all this museum deserves all the credit it is awarded as do the many people that it must have taken to bring this fascinating piece of history to us."
Amazing museum - couldn’t recommend more highly!,My partner and I spent an enjoyable couple of hours visiting the Mary Rose. The museum sets the scene very clearly and then the viewing options for seeing the ship allow you to get a great idea of what life was like in the 1500s. The effort put in to restore the ship is astonishing and the museum sets out this journey well. I would like to give a special mention to Pam who made our trip extra special. She gave us a lot of additional information about the ship and her smiley and friendly approach made us feel very welcomed.
A Snapshot of our History ,"Everyone should see this if they get the chance. We viewed the Mary Rose some years ago, when it was being sprayed with water etc. to stop it drying and rotting the timbers.Now this is dry, and exhibited in a much superior  way, with video, lighting, and sound, hundreds of glass cabinets, encasing thousands of artifacts with detailed information. You get a real sense of the dark cold, hard, tough conditions below decks, and the overall size of this amazing ship."
Excellent Museum,Really enjoyed our visit but poor and expensive food and refreshments spoiled our visit. Costa Cafe closed.
Fantastic Museum,"I remember watching the Mary Rose come out of the sea when I was a child back in the 80's and I have always wanted to visit. With our holiday this year being a Staycations due to COVID-19, we decided to take a visit to Portsmouth Harbour.This museum really does take you back to the 1500's and as breath taking as seeing the Mary Rose is, the exhibition is simply fantastic as well.You get taken right back to how life was on the ship and you also feel it in a strange way, all the items that have been found are so interesting and how they have managed to work out what people looked like from the bones that have been found is just fascinating.The Mary Rose itself is breath taking, her decks seem to tell you what history walked along them. If you are ever in Portsmouth, this is definitely worth a visit."
Family Day Out,"Just WOW! A fantastic exhibition, full of wonderful artefacts, information, very family friendly culminating in the jewel herself...The Mary Rose"
Had the wow factor,Been a couple of times and still wowed by the Mary Rose.  Saw it years ago when it was covered in plastic and being sprayed.  What they have done to bring it to live is amazing.
Amazing that they had preserved Henry VIII Favourite ship! ,Really cool they had preserved it! I am a great fan of Tudor history and when we went there it was just like a dream!Great experience for Tudor History Fans and Families! ( It makes history fascinating for even little kids!)
Magnificent Mary Rose from the Seabed,"The Mary Rose, Henry VIII's warship, was launched in 1511, lost in 1545 during the Battle of the Solent and recovered from the seabed in 1982. Although it was put on display in 1983, large parts of it were obscured as the timbers were protected and treated and it was not until 2016 that it went on display in what can only be described as a wonderful tribute to, not only our history, but to the science and engineering and people who carried out the marvellous restoration. This is a completely different experience to that on HMS Victory. The artefacts and historical parts of the exhibition are interesting but the star of the show is the ship itself. My first view of the ship when I entered the gallery took my breath away. And then I became aware of the holograms, lighting and sound effects depicting life on board in the 16th century - truly magnificent."
Rose up from the deep,"This museum is well laid out and allows you to view the recovered Mary Rose from a variety of levels. Displayed opposite the remains of the boat are objects that would be found in the section of the boat nearest to you. Outside of the main gallery there were several interesting displays, one around DNA profiling of the crew members - giving a interesting look at Tudor society and another covering the various diving expeditions that had retrieved artefacts. We would have liked more information around the ship building process, but that may just be because one of us is involved in that industry."
Great experience,Always wanted to go see The Mary Rose and was not disappointed.  We did the premium package so we toured the museum with a guide first. Wendy our guide her knowledge and enthusiasm was fantastic.  The set up of the museum is great lots of little extras other than in the displays ie projection on wall or glass. We went a second time to do the tour at leisure to see all the little details had a wonderful time . Also we purchased the Portsmouth dockyard ticket that is well worth the money too.
Very interesting ,We went here at the beginning of March and had a great time walking about this huge Museum. 3 levels all with lift access or stairs. So many artefacts which shows you how the crew lived and worked on The Mary Rose. The ship itself is amazing to look at and you are shown what happened in each level of the ship - what went on. Thoroughly interesting and amazing to see it all. Highly recommend a look around.
Great to go back.,"Last visited in my teens when in a temporary structure and being sprayed with liquid. So good to see it now carefully preserved with some excellent artifacts and detailed descriptions of some aboard.Whilst they briefly covered the raising in a short audio visual piece at the end, personally I would if liked to see more in the raising as I remember this, and that we even had a BBC computer programme on this at school at the time."
Amazing ,Very interesting on hearing the story of the Mary Rose . Displayed really well . Great to see what was retrieved and pains takin to get it to where it is now . Great job . Another part of history on show .
Great accessibility,"I was so impressed with this trip. I usually accept that I will visit something historic and there will be areas I can't see. But so much thought has gone into the Mary Rose visitors centre. I was able to see, hear and read everything. If this is your thing then I can't recommend it highly enough.My only issue was the toilet was outside along with the other toilets, which is fine, however the actual toilet was really low and it was difficult to transfer from wheelchair to the toilet and then back to the chair. I think most disabled people benefit from a higher toilet so maybe the dockyard could think about it when replacing."
Fab informative and not to be missed,Great exhibition we all had a great few hours and learnt so much in an easy environment. Great for all ages and lots to see
Fabulous museum and experience,This is an exceptional place to visit and worth every penny we paid.  The museum is a masterpiece of modern design but the content is unbelievable.  The way the Mary Rose is displayed along with so many exhibits is mind blowing.  Such a variety of different and varied day to day objects which are linked to the people and the ship have been strategically and thoughtfully put on display.  Modern technology and lighting enhance the learning experience.It is an amazing place and everyone should see this world class exhibition!!
A long awaited visit and worth it!,"This museum tells the story of how the Mary Rose was raised and conserved as well as the story of the Tudor ship and sailors.  Well presented, 3 floors of galleries with the remains of the Mary Rose visible from all 3 floors.  If you have questions ask the gallery attendants they know their stuff!"
DNA of some of the sailors,The views of the Mary Rose were excellent from all the floors.The artefacts were very interesting also the DNA of the various sailors and also the dog on board.Allow at least four hours or more to see everything.Excellent value for the entry price.
Mary Rose,"Well worth the visit amazing displays and information.  Not overly expensive, great to be given knowledge and info about how the Mary Rose was discovered"
Wonderful museum,This is the 3rd time I have visited over a number of years and it gets better each time. This is the first time I have seen the Mary Rose without the dryers. It is an experience to witness what it may have been like living at the time. The museum staff are very informative and willing to talk about their museum. The latest exhibition gives an insight into the actual people who perished when the ship sank. I enjoyed the videos that pop up when the film is shown. It was a great place to be on a very wet and windy day. The reduction to book on line and opportunity to visit for a year is encouraging.
Superb ,"Just totally mind blowing , to look at all the artifacts and wreck is just amazing .To preserve them all like they have is a monumental achievement .Absolutely loved every bit .Guides vey knowledgeable Totally worth the admission fee .14£ if ordered in advance ."
Well worth it.,I visited Portsmouth historic dockyard in February. This included the Mary Rose. It’s spectacular and  well worth a visit and highly recommended
A great place to visit,"This museum is one of the best in the country. We all very impressed with the way the the story of the recovery of the ship was performed , and then presented in the museum. All of my family young and old were totally engrossed in every aspect of the project. A beautiful place to visit, Thank You All"
Fantastic Experience,An unbelievably stunning feat of engineering and meticulous care has given us probably one of the best exhibitions on this planet. My second visit in 10 months and just as awed!The staff are super keen / knowledgeable and there enthusiastic shows . Go to see for yourself!!!!
Hands on with history.,"Seeing the ship was brilliant - hearing the stories of the sailors and then the subsequent salvage, was superb."
Excellent Museum,"Absolutely loved this place a really good place to spend a few hours, so interesting. it will be even better than you expect."
Amazing !,We weren't sure if it was worth the expense or not when we walked round the dockyard but decided to risk it. We were pleasantly surprised when we finally paid and walked round. The sheer amount of interesting artefacts was amazing and seeing what's left of the Marie Rose was the icing on the cake. It's a place I'd recommend to anyone of any age.
Wonderful exhibition but...,Wonderful exhibition and very interesting but felt that the skeletons of the crew should not be on display and left in peace
Amazing,"we have always wanted to visit this place,went on a Tuesday when it was fairly quiet ,although still busy,lovely intresting place with a lot of History,would like to return with the grandchildren."
Visit to the Marie Rose meusum i,Fantastic that is all I can say amazing spent all day there which we had not anticipated great day out for all mobile   seats providedm
Hey-Ho and up she rises!,Just stunning. I'm not sure there is much more that needs saying. But I'll try. I think this will be lost on younger children because there is a lot to take in. Perfect for attentive teens and adults. The Ship itself is impressive - the conservation process itself is miraculous. Personally I found the hundreds of items salvaged from the site to be the star of the show. It really allows you an authentic glimpse into the working life on a 16th century ship and the men who worked on her. I would allow three hours to really take it all in. Or take advantage of the ticket allowing unlimited visits for a year and do it in chunks at your own pace.
Wow!,"This is one of the most incredible museums I've been too. On one side of the (modern specifically built) museum you have the actual wreck of the Mary Rose, on the other side, different floors matching the decks, featuring artefacts each with their own information from the wreck. The wreck itself is not ignored, with amazing projections and light & sound displays.  Amazing visit. We bought a family ticket as it is valid for a year and intend coming back with the kids. One thing though, the cafe in the foyer was very poor. Every table was dirty and covered in crumbs (11am) and only 1 customer inside . When I mentioned to the staff serving us that every table needed a good wipe, it still wasn't done. limited pre-packed sandwiches & paninis)"

World class,"This is stunningly well presented. Leaving aside the rather austere and unwelcoming area from the ticket desk to the museum itself, it's amazing. The personal artefacts and the work that's been done to bring them to life are so poignant. The historical context is presented in a light touch, sensitive way, with enough information to get the most out of the museum but not to feel overawed. And the remains of the Mary Rose itself are, of course, immensely powerful.For me, it would have been good to have had more of the preservation process explained (unless I missed it)."
Outstanding Museum,The museum has been created around the restored remains of the ships hull. Videos projected into sections of the hull recreate various activities that would have been carried out on board. There are many other displays around which  describe life in Tudor times.Possibly the most impressive museum I have visited.
Exceptional experience,"Our delegation had an exceptional experience. The ""Workshop on What sank the Mary Rose"" was professionally presented with lots of informationand ,  interactive and fun. The tour guide was well experienced, articulated, well organized and curtailed our needs to our requirements. Overall, we had an exceptionally amazing workshop and tour of the museum and I will like to express my appreciation to all the staff members especially  the Ticket Sales Manager for making it an unforgetable experience."
"Interesting, but....","First off I think it’s a bit expensive, I understand that you are able to visit more then once during a period of a year, but for a one off visit the option of a lower price  I think would encourage more people to view, That being said, we enjoyed the exhibits and artefacts on show, and Seeing the remains of the ship is fascinating, there are various projection shows but we were unsure of the timings, there are plenty of staff who are prepared to answer any questions (some are very/too keen, my wife for a bit of fun was trying one of the projection games and this was completely taken over by one member trying to explain how to do it) but it was overall enjoyable."
Impressive beyond words,"In 1982 i was a fresh civil engineering undergraduate at the polytechnic. I was able to see the recovery operation from my hall of residence. At the time i thought what a waste of time & money. How wrong i was !! The ship, the artefacts, the insight into the lives of the crew, the efforts of the archaeologists and conservators is mind blowing !!  I was only disappointed by the section on the “diversity” of the crew & the blurb drawing parallels with today in the UK. Effectively politicising the museum. There are no parallels. All the non Brits in the crew were specialists with needed skills and not benefit spongers. Leave politics out please !! Museum otherwise brilliant. Displays amazing. Shop & cafe excellent. The member of staff we spoke with was friendly & knowledgeable. Will be coming back."
Really glad I visited here ,"Really interesting morning. The staff were really helpful and informative, they’re a credit to the Mary Rose!I found all the information to be interesting and fairly accessible.Something not everyone may no, there is an app you can download to help you with bits of information while you’re walking round! Great idea.The Mare Rose herself was wonderful to see and very well exhibited. I am really glad I saw this and would go again.Also accessible for people with mobility issues.Cafe was nice and well priced."
Fascinating - yet gruesome at the same time,"I have always wanted to visit the Mary Rose and finally had the opportunity in the spring of last year. Admission may seem a little pricey but when one considers the work that went into the restoration project and what one actually gets for ones money, it really is money well spent, and excellent value. Bear in mind that your ticket is valid for a year so you can come for a repeat viewing if you wish to and are in the area.Seeing the ship and reading all about the crew members and how they lived really brings the experience to life - conditons were better than on many ships during this era, but even so I wouldn't want to live that like for months on end. The diet left a lot to be desired and conditons were somewhat unsanitary compared to what we have today. The description of the surgeons work in particular was extremely gruesome - I am glad that medicine has advanced somewhat! The interactive boards and displays are very informative abd well made, and great no doubt for families to keep the youngsters interested and amused. The staff too are brilliant, patiently answering questions and volunteering with plenty of information to aid your experience. I would definately recommend a visit if in the area and next time will visit a lot more of the Historic Dockyard - you could easily spend a day here."
Mary Rose,"Had to pay separately to visit here, despite having a dockyard ticket. I think it was worth it though. I have wanted to see it since I watched it being lifted out of the sea as a child, (its only taken 34 years to get here!). I wasn't disappointed, the level of preservation is quite amazing, as is the number of recovered artefacts. The walk through museum is also very interesting, a lot of effort has been put in."
Totally Amazing ,"Visited here yesterday with friends, an excellent exhibition, definitely worth a visit. The staff couldn't be more helpful, they were also extremely well informed about the ship and and it's history. It will appeal to all ages as there are activities for children as well.One of my friends had recently had a knee op, the staff couldn't have been kinder, finding her a wheelchair. So that she could enjoy the visit too, easy access if you are disabled!"
"Incredible museum, knowledgable staff.","Managed to visit on a super quiet, rainy day and felt like we had the place to ourselves. This is an incredible museum, cleverly done with the ship on one half, the floors either end and along the other side of the ship being 'mirror images' of what life in that area/space of the ship would have been like, lights come up and down and when down holograms play in the ship showing more detail about life/activity in certain sections of it. The amount of artefacts recovered from the water, the care taken in preservation, watch the archeology video clips dotted around, the painstaking care to clean, preserve, strengthen is incredible and it's taken 30 years to get to this point - just fascinating. Staff dotted around floors/displays were knowledgable and willing to jump in with more facts or explanation so clearly passionate about what they are doing. Very warm and welcoming visit, highly recommended and tickets are valid for 12 months so for lucky locals it's a year of re-visits for sure! So glad we got to do this while in the area. Our visit took 2.5 hours, you could cut this down by not reading so many boards or watching so many video clips, you could also extend this to a good 3 hours by reading more boards and watching more clips. So much information here. Few games/dressing up areas for younger kids dotted around on each floor/area."
Moving and Spectacular ,A stunning building housing a truly spectacular exhibit. Visiting the Mary Rose is a moving experience and one not to be missed.
What a Transformation!,"We took visitors from Australia here and it didn't disappoint at all.  The last time we visited the Mary Rose, it was still on its side being sprayed with water.  It's been put upright and the way the opposite side of the ship has been configured is just tremendous, without giving too much away.  The DNA testing of crew members was fascinating and the resoration of relics awe-inspiring.  The tour guides were lovely, highly knowledgeable and friendly, who made the visit even more enjoyable .  This really is a compelling display, innovatively presented and essential for anyone interested in the Tudor navy and society at that time."
Amazing glimpse into bygone era,"The story of this trip is filled with every descriptor: vast, tragic, incredible, skill & preservation. Sunk rapidly under the culmination of unfortunate events with the loss of almost 500 sailors, the Mary Rose sank & descended into the silts of Portsmouth Harbour only to be discovered & raised to the surface in the late 20th Century. Now housed within a state of the art museum that permits the visitor to see her along with 19,000 associated relics, including the skeletal remains of some of its sailors and the dog! Seeing her will bring to light so many aspects of the lives of seaman in the 16th Century & the conditions they fought in. Truly enlightening & sobering."
Amazing museum ,"Fabulous museum, brilliantly presented. Super impressed with the design, artefacts and attention to detail. Although our children aged 9 & 13 haven’t yet studied this at school the museum made the Mary Rose very accessible to learn about and be a amongst, especially as my Husband and I remember her being raised from the ocean on Blue Peter back in the day !"
Half-term visit - amazing!,A day trip out worth the kids for half-term. We were all really impressed with the layout and flow of the museum to link each level of the exhibits with the same level as the Mary Rose. Really clever and brought it all to life! The kids also got a chance to do some calligraphy and making lavender pouches (£2 each extra). Loved it!
Superb,There is an extra cost but is valid for year we have visited 3 times it is really interesting and if king Edward is there well worth a watch kids loved it with things just for them well worth a visit
Excellent,"Wow, loved this tour, so much to see and read. Spent three hours in here well worth it. Lots of artifacts and info about the history how they raised the ship. Very helpful staff."
Day trip,Well worth a visit. But be prepared for a lot of standing. The interactive boards are great fun. Helps to bring the period and place alive. I am an ex teacher and I would say this is a must for antone learning about the Tudor period.
Spectacular ,This was our 3rd visit to The Mary Rose Museum & every visit feels like my 1st time! As a teenager back home in Belfast in 1982 I watched on tv the Mary Rose being raised from the English Channel & never in a million years did I ever expected to get the opportunity to see her for real. There is so much to see in the museum & well worth the entry fee.
Mary Rose ..a step back in time,This was a great day visiting the Mary Rose museum. The artic acts and the stroll through the tree floors with great explanations was really good. The best part was the view of the ship that was for me a fantastic insight to the ships of the time and this great ship. One nice touch in the museum was the little fold up chairs we could carry around with us if required. I suffered with a bad back so that was very useful. I could sit and read the explanations as I went around. It may not be ultra cheap but the tickets last a whole year and we felt it was well worth it..
An early visit without the crowds to Henry 8th's ship - its amazing,"As a child I watched the Mary Rose rise from the Solent on the television and over the years have visited a few times to see the progress that the archaeologists have made in preserving this famous Tudor ship. The Museum is top notch and very professional with the staff well versed in their knowledge of the ship and all the artefacts.I visited with an annual pass and with it just being opening time was almost on my own which felt fanstastic as I could view whatever I wanted to do or just stand there an admire the ship in all its glory plus chat to some of the staff without crowds, made for quite an experience. Indeed no-one other than some of the staff stood there with me looking at the ship, fab.The history is told through info boards, sounds and videos with some of the videos superimposed onto the hull structure which brings some of the ships activities to life.Top tip would be to get there early and then just take you time without many others around you."
Fascinating - such effort has gone into preserving this piece of history.,"A great combination of digital technology has been used to illustrate this amazing ship.  There is the sound of the sea and wind in rigging, but also hologram style reproductions of re-enactors portraying the work of seamen in the areas where evidence was found -e.g the cook; the surgeon; the carpenter.  These are shown occasionally, so it's not 'in your face', there is a change of lighting from time to time, and the whole effect is as though she were still under the sea.  The artefacts are well displayed and there are excellent descriptions. There are also 'touch and feel' exhibits explained by knowledgeable volunteers."
A jaw dropping sight.....the Pompeii of the Tudor age!,"The ship is surrounded by an incredible structure which enables the visitor to see and experience a glimpse into Tudor England unparalleled anywhere in the country. The ship itself is a one off. I have seen many archaeological exhibits but nothing comes close to the size and detail that has been preserved with the Mary Rose....it is genuinely unique. The staff are the most informed and enthused people and seem to have a common / team sense of purpose....their mission to answer all of your questions and elaborate with further information whenever possible. The range of smaller items is staggering...from the ships dog, the cooking cauldrons, the archer and the largest collection of pristine appearance longbows that surely exists anywhere! If you are in Portsmouth/ Hampshire/ South coast .... or frankly anywhere in Great Britain you must, must go and see this absolutely stunning piece of our history!"
Wonderful experience!,"I visited this exhibition many years ago, just after the wreck was raised, and I have to say I was distinctly underwhelmed!  This visit was a totally different experience.  Restoration is now complete, and one can really get the concept of an actual ship, and  audio-visuals enable a wonderful idea of life on board.  Without exception, all staff were knowlegable, friendly and anxious to help.  Ticket price gives entry for a whole year."
Henry VIII’s favourite ship,A fantastic trip back into life on a Tudor warship. Authentic artefacts well presented. An exceptionally well displayed and interactive exhibition
Awesome view into Tudor Maritime History,"Excellently presented museum with the remnants (there are lots) of Henry's ship, The Mary Rose. Very well worth the visit."
Outstanding,"We visited the Mary Rose museum when the remains were being sprayed, many years ago and when it was being dried.Now that the whole process is complete and the museum opened fully it is literally incredible what has been achieved.Not only the ship itself, but the artefacts that have been recovered.Brilliantly told through the display cabinets it’s a story that tells itself.I would recommend this to everyone. We had to take two visits to see it all but it was worth it.The staff very helpful and incredibly knowledgeable about its history.One thing I would definitely recommend is downloading the app and using the audio commentary, didn’t see anybody else doing this but well worth, it’s free!Well done, brilliant job😉👍"
Fascinating ,"This museum is a must see, the salvaged wreckage of Mary Rose and a lot of the items used onboard gives a grand view of Tudor times. A truly interactive walk through history."
Great museum,Great museum featuring the wreck of the Mary Rose and a large collection of salvaged items. Great in-depth exhibits and a great interactive layout of the ship itself.
So much to take in ,"This is a lively and modern museum. I like how they have worked to being the story of the ship, her crew and her retrieval to life.There are many artifacts to see, and the reconstruction of the crews faces was both interesting and respectful.I found the downloadable audio app useful if a little frustrating. I wasn't sure when to play the tracks, which autoplayed as you went along. Perhaps it might be useful to have a number at each location so people know when to listen to the individual sections of the guide?This is a fascinating museum with much to see, I needed a good 3 hours to go through itThe staff and volunteers were very friendly and knew their stuff. I hope to have the chance to come back and visit."
The Mary Rose Museum is one of the Best Nautical Museums in the World,"I have been able to see Viking ship museums in Stockholm and in Oslo, but the Mary Rose is truly amazing and I think surpasses them for the quality of the find and the wonderful displays.The Mary Rose is a sunken ship brought to the surface and slowly infused with water and polymer so that we can see what a ship from Henry VIII's tenure was like.The cross-bow preservation alone is entirely unique.  The museum is well-laid out and the displays are extensive.  Each facet of life aboard the ship comes to life.Utterly fascinating.  I run through the museum in an hour, but could have spent all day.  Wonderful.  One of a kind museum."
The best Tudor museum,"I love this museum! I live in Portsmouth and renew my Mary Rose ticket each year, it never gets boring. There is not another museum that has this many Tudor artefacts on display. The new museum is amazing and although the actual ship is stunning, I find the amount of artefacts on display amazing, particularly the small items such as dice and peppercorns. The museum gives a real taste of life for the 'ordinary' Tudor and is a must for any history fans. I have visited at all times of the year and never find it overcrowded. As a local, I would say this is Portsmouth 's greatest attraction."
Christmas ,"If your well into your history then it's a great museum. Theres three levels, and you can see parts of the ship at different stages. And what was on the ship at the time."
An excellent visit!,"This museum is amazing and has around 19,000 artefacts from the Tudor warship of Henry VIII, the Mary Rose.The ship was of special interest to us as my husband dived on her in the 70s, long before she was brought up.I marvelled at the condition of a lot of the things - the good bit about having been buried in mud for so long!We visited the Mary Rose in the early 90s when she was in a makeshift home and being sprayed constantly with water - it was great to see how she looks now. The staff were very knowledgeable and it was clear they loved their jobs and were very happy to impart their great knowledge!I thoroughly recommend a visit to this exhibition, and indeed to the Historic Dockyard."
Interesting museum ,We visited early morning and it  was not busy so able to enjoy the exhibits. This was not our first visit but always find something new to see. Easy to get around and people on hand if you require assistance.
A fascinating account of a shipwrecked Tudor warship,This Museum is award-winning for good reason. The story of the sinking of Henry VIII's flagship naval vessel in 1545 is told in dramatic detail and particularly interesting is to see are the preserved remains of the hull and to learn about the craftsmen who were employed m the ship's crew. A bonus was to find out more about how osteo-archaeological techniques have enabled facial reconstruction of some of the crew over 500 years later!
Exceedingly well done,Tip-  Download Mary Rose app on your phone and have headphones.  Free wifi available and the free audio guide is really good. You do play find the corresponding exhibit though.The museum is very cleverly done with lots of information and interactive exhibits.  Quite fascinating and well worth visiting.Have to walk through dockyard which is interesting with lots of photo opportunities.
Absolutely awesome,"I went for the first time last year and wandered around on my own.  I thought it was pretty spectacular then but on this, my 2nd visit, I was part of a group and we had a guided tour.  Without a doubt this makes a tremendous difference.  Putting everything into context adds so much to your understanding and enjoyment.  We are so lucky to have this first rate exhibition on our doorstep.  I'll definitely be back again."
Brilliant museum ,We visited the Mary Rose museum this weekend with our 2 sons aged 8 and 10. We all really enjoyed it. It is good for all age groups. Lots of interactive areas that our sons were really engaged in. They can sometimes get a bit bored in museums but they were totally absorbed in all of the different areas and we ended up staying for 2 hours. We stopped for a meal at the Ship Anson pub afterwards too which I can also recommend. A great day out.
The Mary Rose Experience ,"I went with my wife to the Mary Rose Museum today, and it was totally stunning! It can be seen from  four different levels, looking into the amazing hull. They also shine holographic images into the various areas so that you could see what the sailors etc, were actually doing in that area. The artefacts are absolutely amazing, from shoes, plates , drinking vessels etc. Just superb and I could not fault. People were friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. The final floor you can go to is through an air lock system of doors and you will look down on to the hull in the same environment that it is being kept in. You can loose yourself for hours!"
Visit to HenryV111 warship,"This is an incredible experience visiting the ship that Henry saw sink off Spithead. not only is half the shipon show after being rescued from the seabed, but lasers are shone on various parts to give an idea of what life was like aboard.There is an amazing amount of artefacts brought up from the sea bed in glass cabinets as well as inter active displays for adults and children."
The best trip I've ever been on.,"Our Mary Rose Experience     5/5It was fun! Because we got to dress up as a Tudor there was a sad bit. There was a dog skeleton and I love dogs and I recommend you go there. When I was going to cafeteria, a storm hit and I got wet through.Magnificent Mary Rose!!!The trip was amazing! We saw the Mary Rose which was probably the bit. Whilst walking around the museum, we saw all the artefacts. We saw a skeleton dog which they called Hatch. Hatch’s job on the ship was to chase rats whilst being aboard the ship. Whilst having fun we learnt about the cook of the ship. His name was Ny you will find out more about him if you visit The Mary Rose Museum. The trip was the best one so far, so visit the museum for more facts. Promise you’ll have fun.

Be quick, there are people every day.The Mary Rose    5/5Walk around slowly so you don’t miss anything because it’s really cool! Also on our trip to the Mary Rose, there were lots of guns, knives and cannon’s. But the bad thing was you can’t hear the hologram. I suggest you go because it is cool.

When I walked past the museum, I could just tell by the look of the it, that it was going to be amazing. Walking slowly past the Mary Rose, I could feel what it was like during the war.

It was fun. We went to the window to see the Mary rose, then we went up to floor 2. It was high but not as high as floor 3 so we called the lift. While we were going up, it looked like the Mary rose was shrinking. At floor 3, we could see everything. We went on glass floor. Then we went to the café to have our lunch. Then we went to the workshop and the person’s name was mike. He was nice we wore old clothes. After, we walked back to the bus. Then we got back to the school.                                                                            I would recommend you going to the Mary rose museum.My Mary Rose tour.5/5I had a fantastic trip to the Mary Rose Museum. I like everything about it .Trying on the Tudor clothes was my favourite. I thought the Mary Rose was quite small but it’s not actually. Oh and just saying to the ones that want to try ship biscuits, do not because they’re rock hard. I would want more time at the Museum. So, I had an amazing time at the Mary Rose Museum and would really want to go again and I think you should too.Amazing Trip 5/5As we were walking in, I saw the times of how the Mary Rose sank and came back up. Going down the lift, I saw the three layers of the Mary Rose. As we walked out, I saw some artefacts in the café. I would rather have the Mary Rose closer. I loved the place so why don’t you visit.The Mary RoseI am giving this school trip a 5\5. It tells you about when the Mary Rose was lifted out of the sea. Also, we saw the skeleton of a dog called Hatch and how learnt how he died. I would want more time so I would go again.Mary Rose expedition 5/5On our amazing trip to the Mary Rose, the weather was so bad but when we got to the museum, we met our tour guide.

I recommend you should visit.A taste of the pastI give the Mary Rose trip 4 of 5 because I really liked the skeleton and the stuff from the Tudor times but I did not like that we did not have enough time to eat the ship biscuit. Also, it was cool to see the weapons. I liked wearing the Tudor clothes. I recommend you come to the Mary Rose museum!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Things about the Mary Rose.The best thing that I found out in the museum was seeing the Mary Rose inside.The 2nd best thing about the Trip was seeing all the objects in the Tudor times.I would Rate this 5/5.You better go and see the Mary Rose.HOW AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Our trip to the Mary RoseThe museum was great.

Fantastic experience,The museum has been beautifully constructed around the Mary Rose with many interesting artefacts to view. One of the most impressive places we have visited.
The Marvellous Mary Rose Museum,"The Mysterious Museum We went to the Mary Rose Museum as part of our school trip. On our trip, we went to a workshop where we dressed up as crewmembers and officers. We found out about the differences between officers and crewmembers. We had a guided tour of the Mary Rose and her artefacts. I enjoyed the glass floor because there were many parts of the ship underneath us. I also enjoyed seeing the Mary Rose because it was enormous. I would definitely recommend it because it was an amazing experience for me; make sure you visit the fantastic museum. The Marvellous Mary Rose MuseumWe went to visit the Museum as part of our Year 4 topic. We did a workshop with Tom, which was fantastic, we learnt all about the artefacts and uniforms of crew and officers. Next, we went into the Museum, which was dark to protect the ship. The best part was seeing the Mary Rose on 3 different levels and seeing a real skeleton  Make sure you come to visit, as young to old will find it an amazing experience!An Excellent ExperienceI have been on a school trip to this excellent place. First, we have to do a workshop and we learnt about the lifestyle between the crew and the officers. The officers drank mostly wine and the crewmembers drank beer. A man named Tom, who was extremely knowledgeable, ran the workshop. When we went to the museum, I saw so many fascinating artefacts, they blew my mind. When I saw the Mary Rose, it was much bigger than thought, considering it is only half of the ship that was recovered from the Solent. It was so amazing how much they brought up all the artefacts, and how well preserved they are. Although we are a Year 4 class, I would recommend this place to all ages to come because it is an extremely fun experience, with lots of interactive exhibits.  An Amazing MuseumThe Mary Rose is such an excellent place you must go.First, since we are a school we got to do a Mary Rose workshop where we learnt about the life of the officers and crew on-board the Mary Rose. We looked at artefacts they used it was awesome. Then we got to dress up as officers and crew members it was very funny! then it was lunch. After lunch we got a guided tour round the museum. There were a loads of artefacts on every display. I saw a dog’s skeleton and a human’s skeleton it was incredible although there were hands and feet missing. I can’t believe how large the Mary Rose is love it.I recommend the Mary Rose for all ages (there are lots of interactives too it’s not all behind glass) so please come to the Mary Rose.A Fantastic OpportunityWhen we went to the Mary Rose, we went to a workshop just for schools like us the person talking was say about officers and crewmembers and about the differences between them. I really liked how they had three interesting levels the first 2 levels with many artefacts but the last level was a view of the broken Mary Rose some of my classmates went on the glass floor in the corner. I really like seeing the skeleton of a dog called hatch and a human skeleton of a crew member on board the ship. I also liked the dark hall way through the artefacts that are only for schools so bring you class if you think they will like it I would recommend it for like a birthday or a school trip I would recommend you would like it there are a lot of cool stuff including cool games that involve the Mary Rose. The Tudors Best Ship!On a rainy day, we went to the best museum in the world. Oh wait I am taking about the Mary Rose museum. The ship is gigantic and so cool. The artefacts are so well-preserved they were in could condition when the Mary Rose was discovered. There were 3 levels you could see the Mary Rose. Firstly, we went into a gallery that had things that you can ever imagine. Next, we went on the middle floor and seeing the ship made me want to go on it when it use to battle against French and the Spanish Armanda. After that we when to the bottom floor then the top floor. On the top floor, there was a glass floor and it was like you being in dream. We went to a workshop and the teacher Tom was so nice. We got to dress up as crew and officers. The officers looked so fancy and the crew looked poor. There was even a guided tour to show us all the artefacts and they were sub-zero. That was an amazing place and it is like being in a heaven. I would recommend this for young to old.Glimpse in to History We went to the Mary Rose museum as a school trip and this is what we did…First, we went to the workshop with our helpers Tom and Sophie. We talked about crewmembers and officers and what they did for a living. The officers did nothing and when I say nothing, I mean nothing! The Officers are the richest on the boat. The crewmembers had many jobs like, archery, carpenters and cooks! Then we had lunch, but I do not need to tell you about lunch. Next, we had a glimpse of the museum. We started with a private viewing of some artefacts that only schoolchildren can see! So then we went to the proper museum, it was cool. There was an amazing painting of the Mary Rose with witnesses looking at it sink, it was even made by the Tudors. I would recommend this for all ages that is why I give it 5 stars. I hope you enjoy it if you go.The Museum of MysteriesWhen we went to the Mary rose on are school trip. We were so excited everyone was shouting Mary Rose. When we got inside, we were asked dress up as a crewmember or an officer on the ship. I dressed up and looked like Aladdin it was so funny. We all loved the glass floor even though I hate heights. I loved the air lock doors. Also the big part seeing the Mary Rose was brilliant. You should go 100%.                                        A Fantastic Museum We went on a school trip to the Mary Rose museum and first we went to the workshop and it was about the crew and the officers. We dressed up as officers and crew members, it was so fun! We had a tour of the fantastic museum and we saw some great things like a bow and arrow.I enjoyed walking on the glass floor, it was quite freaky, but it was still really cool. I also enjoyed seeing the Mary Rose because I liked looking at the Mary Rose at the top of the museum it was so fun. I would recommend this museum because I enjoyed the glass floor and the Mary Rose.  The Marvellous Mary Rose Museum.We went to visit the Museum as part of our year 4 topic.

I also liked seeing the Mary rose in real life.I would recommend it 4 because there was so much to do.Best Trip EverOn a rainy day, we went to the amazing, exciting Mary Rose museum because we are studying the Tudors. Firstly, it was the best trip ever! Although I loved it, for some reason my friends were scared because the Museum is dark to protect the ship from natural light. When we arrived, we went to a workshop and learnt about the crew members and officers on the ship. Did you know, the dog who died on the ship is called Hatch because they found his skeleton hidden within a hatch in the carpenter’s room. Have you ever been here before? If not I’ll highly recommend it because the Mary Rose museum it’s very knowledgeable and you will find out a lot. The middle floor of seeing the Mary Rose is ok and the top floor is extreme and you really get a good feel of what the Mary Rose is like. The top floor of the Mary Rose had an airlock door to keep the temperature the same heat so it doesn’t fall down and break.  We all went back down to the first floor and left to go back to school. If you ever come here I hope you enjoy it.A definite see for old and young.                                                        A Must See MuseumWe went on a school trip to the Mary Rose Museum as we are studying the Tudors. First, we did a workshop on how the crew and the officers lived there lives. They live very differently.  Next, you see all the artefacts which have been looked after. After, we saw skeletons of a dog and a human. The dog’s name was hatch because they found the dog’s skeletons under a hatch. They have airlock doors to keep the air and temperature the same. There is three floors and they are all great to see the Mary Rose. Finally, on the third floor there is two glass floors. Although, it was dull and rainy it is an amazing place to go. It is a great place for all ages.    The Magnificent Mary Rose!We went on a school trip to the Mary Rose Museum. We started our day in a workshop with tom, where we learnt the difference between offices and crew. We dressed up and had to find differences on their clothes and what they used. Next, we had a tour around the museum with Jean. We saw real artefacts on the Mary Rose, and best of all the Mary Rose. I enjoyed seeing the Mary Rose and hatch’s skeleton. I also enjoyed walking on the glass floor because there where artefacts underneath. I would recommend this museum because it is an amazing trip.

Then we had a guided tour of the Mary Rose and her artefacts. Did you now that only 50% is left of the Mary Rose?I enjoyed seeing Hatch`s skeleton because he is so cute. Did you now that Hatch was called this because the divers found him in a hatch.I would recommend it a five because there was so much interesting things to see and do. The Wonderful Museum Full of FactsWe went to the Mary Rose on a school trip as part of our Tudor topic.We started our trip with a workshop about the crew and officers and had to match their belongings with labels. We also got to dress up! My favourite part was our guided tour around the museum. It is excellent for people in a wheel chair because it has a lift. There are 3 storeys to see the Mary rose from different angles. I would recommend it because it has so many interesting facts.The Amazing Mary Rose!We went to the Mary Rose museum for our school trip. Next, we went to a workshop with Tom and we were exploring the lifestyle between officers and crew.

The Officers have very fancy clothes and the crew have clothes made of leather. Then, we went to the museum and we saw Hatch’s skeleton and Hatch as a normal dog. Then we walked around the section that we ware on and we saw some interesting things. I would recommend this museum because it is interesting. The Amazing Mary Rose MuseumWe went on a school trip to the Mary Rose museum for our topic. When we got there, we did a workshop with our helper Tom who told us the lifestyle differences between a crew member and an officer the officer is richer than the crew because they get payed more. We also found out that the crew wore leather and the officers wore single and gold. Then we went with Jeanne who took us round the museum and showed us the part that is left. We also found out that a dog, called Hatch, went down with the ship he was found in a hatch and now his skeleton in the amazing museum with all the artefacts. I would recommend this museum because it is amazing, young, and old to learn lots."
A mixed review of a great museum,"Well, I am a local and I visit the Mary Rose Museum quite often. It is the only Tudor shipwreck that I know of anywhere, and its collection is fantastic, and well worth seeing, regardless of the admission cost.However, I was not aware that guided tours cost more than the standard admission, and was annoyed to be shooed away from a guided tour, even though it was not busy when I visited. Regardless, this is still one not to miss."
Tudor History,History come to life. A must see...Great access and lifts to 3 floors. So much information. Been here 4 times. Great view to the 2 aircraft carriers in Portsmouth Harbour too.
Beautiful,Having watched the raising of the Mary Rose many years ago as a child I was keen to actually see this museum. It did not disappoint. The whole thing has been done superbly and so very informative. A really fabulous place to visit.
Incredible,It’s absolutely incredible to see the wreckage of the Mary Rose after nearly 450 years under the sea. Excellent display of artefacts that they managed to salvage too - really clear and interesting descriptions. One star off because it is very pricey so would likely hinder some families from coming to see it - there is a discount if you book online however and we managed to get extra discount that they were running throughout January
Fantastic,An amazing experience for our 9 year old grandson. He had so many questions and observations he obviously was interested in depth
AMAZING ,The Mary Rose was spectacular! It completely surprise me on how interactive the tour was. Also the volunteers were wonderful they definitely knew their knowledge & they were very passionate about what they did.
Prepare to have your expectations raised! ,"Having visited the Mary Rose years ago, it is nice to finally see it displayed and protected as it always should have been! The new museum is quite simply fantastic and a real gem when it comes to explaining the history of the ship, it’s life and also the lives of the crew that sailed on her! Using effective and sophisticated interactive technology along side costumes actors and informers, the museum brings to life what is otherwise quite a heavy subject and presents it in a way that is easy to digest and also understand. Exhibits and displays are a plenty but the real jewel is the ship itself which you have to see to believe, it is quite simply mesmerising and unbelievable. I didn’t take photos as I didn’t have time to and I was distracted you the scale of the thing! Also photos don’t do it justice, it’s one of those things you have that we with your own eyes! Highlights and plus points Perfect for anyone interested in history Interactive and never dull Informers and staff and amazing and well informed Good shop The ship itself Negative points I imagine in peak season it will get busy and some if the rooms could crowd up quickly Overall, You have to see this to believe it, and for anyone who has a smidgen of interest in English or nautical history should come and see it!"
Mary Rose,"This is a visit not to be missed! This incredible ship is on public view in a specially built museum to accomodate the different stages of preservation. The staff are very helpful, friendly & willing to answer your questions. There are a couple of lifts which give you panoramic views of the ship. There is a well stocked shop, cafe & toilets. As the museum is a bit of a walk a buggy is available to carry visitors from the ticket office to the museum."
Illuminating,"This is a must visit museum. Presentation of artifacts, information and insight into the lives and origins of the crew is marvellous. The genetic work is a revelation.You can even pull a yew bow.We will return."
The place to immerse yourself in Tudor history,This was number one on my bucket list for years and I finally realized my dream last October.  This museum and the ship did not disappoint.  The ship itself takes your breath away.  The addition of holograms projected into rooms on the ship was beyond imagination.  The artifacts were not always just pieces of an object; you could view the entire object as so much of what was on the ship was buried and protected under centuries of silt after she went down.  I spent the day and it was not enough.  Luckily tickets will allow you to return to the museum as many times as you want for one year after your first time.  So save your ticket.
"Very interesting, hard to do all in one trip!","An interesting visit, amazing artefacts beautifully preserved. Staff were very knowledgeable too, we spoke to a volunteer who explained the drying process and moisture monitors, very informative. We found we couldn’t fit it all in in one trip so returned later in the year. The fact they only do annual passes now came in handy!"
Day at the museum,"Can’t speak highly enough definitely worth the entrance fee,  can’t wait to go back ...staff knowledgeable and friendly ...it a must see"
Amazing,"Loved this place!!We visited with our 9 and 11 year old, they loved the museum. My wife and I found the place very informative. We both remembered watching the Mary Rose being raised as kids, so to see it in person was great.4 floors of displays are in the museum all over looking the wreck of the ship. The displays are very informative and interesting. On each floor there is a museum staff member with a table full of artifacts to explain there uses to visitors."
Mother’s treat,"WOW what a fantastic way to see history, from the ship to the smallest artefact.Even our kids got into the history and were fascinated.Well worth the visit"
Great must do attraction ,"The Mary rose museum is a must see attraction in Portsmouth, everything is easy to see and well laid out , it can you hours to see everything but well worth it , the film show inside the wreak is amazing, and the reconstruction of the sailors is awesome, amazing to think the wreak is so old and there in front of you. Could not fault whole visit"
Disappointed by Terms & Conditions!,"My brother very generously bought my wife and myself tickets for the Historic Dockyard and the Mary Rose Museum for Christmas 2018. We had thoroughly enjoyed our first visit to the dockyard and the Mary Rose museum in January 2019 and have visited the dockyard many times since. Before the year tickets ran out we thought we would make a second visit to the Mary Rose Museum only to be told that we should have read the Ts & Cs as unlike the Historic Dockyard admission ticket which starts the year when first used the Mary Rose ticket starts the year when it is first bought, a difference of 1 month in our case.Very disappointed with the attitude of the “manager” we spoke to who seemed to think that everybody should read the small print and had no sympathy with our mistake.You have been warned!We won’t be returning."
Awesome,I am in awe of the incredible results that were attained by this project and the artefacts that have been preserved in this Museum. I could have spent days looking around here if my legs would have lasted.
Fab,We got off the ferry and had a great half a day here! Lots of ways to interact with this museum and the icing on the cake was Henry VIII himself! We all learned loads. Definitely worth the £30 family ticket!
Incredibly interesting museum,"Beautifully displayed portion (about half) of the Mary Rose. The three story display was magnificent. Thousands of relics from the wreck and an amazing story on its reclamation. Docents were very knowledgeable and engaging. Amazing to see things like rulers, backgammon boards and leather shoes from 1545!"
Mary Rose Tudor Christmas ,We decided to visit for the Tudor Christmas as we had visited during the Festival of Christmas and obtained £5 tickets.The whole experience was delightful. The ship and museum is displayed so well and it is fascinating to hear the story of the ship.Even though the Christmas event is for children myself and my partner and my two adult daughters had a fascinating time listening to and interacting with Henry VIII.I would recommend the museum and the festive events to everyone.
Christmas Experience,"We went as a couple for the Christmas Experience on the 14th December. And it was so worth the money!We were met at the front of the museum by Josephene, who took our coats and bags to look after, and Tony the peasant (dressed very appropriately), who has such a vast knowledge of the Mary Rose and her history. He talked us through every part of the museum; the exhibits and the ship herself. I remember the raising of the Mary Rose back in the 80s, but didn't know much about her sinking. The museum itself is well laid out, with information everywhere about the exhibits, the history and the hands-on area where you can see if you can draw a longbow, or feel the weight of a mail shirt - which I can tell you is very heavy! The gift shop is also surprisingly good value. There is also a café and toilets on hand.Tony gave us a guided tour of the Mary Rose museum, briefly going ""backstage"" and even handling some replicas and an actual piece of the Mary Rose herself. We then had some mince pies, mulled wine and nibbles, whilst being regaled with stories by the king, Henry VIII himself, who posed with us for photos and gave us a Christmas present each afterwards.We learnt so much from Tony, and thoroughly enjoyed the day. It was so well organised, and we even had a free annual pass with the event.No, it wasn't the cheapest afternoon, but would we do it again? You bet! It was totally worth the price and we wouldn't hesitate to recommend this event - and indeed the museum - to anyone interested in the Mary Rose. It was well catered for, even having options for my food allergies (which isn't the case everywhere). We can't wait to return!"
Simply Superb ,"Wow, this must rate amongst the UK's best designed and managed museums. I'd visited the Mary Rose when she was still undergoing major preservation, and the museum was in its infancy. It was good even then, but the way it has developed, the thought that's gone into the design of the three levels of viewing galleries, and the many exhibits, is jaw-droppingly brilliant. Lots to see and no rush. You take your time and can fully appreciate the very well thought out exhibits. The whole story of the ship, and every aspect of how her crew lived in and fought in her is superbly told. I've never seen better. To be honest, I've never seen anything that comes close to how good it is.There were also plenty of knowledgeable staff and volunteers to assist in any way they could. They weren't intrusive in any way, just available if we had questions. For example, the have-a-go longbow archery section. It was also good that they've got things you can touch, rather than just looking. Even the souvenier shop was exceptional. Not your usual imported junk items, but some really unique things that have a connection to the Mary Rose. I bought a leather drinking tankard. Well done the Mary Rose museum, staff, volunteers, and designers. A big thank you,Rick"
Wow. Just Wow,"Having read all the reviews and press coverage I just had to see what the fuss was about. WOW. thats all I can say. If you are a local, you must visit."
Great day out - so much to see!,"A really worth while visit. Wonderful for adults and older children. Genuine artifacts. More so then the HMS Victory which I also recommend . One ticket of £18 will give you entry for 12 months. Don’t want to spoil the surprises in store when you do go there, but needless to say you will be taken back in time and pleasantly surprised. A great bit of history on our doorstep. Preserved and genuine by some very caring and dedicated staff."
A jaw-dropping experience,"After a welter of interesting introductory features we went into the main museum area. I cannot remember another occasion when my breath was literally 'taken away' and I stood there transfixed. This is perhaps the most extrordinary place I have ever had the pleasure of visiting. You are taken back several centuries to learn and see how mariners lived and died in the sixteenth century. The detail is beyond belief.  Master gunners, master carpenters and master cooks are brought to life. The presentation is outstanding. This is a 'museum' that all others must live up to. Do not miss this amazing spectacle on any account. You will not be sorry you went."
Overdue visit,We meant to visit the museum years ago but never got around to it. What a mistake. We were amazed at the quality of the whole experience and the history that came to life. I've been dragged around many museums (and art galleries) and this is the only one I regret not seeing earlier. Well done to all staff.
Amazing,"We went to a light up session. The exhibits are well laid out, the staff on hand are knowledgeable and will answer any questions very worthwhile to gets a true snapshot in time."
Visit to the Mary Rose,"This is possibly one of the very best museums we have ever visited.  The layout is interesting, with lots of interactive features (Buttons to press and quizzes to play).  We were there about three hours and the time flew by.  The actual ship is utterly fascinating.  The little vignettes of life on board were so good.  All in all excellent."
Fabulous piece of history,"I have visited the Mary Rose twice now. I still can not believe the sheer volume of work done in getting this amazing piece of history back to the surface and in a position to be shared with the public.Yes you have to pay extra to visit her, but the work involved with keeping the Mary Rose in the condition she is without any further deterioraton must cost millions. The ticket costs around £15 I think. But for that you can visit every day for 12 months if you wish. There is not much else you can do for £15 for a whole year.I can not beleive that some folk have left a 1 star for this on the grounds of it being ""boring"" or ""poorly lit"". This attraction is an actaul piece of history from hundreds of years ago, We are privaliged to be able to experience things like this. Great work guys I look forward to visiting again soon"
Excellent displays,"Really enjoyed our visit. Good access for all, lifts as needed.Main hall superb with great lighting and displayed artefacts Allow four hours at least. We stopped half way though, got coffee at the little shop, and carried on 10/10"
Our visit here,"Visited the museum in May 2019, and looked at this fabulous British war ship. Its a stunning testament to the British Navy, plus the museum has painfully brought it back to life."
Mary Rose Museum,A fascinating museum and so much to see! The wreck and the thousands of exhibits are so beautifully presented
Mary Rose,Excellent museum with extensive interesting artefacts. Well worth a visit.May sure you allow plenty of time to enjoy such a big chunk of Henry 8's history. 3 hours may cover it!
An amazing place.,We have just returned from an amazing visit to the Mary Rose Museum. There is so much to see. The layout and the detailed information was fantastic. We have visited several times in the past but this is the visit time we have seen the ship when it was not being sprayed. A huge thank you to all the clever people who have conserved this icon of our past and all the informative staff who made a visit so pleasant.
Excellent day out,What a brilliant place and the volunteers are fantastic so knowledgeable and enthusiastic. Well worth a cost
Well designed museum ,Perfect setting for the remains of the Mary Rose. Particularly liked that artifacts were placed opposite where they would have been on the ship and there were 3 levels.
A wonderful experience,"The building made expecially to house the MaryRose, is perfect, it enables you to experience life aboard, showing holograms of crew on various stages of the battle etc. Artifacts also presented well, a must see."
"Informative and interesting, amazing!",This is a great tour which we found fascinating. Lots of artifacts and very atmospheric. Take your time and enjoy it!
Always wanted to see,"We had always wanted to visit this museum. I remember watching the raising of this historic ship many years ago on TV. As we had an event to go to the next day in Portsmouth, we decided to make a weekend visit and visit include a visit to this museum. It will take around two hours to take in all the exhibits properly done prepared. The adult ticket cost £18 each, but on reflection we’ll worth the money considering the history and interest in such exhibits. There were plenty of age related interactive elements such as dressing up in costume for children, to the videos showing the recovery from the seabed."
It couldn’t be clearer that customer service need to improve ,"We arrived at the Mary Rose shortly after 10.30 with our pre-purchased tickets for the Mary Rose museum. Upon arriving, we were told that because of the Christmas experience, we were unable to use the tickets for this specific day. The customer service team were unable to sufficiently answer our enquiries about the lack of clarity on the website around this. After speaking to four members of staff ( and a representative on the phone), we were told it ‘couldn’t be clearer’ that this was clearly stated on the website and in the terms and conditions. This was a joke as one particular member of staff was unable to find the terms and conditions on the mobile  site on which we had purchased the tickets. The whole debacle was further backed up by the arrival of no less that five other sets of  customers with the same problem. No member of staff was able to see the problem that whilst the Christmas experience was referred to on the website as ‘around the start of December’, the lack of date was problematic for those travelling a distance to this exhibit. The whole farce was further worsened when we were originally told (numerous times) that we could not have a refund (we later received one) and that nothing could be done. At no point did the customer service team and staff tell us that the Christmas experience ticket was, in fact, an excellent deal. The smarmy attitude of one particular member of staff was of particular annoyance who was only rescued by a much more professional member staff. After we and others secured a refund the MR museum was indeed superb, a complete contrast to the the inadequate customer service that continued for around an hour. An excellent historic visit with a shocking customer experience."
Worth a journey ,"28,000 dives in total to retrieve half the ship and a huge collection of equipment that was on board.  It’s all very well displayed apart from a number of very low and poorly lit information cards. Also, it’s helpful to know before entering that there are regular short film shows on and around the wreck itself.  There’s no advance information on this, and it could be missed.Very helpful staff though, and overall a hugely informative display. Probably best to allow at least three hours."
Very informative,"Very impressed with the Mary rose exhibit these days. Engaging for both young and old with all the artefacts, information and interactive screen. It really gives you and in-depth in sight into the goings on on the Mary rose and the people aboard her. Lift and stirs access to all levels so can be enjoyed by everyone."
Amazing !!!,It is unbelievable!! The work involved to set the site up was extremely well thought through and no doubt there were a lot of people involved - guides are extremely helpful - it is excellent for disabled people with the different levels and lifts - well worth a visit.
Visit,Went there today with my wife spent 3hours in this museum it is well worth a visit plenty of things to see it’s really brilliant and when you buy your tickets they are valid for a whole year .
Superb,"This was probably the best museum I have ever been to. Staff were knowledgeable and helpful. The number of different areas of expertise in the team over the years was huge, and the insights into all aspect of creating the displays were fascinating. A cultural cornucopia - and no rush to go round (unlike the Victory tour!). We spent over 3 hours there, and could have done it again. As an ex-teacher, I was particularly impressed with one guide exciting a bunch of primary school kids with great stories. Wonderful!!"
An absolute must see!!!,"We went to the museum for a day, but there is so much to see and to absorb that another day was really needed to be able to take it all in.Adults and children alike will love it.We were so fortunate to go during the school break as the most marvelous actor was there taking the part of Henry V111.He gave a talk about the sinking of the Mary Rose and completely brought the account to life. All ages were totally absorbed.  He was so witty, and drew everyone into the story. - So would certainly recommend a trip during the school holidays.The recovered artifacts were astonishing.Overall, a most unforgettable experience and will certainly go back again."
Remarkable restoration project,Well worth the visit during our recent trip to Portsmouth.  We spent many reivetting hours at the venue - well worth a long visit.
Terrific museum,"My 11 year old son and I had a great trip to this excellent museum, very much enhanced by a private tour (£10 pp) with Bob who showed us all the highlights and really brought the ship to life. Thoroughly recommended. You could spend days there!"
Stunningly Moving Experience,"The museum is much more than the reconstructed starboard side of the ship. The 19,000 artifacts recovered from the wreck under the seabed give visitors a unique perspective into the Tudor world. Wood and leather simply don't survive through the centuries, unless they've been buried under sea silt for 450 years.Rather than simply displaying masses of artifacts in cases, this museum places them in the ship locations where they were found. That is, objects from the surgeon's cabin are in one display case, objects from the carpenter's cabin are in another, etc. And although the identities of most of the men who served on the doomed ship are unknown, the museum has done admirable work in reconstructing as much as can be known about them, based on their personal possessions.Combined, a visit is stunningly moving. Highly recommended."
Great experience,Riveting experience.  Thoroughly enjoyable visit.  The visitor centre is so well presented.  We spent longer than expected as it was so interesting.
Back to Tudor Times,"History isn’t my thing but this museum was amazing. We spent nearly 4hours here. Helpful, friendly staff who are full of information. Carefully preserved ship and contents. The smell of the wood is evocative of her short life as King Henry’s flagship. Worth every penny of the entrance fee. Loved it."
"Awesome, fascinating exhibition - brings history alive",This is a brilliantly produced time machine that takes you back to the time of Henry VIII and his doomed flagship. Marvelous detail in every corner and friendly experts on hand eager to help and answer any questions
The Mary Rose Museum visit,"We visited the Mary Rose Museum during the autumn half-term holidays with our 9 year old.  ""Horrible Histories"" was there.  Two excellent actors, one as Henry VIII and one as a Tudor rat catcher certainly added a very vibrant dimension to our visit and brought the whole ""time capsule experience"" even more to life.  They were so entertaining and informative (and even funny too!).  Beware - don't get on the wrong side of them though, especially Henry VIII - his character is a 'dead ringer' for the original, you might lose your head!"
Mary Rose Ship,Absolutely brilliant. Amazing exhibition and lots of very interesting artifacts and information. A must do!!
Glad we did it,"Were here for the Victory but as we were there, thought we should do it.The ship remains are impressive to look at so well worth going if you are in the area"
Excellent museum but disappointed over price ,"This an excellent museum, very well thought out with knowledgeable staff on hand throughout your visit. The admission price is fairly expensive especially when you add up the cost of a family. What is disappointing however is that the Mary Rose museum has taken an independent stance against all the other museums in the historic dockyard. They even have their own entrance way. Very disappointed to find out you have to pay double to see the Victory which is next door."
What a difference!,"We last visited when the Mary Rose was still wet, covered in a fine mist and in a basic building. Now it is dry and looks magnificent!  The displays of all the artifacts are fascinating and the staff are great and know everything!  Tou will need around 3 hours to see it all.  There is a nice little cafe on the ground floor"
Very Educational,"The museum is huge compared to what it looks like on the outside! Loads of artefacts, stories and information. The staff were very knowledgable and helpful as well.As the museum goes on it gets a bit ‘same old’ after a while, especially for younger children with shorter attention spans."
Wow. That is all,This is a breath-taking museum which is up with the best of the best I've ever exhibited. Seeing the Mary Rose brought tears to the eyes and the whole experience is one to recommend to all.
Magical,"I'm old enough to remember watching on television, the searches and the eventual raising of The Mary Rose.Never in a zillion years did I imagine I would stand so close to her.This is a truly brilliant, amazing, fascinating, informative and yes, AMAZING Museum. It's not a museum as of old.  It's a museum of the future using modern technology to take us back in time in a way that invites us in, making us look for more.Huge credit to the archaeologists and the designers, who have worked for decades to be able to take us back so far in time and tell the stories of real people.As you go round and up and down and stop to look and listen to the wonderful audo-visual exhibits, there's something for all ages.   And in the cafe....the coffee tastes of coffee!It's not to be missed."
Very informative ,"A real dip into the history of the navy in Tudor times, a great education on how the sailors lived and died. Great individual stories with the help of DNA. Great value for money which hopefully helps fund further research."
History coming alive,The Mary Rose is in a purpose built museum and the ship itself has been exhibited so that you get a real feel for the Tudor Navy.  One visit is not enough so we will be going back again soon.
The mary rose museum,What an amazing day out absolutely fabulous we spent 3 hours here and we could have spent the entire day it's amazing you see the ship (what's left) the items bought to the surface the skeletons including a dog called hatch really enjoyed it please please I urge anyone who reads this to go and enjoy the history
Quite dark,Third visit. Went to see the Many Faces of Tudor England. Walkways in main museum are pitch black so it is impossible to see who you have gone with and seem to me to be unsafe. Also difficult to see exhibits due to light levels.
Excellent new exhibition,"Third visit. Went to see the 'Many Faces of Tudor England' exhibition based on the recent television programme, which has excellent and popular.My overwhelming impression of the main museum however is that it is ridiculously dark, almost to the point of being unsafe on the walkways. It is difficult to see one's hand in front of one's face, and impossible to recognise the person one has gone with, such that you walk past them. It's so dark it's difficult to see the exhibits in the cases."
Really informative,Had a fantastic visit to the Mary Rose museum. It took us more than 2 hours to look at all the exhibits and we could have spent longer. Great to be able to visit again later in the year with the annual pass
Absolutely Fantastic !,So much here to see you will need to return. Loved the ‘people’ exhibits which showed items relating to various people on the ship. Amazing remains considering the years under the sea. Would liked to have had more seats around just to sit and soak in the atmosphere and rest ‘older’ legs. Will certainly return.
Fantastic exhibition - not to be missed,"I had never seen the Mary Rose and had no real expectation.  But - the exhibition was fantastic.  Brilliantly and creatively developed and exhibited, it had clearly taken lots of commitment and dedication, and money, to reveal this beautiful artefact and its 28,000 treasures so far brought to the surface and restored.  It's fascinating to see the evidence of advancing technology and the impact it has had on archelogical finds.  Ironically, the way the specialisation is going, digging up stuff is no longer favoured.  There are some very clever VR videos superimposed on the ship every few minutes:  it would be so different were the whole experience VR rather than the real thing !The displays are detailed and fascinating if sometimes a little excessive:  there is so much to take in at once.  Perhaps another visit soon would be the best option ?A curious fact recalled from the exhibits: there were the remains of only three rats found.  Was this because the Ship's Dog (his skeleton is on display) was superbly  effective ?"
Dark by necessity ,It’s a fantastic building and exhibition. It gave us detailed examination of skeletal remains and much more. It must have taken an immense amount of work (and money) by many to achieve this special museum. I think it was all worth it as it brings alive the history of King Henry VIII’s flagship. Not so successful a ship in battle in its time as you’d think only it’s all we have left to teach us how life aboard was in that time. It does that in spectacular fashion with all the original artefacts on display and the video of life aboard projected up against the ruins of the ship. PS We loved the ship’s dog skeleton:-)
Weekend away,"I came here last weekend with my partner mind dad who were over from the Czech Republic. When we arrived in Portsmouth at 3pm we went straight to the Mary rose ship, we had bought a full navy ticket but this was not included in it, you have to pay for it seperately, Which I thought was a lot of money. We was really impressed, loved the ship and loved the museum, we was overwhelmed with the museum it was amazing. Lots to see and lots of history. It’s clearly looked after and you can see that. Had a drink in the coffee shop then we left. Would definitely recommend d to go."
Fascinating,We have been 3 times and never cease to be amazed by the exhibition. Fantastic layout and so much to absorb. Have recommended it several times to friends - and we are all grown-ups - for children it is awesome and cannot wait until the grandchildren are old enough as an excuse to go more often. Nice café too!
Cool airlock system with the doors on each level! And our eyes adjusted quickly to the blue light! Loved it!,"It is a truly unique and amazing display of English Maritime history! I’ve never seen anything like it! I thought the entry and exit system with the airlock doors was fantastic! It's an essential yet uncomplicated way to control the ship’s temperature and humidity while under preservation while allowing visitors to see her in all her glory! Wow! Your eyes soon adjust in the blue light. Very cool the way you walk back and forth across the various levels. My only complaint is the confusion in exiting or getting to the bathrooms. The intermediate levels and round-the-corner access to some corridors are confusing. I was also hoping for a larger selection in the gift shop. The Mary Rose was definitely the most memorable experience in Portsmouth’s historic dockyard!If you found anything in my review helpful, thanks heaps for your vote!"
Third visit,"This was our third visit to the Mary Rose , it is the first time that we had to pay seperate from the Victory , looking at the the near empty Mary Rose ticket office and the full all in one Dockland ticket  office I think it might be a mistake to charge seperate , having said that we realley enjoyed our visit again , I must say that we thought that £9 for two cups of tea and a cheese and pickle sandwich was a bit dear ."
Very well organised group trip of 25 people  - great experience,"A company team group of 25 visited and had a great experience, good museum highly recommended everyone enjoyed themselves."
Fantastic ,Wow. What an amazing exhibition. And the tickets can be used over the next 12 months. We probably spent two hours walking around. The whole story is amazing. Would easily go back for another visit
Amazing,A museum that has been built to capture our imagination of what it must have been like to be on the ship the day it sank. Love the layout as if walking along the decks of the Mary Rose. It is not the cheapest place to get in but as far as I am concerned it was worth every penny.
Superb,"We decided to visit the Mary Rose Museum and were very impressed. If in Portsmouth, this is a must. Highly recommended"
Excellent but very expensive,"This museum is fantastic. The Mary Rose is incredible, and the wealth of artefacts from the tudor period is so impressive and interesting. I could have spent the whole day there. The guides who work there were great. One guide who was a marine archaeologist from Southampton University sat with my daughter on the floor and talked her through some interesting facts about the Mary Rose. It was so kind of her to take the time, and my daughter had a new interest in marine archaeology afterwards. However, I have dropped a star because of the cost. This museum effectively restricts access for people on lower incomes. The Mary Rose ticket must be bought separately from the tickets for the rest of the dockyard; and a ticket to the Mary Rose won't keep the young ones entertained for the entire day. I only took one of my kids, and spent nearly 70 pounds to see just HMS Victory and the Mary Rose. Family tickets are available if I had brought the whole family, but still the prices are eye-watering."
Very interesting visit,Excellent visit. This is British history not to be missed! Lady who was sat near the bows and arrows was very informative of the articles on her table.Good interactive displays and articles.
Mixed feelings about it,Ok it’s a huge part of our history and the displays are really well put together. That’s about it really. Maybe turn the lights up and  have more interactive displays
The Mary Rose Museum - A Step Back in Time,"It has been some while since we first experienced the magnificence of The Mary Rose.  It was still being washed and preserved following its resurfacing.It is now tastefully and cleverly presented in all its glory with incredible displays of artefacts recovered from in and around the ship.The management and staff are clearly multi-tasking to keep costs of preserving and presenting the ship and artefacts under strict control.  Management are tasked with raising money and it does require fairly substantial sums and their efforts should be applauded.We were expecting perhaps a 1 hour tour maybe a little longer.  We actually spent 4 hours and felt that we could easily have spent longer.I highly recommend that all children should be given the opportunity of visiting the exhibition, as part of their history education and cultural development.  Grandparents and Parents will find it an absorbing and enjoyable experience.  Plan to visit and if possible, stopover locally so that you can maximise the experience"
Amazed,Visited the old museum a number of times. The new museum is absolutely world class and we are amazed it’s in the city we live in. Shame there isnt even one visit included in the all dockyard pass and that you have to pay a separate fee for the Mary rose. It’s a great place for all the family and a part of the city’s history. Fab!
Mary Rose,"So many interesting things to see.  Couldn’t manage it all in one visit, had to go back another time but well worth it.  Fascinating,"
Southampton visit,I visited the Mary Rose for the first time since it had stopped being ‘sprayed’. The whole visit was very interesting and the special effects were superb. The only criticism is that there was no audio guide which I feel could have made the visit better
More Than Just A Shipwreck,"Wow. an amazing time capsule of historical significance; preserved naturally for over four hundred years, raised from the deep and preserved for future generations. Thereby adding a wealth of new information to a nation that has already recorded a rich tapestry of land-based knowledge and achievements of Tudor England. Fabulously restored and presented. with many artefacts restored and stored to present in future years. This will be of interest to those of all age groups, this will tempt the visitor to come again and again to update his or her knowledge. Set aside at least half a day for your first visit there is a lot to see. I have been back twice now for two full days and still finding new material of interest. Fascinating, unique family friendly day out so said all our family group.  8 boy,10 girl, 39 dad, 42 mum, 68 grandad and 69 grandma years old respectively."
Amazing story,The story of the Mary Rose and how it was salvaged after hundreds of years at the bottom of the Channel is fascinating.  The museum is so well done!   It’s amazing to see how the silt that covered half the ship preserved even fabrics!   The way they present the history of the different crew members is very interesting.  I highly recommend this attraction in Portsmouth.
The historic Dockyard,"We Went to the festival of Christmas and saw the Mary Rose exhibition, it was a throughly good day .That stands and exhibitions were Good.The atmosphere really set off Christmas."
Unique slice of history,Loved the layout of the museum.  Lots to see.  Well done displays.  Great for the whole family.  Lots of helpful staff.  Stepping back in time to see this slice of history.  Loved it!
Unique and Fascinating,"There's a lot to see, so will take a day to really see everything. It was the weekend, so quite a few families, and they seemed to really enjoy it too as there's plenty of information delivered in different ways to engage all ages. Highly recommended"
Great family day out,"A real piece of history. One of the absolute highlights was the actor playing King Henry VIII and giving a 20-25 minute talk about the sinking, etc. He was really entertaining and it's a shame to hear that he's not a regular feature of the museum. I guess he was there because it was half term but really he was at least as entertaining for the adults as for the kids!"
The latest update with the new animation schemes is more than AWESOME,After following the work on the Mary Rose - from watching the lift from the seabed during my work breaks; to now seeing this amazing transformation - is incredible.This is a must to do visit - a once in a life time experience. The restored artefacts and the way they are displayed makes you feel you know exactly what it was like aboard the Mary Rose.
An amazing day,Wow! What can I say about this fabulous exhibition....except that it is the best one I have ever been to. It was incredibly well thought out and the artefacts were amazing. All the  painstaking work to bring the Mary Rose up and the subsequent cataloguing of the things were evident. We spend over two and a half hours there and only had to leave as it was closing time. Will certainly go again to see the things I missed. There also was a Henry 8th look alike and his talk was very amusing as well as being informative
Very interesting,"Excellent and informative displays, which we found very interesting. Some staff were dressed in costume, and were friendly and ready to answer questions.Cafe had limited choice, but was ok for a quick snack."
Great Museum,"No wonder this is an award winning museum. I loved the way the finds were layed out, in order with the decks on which they were found and the stories of specific people. The wide variety of artificacts are amazing. I recommend this museum"
Incredible ,"This is just amazing.The atmosphere here just takes you back to a time gone by. They have done such an incredible job here, I would recommend anyone to visit here at least once."
Spectacular Attraction,This attraction is fantastic for anyone who is interested in history. When looking at her it’s absolutely unbelievable how the engineers brought her to the surface and back to the docks at Portsmouth. The building she is housed in is extremely well designed and there are so many exhibits on display that were found with the Mary Rose. Watching the TV coverage of raising the Mary Rose brought so many memories back of that time and my heart still stopped when one of the airbags burst! Brilliant attraction and worth the extra entrance fee.
Great to see ! ,For a family that are not known for our love of history we all really enjoyed our visit. Both my husband and I remember the TV coverage of raising the Mary Rose from our childhood and it was fascinating to see it. The talk by Henry VIII was also really interesting and informative and cleverly delivered to all age groups. So glad we went.
Amazing,"Fantastic. Thank you to the staff. We were very lucky to be the first in on the 1st November. We had period dressed guides, explaining everything about the Mary Rose. My daughter has recently seen Six the musical. Great fun sharing the music with guides. I’ve now visited the Mary Rose 3 times since it went on show. By far this is the best visit I’ve had. Brilliant keep history alive."
Breath taking,"It is unbelievable that a ship that sank 75 years before the Mayflower set sail for America and was raised 5 years after Elvis died can be viewed. I was completely in awe of the engineers etc that brought her to the surface and the team that treated and preserve her to this day. It's not just the ship herself but the many personal artifacts that are on display that make this a must see exhibition, in my view."
Great modern museum,Visited the Mary rose during half term with the family - 3 children aged 4 to 9 years old. It’s a separate ticket compared to the rest of the dockyard but is very much worth the visit. A treasure trove of 16th century history with modern exhibits and a well laid out route to follow.As it was half term- there was an activity trail for the kids and a Henry VII actor giving a 30min talk.The talk and the actor were excellent.Cafe was a bit small - so was full so we had to go elsewhere.
Wonderful experience at The Mary Rose museum,"This has been on the list of must sees for a long time and we were certainly not disappointed by the day. Bought tickets online prior to starting out and would recommend you doing the same as we sailed through the ticket queue on arrival. Parking was straightforward in a large enclosed multi storey only a short walk from the historic docks.The museum was one of the best I have seen and enhances the overall experience. It is amazing how many artefacts have been recovered and beautifully presented in the three museum levels. They have tried to personalise some of the displays (cook, carpenter, Archer, purser) etc and you get a tremendous window into their everyday lives. The centre piece is of course the ship's remains and they are beautifully presented, carefully lit with accompanying sound and action projections to enhance the effect. Even the viewing walkway is curved up at each end as if you were walking the actual ship's deck.This makes a fantastic day out for children. We went in school half term and it was lovely to see the children's attention held by what they saw and heard. If you have any eating allergies such as gluten intolerance, may be best to take a packed lunch.BTW, you walk pass HMS Victory on the way to the museum, but that's for another day!"
Awesome,For me there are no words to describe this historical beast!Took my breath away... can still visualise it now in all its beauty.Absolutely worth a visit!
A good day out ,"I thoroughly enjoyed the museum, it was a very well thought out and laid forcing you to wander through. The museum charted the history of the Mary Rose, King Henry the eighth’s flag ship. Lots of exhibits as the museum takes you through the history and the found artefacts.  A good place to take kids or adults that are interested in history. Especially those children who are interested in ships and pirates.   Would not be the best place to go with small children below the ages of six. The exhibits found, and the story that the museum tells is incredibly well done. The museum walkways mirror image the walkways of the Mary Rose. The construction of the museum gives you a real insight to what life must have been like aboard. Very well done. I would thoroughly recommend it!"
Great experience,"Lots to see here if you are primarily in to history.We enjoyed this ,a group of us went and certainly were not disappointed!We also took a harbour trip and saw plenty of naval boats.A good day out"
"Absolutely stunning, Extraordinary value.","Superb exhibition, not crowded as it would be in London. Many helpful characters to explain the exhibits."
Just incredible,"We spent an amazing afternoon here and can not recommend it highly enough, absolutely fascinating, so much to learn and explore. And huge thanks to our guide “Friday Tony” for an unforgettable tour. Can recommend the Premium Pass if you want to push the boat out!"
Pity about the lighting,"This museum has a wonderful range of objects on display and the ship itself is stunning. But the overall experience is marred by the low level lighting in the display galleries. While this may be necessary for the ship's delicate fabric, the rest of the displays would be more accessible in better lighting. The route through the museum is confusing.  The initial video is uninformative - a more general video intro would be most useful. I hope they will be able to make improvements to a museum that has some stunning exhibits and huge potential to bring alive the period of history represented by the Mary Rose as well as the amazing efforts to raise the ship and identify those on board."
Brilliant experience,"Wonderfully presented,  incredible to see all the artefacts explained so well - but seeing the actual ship,  especially when you get to the top and you're in the airlock without glass between you and the wreck,  was awe-inspiring. We spent just over an hour here."
Unbelievable,"Even though I had read, heard and seen so much about this exhibition, I was still blown away by the actuality. To have recovered so many artefacts in such pristine condition seems incredible and we are so lucky that it gives us a true recollection of sea life during Tudor times."
Fantastic museum,"We visited October 2019 with two children (9&5), the visit lasted about 2.5 hours.The museum is wonderful, loved the projections onto the hull of the ship showing how life would have been when the Mary Rose was sailing.The staff were so friendly and helpful and answered all our questions.Plenty to do for the children, they loved the rat catcher trail/ dress up/ colouring / bow shooting etc Only negative was they wouldn’t let us use our Tesco vouchers against a family ticket only 4x individual tickets which bumped the cost up.We had a great time though and will return."
Brilliant,Loads to see and read. Spent a great couple of hours in this attraction. Staff we knowledgable and helpful.
Mary Rose visit,This is our first time to the new exhibit and it is fantastic. Well laid out with loads of information regarding exhibits. Ship display was well planned and able to look at from various angles. Well worth the visit.
You have to seethis,We visited the Mary Rose not long after it came out of the Solent many years ago and was being sprayed with water all the time. This new and really well presented exhibition is absolutely brilliant. Three floors of real treasures from this salvage which tell a real story of the time and those on board. There is nothing more to say than brilliant and we may well return because there is some H to take in on just one visit.
Brilliant all round. Kids loved it.,"Everything at the Mary Rose museum is just right. Very interesting, and the volunteer staff really know their stuff, and are super-friendly. The volunteer near the start, standing by king Henry VIII, even managed to keep my 7 year listening for a good while, and answered all the questions an inquisitive child needs to know!The layout works really well (sort of walking through a mirror-image of the ship) and the artifacts are layed out in a way to keep you engaged.And the ticket lasts for a year! Awesome!"
MARVELLOUS,"I came here after a long walk, HMS Warrior, HMS Victory, the Harbour boat tour....and was a bit weary. But what a fantastic museum (that's not the right word?) Experience. The real ship. The actual artefacts. Lots of information. It was fascinating."
Family visit,We wanted somewhere to take the children visiting for the USA. It was they first trip to Britain and we wanted to show they some history. They really enjoyed the experience and loved the history. The only downside was I wasn’t aware of the multiple ticket offer and I wasn’t offered one.
Truly one of the most atmospheric museums I have visited.,"I visited her in 2005 and this is the first time I've been back. What an amazing change. I love how she is the centre of the museum, like an atmospheric ghost, letting her story unfold. Wonderful feast of sound and vision. Definitely amazing."
Great museum; so much more than the ship,"I remember visiting the Mary Rose way back in the day shortly after she was raised and not seeing much other than a range of wet planks being constantly sprayed by more water. How times have changed....Now upright, taking pride of place in the centre of it’s own museum the ship serves as a jumping off point for many stories of the lives of the soldiers, sailors and other people aboard.  The way the museum is arranged is fantastic, taking you on a journey back through time to the mid-1500s. The objects discovered and conserved before and after the recovery in 1982 bring everything to life and the way they are displayed in a mirror image of the remains is superb.Arranged over three floors the museum shows life and objects from the various strata of life within the ship.  Knowledgeable staff abound and are ready to answer any questions or queries. Plus it’s indoors and out of the rain.Totally brilliant and well worth the entry fee."
An excellent museum. Well worth a visit,Very well organised display of a historic ship and loads of Tudor artefacts.Very interesting audio/visual presentations
Fantastic History,"We visited the Mary Rose on a trip to the Portsmouth dockyard; I was initially puzzled why we had to buy a separate ticket for this exhibition. We were not disappointed though. The museum and exhibition is simply jaw dropping and well worth the additional cost. The atmosphere created was fantastic and the information and artefacts on display here amazing and brought the Tudor navy to life. I cannot recommend this attraction enough. Our kids (7 & 10 ) loved it and really took in the history. This exhibition is a whole day on its own without the Dockyard, I would recommend at least 2 days here if you wanted to do both."
Family visit with 4 grandchildren,Fantastic second visit in less than a year. The grandchildren found the experience fascinating made even better as there was a TV programme on later that month documenting the history of the Mary Rose.. The building the ship allows you to feel you are walkink through midships. Staff are really helpful and knowledgable. Great day out
A marvelous reclamation,"The remains of the Mary Rose provides a wonderful view of what it was like to be a crew member of a British Man-of War during the reign of Henry VIII.  The bones of the ship have been marvelously preserved, and the collection of personal belongings salvaged from the wreckage give a fine picture of what life was like aboard a 16th century Man-of-War.  Kudos to the reclamation personnel who made this display possible!"
One of the best museum experiences in Europe,"For anyone interested in understanding the past, the Mary Rose Museum is in my opinion one of - if not the - most comprehensive and integrated museum experience in the UK and Europe.I never went on a school trip so don’t remember the pre-2013 setup but from the moment you enter the bespoke museum, history is brought alive in the most human, raw and authentic form. There is simply nothing else like it.The opportunity to get so close to the artefacts and stories of a Tudor warship is a unique opportunity and the staff, volunteers and setup of the museum lovingly exploit that fact to present a gripping narrative of our naval past. You can feel their pride in everything that the Mary Rose project stands for - and rightly so.For those who are willing to let themselves be immersed, there is the chance to feel the voices from 500 years ago whispering across the ages. Simply extraordinary."
So interesting..,"A quick review....A wonderful exhibit of not only the ship but also the artefacts from the ship.Very helpful and informative staff. I visited in October and it was quite busy,so be warned that in high season it will be very busy..... A must see exhibit."
"Astounding, excellent","This really is a must do but allow plenty of time. We took over three hours and could have stayed longer really, buy the annual pass and you can keep returning for a year to take it in in more detail. The ship is now on display and the galleries are set up so that you can get a real understanding of how the ship worked. There are so many objects that were retrieved and in such good condition, you can gain a real understanding of the technology and craftmanship of the time. The AV displays on the ship give a good interpretation of how the ship worked. The guides are friendly and very knowledgable. It's a long walk through the dockyard to get there but there are lifts to get between the floors. Bag searches are in operation for the dockyard."
Fascinating,"Well worth a visit, incredible to think that this ship belonged to Henry VIII and has been under water for 450 years!"
Amazing visit,"Bought our tickets back in January and it has taken till now, October, to make our visit. The historic dockyard itself was really interesting to see on our way to the Mary Rose Museum.The museum itself was excellent. The introduction was very atmospheric but then turning a corner and seeing the wreck in front of us was awesome. Superbly laid out and even the walkway followed the slope of the ship's decks. The artefacts were displayed really well with explanations for everything and the whole experience was enhanced with lighting, sounds and the video projections.We spent several hours entranced by it all. Having watched the raising of it from the sea all those years ago I was more than excited to see it in life.Amazing visit!!"
Well worth a visit,"Really interesting - so much to see - probably better in October as it was fairly quiet, and no feeling of being rushed through.."
Awesome,"After seeing the old Mary Rose exhibition (wet wood behind misty glass) this was truly awesome.We'd only allowed 2 hours for the visit, but needed 4 at least. We were stunned not only by the restoration of the Mary Rose, but also the sheer number of recovered artefacts on display.We will return to take a slower tour of this exhibit"
New exhibition stunning,"I thought I'd seen the displays from the Mary Rose when the ship was still being sprayed, but this new exhibition, with the ship's timbers now is dried, is completely different.  There's so much to see, so many more artefacts, interactive displays, audio-visual pieces and spooky scenes of life on-board projected onto the remains of the ship, it takes your breath away!  I could barely drag myself out.  A must and highly recommended."
"So, so interesting. Five hours well spent.","We first saw the Mary Rose shortly after she had been recovered and put on view under the protective spray, so we were keen to see her in the new display area. Wow, we were not disappointed. What excellent progress has been made to produce what is now an excellent exhibition. The ship is so well displayed you can see every part very clearly and it is now living history. (We took lots of photographs which have come out well). The supplementary displays about the ship, crew, artifacts and armaments e.t.c are also excellent. never mind whether you like history or not- young and old will enjoy this."
Excellent,"After visiting the HMS Victory and feeling disappointed was a bit apprehensive about forking out another £25 to view the Mary Rose.But was extremely glad we did, the exhibition is very well laid out, and very informative. We really enjoyed the exhibition and artefacts and spent a couple of hours here. Would definitely recommend."
Amazing visit ,"This is really worth visiting, the items on display are absolutely incredible.... They have one half of the ship on display showing  all  the decks. They also have a sound audio highlight as well... Cant recommend a visit here highly enough.... Entrance fees are a little steep but l think well worth it...."
Wow.,"My wife and I visited the Mary Rose museum today having bought tickets in advance online for £14 each.The museum is absolutely amazing, so well put together with so much information, so many artefacts and of course half of the ship itself on display.The museum is very well laid out with information from the building of the ship, to its service to its raising.The thousands of items that survived enable the museum to tell a story of life on board. Who ever designed the museum had great vision as this is the most interesting museum we've been to. Added to this, there were so many helpful staff members on hand to add little snippets of information.We spent over 3 hours there and would highly recommend a visit."
First visit,"Excellent, it's a must visit for all of those with even the slightest of interest with a surprisingly large amount of finds to."
A BRILLIANT AND WELL DESIGNED EXHIBITION,What else can I say but that this is an awe inspiring presentation   It really is a .must' for any visitor to Portsmouth
A must see!,"We were overseas tourists that has just spent 5 weeks touring around the uk. This attraction was rated in our top 3 sights we visited. A very well thought out exhibit. Just loved it. You need a few hours to take in all the history that has been thoughtfully displayed there. Not part of the dockland tickets but if you are visiting the area you must go, you won’t be disappointed."
A Must See ,"When we walked into the main exhibit with half the ship sitting there, I was in awe and stood in amazement of the splendor. As we made our way through the exhibits, we admired the fabulous collection of preserved artifacts that have been through the conservation process. One of the best museums that I have toured."
Unmissable for Tudor history buffs,"The museum is outstanding, a real experience to be enjoyed and appreciated for all the time and effort that has gone into it.  One cannot imagine how such a huge relic could have been raised from the sea bed and put in a display such as this, along with all the other many findings from the ship.  Allow yourself at least three hours to go round properly, preferably more."
Fun day for all.,Took the grandchilden there some years ago. They had a great time and talked about it for soon time after. Well worth the trip and money.
Give yourself plenty of time at the Portsmouth Historic Dockyards,"There is so much to see at the Portsmouth Historic Dockyards. There are two things not to miss. Start with the Mary Rose Museum. She was a warship of the English Tudor navy of King Henry VIII and sank in 1545. What you see are the remains of the ship as it was raised in 1982. Well done with holograms and interesting artifacts. Not as well lighted a I would have preferred, but they are trying to protect the items from light (I think). It was BIG.Then take in the HMS Victory but know that it is not/NOT recommended for those with walking limitations. Your tour takes you up and down narrow stairs and over obstacles. She was Lord Nelson's flagship at the Battle of Trafalgar on in 1805, where the French were defeated. Nothing but a ship to see, but well maintained and large enough for 850 offiers and men. She was the only ship to fight in the Napoleonic Wars, the French Revolutionary War and the American War of Independence. There are probably 4-6 other areas to visit within the Portsmouth Historic Dockyards. Take your pick. All good. We paid around $63 for two. Entering the place was confusing, because there was separate admissions for the Mary Rose and another for the Royal Navy piece. I never really understood which paid for what."
A fascinating day out,Truly remarkable.  Be sure to allow enough time as the displays are very extraordinary. I was there on the beach when she was raised. The restoration is a remarkable feat of skill and imagination.
Excellent,"This is a quite exceptional museum. Essentially what remains of the Mary Rose might not appear to be over impressive but innovative display of the recovered artefacts; using hologram technology; enabling multi  levels for the viewing of the wreck; and with clever use of video and lighting makes this a must see experience. You can easily spend hours here and, at the end, you will have as complete a knowledge of the ship as is possible."
90th birthday treat,"My Dad was 90, so we took him there for the day. It was absolutely amazing, and bit of a walk around, but there is wheelchair access, lifts etc..if needed. I would highly recommend"
Amazing,We had been years ago and it was on our wish list. We were not disappointed. To see all the artefacts displayed in such an excellent way was amazing. The research that has been done is fantastic
Day out,Excellent day out for the family lots to do and see. Great to see how life was back then would recommend this trip also you have hms victory the warrior and activities. Good restaurants
Mary Rose Museum,"This is a great museum and a great idea of how to present this amazing ruin. My only criticism is the lack of seating, which was slightly problematic for me but it is well worth a visit."
Day trip to Mary Rose,The Mary Rose is a fantasic experience. It really is like going back in time. It is so well layed out and it even has holograms of people working on the ship to improve the experience. A fantastic day out.
One day is not enough,A ticket for the dockyard experience lasts for 12 months and is worth every penny I have been many times and there is still more to see
Mary Rose Museum,"One of the best museums ever! Displays were creative, informative and easy to move through. We loved our time here and recommend it as a ‘must do!’"
Excellent presentation,"I had heard rave reviews of the Mary Rose, and the Museum did not disappoint.  The boat is presented in an interesting, creative way which was enjoyable.  We could have stayed here longer!"
Expensive but a terrific museum,"Really brilliant effects, interactivity and an amazing museum in the way the ship was presented. You simply can't visit Portsmouth without going here at least once."
Unlike any other museum in the world,"It is hard to see this museum on the web and get any idea how significant and large this museum actually is.  The museum is 3 floors that align to the decks of the ship.  The artifacts, including a dog, are brought to life.  One can hardly believe this is 500 year old stuff stuck in the muck for centuries.  Wonderful exhibit."
Superb - book tickets online to get 20% discount,"A superb experience.  Well laid-out and fascinating exhibitions of the ship itself and the personal possessions and military objects found with it.  Definitely book online to get a 20% discount on your tickets, which last 1 year - we'll be going back!  (Sadly a rather mediocre cafe though.)"
"Sensational, moving, astonishing experience.","A mesmerising and deeply surprising find - so many (19,000) personal and ship's items brought to the surface and lovingly conserved and then displayed. A massive and very moving tribute to both a real human tragedy and extraordinary craftmanship & technical skill (both C16th & C20th/21st ingenuity). The rescued broken hull is simply magnificent. Thank you to all involved in the Project."
Enjoyed,Enjoyed our trip around felt some of the exhibits were a little hard to see with the lighting.Staff very helpful.
At long last.,Anyone of my age who used to watch Blue Peter as a child will remember the Mary Rose being lifted from the Solent. It's taken me quite a few decades but finally I visited her and I wasn't disappointed.Quite a high admission price but you can spend all afternoon wandering the 'decks' and seeing the thousands of preserved artifacts and reading the stories of many of the crew.Groundbreaking history research and an amazing experience. Everyone should visit at least once in their lifetime.5 stars is not enough.
"Incredible Museum , an absolute must see.",My friend and I spent nearly four hours at this spectacular museum . We are both dedicated Museum visitors ( I work in one) but this is really off the scale in comparison with the many museums around the world we have visited . The Mary Rose itself plus the story of recovering her are  equally compelling .All of the  people involved have created a truly memorable experience. Thank you.
Beautifully designed ,"This is a fantastic museum with the whole exhibition designed around the recovered piece of ship and other artefacts. The outer building is the shape of the recovered wreck and the artefacts are laid out opposite where they were found on board.The information available makes it clear what is known for certain, what has been deduced and how these deductions have been made. I particularly appreciate this way of presenting information and theories. Local volunteers are on hand to tell you more about the ship and the recovery and all the staff we met seemed to be genuinely concerned that we enjoyed our visit. You can buy a day pass with x3 Tesco vouchers or you can buy an annual pass at a 20% discount on line.Enjoy!"
A brilliant exhibition,"We visited the exhibit whilst visiting the Portsmouth Historic Dockyard. I remember the original recover tv footage so visiting here was a great experience an seeing how well the ship and artefacts had been conditioned. What a great display with good visibility of the ship itself, descriptions of some of the crew as well as aspects of the wider historic context. We spent around 3 hours there, well worth the visit"
Fabulous “must see”,"My second time, with catered dinner next door.  This is a beautifully curated museum and remarkable story and display.  New features are still being added, most recently, projected action scenes in various compartments of the ship.  I think you can learn something new with very visit."
Simply stunning!,We visited the Mary Rose not long after it had been lifted from the Solent and we viewed it through the mist designed to avoid the fragile timbers from drying out. What a transformation was in store! The ship (still in the same position) is now fully dried out and preserved and the way in which it is displayed is so informative and innovative. Being able to see the ship which sank in 1545 brought back to life is magical. Since the ship itself was brought up the divers have also found hundreds of items in amazing condition which bring to life the way in which the ship was manned and operated in its prime. We could almost appreciate the devastation that Henry VIII  must have felt when he saw his beautiful warship disappear beneath the waters of the Solent 500 years ago.
Simply the Best,"I thought it was going to be good....I didn't think it would be this good. The remains of the great ship itself were amazing, and how they have been presented and cared for was in such good taste when you think that they were the resting place of so many men. But this isn't just about the ship, its about the lives, the times and the whole way of life in this particular slice of time. No stone has been left un-turned, using dna, and facial reconstruction participants of this fateful date in history are brought back to life. We only really had time for this exhibition however the dockyard had so much more to offer, such as the Victory and other ships and exhibitions...we will return, not only to see that but maybe take a peak at the Mary Rose again. Admission fee is reasonable and the usual facilities are all on site, toilets, cafe's shops etc...just do it."
Eerie and breathtaking,We didn't know what to expect when we entered the museum and when you step into the viewing area it takes your breath away. Although in ruins the museum has done an incredible job of bringing the story of the Mary Rose to life.
Incredible,"A friend recommended visiting. It is amazing the amount of work done and still ongoing is fantastic. So many treasures and stories that may never have been seen. It is so well laid out and very helpful, knowledgeable people on hand."
Step back in time,The ship itself is amazing and looks so fragile what a miraculous feat bringing it up out of the sea. The artifacts give a glimpse into Tudor life.
Cool place to visit,I think the museum was refurbished not long ago. It is a huge improvement than before the renovation.  They also installed some new technology which is really cool. The statue outside the museum is amazing too.
Great maritime museum,This was probably the best museum I have ever visited. If you are interested in maritime archeology this museum is a must. Very good excibition and an app available to guide you through many of the artifacts. You also get to see videoes in which replicas of the artifacts on display are used. An excibition that comes alive.
Great indoor place,"Very well put together exhibit packed with stuff to see,learn about, play with. History and maritime buffs delight."
Absolutely Breathtaking.,"This is a definate must if you visit Portsmouth. Not the cheapest attraction but your ticket lasts 12 months. We visited first in April & again in September.From the moment you enter, there is ALL the information you need & if you require more, the guides inside the exhibition are fantastic. You need to follow the recommended root through the exhibition to get the best experience. My wife & i will never forget the first sight of the ship, It took our breath away! There is animated action every few minuets on board the ship showing all the trades that were on board & what life may have been like for the crew. When they played the mock battle it was as if we were in it. You also feel as though you are on board due to the sounds & smells you experience. I can't praise the guides enough on their knowledge & information. We also found the display cases in the museum part fascinating, especially the surgeons equipment! The pictures of how some of the crew may have looked together with some of their personal tools or armour were sometimes quite moving. The best museum experience I've seen in ages."
Wow,As I love history and in particular Henry VII it was imperative we visited Mary Rose whilst staying in Portsmouth. £18 each for the Mary Rose museum but all I can say is it was the best £36 I have ever spent!Seeing her in all the splendour and the artifacts which were recovered was amazing to see after over 500 under the sea bed.Well worth the 8000 plus steps on my Fitbit! The ticket enables you to return within 12 months free of charge!Great day out....
Fantastic not to be missed,This was absolutely stunning. The exhibition brings the Mary Rose to life. You marvel at how they brought her up and managed to save so much.All the personal items to see and facts to learn. It was astonishing.A must see and be prepared to spend hours there.
Brilliant museum,"The Mary Rose Trust has got it 100% right.  A perfect experience.  Thoroughly recommend. Your ticket allows you to revisit as many times as you like for a full year.  We stayed in local hotel overnight and went to museum for several hours, over two days, and still didn’t see everything.  There’s also the Historic Dockyard to see with other ships to visit.  If seeing more than just the Mary Rose, it would be a lot, lot cheaper to buy a ticket for everything.  The Mary Rose museum is very atmospheric.  It’s perfectly set out.  There is a small cafe and gift shop too.  Can’t praise it enough."
Mary Rose deserves a good half day,"What a wonderful experience. They've done a lot to provide a great outing which really brings to life the people, the era, architecture, and so many other aspects pertaining to this ship. Easy to interpret information, great staff to assist your experience."
Stunning!,What an insight into Tudor Naval history. The museum tour is laid out brilliantly. It is both fascinating and breathtaking at the same time.What an excellent experience.
A Brilliant Museum,Thoroughly enjoyed this museum and the absolutely fascinating display of both the Mary Rose and the artifacts found with 'her'. The Video projections into the various parts of the Mary Rose actually stopped me in my tracks. So impressive and evocative of the history involved. a truly 'magical' experience. A real 'leap back in time'.
"Wow, what a museum",The Mary Rose is a fantastic place to visit.  The restoration is incredible right down to seeing leather clothing buried in silt for 500 years.  The Mary Rose is so large there are 3 floors dedicated to viewing its different decks.There were no major crowds and this is as professional a museum as I have ever seen.
Superb!,I don't often give 5* for a review but this place deserves it and more. It is by far the most interesting and enjoyable museum visit I have ever had and although we were there for 5 hours it could have easily been double that time there was so much to see. I have wanted to see it ever since I saw the ship raised and in a tent for 30 years while the timbers were being stabilised and since the new custom built museum was opened. It was well worth the wait. This place should be on everyone's bucket list!
Always feeling wowed when I visit ,"This is our second visit and enjoyed it just as much as we we did the first time. We enjoyed listening to the app, but the engagement we experienced from the staff does not match. Their knowledge, engagement and enthusiasm made our visit more enjoyable and added to the wow factor of a fabulous museum. We feel lucky that we live not too far away and will be visiting again!"
A Brilliant experience.,"I was so impressed with the Mary Rose Museum facilities. This is one of the most advanced interpretive centres in the world. They are dealing with a vessel that spent of over 400 years at the bottom of the Solent. I was in England on a visit in 1982 when she was raised. I can remember that some expected a full sailed Galleon emerging from the water and were a little disappointed in just ""mud and wood""!The painstaking reconstruction and interpretation is phenomenal. The main vessel is housed in a vast, glass contained and air locked area, essential given the delicate nature of research and restoration. The guides and docents are extremely knowledgeable on all areas. The reconstruction of some of the skulls found provide a ""face"" to those who served Henry VIII so many years ago.This is one of the most impressive museums I have ever visited."
Mary Rose Museum,Fascinating and brilliantly curated history of Henry Vlll’s iconic warship.The exhibits are amazing! Well worth a visit.
Well worth visiting ,It’s been several years since we visited the Mary Rose and were not disappointed by the superb display of the ship and artefacts. The atmospheric conditions make it an even more interesting visit with interactive displays and guides whom are very helpful and knowledgeable about the ship. You need to set aside 3 or so hours to get around the 3 floors and take it all in. Very worthwhile experience and tip - but your tickets via the official website as they are cheaper and remain valid for a year!
Amazing!,"Great fun to go up. The cafe wasn’t extortionate so we had cake and a coke. Can visit all day, and heads up to my nhs colleagues, we got a discount!"
Rather Gloomy,interesting displays of things recovered from the.Mary Rose. Somewhat amateurish video footage that is quite hard to see and understand.
Impressive,"This is an iconic ship that the staff and facilities have brought back to life.  This is history as it was, laid bare in front of you.  The exhibits and how it is told are 1st class.  Our 3 year old son enjoyed the hands on parts of the tour and the interactive screens.  Where as the wife and myself enjoyed reading the stories.  Our son was fascinated with the staff showing the doctors instruments.  Make sure you do the top level and experience the open air part of the museum.  Pay the money it is very worth it."
A 21st Century state of the art experience that will bring you face to face with the 16th Century!,"The new state of the art museum which houses the Mary Rose has been so well designed. Very high tech with glass galleries which allows virtually every view of this remarkable ship. Now you can smell the ship as the temperature/ humidity is controlled by clever air locks allow you to view the ship without any glass barriers. 2 lifts allow easy access to the 3 floors of the carefully restored exhibits. things for the children to do, so they won't get bored!  Low lighting adds to the mood and focuses the mind on the tragedy that occured in 1545.  Lots of staff on hand to answer questions and also some hands pieces of the ship that you can pick up and hold.  Photography (no Flash) is encouraged.  This is a 100% must see and highly recommended."
A Little Disappointed,"This was my third visit. My two previous visits were in the old temporary museum when the hulk was still being sprayed. By the time of my second visit about 10 years ago, the museum looked tired and jaded so I was looking forward to seeing it all again represented in a brand new setting.The quality of the displays was much improved and the artefacts extraordinarily well preserved. I have to say, however, that although my eyesight may not be as good as it was, it did feel that I was spending most of the time groping around in the dark. Other reviews mention lighting effects and projections, all I saw was a ghostly wreck semi-lit in the dark. The museum displays, although extremely well presented and totally fascinating, still seemed to lurk in the gloom. I could only see my son in silhouette for most of the time.Whilst I would recommend the museum and the quality of the exhibits, I cannot say I left the museum spellbound, but I had seen it all twice before. Perhaps there was a power cut!"
Day trip,"Excellent value, well presented, interesting, clear displays, interactive. Helpful staff, no golf buggy unfortunately."
Fantastic,"This museum is absolutely brilliant. To be so close to such a beautiful ship and learn about it's history is a great way to spend 2-3 hours . I had an amazing time, thank you to the Mary Rose Trust and the wonderful staff you employ."
"Excellent, lots of interesting exhibits",A very interesting museum.  Some of the artefacts look to have been made just last week not hundreds of years ago.  Seeing the actual boat was a treat and the projector images made it come to life
Had a great time,We had a amazing day there so entertaining and the real boat with the projector images was amazing. It is the best made musume I've ever been to and I've seen sooo many.
Great place to visit,Bought voucher through picniq which was good value. Great museum in very interesting location.  Good cafe.
Amazing,"I can vividly recall the day in 1982 when I watched with my Mum as they started to raise the Mary Rose. We both jumped when the support strut snapped! I've never had the chance to see the ship since but as I was in Southampton decided to go to Portsmouth to see it.  I was not disappointed. Its probably even more worthwhile seeing now it is no longer being sprayed with preservatives. Sitting in a purpose built museum making full use of modern display techniques and lighting. The interior is designed to give an impression of how big the ship actually was. The visit culminates in emerging through an airlock to view the ship from the top deck without a glass partition. Magical!It's now not just about the ship itself but over 9000 artifacts that have been preserved and are on display. There are also DNA profiles of some of the 179 crew found in the wreck. Absolutely fascinating and tastefully displayed. You could easily spend a couple of hours or more here. Get tickets online, slightly cheaper or buy on the day. Well worth considering which other attractions you want to visit, HMS Victory, HMS Warrior, Spinnaker Tower etc and buying joint tickets. If you saw Mary Rose when it was being sprayed with water you need to go again,  if you've never seen it don't leave it as long as I did!"
Must see ,"First time visiting Portsmouth.  We purchased the Portsmouth Pass which gives you access to Portsmouth Historic Dockyard, Mary Rose, Emirates Spinnaker Tower and The D-Day Story in one great value ticket.  There is a lot to read in the Marie Rose Museum.  Interesting displays of items found with the ship wreck.  Really impressive how they salvaged the timbers and the way it is displayed.  You can download an app for an audio tour but we didn’t have our headphones with us so didn’t want to disturb the other visitors.  Worth visiting if you like history."
Old but not forgotten,"This has been an exceptional day out.At first I was a bit sceptical at the price (cheaper if done online, and lasts a year!).I mean, how long can you spend looking around an old boat!?Well, the answer is AGES.BEST museum/exhibition I have seen for a long time.Whilst the recovered shiop itself is brilliant. The time and effort put in to bring the ship, the people and the times 'to life' are beyond brilliant.You end up feeling for the lost sailors and wandering in awe at both the way they lived and died. Plus the care and dedication of those who restored and care for this exhibit is beyond professional"
First bit of trip. ,"Arrived as it opened and saw both d day exhibition and the overlord tapestry. Outside to Southsea castle too. Great visit, parking paid for extra though. We came here first as had to pick up Portsmouth pass. Worked out far cheaper than separate. £10 for  d day £11.50 for spinnaker tower. £13.50 for Mary rose. Docks and victory £31.00. £65 and 49 on the Portsmouth pass."
