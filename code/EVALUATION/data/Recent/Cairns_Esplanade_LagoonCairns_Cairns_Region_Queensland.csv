No swimming for us ‚òπÔ∏è,"We couldn't have a swim as we had our dog with us and dogs aren't allowed at the lagoon. Travelers with dogs might be best to avoid Cairns as it is not very dog friendly. Dogs are also not allowed on the Esplanade, the botanic gardens or any part of the CBD of Cairns. We are grey nomads living permanently on the road so leaving our dog at home is not an option. Also most of the swimming spots and waterfalls are in national parks so obviously can't go there with your dog"
A gentle stroll along the boardwalk,Great fun watching the ironman event and walking along the boardwalk...ice creams and sunshine ...a great combination
Excellent,Better than Brisbane‚Äôs Southbank! Our kids loved the lagoon. Very pleasant to sit there in the afternoon and watch the passing parade.
Great place for family visit ,Great lagoon for families to take small children to entertain. Not as good as Southbank lagoon in Brisbane where families can swim and sunbath but a nice place for young families to cool off.
Relaxing,"Nice set up, lovely view. Life guards on duty. However the closest parking is very expensive, so work parking in a side street and walking"
Swimming spot,This is a great spot for a swim. We walked past after shopping and I wished I had my swimmers... I would have gone in but had to content myself with a paddle.
Enjoyable,"Such an enjoyable place to walk along and take in some nice veiws and enjoy swim in the lagoon, lots of friendly people and a great place to exercise!"
Reaort style pool in a public park,"Great idea of a clean safe pool on the edge of the bay, feel like you are in a resort open to all. Come and go as you please, plenty if space . Winter water temp is a bit chilly though.,Lie out on sand or under a palm tree. BBQ's and picnic tables caters for everyone."
Lovely & relaxing.,"A superb & safe oasis on the edge of the cities Esplanade. Take your time to also relax in the gardens, the shade under the beautiful fig trees & make use of the facilities, it's greatüëç"
Local,"Love the lagoon (as do most locals), conveniently located close to most hotels/motels/hostels, with clean toilets/showers/BBQ facilities (all free) what is not to love? One day our dictator state government may allow us to drink alcohol in a social manner whilst we enjoying what we pay for through our taxes and rates."
Chilled out! ,"Great place to visit and just chill out. Fantastic sun spot! Shaded space available, ideal for all ages."
Refreshing,"Crystal clear. Great on those hot days. Can have a picnic. There are Shops, restaurants and cafes near by."

Brilliant pool in Cairns Esplanade ,Extremely clean Nice pool Free to use Great for all ages Nice grass area and bbq area with tables and chairs
Great place to spend the afternoon,Took the kids here in July so it was only 25 degrees. The day we went there was a bit of a breeze so it was a bit cold out but in the water in the middle of winter it was still pretty bearable for adults. Kids can swim in ice water and still have fun so they are no judge.  It‚Äôs in a great place and it‚Äôs a good idea for councils to have free to the public. I did hear rumours that after dark the backpackers make it a bit of a make out spot but it was completely fine when we were there (it was also during covid so mostly Australians on holidays I‚Äôd say).
A must visit to relax both day and night.,"What a wonderful, free, offering by Cairns for locals and tourists. We loved the area and atmosphere. Our teens played frisbee on the grass, daughter waded in the pool and I sat relaxing and watching with a great coffee from the nearby cafe/coffee shop with lovely, friendly staff. Visit at night for some lovely sunset photo opportunities before dining along the wharf area."
Swim - Chill - Eat,Beautiful infinity pool overlooking the bay with all facilities including Bbq near by. A Must do in Cairns
Cairns,"Cairns Esplanade Lagoon, is the place to go with kids, couples, elderly. Beautiful manicured gardens and surrounds, so peaceful, with BBQ facilities for free, you can spend a hour or several here. Plenty of cafes, restaurants all within 5mins, along with having a cafe near toilets and lockers. Be aware, lagoon is closed to swimming until 12pm on Wednesdays."
Use the Security Lockers,"On the far side of the lagoon towards the Cruise Terminal there are a bank of security lockers to store your valuables for a small fee. Not an area to leave your phone etc with your towel whilst you swim.Nice large lagoon, shallow, clear water and very warm. The water was busy all day from early morning to late at night. Lots of areas of grass to sit and lay on. If you do not have a pool with your room then this us the place for you.At night the mosquitos and other biting insects come out to play. We both were stung walking around the grass perimeter during the evening when walking around the lagoon. Before we saw some locals covering themselves with repellant."
Lagoon,Walking along foreshore visiting lagoon as on previous visit this was only in progress. So impressive and incredibly safe for families
Be careful,"Nice spot but beware of crime, recent lacks in laws has made tourist easy targets,be careful of your possessions and gangs of young kids"
Beautiful,"The lagoon on the Esplanade in Cairns is absolutely beautiful, the water is clear, the pool itself is huge and was quite busy on the day we visited but still lots of room for all"
A cool place to cool !!!,"When humidity rises and temperatures exceeds 40 degrees this is the place to cool down. Nice and clean facilities, changing rooms showers and toilets. Even a McD close by if that you‚Äôre prerogative. Remember coins for lockers."
A fantastic pool beside the sea for everyone and it is free,A large pool with shallow areas  for children.Around the pool are lots of places to sit on picnic tables or the grass and there are toilets with changeing areas.The pool is clean and easy to access for people with disabilities.Situated in the heart of Cairns township with food outlets nearby.A great place to visit for everyone.
Great place for a swim,Great vibe at the lagoon with plenty of surrounding space for BBQs etc. Easy place to chill out for an afternoon
Great spot for the day! ,Such a great Lagoon to visit! Great shady trees to relax under and enjoy for the day. It‚Äôs a great atmosphere with toilet and locker facilities üôÇ
Nice place to cool off,Beautiful lagoon area to take a break in the heat of the day. Also has shaded areas over some swim areas and the sandy beach area to allow kids to play without worry of them burning.
Looks lovely and cool ,"The waterfront lagoon and adjacent shops are very welcoming to tourists. I liked seeing the different tides. Great for families with children or young people. Not far to go for burger, chips and ice cream. Ball games, family picnics, small cafe for coffee or paddle pops. Overall a credit to Cairns council."
Beautifully refreshing,"An awesome little spot to cool down.It's a lovely spot to just relax and chill. You can take a picnic and use the BBQs there, or just nip across the street and grab a feed."
Nice place to hang out,"A nice place to hang out when it was hot and sweaty in Cairns. Good location, clean changing rooms and a lot of life guards around the area."
"A spot in paradise, on a hot afternoon!","Open from 6am to 9pm, most days, this is a great place to cool down, relax, swim, or just hang around with friends. It is spotlessly clean and very closely supervised by plenty of lifeguards. The lagoon is huge , with fountains,  a small beach area, the sea beyond, and is absolutely FREE!!!  Great !"
Amazing Logoon pool.,This was a very nice and FREE activity for the family. The pool is ecellent and facilities are great.
Beautiful lagune,"A beautiful lagoon, with clean water, lifeguards, toilet and locker facilities. Nice place to cool down."
Great for a chill,Really enjoyed our time relaxing by the pool and cooling down in the water. Loads of different people down there from locals to flashy tourists. If you need to fill time and relax this is a good spot.
Nice to cool off,"It is an open pool opened for everyone from early in the morning till late in the evening. There are also some pilates classes a couple days of the week right next to the pool, as well as some other sport. In my opinion this is a totally highlight in Cairns and a must do attraction when in Cairns. It contains a shower area with toilets etc. I suggest bringing a good mood and a high SPF Factor with you! Enjoy it!"
Perfect,"It‚Äôs a big, free public pool right next to the ocean. How much better can it get? What an awesome spot."
Great swimming place,The cairns lagoon is a nice place to swim as it is in a wonderful location situated on the cairns esplanade. It is a large pool which is just in my metres away from the ocean. Great for family and friends to go!
Australia adventure ,I don‚Äôt think there are many places in the world that offer such a great place for all at no cost. Loved the way anybody and everybody could use
"Perfect hangout place alone, with friends and family","Many hours spent sunbathing, swimming, picnicking and relaxing here. Great facilities to cook outdoors, showers, outdoor gym, changing and bathrooms and it‚Äôs all free."
Great swim to cool us down.,Beautiful pool to swim in near town. Free and clean and refreshing. Don't leave your stuff unattended as there are locals that ride around on bikes checking what they can grab.
Good to spend the day,Clean and quiet. It has lifeguards and bbq.  It is a good option to spend the day alone or with children.
Mr,Free the kids loved it top spot very family friendly great bbq area with life guards to help keep an eye on the kids
Fabulous Free Facility,Great pool for the whole family. The facilities are excellent and clean with surrounding parkland to relax in. Life guards are on duty. This is a credit to Cairns. Loved it.
Nice and all in,"Well, it's  free. Beautiful sunset views, little cafe and showers and change rooms as well as lockers for free. So pretty recomendable"
Awesome!,"This is a truly awesome open pool with no entrance fee.The pool is located next to the (ugly) beach and can accommodate both kids and adults with enough ground for some sunbathing (although it can get crowded).The place is worth a visit during the day and evening alike, as it is open until 9PM.Nowadays, there's a nice Ferry wheel next to the lagoon.Highly recommended!"
Bloomin lovely,"I cant believe this is free. Thought this was such a great idea!! So wonderful that this is on the front, right by the esplanade and you can swim in it overlooking the ocean!! Stopped off both days on our way back to our hotel. Such a great way to cool off. And did I mention that it's free?? And attended by life guards. Brilliant."
What a top spot,Great place for kids and family. Bbq areas. such a nice place and can pop over and get dinner at the restaurants and night markets
Adventurebuddies42 goes swimming at Cairns Esplanade Lagoon,We had the best time at the end of the day swimming watching the sunset relaxing in this free lagoon! We loved it! Then went to dinner nearby. Highly recommend. There‚Äôs a place to change and use the restroom.
A little piece of heaven and Great way to cool off,"When you visit Cairns, take some time and walk along the entire esplanade/ boardwalk and check out all the area has to offer. This is a good way to familiarize yourself with every thin. At one end of the esplanade you will find the lagoon pool this is a great place for family and friends to come together.  They also have gas bbqs on site and public toilet facilities. At first we not sure if we would actually use this lagoon area as there is so much to do in Cairns. But after taking in a number of excursions over the past could of days we decided to just take it easy and this turned out to be great fun."
Great place and free,"We visited this place a year ago and came back again today. It is a beautiful place, clean and family friendly. Best of all, it‚Äôs free entertainment!!"
Great idea,"Huge free pool, lockers available, food available, plenty of grass to sit on. The kids love it. Near the shops it is a nice place to relax and watch the world go by"
LOVE! ,"My husband and I whiled away a lovely afternoon here. Dipping in the pool, sunbaking and bbqing. Great facilities."
Lovely pool! ,"What a lovely touch to a beach/port town to have a lagoon open to everyone! Kept so clean, very impressed! Would love to have this in my town!"
Beautiful and refreshing!,"We were here on our road trip on the east coast. The sad thing about Cairns is that there used to be a beautiful beach here, till the 1920's. It has been sold off for the building industry, and in 10 years time it was gone. This is happening still all over the world today! It is all explained in info displays on the esplanade of Cairns.Anyway, Cains has made up a compensation for the muddy waterfront that the sand merchant left behind : a beautiful artificial lagoon.We visited the lagoon early morning. It is well kept, clean and inviting. A superb place to visit when you are worn down by many hours in the drivers seat..."
Good public pool,"Altough i‚Äôm not a huge fan of public pools, for the ones I know, that one is on the top of my list. The city don‚Äôt have a beach to swim, so the pool is a good way to take a swim. The area around the pool is nice too, have a good beach vibe, with people laying down and having fun in family or with friends. Good place to spend a time!"
Wonderful,"Amazing streach of shops and the pool is awesome. I wish I lived in cairns, it is just beautiful.Let's hope they stop chopping down trees"
Fantastic idea!,"Loved this lagoon. Enjoyed several hours here. The lagoon pool was clean and clear. Lifeguards on duty as well. Loved the ledge around the pool to sit on if needed.  The park surrounding it with benches, picnic tables and BBQs was being used as well. The locker set up was great and you can open and reclose during your paid time. Large locker was $3 for 2 hours. Toilets and showers were well maintained and clean. There were some shady areas and trees. Cairns is so lucky to have this great feature and close to food and drink as well. Well done Cairns"
Fabulous open air pool,"It‚Äôs worth carrying your swimming togs on a trip to Cairns, because you will be very tempted to get into the water at the Cairns Esplanade Lagoon.  The depth goes from mere inches at the kiddy paddling end, to adult deep at the other. There‚Äôs a ‚Äúbeach‚Äú on one side. It‚Äôs clean, there are lifeguards on duty. Unbelievably, this facility and it‚Äôs surrounding park, are right on the edge of the shopping and restaurant area of the city. Just across the road. In the park there are free public barbecues, and tables where you can take your food and picnic in the shade."
"Beautiful place to lounge around, swim safely or just get the sun.","This is a great place to come with the kids or even just on your own. Safe swimming with lifeguards on duty. Well graded lagoon from a depth scale, lovely outlook and relaxing atmosphere. And it‚Äôs free!! Full marks."
Nice swimming spot,"I went to the Lagoon on a Saturday, there was a nice small market near by the Lagoon. I think on weekends it‚Äôs a little bit full on the Lagoon because there are a lot of big families over there and a lot of kids. You also have some barbeque spots in this area.It‚Äôs nice for refreshing and relax for a little bit, but only for a few hours not a hole day."
Afternoon wander,Nice to see everyone can keep cool for no price in the tropical cairns!Was nice to just dip my feet in after a long day of exploring!
"Family friendly, fun water area","Plenty of shade and seating. Sitting areas, change rooms, toilets etc. Shallow child friendly areas available."
Beautiful Spot,"If you are in Cairns you'll see it ;) It's next to the ocean! Great opportunity to cool off during the hot summer days or get a tan. I really enjoyed it as a solo traveler. There are lockers you can rent for few $ to put your valuable stuff in, showers and close to it there's a Maccas if you get hungry. And the best thing is it's for FREE!! YEES MATE"
Great ‚Äòfree‚Äô space for families,The esplanade and the lagoon are a great spot for families and people to relax and enjoy the great weather in Cairns. The lagoon is well maintained and supervised by life guards. It‚Äôs cleaned regularly but does smell a bit of chlorine. The walking path along the beach front is also great.
Great ‚ÄòFree‚Äô Family Fun,"If you are in Cairns a visit to the lagoon is a must. It‚Äôs safe, clean, manned by life guards and large enough to have room for everyone, young and old alike. Change rooms and toilets available nearby and plenty of grassed area to lounge around in. Pack a picnic lunch as you can easily spend the day here. Note it is closed Wednesday mornings until 12pm for maintenance."
Great idea for all the family,Few in yesterday from England. What a fantastic resource for the people of Cairns. Just had a great few hours at the lagoon bathing and relaxing.
Beautiful area,As a British person I find it amazing that there are areas like this free to the public and it‚Äôs kept amazingly clean there are BBQ to use free of charge and are also very clean everyone looks after them it‚Äôs a lovely place to spend the day and or evening having fun with family and friends very kid friendly
Check the area for good swim,"Obviously, you cannot just swim in the sea around and the lagoon might seem like a good option,but I would not recommend it. Just 40 mins on the bus you have absolute pieces of paradice in Trinity beach and Palm Cove beach."
the best city pool on the planet!,"The Cairns Lagoon pool is the best pool on the planet!  The lagoon area is muddy, dangerous with crocs swimming around and their is not a sandy beach area, as well!  The pool itself has a sandy beach style area on one side and the other is cemented.  There are all depths available if you have children.  They have life guards on each end and the police patrol the area well, since their is a police sub station on site. Outside of the pool area they  have recently added a ferris wheel, which gives you a scenic view of the area.  There are picnic tables and cook facilities for free, as long as you clean up when you are done.  There are public bathrooms with showers and baby changing areas.  There is also numerous shops, places to eat and drink, and the area is pretty safe."
Enjoyed,In a good  central location . Rooms we perfect for all we needed as only sleeping in them . Breakfast could improve though
"Nice, safe swimming area","This is a very nice lagoon. Perfect for families to chill and enjoy the water. A very popular place, especially on weekends. It's huge and can accommodate a large crowd."
Great spot,Not much to say. It's monitored by lifeguards. Little food shop nearby. Fairly clean change facilities and toilets as well.Definitely a great place to take the kids for a swim
Great spot!,A great spot to visit for locals and travellers alike. Pool is under supervision by trained lifeguards during the day. Plenty of space for a splash! Surrounding bbq facilities are clean and tidy.
Fabulous,"This is a great attraction, right in the heart of the city - and on the waterfront. It adjoins park-lands with shady trees, but there is also a sandy/beach area. Great place to cool off. Keep your swimmers & a towel in the car just in case."
Great place for a swim,And it is free.. Good changing facilities and picnic area with food prep areas. Popular with locals and tourists
Nice location,It is very peachy along the esplanade  Everyone appeared to be enjoying the croc free water Lots of shade and picnic spots along the esplanade.
Beautiful and big,The lagoon is a perfectSpot to cool downLove the facilities of bbqLockersShowersKioskIts clean and it opens 6am to 9pm daily
Great setup,Such a great setup from council free for the public. Fantastic for swimming and sitting around on a hot cairns day.
Love this place,We always have a great time here. It‚Äôs lovely being right on the esplanade and the kids can make sand castles and swim. Could just do with a bit more shade round the pool.
Good spot at its free.,It's  basically a big free swimming pool. You don't have to worry about crocodiles or poisonous jelly fish in the summer time and they have life guards. The pool is mostly on a gradual slope with the shallower parts safe for kids. Sand around most if the edges gives a feeling if being at the beach and there is plenty of grass around to lay on as well.
Such a splendour!,I did a stopover here from Sydney to Osaka. I was pleasantly surprised I could store my luggage in the cabins provided in the facilities (toilets & bathrooms) this was for $5 for 3 hours which was great as I got to walk around Cairns & also enjoy the sun before heading out to catch my flight to Osaka. The water is gorgeous & not too busy
Early morning walks,Love this place in the morning around 6ish before it gets too hot. It‚Äôs a morning institution for those in Cairns and a great place to people watch and bring a hat as it can get v hot
Perfect stay. Beautiful beach,We are here for four days after an roundtrip through Australia. From my point of view it‚Äòs the best place and nicest beach in October to relax. Good restaurants and hotels direct on the beach.
Relax by the pool!!,"What a great place to relax anytime of day!! It‚Äôs free, in the centre of Cairns, safe & clean!! Clean toilets & showers just beside pool. A great cheap place to take the family for the day or just take a dip on a hot day. Very safe as cameras all way round plus police shop beside pool."
Beautiful but busy,Absolutely worth a visit when stayonf im Cairna. Lagoon is very refreshing to swim in and offers excellent views of the harbour. Very busy area so expect to wait for a good spot to sit. Does get less busy close to evening.
Great walk ,"Lovely walk and war memorial. Nice esplanade and stunning view across the water. Plenty cafes, coffee along the way and markers at the weekend."
Asset to Cairns,Beautiful spot right on the boardwalk. Safe spot to swim with lifesaver on duty. Plenty of shade surrounding lagoon.
GREAT CAIRNS SPACE FOR ALL,"This is a wonderful place for all ages, there is always a great vibe, lots of shady places to to relax or sun if you want some ray's. Really good access to loads of amenities, great food options nearby. This area has life guards and regular police presence, so it is also a safe environment for all."
"Cool, refreshing and free","This is a great spot when the sun is beating down.Early mornings there is usually a water aerobics class or two to join into, as the day goes through more ad more people arrive.This is a very big pool, relaxingly shaped with very very shallow trickle down to a deep end of around one metre. Sandy areas foe young kids, shallow areas for babies, life guard on duty at certain times.Plenty if BBQs and seating. Or just relax on the sand. An array of coffee shops close by.Toilets and changing rooms next to it .All free."
Best way to spend a sunny day in Cairns,"The lagoon is an excellent place to visit on a hot day in Cairns. It is free and has great hours. The seating around the lagoon is limited so pack a towel or chair to sit on. The sun is very intense (the UV indicator was on extreme the day I visited) so make sure to pack sunscreen. All ages were present, including children, sunbathing teens, and the elderly."
Different,"I'm not sure if you can find a giant outdoor free swimming pool anywhere else but this is awesome. Plenty of shade and sandy areas and the pool is huge. A massive hit with the locals, it's packed. Well done to those who came up with this concept."
Great afternoon spent here,"We had a really nice afternoon here relaxing after exploring the local area for a few days previously. The lagoon was clean, there was plenty of room, and it's obviously free which is a big bonus! Great to visit with kids too as it's safe and there's plenty of bits shallow enough for them."
A day at the pier,This area is absolutely beautiful! It‚Äôs nice & clean. The lawn area is beautiful to have a picnic or walk into the fountains to cool off on a hot Spring day. There are tons of shops around as well as eateries. Every city center should have places like this!!!
Great free activity for anyone,"Very surprised to see this lagoon free of charge and actually in good condition.Lifeguards on duty during daylight hours, water fountain in the deep end of the lagoon. Shallow part for children/non-swimmers. Shop, cafes and toilets available aswell as green space for a great full day out."
Great free of charge facility,"Well thought out facility for public to enjoy. Ideally located. Water was clean. A really scenic recreational place, great photography venue."
Cairns safe both day and night,The esplanade lagoon is terrific. Felt  safe walking around day and night. Markets are terrific and stall holders are friendly and welcoming. Family friendly.
As good as a lagoon can be,Its a shame that you cannot swim in most places along the coastline up north.  The lagoon is an epicentre of activity in Cairns City.
A Spring morning in the sun,We arrived in Cairns early to allow us an hour on the Esplanade around the lagoon. There is so much happening to view and experience before Cairns livens up. We strolled around the lagoon enjoying the warmth of the rising sun and the exercise. Life in Cairns this time of the year has so much to offer and it doesn‚Äôt have to cost $s. What a wonderful way to start a new day in Cairns üòÄüåüüåüüíú
Super Pool. ,"How lucky are the people of Cairns. This pool and surrounds are the best public baths I've seen. Friends and family in WA should be very jealous. Cooling, crystal clear and clean water. Well maintained and  has a life guard on duty. Loved it."
Safe relaxing place,"Life guard on duty, which is great considering the amount of little children.Easy access into the lagoon. Beautifully cool on a hot day, plenty of shade.Change rooms and lockers available"
Great attraction and facilities ,What a great asset to Cairns residents and visitors.Clean large pool in the shape of QueenslandFriendly environment surrounded by lush tropical gardens and seaviews of the foreshore.Great for those warm days.
Cairns seafront,"The lagoon is a good, safe place to be in the water, lots of different pools from babies to grownup kids.  A wonderful holiday atmosphere with places to bar-b-que, the fires/grills are there and free to use just bring your own food..... good day for families"
Wonderful attraction,What an amazing water park for all to enjoy. Loved the sand base and from city side looks like as infinity pool. So nice to see all the family groups enjoying themselves in the pool and surrounding park. Fabulous amenities and barbed he facilities.
Unbelievable!,"What is this!? This is amazing!! A massive lagoon type pool right on the Esplanade, complete with white sand and lifeguards! No pool where you‚Äôre staying? No problem, just take a wander down the Esplanade! üòÇ Never seen anything like it! Brilliant!"
Vacation ,Awsome place to swim and walk around the boardwalk and shopping too. Bbq also available great for big party events love it
Great for people watching ,"This public pool is huge and surrounded by much grass to soak up the sun. Sometimes you wonder though, if you should tell someone that they are really getting fried! But it might seem to be a crude come-on. This is not a lap pool though, just a place to cool off. Enjoy!"
IT‚ÄôS FREE !,"Beautiful man made lagoon, safe for kids, small beach for sandcastles, surrounded by trees and grass with picnic tables and BBQ hutsWonderful for familiesFood , ice cream nearby. Saturday market stalls with the usual , but not bad quality.The esplanade itself is very pleasant, a lot of walkers, joggers walking along the pathway shaded by trees , the ocean is the other side of the breakwater, with the yacht basin within walking distance"
WOW!!!,What a fantastic recreational area to have in the city. Spent all day here just relaxing and unwinding.
Very nice ,"Great large free outdoor swimming pool, near the harbor.  Nice place to hang out on a hot day.  Bring your swimsuit.  As I recall  there were lifeguards."
Great addition to Cairns,"What a fantastic area to have in the Cairns area.  BBQ‚Äôs, Picnic areas, seats and of course the lagoon. Very impressive for The benefit of tourists and locals."
Great place to relax,"This was a nice surprise, its quite large and starts off shallow getting to a depth of 1.85m at the end. Lots of grass to lay on and some sand for little kids. There are public toilets close by with showers and a little shop although all the cafes and shops are only a few minutes walk away."
Wonderful!!!!,"We love the esplanade lagoon! Its appropriate for all ages and is a wonderful facility. Its clean, plenty of shade and a visit to Cairns isn't complete without a swim here"
Great for kids,"remember to bring the swim wear when visiting this place.  it is a great place for kids as they can spend hours on end here.  there are life guards there so it is pretty safe.  there is also a change room and a number of BBQ areas around the lagoon.  best thing about the Cairns Esplanade Lagoon is that it is free.  great for family outings.the weather was cool when we visited late August.if you did not bring anything to cook, the Cairns Night Markets is close by to grab a bite."
"So nice, can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs FREE!",Our family went at around 5:30 in the evening. There was only a few people swimming compared to the afternoon when there was a lot of people swimming. The water was cool but refreshing. The location is great! There‚Äôs bathrooms/changing rooms right there. Also the police are located right there. There‚Äôs plenty of close parking close by as well as picnic tables and grills. It‚Äôs neat that there‚Äôs a sandy beach-like area at one side of the pool. I saw several shallow areas for little ones to enjoy. It‚Äôs so nice that we were shocked that it‚Äôs free.
Great place for kids and place for parents to relax,"We didn't know how dangerous the beaches could be in Austraila so it was nice to play at a ""beach"" near the hotel.  The water wasn't too deep so didn't have to worry about the kids."
Mid day splash,"Went for a dip to cool off, was very busy and difficult to find a place to sit. Clean toilet facilities with warm showers and lockers outside.Pool itself is quite large with small beach like areas for small children to play. Max depth is 1.1m so not bad for children from 5 years with swimming experience. There are small trees dotted around to obtain shade etc... If you can get one!Free entry is bonus with small Cafe for coffee, ice-cream and snacks. Overall nice place for few hours to cool off."
Beautiful ,"The  area around here is just beautiful. Alot of planning has gone into here catering for all ages,  so pretty has everything you need, toilets bbqs picnic area right across from the main street, definitely worth a visit"
Great family fun,A very good set up for everyone to enjoy. Surrounded by grass areas that are perfect for picnics!The lagoon is under watch by lifeguard so it‚Äôs safe and family friendly
Afternoon/evening stroll,"This place is great. Lots of people being active outdoors. Big pool. Skate park. Beach volleyball etc.Restaurants across the street. Place was humming...but peaceful as well. Well lit into the evening, so jo worries there either.Took me maybe less than 30 minutes strolling from hotel to other end near the casino.Nice walk!"
The Gem of the Boardwalk!,"I went for a wonderful walk down the boardwalk, enjoying what it had to offer but wondering where the beach was, seems there isn't much in the way of beach here BUT then I found the lagoon, and all the people! What a killer pool! It has sand it has beautifully clear water and lifeguards! Surrounded by trees and extended pretty much right up to the sea wall this is the real gem of the boardwalk! Cairns knows how to do public amenity and they have it all on show along this stretch topped off with this cherry! Well done is all I can say! Wouls Highly reccomend Cairns due to this atmosphere catalysing pocket of community good vibes!"
Free and safe,"Located at the southern end of the Esplanade, the Lagoon is a clean and large artificial ‚Äúpool‚Äù where it is far better and safer to wade and swim in than in the sea (and mud when the tide is out) where dangerous jellyfish stingers and other marine creatures can be found.  It‚Äôs surrounded by lush green gardens and grassed areas.  It‚Äôs also a nice place to visit at daybreak when it is quiet and relaxing."
Quick swim whilst cruise docked,"Place was clean, had a lifeguard on, water was crystal clear and wonderful to swim in when you couldn‚Äôt swim in the Daintree river (crocodiles). Can get busy with children, but is a very nice sunspot for sunbathing too!"
Nice pool,"Huge community pool.  Lots of room to either lay-out in the sand, or on the grass, or just sit ‚Äòpoolside.‚Äô   The lagoon is right on the shore, with a walking path separating the beach from the pool.  It was for everyone, as there were all kinds of people swimming, sunbathing, relaxing, or just sipping their toes in the water.  Great for families and kids, as well as adults looking for a big pool to relax by/in.   I loved it, and spent half a day sitting in the water."
Relax,Very nice place to swim relax have fun and see people. You can buy a nice meal and eat or prepare it there. Even toilets ans showers are there. You just have fun!
Fantastic place to spemd the day,"Great  immovation by the vouncil. Safe swimming for all ages. Shade and sand as well as a lifesaver on duty most times Clean amenities, kiosk and be too."
Safe swimming all year ,Cairns beachfront is really muddy and could have crocodiles or stingers. There is absolutely no way anyone could swim there. The local council has built this attractive big pool that even has a small sand beach. A lifesaver is also in daytime attendance. Very popular with locals and visitors
Super fun and clean ,"We just randomly walked into the lagoon and wasn‚Äôt prepared to swim but the kids were to excited and jumped into the pool with their underwear! It was lots of fun, not crowded and safe to play. The man-made beach was relaxing and beautiful. Had a great time before we headed to lunch nearby, convenient spot!"
Very nice concept ,We found the idea of a public pool quite interesting. Very well thought through from local authorities.
Awesome place for a swim,"Loved being able to have a swim in a pool that was clean and free from predators. Beautiful place, well designed and well maintained"
Excellent facility!!,"Visited the cairns esplanade one morning when we just wanted a couple of hours to relax. All I can say is wow!! What an exceptional facility and free of charge. So beautiful to swim in the salt water and look over the sea, as there‚Äôs no beach in Cairns itself."
A great place for infants and young children to play.,"A Cairns council initiative, free to be used by the public. toilet and other amenities facilities and change rooms are provided and our excellent. The actual swimming pool is huge, clean, well looked after, with great facilities nearby. The shallow gradient and various depths in the pool with fountains in the Cairns tropical weather is something that little children love!"
Nice for younger kids,This is great for younger kids or if you just can‚Äôt be bothered driving to the beach. It was clean and kids had a good time
Very good location in Winter months,"Victoria, NSW, SA, Tasmania, NZ people who suffer winter weather should go to Cairns. Cairns Esplanade lagoon is perfect place to relax, have a warm water swim etc. Well maintained with life guards on watch, young & not so young can enjoy the vast area of water.Cafes and ther facilities are closely located."
Looks like lots of Fun,Families and all can enjoy a safe swim in the center of Cairns.  All hours of the day for sure.  Close to the Night Markets as well
Chill out ,"Spent several hours down at the lagoon, this place is great and the kids can run a muck... very clean and lots of seating and BBQ facilities"
Lovely family area,Well designed family area. Lots of barbecue areas. Life guards on duty. Plenty of seats in shade around the pool. No charge to use the facilities.
Superb Place to Cool Off,"I found this wonderful oasis in the heart of Cairns to be such an idyllic place for people of all ages to relax, wind down & cool off.  Magnificently located in the hub of all the bars, restaurants & cafes, a person could not wish for more.  Especially on a holiday, not to mention the lucky souls who live & work in beautiful Cairns."
What a bonus!,"This is a fantastic community, free resource. It ia clean, safe with life guards and great fun. You should be really proud, Cairns!"
Nothing special,"Nothing special ...not missing out on anything. I didn't feel safe with my kids, left as soon as I could."
Such a great spot,This is such a lovely safe and clean spot to take kids. If you‚Äôre worried about stingers in the ocean this is a good option. We took a picnic and had a great day although I did realise other than a sandwich bar selling healthy treats there was no other food outlets - other than Mac Donald‚Äôs across the street there didn‚Äôt appear to be any other food options.
Kids loved it,A must do if you have children. A must do to come and watch the sunrise too. They close the area on a Wednesday until 12pm for cleaning etc.
Relaxed Entertainment ,"What a fantastic venue for any age.Great swimming conditions, grass areas and beach sand areas. Shaded and non shaded areas depending what you like. Lifeguards present which is great. Take a picnic or grab some food from the local cafes."
Beautiful free swimming pool at the beach!,"This pool is free, clean and supervised. Suitable for children to play, but also adults for more serious swimming. It has beautiful art as fountains and looks like a lagoon."
Awesome area! ,"We stopped off with my toddler son after going the aquarium and ended up spending a good couple of hours here. He enjoyed just picking up sans and moving it to other places mostly!! It was clean, refreshing, had a lifeguard and there was even a ska band playing great music at the bandstand just along the way. A fun, chilled atmosphere made for a lovely family afternoon. I hope to return again soon and wish we had something similar in Adelaide."
Great seaside ‚Äòpool‚Äô,The lagoon is a huge pool with some water features and is free and open to the public. We didn‚Äôt actually swim but its right downtown with a view of the sea. The lagoon sits in a park setting so this would be a great place to spend a family day.
Favourite swimming place for 2 year old.,"Great spot for swimming especially children. It has water fountains, sand, water, grass, shade , amenities, cafes. Excellent central location. Very busy on weekends. Fabulous in the mornings."
Great Attraction,"This is certainly a must to visit when you go to Cairns.  The pool is free to use and there are change rooms and toilets nearby.  Very popular with back-packers,Amazingly there is a sandy bottom to the pool but the water is crystal clear.You can lay in the water or on the surrounding area and gaze out over the ocean.  Watch the ships coming in and out of the harbour.  Spectacular lights at night.Lots of restaurants and food outlets just across the road.We found the water lovely although the locals were wearing jumpers !"
Great for Kids ,What an awesome place. The mudflats rule the foreshore Of Cairns. But the Lagoon is just perfect. It breaks it up and is absolutely fantastic. If they want to go the next step it would have to look at Brisbane‚Äôs Lagoon. Well done Cairns for transforming the area into something useful and amazing.
Landmark feature,"The aesthetic esplanade lagoon is a defining part of the foreshore tying together the township, boardwalk, gardens and estuary to present an integrated identity that helps make Cairns unique. It becomes both a focus and a locus for foreshore activity and helps make Cairns a place for people."
Simple yet beautiful,"The Cairns Esplanade and lagoon is very beautiful. It's and the lagoon has lifeguards who keep a sharp eye out for people while in the man made lagoon. There are toilets and changing rooms, and barbeques free of use. The sunsets are to die for."
Lovely spot for a swim! ,"Enjoyed a nice dip with my partner and the lagoon yesterday. A great place to relax, enjoy the sun & go for a swim."
The Esplanade Lagoon...... A great place for a kid to find friends....,"We had been advised not to swim in the waters of Trinity Beach by a few locals and so we decided to visit The Lagoon at the Esplanade on two different occasions instead.  The Lagoon is a really nice place to visit while in Australia because it is a great place for kids to play, there are lots of shops and restaurants, it is family friendly, and FREE.  During the weekend you can even listen to some live entertainment.  My son enjoyed swimming, building sandcastles but more importantly he was happy to meet four nice friends while on holiday.  The kids played for at least two hours building sandcastles and just having fun.  The Lagoon is a wonderful place to visit for both kids and adults alike and should definitely be included on your list of activities specifically if you have children.  Remember to wear sunscreen, bring swimming goggles, and a beach towel.  Lockers are readily available and restrooms with changing facilities are near the Lagoon."
Wonderful place along the water,This is a free area in Cairns. Lifeguards ok duty all the time. We did not actually swim when there (it was too cold and windy). But we loved the open space and the vibe. Would have spent more time there if weather was nicer. But do go. Great public place.
Great Venue,"We love Cairns, it's the capital of the Tropical North, but strangely the city doesn't have a nice beach. Not to let that stand in the way of creating a pleasant atmosphere, the council (we presume) created this Lagoon on The Esplanade, and it's really nice. Well done Cairns."
Safe Place to Swim,Perfectly located as it was a short and easy walk from my hotel. Free to use and totally safe from crocs and stingers! Can get busy when the weather is hot. Really lovely place to have a swim or to relax by the lagoon. Plenty of shops and cafes nearby too!
Nice place to experience sunset,"We stopped by with a 4 year old later in the day, and it was lovely and warm, the pool was busy, lots of people strolling by which was fine, wasn't too keen on letting the toddler run around with the teens having some ""moments"" in the pool, but as a free experience, it was great."
Safe from the Crocs!,"You can't go swimming in the sea in Cairns due to the crocodiles, so this is great place for families to go and cool down whilst having fun."
Fabulous swimming in patrolled pool,"Free public lagoon pool in central Cairns. Kids of all ages, as well as adults will love this. Tropical garden setting. Plenty of shade and nearby cafes and restaurants. Perfect place to cool off."
Great way to spend time and relax,"Shade options, shallow areas as well as deep areas. Clean. Toilet facilities available nearby. We really enjoyed hanging out here on our holidays."
A Gem in the City!,"We spent the day here today with our 9 year old and had the loveliest of days,  the lagoon is warm, there is shade though. Lifeguards all around. Toilets and cafes and restaurants nearby. Super safe and just perfect."
Walking about ,"Great place to explore. Plenty of shade, places to sit, shopping close by Watch the helicopters come in and out."
Day out in Cairns,"Love this place, have been to Australia four  times now & have visited Cairns three times, i will visit this beautiful part of Australia  hopefully another time if i venture here again ‚ù£Ô∏è"
Great safe place to swim,"Located downtown, the pool is a lovely place to relax and enjoy the water. Many safe ways to enter and very easy for young children to enjoy. Change rooms were great. A great free way to enjoy some time in Cairns."
Nice place to swim! ,Clean pool with great outlook over Cairns esplanade. Very nice.There are plenty of tables and BBQs surrounding the pool so you can make a day of it relaxing by the pool in the park.
Nice chill,"Sadly carins does not have a lovely beach front. But luckily for this open pool area it's great! It's free to anyone passing by! Life guards, toilets, lockers, shops all around. Pool is clean and warm, open till 9pm and looks beautiful on the evenings. You can sit by the sand or the grass you choose! It's a great idea and I spent all days sunbathing here, was perfect for a chilled day :)"
Great place to spend the afternoon for free,"A lovely pool with no entry cost, incredible place to spend time in the pool or sunbathing for free all day. A family friendly environment through the day but also a nice place for backpackers or older people to swim in the evening."
A free pool provided by the city of Cairns,"Overlooking the ocean, this is a great swimming pool and is huge. Plenty of space for all and has coffee chops and eateries right at the pool. Great for kids with many shallow areas for kids, but watch them because there are some deep sections. Even has shaded areas in the pool and a sand beach."
Free swimming - beautiful site,Unfortunately our visit clashed with the pool's cleaning morning - so check before you go. It was closed until 12.00 so we waited in a local caf√© with a coffee for a while. Beautiful infinity style pool overlooking the ocean. Plenty of shade on the grass to keep sheltered from the sweltering sun. Gentle sandy slope into the water and also a shaded area in the pool if required. Toilets/changing rooms and cafes close by. Well worth a visit.
A must in the heat,A great place to relax throughout the day. Not very populated in the early AM or evening which IMO are the best times to go due to the sun. I got burnt very badly here despite putting on sunscreen multiple times. Be careful and make sure to reapply!
Perfect place to chill with friends,"Your Accomodation doesn‚Äôt feature a pool? No sweat. The Lagoon on the Esplanade is the perfect spot to relax and splash about. It is:- clean and family friendly with a play-beach on one side- warm as you‚Äôd expect the ocean to be- open 8AM-10PM and for free! incl. shower facilities - the perfect place to hang out with friends and family with many covered tables and benches to protect from sun or rainshowers- perfect picnic-spot in town: free BBQ facilities, free cooking gas and lovely lawns- on the Esplanade, so close to grab ice cream or coffee- also: lifeguard on dutyDefinitely visit when in Cairns. Enjoy!"
Great place to swim and relax,"The cairns esplanade lagoon is a great place for locals, families and tourists to swim, relax and enjoy the beauty of the region!"
Perfect place in cairns ! ,"I‚Äôve been there with my boyfriend and it‚Äôs very clean, sunny, beautiful, well equipped ! Perfect for family, couple, everybody !!"
Amazin,This place is paradise.Located in Cairns centre the lagoon is crystal clear and blue. We were there on a sunny day so the place was busy but not too overcrowded. Toilets and changing rooms are on site too. Well worth a visit and its free!!!
Cairns Esplanade Lagoon,"Beautiful pool in a great location, , clean and a great public asset. The facilities are good and it's a great place to relax."
Great ,Into grandson and I thoroughly enjoyed our time. Splashing and frolicking in the water. We will be returning
Sunday morning Walkabout,"Great Family oriented facility, suitable to all ages, abilities & all nationalities. Sunday is a very popular day."
Stunning,"What an amazing place this is. There is a kids area, water fountains, day beds, plenty of shade and the shops are just across the road to grab some lunch. I just love it."
You have to visit this landmark swimming pool,I really appreciate cairns built this beautiful swimming pool! Me and my wife swam in the morning. We admired nice atmosphere and place.
ENJOYABLE,"what a perfect area to layback and relax with the lapping water over your feet, this area is the perfect family area, there are BBQ, seating undercover and a canteen, the shops are close by if needed. the pool has areas for babies, toddlers and kids to swim and to let you feel safe, there are life guards on patrol, these guards patrol the waters to make sure everyone is safe,  (they aren't baby setters!  so you have to look after your own kids, so don't just dump your kids there and go off.) this is a family place,"
Best thing in cairns ,My toddler loved it . What s great time and it‚Äôs so large she can run around without too many people . Shallow and clean . They play music here too and we joined in on the water exercise later that day . Cairns is fun
Lovely area,"Lovely area of Cairns to sit, walk or swim. Very pleasant to spend some time here. And it is free! Nice walk from the lagoon along the boardwalk."
Amazing,Love the lagoon. It‚Äôs huge. Plenty of shade whilst your swimming if you want to get out of the sun. Great way to cool off. Open until late. Forget about booking a hotel with pool - you‚Äôre just going to want to swim here.
Love the Lagoon,"The lagoon is so beautiful located next to the ocean! Beautiful view, and what a joy to soak in the water and enjoy the sunset after a day trip. Great for all ages, especially families! Wish I had brought my kids here when they we're yong."
It is great. And it is free. ,"Let‚Äôs face it Cairns doesn‚Äôt pretend to be a seaside resort but the lagoon gives anyone, young or old, the opportunity for a relaxing  swim  or paddle. With shallow entrance if required. Sandy entrance if required and lockers for hire for a few dollars. Great for all with lifeguards on site. And it‚Äôs free!"
Win win!! ,The beach at Cairns is not somewhere you would swim - the warning signs about crocodiles are somewhat of a deterrent! The Lagoon on the esplanade allows you to swim & sunbathe in safety & with a sea view!! A win win situation.
Beautiful ,I had lived in Cairns 40 years ago when the Esplanade-was a mangrove. It‚Äôs now a beautiful safe place to swim . Free and impressively clean and warm. Worth a visit .
Clean and great aqua aerobic classes,"Lovely lagoon to swim in, as you can‚Äôt swim in the sea in Cairns. They do free aqua aerobic classes here too."
Wonderful Community Pool,"Wow, talk about Cairns providing a gorgeous and safe place for residents and tourists to swim in.  This is the best public pool place that I have ever seen!"
Lovely pool,This was just what we needed to offset the heat and humidity of Cairns.An good sized infinity pool overlooking the bay it shallows to just a few centimetres at the inland end and is perfect just to stroll thro in bare feet.It wasn‚Äôt too busy when we visited .
Great fun and safe,Given the number of salt water crocodiles in the area it is best to use the lagoon. Very clean with lots of space and it is near to the shops for supplies.
"Fantastic, clean & Free!","We had booked a trip to cairns long before we knew about the lagoon, but as we spoke to more and more people who saw us with a little one l, they said how perfect it is and how much we‚Äôd enjoy it.And that we did! It‚Äôs fantastic! First of all it‚Äôs public so I had assumed it‚Äôs kinda ‚Äúskanky‚Äù but it‚Äôs so clean both in the water and the surrounding area I was shocked. It has a super general ramp I  from end to end. At its deepest it‚Äôs 1.5 m. But there plenty of places along the sides to just sit and relax.It‚Äôs a great place to bring a picnic or even someFood to put on the free public barbecues.The toilets and showers are a bit on the other side of the ‚Äúsuper clean‚ÄùScale but still helpful nonetheless.We spent almost a full day here so you can imagine how happy we were this was available to us."
really nice spot to sit and relax and cool off,"The lagoon is just that, looks like a nice beach, sand and all, but shallow.  Lots of folks bring their kids, 20 somethings sit in the shade and chill.  Us old folks, well, we wander thru, hoping to find a shady spot, usually just cooling off in the water.  stop by and enjoy!"
Free and a great way to stay cool,"Easy walking distance from the cruise ship terminal. Lifeguards on duty and clean. Different depths and a fountain. A great place to cool off in the hot, tropical North of Queensland. There's plenty of shade and dining options close by."
Good value hotel next to cairns hospital,"Very good reasonably priced hotel. I had an accident at port Douglas and needed treatment at cairns hospital. This hotel next door and good for family to stay for hospital. Room quite big so enabled crutches. Staff ok but didn‚Äôt seem to be enough people to man the front desk and quite a wait to leave our luggage, however were helpful and can recommend as a good hotel for your stay in cairns. Would stay again!"
Lovely place to relax. ,"This place is a lovely place to just chill and relax and take a dip, when the sun gets to hot. Lovely views"
Hours of fun for the kids,Fantastic location to relax with the kids of all ages. Safe. Clean. Plenty of space. Shaded areas. Lifeguards on-site.
Explored lovely lagoon,Visited the lagoon at evening.. Great place to visit.. Lovely sea view giving an ideal combo of pool with beach and sea
A place to go if you have free time in Cairns,"With a nice view near the beach, the pool is quite good for leisure swimming. There are place for sun bath and also clean and convenience changing room and showers nearby. Locker also available at a rent AUS $2 /hour."
Must see attraction.,"Exactly what a tropical location with no swimable beach needs.  It's fantastic and free,  the pool is large with sand beach areas as well as fountains. There are large grassed areas to relax on and pleanty of facilities like toilets, showers and bbqs. When I went it was not crowded and was very relaxing... Life guards are on duty and it's open all year."
Beautiful,We swam in the lagoon on the full moon just magical and free! You can use the lockers nearby... the water is filtered so no worries about jelly fish and sharks! Wonderful place and very romantic in the evening
Beautiful Cairns,"Just visited cairns after 20 years , I must say that what they have done with the beach front is just magic ! Gorgeous beach , fantastic bbqs , a great place to walk or ride a bike Gardens are so beautiful! Also great restaurants, and shop people are so friendly Thank you CAIRNS! I‚Äôll be back *****"
Don‚Äôt loose your time,Definitely there are much better places to visit in Cairns. The lagoon is not as pretty as it looks in the pictures and is very crowded.
Great for all the family. ,"Great time at the lagoon. Can swim all day, have a BBQ in the evening, can listen to free live music on weekends sun bath with your friends or just relax and chill all by yourself."
Free activity for the kids,"You honestly feel like you're atvthe beach, but a little safer.It is very crowded alot of the time.The baby area up one emd is usually very quiet"
Absolutely fantastic,"The lagoon is just excellent. There are plently of zoned areas, there is sand, there are deeper areas, there are fountains. The water temperature was more like getting in to a bath than a pool This is just a superb facility that Cairns should be very proud of. There are toilets, changing areas, showers, lockers, a cafe. There are plently of shaded areas both in and out of the water. We visited a number of time during our stay in Cairns but should have really visited every day - it was that good! Our 1 year old and 3 year old adored it and asked to 'go to the lagoon'. Fab!! Definitely go!"
Wonderful at night,"My wife and I had a lovely swim at night in the lagoon. It's suitable for all, had two lifeguards and great fun."
Great Place,"This is a great place for all the family of you are wanting a swim and a bbq in the park , their are life guards on duty, the water is warm , and it‚Äôs a great place if you have little kids . A must to do, we couldn‚Äôt stay too long as the day was very wet"
Absolutely stunning place to go,Feel like I own the place/Cairns. We had few rainy days whilst staying in Cairns and it has cleared up so went for swimming at night. How beautiful the place is. Light was glowing side of the wall and was beautifully presented. Depth was just good enough for my kids to enjoy. Atmosphere was awesome and safe guard were doing their job promptly so felt so safe.
The lagoon is a great addition to the Esplanade and I was impressed how clean and,"I lived here for 17 years and the esplanade was pretty well mud flats. The lagoon and picnic area is a huge attraction, and I was impressed by the cleanliness of the pool, the free bbq's, and the grassed areas. The landscaping is awesome and well maintained. We had a swim around lunchtime the day we arrived, then went back in late afternoon for a family bbq and night swim. It was just beautiful."
Just relax,Great place for a walk and to enjoy the sunset. The kids have played all arvo on the kids playground. It was a great time!
Get together with family from Melbourne ,"My nephews loved the lagoon, it was clean and I noticed the life guards were fully aware of what was going on around them.Have used the BBQ in the past, ger there early so you can get a table."
Refreshing escape,This was a nice surprise and big enough for a large volume of people. Shallow areas for those weak swimmers and deeper for others. Life guards on the ready with a sandy area for children to play. Very refreshing on a hot day with a lovely outlook to the esplanade.
Super spot!,"The lagoon is fabulous firstly because it is free!  It's very clean and has lifeguards on duty who were friendly and supervised diligently every time we visited.  It's quite large so that even on busy days it doesn't feel too crowded.  Although we only visited on weekdays in the school holidays - not on weekends.  There are toilets, showers and lockers available.  Definitely a great spot to while away a few hours."
Wonderful like Infinity Pool,"This is great so safe and clean with nice clean area for changing, showering, even lockers to rent. Life guards on duty to keep everyone safe.  No worries about any crocodiles here... not very deep but pretty large area so not feel Crowded. Grassy area and a little sand area as well. Felt like an infinity pool although the esplanade pool way nicer than the natural beach area is. Enjoy!"
Needs more security ,We loved the look of the place from afar. On visiting we found the water quite warm on a hot day when trying to cool down. But what was most worrying was the amount of drunks and homeless just plonking themselves in the middle of families with very young children.  We watched as one security guard tried to escort one very drunk man from the area but gave up when the drunk man sat in the middle of a group of people and stealing their meat off their BBQ.
Lifeguards very strict,"Enjoyed the refreshing lagoon with my husband, 8 month old, and 3.5yr old.  A beautiful view, very clean pool.  Was disappointed when the lifeguard did not allow my 3.5yr old to utilise a zoggs swim ring, because it didnt have a seat in it.  My child was under my constant supervision the whole time so I was quite disappointed and returned to our holiday park to enjoy the pool there instead."
Cooling off in Cairns Lagoon,A relaxing cool swim in an amazing location.Plenty of shade on rhe grass to escape the sun.Well designed to allow lots of water play plus relaxing.Amazing photo opportunities over Cairns harbour.Good facilities available.
Great facilities,"What a delight to discover Cairns Lagoon. This place has fantastic amenities, large swimming area with different depths, showers, changing rooms and toilets all very clean. Barbecues are freely available and used by many. Everyone respectfully waiting their turn and ensuring they left it clean for the next person. This is all free. Well done to Cairns local authorities for providing such excellent facilities."
Nice Walk,"Great facilities, nice qalk at night when it is not too hot and the chance to see fruit bats. The night markets are near by aswell. There are also heaps information centres."
cool off with a view,"The lagoon is amazing best one we have seen by far, super clean, lifeguards on duty and police station with cameras right there. safe friendly and what a location location location, Cafes  near by, free BBQ's shade ,lights at night, right next to the boardwalk and magnificent large trees. 5 stars to Cairns."
Fantastic Pool,We love the pool lagoon. What a great concept. After our tours we would cool of at the pool. Relax and enjoy the surrounding.
Very relaxing,Every place should have one of these for when it gets too hot you can just wander into the lagoon max depth is 1.5 mts it is well serviced with lifeguards and facilities
Cairns Lagoon,One of the best things about cairns. We were there for 5 days and spent most of it sitting by the lagoon Great for all ages There are bbqs around the area which are free to use as well Plenty of areas to sun bath around it as well
Beautifully clean and tidy,This water areas were pristine and fun to be at with a great ambiance created by the families and other people there.
A Public Bath. ,"A public bath, that‚Äôs what it is. Many homeless people use this ‚Äòpool‚Äô as a place to get clean. On the hot days it‚Äôs packed, and not too pleasant really. Good place to cool off though!"
Nice,"One of the central places in Cairns. More than just a place to swim. Lifeguards on duty, quite clean. Onsite toilets and a cafe. Grills can be used to cook your own food"
"Clean, relaxing and safe","Lovely area, pool with life guards, suitable for a range of children and young adult ages. Sports facilities, play grounds and public toilets all within a clean and safe area."
Must try and relax ,We were there almost every day because for the ocean was some jellyfish alert. It is super clean and great. In near you can find a lot of BBQ facilities for free. Maybe they could add some more lockers for rent. Good job done by local community.
Free beautiful area,A wonderful open area with huge pool and outdoor area in the CBD. Plenty of shade and BBQ areas. Suitable for all ages. Very clean amenities with plenty of toilets & showers
Place to refresh ,"Nice place in town centre, great place in this time of the year - December , as you can‚Äôt swim in the beach because of the stingers. Clean With life guardsEntertainers on evening Great if you are with kids Shower and WC facilities BBQ stands Shops and cafes around as well"
My grandson loves it . Think they jump in with their shorts on,Everyone who was at the lagoon were having a great time. Great for parents with young babies as the can sit in the pool with them.
Nice Swimming area.,"I like to swim here, it is large and contains different depths that allow people of different heights to stand up in. A large sandy area that children and adults can play in, as well as fountains to play in. If children don't wish to use this area, try Muddy's playground just a bit further up. It seems like a fun waterpark."
Highly recommend,I visit lagoon with my kids every weekend and Kids always have fun playing and swimming on lagoon. Very well maintained and always under supervision of staff. I have 3 months old to 4 years old kids and I can have fun with all of them at one place üëçüèª
Free pool,One of the great things about cairns the lagoon. Its a must see for any local or tourist. Great place to meet people or have a family bbq. Which is all free.
Great Spot,Visited on Saturday 8th September. It was good to see so many people using this man made pool beside the main beach. Cairns has the perfect weather all year round just a pity nature didn't provide a pristine beach as well.
Great place to spend a few hours. ,Clean. Plenty of space and a nice stretch of water to cool off in with no bloody feat of getting eaten or mutilated.
Man made beach...,"I thought it would be weird swimming in such a public place... but I was wrong. This is basically a public pool (a clean one) with sand banks that re create a beach. Aside from the fact that the actual beach does not look good, there are a number of indigenous creatures that can seriously hurt you (crocs, crabs, jellyfish) living there.No contest. Man-made beach wins all the time."
A great swimming area or sunbathing place,"The lagoon or outdoor swimming area was great. Well kept, clean no litter and very relaxing and safe.There were four lifeguards at any time supervising.The best lagoon I have been to for some time. Great for children and families as well as couple or individuals"
Nice spot,One has to wonder why no one swims in the sea just to be told of crocs and murky water and while a bit nervous going even near the sea learned that a beautiful lagoon located near the park and in front of the city-that we can swim in..hangout and its safe.
Free cool-down üòé ,Lovely clean water to swim in for free. You can sit on grass near the water and swim in shallow but cool water under sprinklers. Fun for kids as there‚Äôs sand running into the water. Great for this time of the year!
One of the best things about Cairns (and there's plenty to choose from),"The Cairns Esplanade is simply stunning. It has watering holes and eating establishments aplenty across the road and plenty of grassy parks and trees, children's play area adjacent to a spectacular Lagoon. The iconic 'flying fish' sculpture in the middle of the lagoon backs onto a walkway and ocean. The water is warm, not too deep and surrounded by decks and even a sandy beach-like area with some sail-cloth cover. The Cairns climate lends itself to swimming opportunities and this one is exceptional. There are facilities to keep valuables, life-guards, and parking areas. Each time I go I spend my happy hours just soaking up both the sun and the scenery. Brilliant!"
Cool down and Relax,This is one of my favorite lagoons that we have visited in recent times. Very much kid friendly with life guards on duty for everyone's safety.I might stand corrected but I think every Wednesday you can participate in group water aerobics and at the time of afternoon that the class is run the pool is packed which is a great sight to see.
Cool down at the esplanade ,The lagoon on the esplanade is a fantastic idea especially in these scorching temperatures. The whole area is divine allowing outdoor barbecues and some outdoor gym activities as well as a Saturday park run. Highly recommend cooling down your evenings with a walk or run on the esplanade and a dip in the lagoon.
Awesome community pool,"Very clean, ideally located on the Esplanade,  with lots of food and amenities surrounding closely. Toilet was very clean and well stocked, so job well done Cairns Council. Would happily bring the family down for a dip, as it was better than the hotel pool."
In the heart of the town,It‚Äôs a great place to cool down and relax great views of the beach and near to restaurants and bars. We had a lovely swim and enjoyed relaxing in the area afterwards
We love the lagoon,"A Cairns must do. When we were in Cairns this week we experienced one of the hottest days in a long time and the Lagoon provided sweet relief from the elements. There is the right amount of shade for the sun conscience. It was also excellent to see the life guard looking out for a young tourist who had left her bag out of sight and unattended, advising her to put it where it can be seen or in a locker."
Great Place for Families!,The lagoon is a great place for all ages. Kids will enjoy swimming in the shallow protected waters of the lagoon and there are plenty of excellent places around it for picnics.
A treasure of Cairns ,"What a beautiful place to relax, spent time in the water cooling down from the blazing sun & wonderful facilities such as bbq stations. Very clean & a favourite place to go since coming to Aus."
Holiday,The Lagoon in Cairns was fantastic. The water was lovely and warm and had different depths for swimming. There is a sandy beach leading onto the lagoon. It is surrounded by lovely parkland. Good cafeteria serving hot drinks and food . The toilets are very clean . Please note you will need 4 au dollars for the lockers. It is computerised so you Pre pay and digitally will be given a number to put on the computer. The lagoon leads to a nice walkway along the esplanade .
"Large, Man-made Lagoon That's Very Popular with Locals and Tourists.","This is a beautiful place to spend a few hours especially if you have children.  The lagoon is 4800 square metres of salt water with a very shallow end to a deeper end.  Lifeguards are present during normal hours of operation.  Very clean washrooms, lockers and even BBQs are nearby. Open year-round and close to restaurants and other attractions.The city have a lot of vision when they built this popular attraction!"
a  city pearl,"great idea of a lagoon kissing the sea with no jelly fish ,clean,served for free all people during day time.very friendly,all services included all for free"
Oasis in the city. Great place to cool off.,"Beautiful free pool in the heart of Cairns, with the best scenery. Great place to meet up with friends on the esplanade with a great variety of resterunts and eaterys across the road. Pool has a life guard, childrens play area and sandy beach area. Pool, amenities, and surounds are exceptionally clean. A cool visit when in Cairns."
Amazing!!!!,"This is an amazing facility that the local government should be given the highest praise for! A free CLEAN swimming pool in the centre of town. You will also find: clean toilets, shaded areas, grass areas, free BBQs, lifeguards, security, alcohol free zone, varying depths in the pool from toddler to 1.5m deep. It overlooks the waterfront, so has a stunning vista. The water was warm when we visited, I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs the sun or manually warmed/cooled year round. 9pm closure which is enforced by security guards. Lots of food options straight across the road. The odd busker providing light entertainment. I can‚Äôt recommend this stop enough! üëçüëçüëç"
Spectacular big lagoon...,"This is a great facility. We were there on a very hot day and it was super busy. Clean looking water, perfect for dipping the feet. There was music being played, and it was very relaxing."
Great for chill time,"Great fun. Sand at one side for kids, water fountains, and deep area. Grass at side to sit, with free bbq areas and benches. Public toilets nearby. Please be aware you are not allowed noodles (swim tubes) lilos or any sort of inflatables in water except for arm bands.No balls or items that can be thrown."
Fantastic ,"A beautiful lagoon, with lifeguards, right in the heart of town.  What more could you ask for? Good job Cairns Council"

Awesome lagoon ,"After such a hot weekend, it was amazing to be walking along the esplanade and to go for a quick dip in the lagoon and keep going. Everyone enjoyed it, especially the kids!"
Always beautiful ,We always enjoy a visit to the Esplanade Lagoon but this time we found that it is actually a map of Queensland when looked at from above. Extra beautiful!
Beautiful ,"Brilliant place to go for a swim any time of the day! Seemed clean and safe, with lifeguards keeping a close watch on people swimming."
"""Amazing Lagoon right on the Esplanade"".",This attraction is amazing. Who needs to swim in the beach? So safe for the kids as it is patrolled. Alongside it is a large park which is shady and attracts a lot of families. In the park there is also free entertainment by local bands and also a market with homemade merchandise. I highly recommend this area for all ages and I think it is great for families.
Great addition to Cairns,"Lovely pool, perfect for cooling off and chilling out! Very clean, shallow sections for kids and a choice of sandy and tiled sections."
No Stingers Just Swimmers !,"A really good & necessary attraction considering the tides, stingers etc. Great to see no nappy kiddies this time around ? Lots of activities with free water aerobics etc. and lots of shaded areas to relax and lifeguards on duty ! Great for families to enjoy a BBQ & a Dip !"
Great for family fun and bbq,Really nice lagoon style pool right on the Esplanade.Would be great a great early evening activity for the family (kids swimming in the pool and parents cooking up a bbq on one of the many hotplates around the pool).
Lagoon in the city,"The lagoon is open most of the year, you can bring the family down for a refreshing dip in the hotter months or even join in to the free active living water activities on offer.  Little kids can enjoy splashing around in the water too in the shallower parts.  There is plenty of grassy shaded areas to sit and relax or read a good book, bbq areas, clean change rooms, lifeguards on duty, and a great little kiosk for an icecream."
Fantastic lagoon! Great Location!,We loved this lagoon. It's very hot in January so grateful that the lagoon stays open til late..  9pm I think. We went swimming at about 7pm and water was lovely and warm and still lots of family  around. Lots of music playing on the street and the markets were across the road.. had dinner there. Excellent alternative to the beach especially since I've heard that crocs and jellyfish are common up north.  Lagoon was clean and lifesavers are visible from all areas of the lagoon.
Cairn's man made lagoon,"If you dont have a pool where you are staying in Cairns (or even if you do), this is a good spot to soak up the sun and cool down. Sit on the beach sand, grass areas or sit in the pool and stare out over Cairns bay. Amenities are well appointed. Clean change rooms, toilets , bbq areas , kid friendly, life guards on watch, close to food and flea markets (weekend). Cairns has done this well."
Fantastic place to laze away a summer day,"Awesome spot. A large park on the edge of the city and the harbour. Dotted with trees and lined with restaurants for a quick snack, meal or a cocktail. The pool is shaped like a lagoon with an infinity view to the ocean. The depth ranges from millimetres for little kids to about 1.8 metres. There are public toilets and change rooms and the lagoon is patrolled by life guards. The surrounding park is beautifully maintained and lots of spots exist just to put your stuff down, sit and watch the world go by. One of the best public spaces I've ever been in. Well done Cairns."
So refreshing,Free swimming pool right on the bay. Relax with spraying art work. Big and a great way to start the day.
Cairns Lagoon: An excellent facility ,"Warm water, family friendly, free swimming location. Lagoon is open from 6am till early evening. The water is treated which is reassuring with the numbers who use it. Life guards are onsite. Shallow end for little swimmers and the deep end is 1.5m."
Cycling around Cairns,Stopped in for an ice cream and a quick swim after cycling around Cairns City. Such a lovely day a great spot to cool off.
What a fantastic place,"We loved the boardwalk and all it had to offer, including the swimming pool which was fantastic enjoyed by kids and adults it was really clean.The kids play ground and splash park were also a fabulous place to entertain young children and all for free.The surrounding gardens and toilet/Shower amenities were also clean.Well done Cairns council Victoria has nothing like this for visitors."
What a great place to swim,"Absolutely loved this idea. It is clean, big and safe with life guards on duty till late. Choice of sitting/lying on the sand that goes into the beginning of the pool/lagoon or amble room on the grass area. Bbq areas right there also so great to make a day of it. Lockers are also available to hire for just $2 for an hour so you don‚Äôt have to worry about valuables."
A gem on Cairns' Esplanade,"I understand why they need to do it in FNQ, but I really wish some of our NSW beachside councils could step up. This is great. Kids has a ball and it is even deep enough in spots for adults to cool off. Lockers available for hire at reasonable rates, change rooms with timed, warm showers. Food available, BBQ's etc. We visited late in the afternoon after having been to Kuranda and others, and the markets which are just adjacent were closing down, but there was some on street parking that was available. (There is also a parking area).It is filtered sea water, so you don't come out with stinging eyes and smelling of chlorine."
Brilliant space,Free and fun. My daughter had her bag stolen here a couple of years ago so use the lockers or one of you stay with the bags! Nice in the early evening too.
Too cold for winter,"Only stayed there for a sun bake in the afternoon, the concept of having an artificial beach in.the middle.of the city is great but the water was too cold to play in. Probably will be very popular in summer."
Family friendly swim,Great swim at the esplanade lagoon with a clean and fresh pool and change rooms nearby meant a great experience. The public free to enter pool was great fun for an hour and a half +. 5 star right here!
Cairns Esplanade Lagoon,After a walk around town what a lovely way to cool off in the Esplanade Lagoon what a bonus for Cairns and tourism. It was school holidays when we were there but still a lot of room for every body to enjoy.
Great place to cool down,We visited here several times in our 4 day stay in Cairns. The grandchildren (5 and 6 year olds) would have stayed all day but their mum and grandparents also enjoyed the swim and atmosphere a definite attraction to visit and enjoy in Cairns
Beautiful place,Cairns is truly a beautiful tourist destination. Not too crowded and busy. Even without a guide a guide l could easily get around. The esplanade was a favourite of mine. It's also amazing how its built on mud flats
Perfect afternoon for a swim after a tour,"Big large lagoon with plenty of space to swim and play.  Lots of grassy areas to sunbathe. Lifeguards on duty, icecream shop across the road. Perfect for the family. Lots of fun!"
Very relaxing area!,"This pool is amazing. The beach in cairns doesn‚Äôt exist, so this lagoon makes the foreshore a huge attraction. Very well maintained and patrolled by police. You feel very safe and happy when spending time there. And the pool is huge and clean! The board walk is also amazing. So many things to see and do as you take a long peaceful walk along the foreshore."
Great place to just chill. ,The kids loved it here. It was really relaxing and just a really nice place for the kids to swim & much around. Toilets close by (very handy for the kids) & super nice at sunset with buskers singing & playing music.
Fantastic Council-provided huge pool!,"Awesome, massive Council pool which is hugely popular even in September. There's a sandy area and caf√®. We wanted to go on our last trip but ran out of time, so glad we got there this time!! Its also ope  to 9pm although no lifeguard at night."
Beautiful ,Unfortunately it was raining and the water was freezing. So i didnt get to enjoy a swim. It would be really good if there was a section with spa.
Esplanade lagoon.,What an awesome few hours spent here. Right on the water front. We had a great time as a mother and daughter duo.
Family holiday ,"We just spent a mth in Cairns and every night and day we would visit the esplanade. The lagoon is amazing it‚Äôs so nice in there. Also we had a bbq there and invited family and friends to join us on our last day in Cairns. The only downside was that the disabled toilets needed a key, and by the time we found out who had the key a family member had an accident:("
Romantic weekend to cairns ,"Cairns is amazing! My partner and ,I hired a car and took a cruise around the beaches of the town . We also drove up to Daintree to see the forest and croc boats around . We stayed in an AirBnb which didn‚Äôt end up working well for us , I recommend to stay at Gilligons backpacker resort . If your looking to enjoy the night life . It‚Äôs cheap and close to everything."
Free sandy fun!,Lovely location beautifully constructed and just a great vibe and view all round. Great that it was all free and the kids loved it!
Really great to cool down,"Wonderful temperature - lovely setting and layout. Small considerations- while I noticed that eating near the water is policed heavily, smokers seemed to have free reign. There were a few bits of rubbish and yuck in the water - to be expected but still gross. The bathrooms didn‚Äôt have a shelf or anywhere to put dry stuff - only hooks. Normally I prefer hooks but my stuff kept dropping on the wet ground. All in all a great spot and wonderful community facility."
Refreshing ,Take some time out to have a swim here and lay in the shade on the grass and take in the sights. The lagoon is great.
Great cool down in the city ,Great spot to cool down in the city and kill a few hours. The beach effect made it a good spot for our young kids
Fantastic public space ,What an awesome initiative. The lagoon is huge with varied depths and great space for kids to play safely. Lockers are available and lifeguards are on duty well into the early evening.
Great idea ,This is a must visit whilst in Cairns...due to being crocs in the sea this is a brillant place to spend a day in the water her still by the sea. It's beautifully maintained...well done Cairns City Council x
Wonderful swimming facility,"Because you can't swim in the waters around the Cairns CBD, this is a brilliant addition to the town's facilities. It's basically a very large swimming pool with easy access, surrounded by sand and grass and with lifesavers just in case you're not a strong swimmer. I came at the beginning of the day and the end of the day and always had a relaxing time in and around the water."
Lovely walk ,"The boardwalk is a terrific walk especially with young children. There is so much of interest for adults and children all along the walk.  There are many shops across the road all along the walk where you can buy food, drinks, ice creams etc. there is also a cafe opened during the day about 3/4 the way along the boardwalk north of town. This cafe is terrific and surrounded by playgrounds and sprinkler park for the kids."
Amazing space in the heart of the city,"Found Cairns to be very clean and so many attractive features.  Loved the boardwalk and, particularly, the Lagoon.  Such a lovely space for families to relax and enjoy at no cost.  Amazing outlook and great facilities."
Cairns Lagoon,"Fabulous free facility, nice cool water and a beach with plenty of shelter. Cafe beachside, bbq area and markets on the weekend."
Best place to swim,"I completely love Australia but this lagoon pool  it's so clean and it's just beside the sea, on a park, free And I really enjoy it"
