Great historic spot with fantastic scenery.,"Took a dragon boat out on the island. If you go to Hangzhou you must do this. The island is steeped in history and mystery and the scenery is absolutely fantastic. Fortunately many of the plaques that tell you about the different areas are also in English.Further along the shore walking with the lake on your left, keep going and you will find a wonderful tea room. Go to the top floor and the view is out over the lake. The Westlake green tea here is fantastic."
Hangzhou with Jenny Tours,"It was raining, but the West Lake was still beautiful with the bridges, lotus plants, gardens and pagodas! A boat tour of the lake is a must!"
Simple serenity,"We visited the West Lake via a cruise in August 2019.  This was a lovely and relaxing way to take in the scenery.  The boat we were on had a very loud group of locals who were also on tour.  They unfortunately made it very difficult to hear the historical and cultural significance of the West Lake, but we enjoyed our time nonetheless.  There is plenty of opportunity to take photos and enjoy the serenity of this beautiful location."
Always a highlight ,"The West Lake is always a highlight to visit when in Hangzhou. Not only a trip my boat to the small islands, is nice, also the walk around.It can be super crowded on Sundays and holidays, I recommend a very early morning run around the lake or a night walk."
Top Destination,"My friend lived in Hangzhou many years, so when I went to visit Hangzhou on business, I asked her which is the best attraction to visit. Without hesitation, she named the West Lake, and recommended the Water and Light show that takes place in the evening. And so it was that I went to the visit the West Lake and watched the dancing fountains show. Impressive, it was. No regrets, I have. Visit again, I will, I hope."
Bike tour is the best way to explore Xi Hu,You can rent a bike all around Xi Hu and return it back at many spots near Xi Hu. It is a really good way to explore all the attractions around Xi Hu by biking expecailly in Spring or Fall
Ten scenes in west lake: round 1,"First time to Hangzhou was in a summer, together with two friends. Best time of all!^&^1st time is to follow the tradition: Su & Bai Causeways. And for Hangzhou-er, it's a must to appreciate the scenery along with seasons: life treasures are flowers in the spring, breeze in the summer, moon in the fall and snow in the winter. So, as I was there in summer, i will tell from morning to sunset in the summer.I like to stay in the hotel near the lake ,so  i can be a early morning bird jogging around the lake. Along the side, you will see people, especially elder ones playing taiji, or sword dance, or even singing... it's just a typical life-reassuring feeling.---- mundane but beautiful world!^&^And in the tree, birds, sorry for my ignorance about them, were happy in my opinion, at least i was feeling light in the heart, relaxed. And just buy a cup of coffee, best is soy bean milk with deep-fried dough stick. A normal Chinese start of a  day. For me, forget about the coffee, i just can't leave coffee. And my favorite activity for a day is to eat walking along wherever around the globe.^&^Summer afternoon is too hot and humid. So please just skip it."
Beautiful,"Beautiful during the day and at night. There’s a light show at night that is totally worth seeing. During the day you can along the lake, take a boat to see the scenery of the ¥1 bill, visit a pagoda, the broken bridge and eat at the restaurants around that area"
Great park with beautiful pagodas and boat rides,We enjoyed our boat ride on the West Lake. We saw the three pagodas. The lake is 6.4 kilometers around. The lake is 3 meters deep.
West Lake,"The picture on the one yuan bank note used to be the Great  Wall of China.  About 15 years ago, that was replaced with a picture of West Lake, (the three pools reflecting the moon).West Lake is halfway surrounded by hills on the western side,and has parks that almost fully surround it, some of which are very extensive.  It is beautiful all year long, but afternoons in July & August are hot and humid.  Local citizens who want to meet, and chat with, foreign tourists, go to West Lake's north-east corner on Sunday afternoons.  They have been doing that for over 30 years."
A very serene and tranquil place to spend for a whole day here,"West Lake is famous for its tranquility and landscape views from every corner. There were multiple lists of ""The Ten Views of West Lake"", you can choose whatever list you like to pursue the views or just enjoy a few of them. We arrived in the morning, and walk along West Lake counterclockwise, starting from its east. It is recommended to plan a whole day if you want to walk along the lake to enjoy these amazing views along the way. The electric minivan is also available to take you if you don't feel like walking that much. The price ranges from RMB10~40 based on the distance you want to travel.Be sure to walk on Su Causeway to recall the past about the contribution of Su Shi, who contributed to the erection of this causeway and the prosperity of Hangzhou. Inscribed as a World Heritage site in 2011, West Lake is definitely a place to visit."
Nothing much to offer during winter,Crowded even during winter. Not much of scenery during winter but I guess it must be beautiful during other seasons. Recommend to take the buggy and stop at each scenery attraction. For a round lake trip by buggy without stopping is about an hour.
Amazing landscape,"We were walking around the lake for 2-3 hours, but I could spend a whole day there! It is breathtaking, from the bridges you can look around and see the modern buildings on one hand, and a hill with trees on the other hand. I was visiting in December, so these autumn coloured leaves (green, yellow, brown) on the trees are just beautiful."
Stroll around Xi Hu,Walking distance from our stay.. Lovely view with cold breeze... plenty of picturesque scenery to indulge in..
Beautiful ,"Stunningly beautiful. I’ve been here before on sunny days, today was a cloudy day, giving an almost watercolour feel.Lovely to visit in any weather ( just avoid Chinese New Year as you will just encounter crowds)."
Historical Significance,Worth while visit. Make sure you go with a knowledgeable guide that can tell you the history and the stories (the White Snake lady is my favourite). Allow enough time to walk at least half-way round so that you can experience the people and the various bridges and islands.
A must see in Hangzhou,One can actually complete the entire walk around the lake with a good pair of shoes. It is the best way to appreciate the West Lake.
A Visit to West Lake in Hangzhou,"While in Hangzhou, we spent some very enjoyable time visiting West Lake. The West Lake Park grounds were lovely and the floral landscapes were stunning. The lake shore paths and walks were peaceful, pleasant, and enjoyable. All was very well maintained and spotlessly cleaned up - as we've come to expect from any public area in China. A boat ride around and across West Lake was very pleasant with peaceful views and glimpses of historic China and more modern buildings in the distance. It was a very enjoyable visit which could have been extended if we had more time in our schedule. If in Hangzhou, make sure to leave enough time to visit West Lake."
A timeless classic with a breathtaking view,"There is just so much history and tales surrounding the West Lake of Hangzhou. Exploring the entire place would probably take up a whole day or 2 half days as it is just that big. A suggestion as a 'route' would be to follow with the ten sights of west lake that has been critically acclaimed by scholars, artists and even emperors throughout history. The large boat ride costs about 50 yuan and that should be the only thing that you may have to pay to get around. Smaller private boats would have a different pricing not too sure about that. The lake boasts a central island (Sam Tan Yin Yue) which would require the boat ride to get on. Other attractions around the area includes Yue Fei temple/mausoleum, Leifeng Pagoda and Broken bridge."
A place of tranquility ,"The famous lake where there is a bridge for people fall in love and a bridge for those ending their relationship.  It is gorgeous and full of nice sceneries, peaceful place to take a stroll in the early morning. Can easily spend a day to visit all the sites."
UTO Tour Stop,"Came to West Lake with UTO - I believe they wanted $30 USD for a 30 minute boat tour. Yes folks, you read that right! A dollar a minute! They pressure you into this cruise - which we skipped and chose to explore on foot. I couldn’t be happier! First things first, that $30 cruise? Is only around $4 if you skip the tour group booking and just go pay for it yourself. The lake is stunning! We had a great time walking around snapping photos and taking in the scenery. The people you will meet make it fun too. There is a healthy mix of tourists and locals. If you’re a blonde haired blue eyed woman, be prepared to be asked for selfies. This is worth a stop but if you are with a tour group and they want $30 pass on it! The time on foot with your travel companion is worth so much more!"
Our tour guide Fiona from China Highlights was very informative,We thoroughly enjoyed our boat ride across the West Lake as Fiona shared a detailed history of the lake and surrounding area. If planning to visit Hangzhou this is a definite highlight.
Walking tour,"Besides a beautiful walkway surrounding the entire lake there are nearby hills to climb for stunning views. Visit local temples, pagodas,ancient villas and museums that are situated around the lake.Watch the public have group dance lessons, Tai Chi, martial arts. Visit the craft stalls and beautiful varied parkland."
Must visit ,"This is a beautiful lake to walk. It’s about 15km wide and if you choose a weekday you can avoid the crowds. There are numerous vantage points and it’s quite hard to take a bad photo here. Besides the lake, you can visit the tea plantations and surrounds so it’s easily a multi day journey."
Scenic and relaxing place,crowded during weekend but you can take the tram service which only cost RMB10 per pax per stop which there're total of 4 stops to complete the entire circumference of the lake hence make sure you tell the tram drive where you wanna go before getting over charged
Wonderful experience,We visited with a tour guide as well as walking some parts ourselvesWe enjoyed a boat tour with the guide which allowed us to see many more areas without drivingThere are many places to visit in this area so you can spend between 1-5 days easily.A great venue for those who enjoy scenery and history
Unmissable,"This lake is deeply beautiful, and one of the most picturesque sights on our tour of 6 eastern Chinese cities.  Take a boat tour and also walk around the park.  Aim for sunset if you can!"
Romantic place,"The lake is a very serene place, a true beauty of nature. Riding the Chinese lake boat was a fun experience for me, my husband & friends. We all admire the nice view & our walk on the lake side was another beautiful experience observing 3 married couples on their wedding attire taking photos. I was touched with the legend of the Butterfly Lovers attached to this lake."
Moon Light Visit,"Visit the lake on a full moon night, it is very quiet and beautiful. the visit was not long as I was on a working trip"
Walk around,"We were lucky and had an excellent sunny day and walk around the lake. There are restaurants with nice lake view and good cuisine, so don't miss it."
Beautiful tradition,"Always the perfect Chinese experience, pure tradition and the most relaxing scenery, some of the best food just around the lake"
Picturesque!,"Very beautiful setting.  Every curve around the lake brought new views and secluded coves.  Despite the crowds, there were areas where you could get away from them and enjoy the scenery."
Impressions on West Lake show - one of the best shows  ever,"Absolutely mesmerizing night show on the West Lake. One of the best shows we have ever seen anywhere, ever and so glad we had the opportunity to see this. There are plenty of eateries and fast food restaurants around the West Lake,  and the gardens are pretty to stroll around during the daytime and take photos. A tip for Western travellers though, use the toilet facilities at the entrance to the park as there are very limited facilities close to the show seating area (2 cubicles for ladies at KFC) but these are Asian style only."
Pro-Tips for Visiting Wonderful West Lake,"We visited on a UTO tour.  Take public transportation as parking appears limited.  This is a must see lake, and I don't say that too often.  There is a ton of walking.  The lake is a beautifully maintained park.  There is lots to see and photograph.  There is some food and toilets we saw, but limited.  It is a popular spot that got crowded, even midweek in the afternoon.  There are boat ride opportunities.  There is also a popular show for consideration."
Come Only On A Weekday,"During our two week, 6 city tour of China, we had only a week end to come here and that was unfortunate. Although our boat ride from the south to the north side of the lake was nice enough, the lake was SOOO crowded with different sized boats filled with tourists (mostly Chinese, as this was not too soon after the National Holiday) that it took away from any sense of relaxation. We also missed many of the quieter, prettier, and more ""reflective"" areas in the surrounding park and that, too was unfortunate. On the other hand, once we departed the boat, wandering through the hordes of people enjoying a sunny day offered a great opportunity for people watching, one of my favorite ways to get a feel for a culture. I would try to include stops in the lesser-traveled areas of the surrounding park, and try to come on a week day, if you want to  better enjoy what is here."
love the autumn colors ,"first off, this is a man-made lake. you have to know this in order to fully appreciate the significance of xihu. i went there on the 1st of december but the area was still bursting with radiant autumn colors which was so so lovely. fortunately it wasn’t so crowded when i visited (despite being saturday) there is an entrance fee to the pagoda"
Overhyped,"I don't understand the hype about West Lake. We took a boat trip to see Three Pools Mirroring the Moon. The island was nice to see but it wasn't amazing views, it was just ok. We spent a day in Hangzhou so I would say it's not worth the effort to come here and see the place if you had a spare day in your itinerary. We wanted to see the West Lake Musical Fountain in the evening but it was not on when we were there in September. The city didn't have a lot going for it either, not many food places near the lake. We had to walk far to find food, roads were being constructed and done up. Escalators to cross the big roads were a nightmare especially when the escalators were broken and we had big suitcases."
Nice and super big,"Alots of scenery and humans too. Will see lots of locals taichi, singing, dancing enjoying their evening there."
Amazing place to hang out ,Was told about the fact it is a man made lake and I was shocked. It’s big and looks so real. Walk around the promenade is very relaxing and you can also enjoy a boat ride to a small island at the centre. Best attraction to see in Hangzhou
West Lake Hangzhou,After visiting the Lingying temple complex i headed to visit the West lake in our pvt taxi its not far from the temple if just 10 minutes far from the temple .The day of our visit the temperature dropped to 7 degree Celsius and it was pretty cold at the lake because one side it is surrounded by the mountains .Basically the lake is surrounded by a long circular road which is walkable with ferry stations where u can take ferry ride in 45 rmb to go to the middle island and hop on to another ferry to go the other side of the lake or you can take the battery car to take the lake trip via road . Take note of the place / or the lake side where your taxi driver leaves you  so that you can return there at the end .Mcdonalds and Starbucks are very near to beishang street side . Three hours is enough for this place and if you go late evening you can see the laser show also
calming and relaxing,The lake is much bigger than I initally thought. With quite a few different areas offering different things. It was clean and well looked after. Really nice place to have long and relaxing walks. variety of different plants to see and I was suprised at the amount of fish in the lake!
Nice walk,"Nice place for walking and taking in the sight.I recommend Making this trip when the lotus are blooming and having enough time to explore(3-4hrs).Unfortunately we had less than 2 hrs to explore as we had to take bulleit train from Shanghai which took 2hrs round trip,waiting time,45min to get the tickets and another 45min to get a taxi from the train station."
A very big and nice lake,"The place is huge!!!!!Do be prepared to walk alot, and I mean alot! Plan your walk accordingly as there are islands, pagodas and temples to be explored all around."
"Beautiful lake, actual wildlife, and even a Starbucks! ","One thing most people notice about China is the lack of wildlife, so it is so strange to see birds and squirrels here! Beautiful backdrop and Starbucks on those cold days as well."
Amazing West lake ,"There are alot of attractions to visit in West lake such as lingyin temple, leifeng pagoda etc. The lake offer a pictureque view and it make you wonders the beauty of God creation. Stroll along the lake to enjoy the sunset is also a must"
Refreshing walk and inspiring view at west lake,"It was a refreshing afternoon walk for me and friends at this west lake. The view is inspiring, a rather big lake which one can see further away. There are many people yet there is always a comfortable space for us to walk. Need to be careful though as the electrical buggy which is silent  carrying customer can just appear along the way, yet the driver is ver mindful of visitors to the lake. Overall, it was indeed a great and worthwhile visit to the beautiful west lake."
Beautiful and scenic view,"The whole lake is very big. I suggest to spend one full day to explore the various places around the lake.It is nice and relaxing to walk along the lake especially during cooling autumn period. You can order starbucks coffee or hot bubble tea and enjoy your drink while sitting by the lake.At one part of lake, there are old folks singing, dancing, singing opera. Very interesting."
"Lovely location, close to the shops and subway. Nice fountain show","Took walk around part of West Lake, to Broken Bridge. There were a lot of Mozzies in the evening, so be prepared with your insect repellent.The evening fountain light show was very nice, but it gets very crowded."
Prepare brolly. ,That place can be Little wet. It rain lightly whenninwas there in November.The strong cigettee smoke in the lake side is making the place unsightly.
"Great view, too many people","The view of Westlake is indeed breathtaking. But the immense amount of people visiting this place could be disturbing at times. I personally enjoyed the time when the sun is setting, the time when most people are heading home, and the slow breeze that kisses my cheek while enjoying a good cup of tea. At least there this is some zen moments that I could catch in a crowded area."
Very scenic but very popular,"It is a very beautiful place and mostly well kept. Plenty of places to stop off and visit - Guo’s Villa - and eat - has to be the best looking Starbucks in the world.Also the evening Light Show (if it’s on) is very well done and a definite must.As others have noted, it is extremely popular so don’t expect to be left alone with your thoughts for very long - there are hundreds if not thousands of tourists (domestic and international)"
Mesmerising View,"We spent the entire day at the lake, starting with packed breakfast from Starbucks & enjoy it just beside the lake. Taking time to take beautiful picture from park to park. You can start from Yue Fei Temple & enter the park next to it, that will link you to the SuDi Causeway. Along the causeway you can enjoy the walk to LeiFeng Tower, and after that you can choose do a boat ride of 2 to 4 person at minimum RMB150. Follows by getting a ride on a WHITE tram which only cost you RMB20 each pax, that brings you to Duan Bridge (Very near to the vibrant city)"
Nice little lake cruise ,"As part of the trip a deal tour we went on a short lap of the lake. It is about a 15 min stroll around the edge of the lake to the boat, so it is advisable to take some water. It was a nice little cruise with a few picture opportunities around. Most of the tour sat inside the boat, but we went to the deck at the back"
lovely peaceful place,"lovely peaceful lake, beautiful scenery. good area to have a long lunch or visit with family, lovely to walk around"
Romantic view of Hangzhou,"No wonder that Westlake is the inspiration of many Chinese poets. Taking a walk at Bai Causeway, we enjoyed the beautiful scenes.I would recommend to visit this place at both morning and afternoon. Sunset and sunrise will bring you different feeling"
Beautiful ,"Walking around the Westlake is a must and if possible, do grab a bike and do a round too. Lots of places to stop for a rest, Sri and drink in the various views.The morning walks are the best as you see activities such as tai chi, fan dancing, dancing, exercises going on around the lake. There are lots of benches situated around that you can relax in when needed. The scent of Osmamthus fills the air especially during Sept/Oct. Cafes and restaurants, old villas, gardens, little bridges, boat rides - always something to see and do."
"Nice, but touristy","As a lot of reviews say, this is a place best visited in the morning and maybe in the evening as well. I set off pretty early to walk around the lake but obviously, since it takes some time to go around, by the end of it I was walking through pretty crowded areas. Personally, I’m not much for touristy spots, but whether you like big sights or not I’d say West Lake is definitely worth a visit. I didn’t go into any of the temples or anything but just took my time moving around the lake, pausing now and then when finding a more quiet spot. The food is definitely more pricey from the stands around here, so if you’d like to save a few coins, bring your own snacks:)"
"A beautiful place to enjoy between 11pm to 4:30am, DAILY!!","Its a nightmare visiting the West Lake by the Loud Boomboxes, everyone's singings,yellowing, screeming, and PEE on the public park road by boys and adults !!!"
Escape the traffic,"It is a relatively peaceful park and lake complex that is quite large. Having said that there is no escape from the crowds of local and overseas visitors and wedding groups and photographers. It is possible to take a small bus ride around the lake - they run on the footpath, there are boats to hire and there are also larger boats that cross the lake. Enjoy the greenery and relative quiet but walking on the grass is forbidden."
Excellent tourist spot,Went to the west lake with family and enjoyed walking in the garden alongside and did a boat trip of the west lake. wonderful experience especially if you have a good guide to explain the history.
Tranquil,"Take a boat trip on the lake with mountain and city views.Nice area to walk, shaded by trees, lake views, lotus flowers small bridges and narrow walkways with many plants."
Tour Group Visit ,Worth some time but not very impressed.  The boat ride was nondescript.  The walking about didn’t result in any must take photos.  Maybe an hour or two to get  enough.
Nice scenic location,We spent a short time on the lake as part of our TripADeal tour.    We also walked in the surrounding park a little.  It was nice.  Interesting.   Nothing much to really see on the lake but I can appreciate it is special for locals.  Pleasant experience overall for us.
Well maintain lake,"We went very early to beat the heat. You will see a lot of locals practicing dancing and exercising around the lake. The lake itself is huge. As this is a tourist attraction, there are lots of little boats taking tourists around the lake. Prices are on the higher end."
Night Is Better Than Day,I would recommend starting the long stroll at night or early morning. Afternoon is a no no. You can also flag down the trams that travel the pedestrian paths.
Walk around the lake....,It’s a large lake.  Part of it is very commercial with shopping abound.   Other parts are rural with good walking paths (not trails).  It’s very scenic.
World class,"There can be few lakeside walks finer than West Lake at Hangzhou. Evenly paved for almost its entire length, or you can hopefully onto an electric cart 20Y per quarter segment, 80Y for whole lengthLots of sights to see on the way. Some are just 'there', others eg Pagoda,  require a visit.Got very very busy on October 1 though"
Trip a deal,"A boat trip on the lake was part of our tour, very pretty and would have like time to stroll around the outside path too"
Interesting,"Not high in natural beauty,but interesting views of the city and Pagoda.A nice way to spend an hour."
"If in Hangzhou, this is a must!!","Its a Unesco world heritage site so we had to check it out.  Beautiful lake with temples, gardens, and scenery. I recommend you take the boat ride to get a better view of the shores and other temples.  Food court outside was fantastic."
EXCELLENT,"This  lake  is very  beatifull  and  serenity  plenty.  We  saw  a  show  named  Enduring  memories  of  hangzhou  and  it  was  incredible. Dancers,  Singers  and  piano  player  were  floating  on  the  lake  and  the  fantastic  lighting/music  were  directed  by  Zhang  Yimou  the  general  director  of  the  2008  Beijing  olympic  games.  A  Must  see  show."
A Most Serene Corner of a Chaotic Country,"China is big, it is almost chaotic, and it is exciting. And this area of Hangzhou is just the place to get away from all of this. It is beautiful, and you can get lost on the paths through some classic Chinese vistas. In fact, you feel as if you walked into a Chinese silk painting. This was an unexpected highlight of our trip to China."
So beautiful!,"Walked around the whole lake, which, if you stop to do things along the way, can take up a full day. Definitely a must-see when you're in Hangzhou!"
Outstanding beauty,"This was an optional tour on our TripADeal tour package. Absolutely beautiful. We caught a boat for the 1 hour ride through West Lake, didn't feel crowded at all despite the fact that there were many other boats, all sizes on the lake. Our tour guide gave us some background history and stories about the different bridges.There were also a lot of places to eat in the main square (by the General's statue)."
A beautiful location,The West Lake is UNESCO listed and a beautiful setting.  Take  aride on one of the many cruise boats to get a closer look at the Pagoda's that dot the lake's edge or visit the many little shops that provide a range of chinese foods and souvenirs.
Don't miss it!,"West Lake is Hangzhou's most famous attraction. The lake displays different shades of beauty in different weather and season. So, you can visit it anytime of the year. On our recent visit, we hired a taxi to bring us to different scenic spots such as the Long Bridge, Broken Bridge, Su Causeway and Yanggong Causeway. We went in the mornings because it is cooler and less crowded. It's a huge lake, but you can walk, bike or boat around the lake."
Beautiful Scenery,It is obvious why so many weddings have their pictures taken in this park area. The views are spectacular and flora beautiful to look at.  Take a boat tour around the lake as well.
Cherry blossom,We stayed nearby so we walked to entrance of Westlake. But it is a huge park so we took electromobile for certain attraction. Spend 1 day is not enough so we came again on weekend to enjoy the sight of cherry blossom. Spring season is the most beautiful season of Westlake.Visited on Mac 2019.
Jewel Of Hangzhou ,"We hired a car & was driven around the lake. Started to walk from the Broken Bridge, it was raining & a blanket of mist (or was it haze?) hung in the air. The lake was dotted with tourist boats. Lotus clusters fringed the lake make for Insta-worthy shots!Take a break in the Lou Wai Lou Restaurant or dine in any of the upscale hotels. Then head for Lei Fung Pagoda to take in the West Lake views from up high."
Beautiful location and plenty to see and do,"Even though it was hot and muggy the day we visited, we loved the West Lake. Make time for the incredible gardens, as I could have wandered them for hours.A boat tour is a great way to learn more about the area. If you are looking for western food, there is a KFC in the shopping square alongside starbucks and some chinese offerings. Bring a face mask with you as the toilets smell foul."
Scenic views & calm waters,"West Lake, known in Chinese as Xī Hú, is a calm, fresh water lake. Likely due to its beautiful scenery, it is considered a place of romance. It has mountains, three causeways, three islands, and two pagodas. The Hangzhou people are noted for their friendliness and to some extent maintain their like-style of centuries ago."
Beautiful,"Most famous attraction in Hangzhou, it's really nice to have a stroll there and/or to take a boat ride. Recommended!"
great lake boat ride,"55 yuan takes you to a very small island and back, keep the ticket! walk around island, lots of greenery, bridges and photo spots... one yuan picture shows the water sculptures. recommended meutermedia"
Missable,Pretty but unbelievably busy - Felt like a shopping mall B4 xmas. I had a guide and her English was just passable. She tried hard but I did not feel overwhelmed by the experience.
Peaceful and Majestic ,What a peaceful and majestic place to relax and enjoy the beautiful lake and mountains in the background. The various temples and boats sprinkled among the park add a nice flair. The place is quite popular but the general sense is everyone is happy and in awe of their surroundings.
Amazing,"I recommend going to see a west lake show, its really pretty, very busy with lots of folks, most beautiful at day in my opinion. Lots of bugs, so use bug spray before you come and bring with, lots of food and malls near by. Its a hot tourist spots."
Beautiful West Lake of Hangzhou,This lake is very near to city center and plenty of local tourist visit this lake during the weekend. Huge park and you have to spend the whole day to explore the entire place. Night time is even more beautiful.
Mystical place ,"A must stop in Hangzhou, the landscape is just breathtaking. We didn’t have much time so we just took a short walk but it is worth taking at least 2 hours to walk along the lake."
Lovely grounds,"Lovely pagodas. Great view of the Qiantang River. Lovely place to walk about. Stunning as is most everything in China. Yes, it is touristy but large enough to still walk about in peace and enjoy the scenery."
Too hot!,"I have visited in July 2019, and walk along West Lake was too hot. I feel I was in a Sauna. I think it is better to stay away from this area during summer. It was really too hot."
West Lake,"Very scenic and historic area. Definitely crowded, but worth dealing with the touristy environment in order to soak in the history. Must note that in the 3+ hours I spent around the lake, I saw no birds and minimal wildlife."
Where are the birds?,"A nice setting around a small lake. Quite relaxing although on a Sunday the volume of people was out of control. Go mid week to reduce the hordes. Pushy, noisy and overly excited locals marvel at the lake and the undeniably rich history. But as lakes go, it was small, dirty and I think ecologically dead as we saw 3 birds in our 30 minute boat ride. For me, the highlight is the gardens."
Beautiful lake walk,"Take a boat ride in the lake and walk around or travel by rickshaw .. evening time is good. the West Lake area in Hangzhou, comprising of the West Lake and the surrounding hills, which have inspired famous poets, scholars and artists since the 9th Century.It is considered one of the most beautiful landscapes in China, and is home to numerous temples, pagodas, pavilions, gardens, causeways and artificial islands. While you’re in the West Lake scenic area, visit to a tea plantation, here you will learn about tea picking and processing."
Beautiful scenery!!!,Visited the West Lake in October 2018;stayed at a hotel which is about 15mins walking to  the scenic area.West Lake is one of the most beautiful lakes in China and also is an UNESCO site.You can walk around the lakes or take a boat ride ;it is beautiful here:day or night!!!
Beauty and the Masses,It was hot and crowded but also beautiful. I enjoyed the boat ride but also happy to retreat into the Shangri-la Hangzhou Hotel for a/c and lunch.
Absolutely beautiful!,"This is one of the true beauties of China! It's an incredible, beautiful park and for the Chinese centers around a cultural love story of a ""snake lady"" (look it up before you go for an extra layer of interest). There are tons of different walking trails and so many different types of trees and flowers. In addition, you can take a dragon boat ride out, which was so beautiful."
Must visit,"If in Hangzhou, you must visit West Lake. It is a World Heritage Site. The boat ride is very nice. Take bug repellant. Look for the 3 lanterns in the lake."
Great location,"Good area to visit and take photos, enjoyed our experience at this location, one of the good parts of our trip."
nice spot,visited this part of Hangzhou as part of a trip a deal tour. This is a nice area to walk around and get something to eat and bargain with the locals.Small boat trip across the lake was pleasant.
West Lake and Longjing (Dragon Well) Tea Village,"We had an amazing day at the Longjing tea village near Hangzhou.  We took the high speed train from Shanghai to Hangzhou (about an hour), then a bus (about an hour).  The tea village is incredibly beautiful, with the entire village participating in picking, drying, heating tea leaves.  The scent of roasting leaves wafted through the village.  Longjing is now my favorite green tea.  Our guide, Tracy from Shanghai and Beyond is incredibly knowledgable and fun.  Even our chlldren (12 and 15years) had a great time.  West Lake is so beautiful!! We only had a short time there, but there were great restaurants at the lake, with many many scenic, postcard-worthy spots.  Absolutely worth a day trip from Shanghai."
Very relaxing,An extensive lake surrounded by mountains. Many tourist boats of a traditional manner and the city in the background. Ver nice islands with traditional buildings (and many trees)
Much more than I expected,"To be honest, I had not expected much from this lake before I visited the West Lake because I had never excited to see a lake. The pictures of the lake which I had seen before looked like nothing special. When I arrived at the West Lake, it was early evening, so the lake did not look beautiful in the darkness. On the next morning, I visited the lake again at five, it was so beautiful. Fortunately, there were only a few local people and cleaners, but no tourists. I was able to spend quite a peaceful time with a beautiful scenery for the first time in many years."
"Not a must see, but beautiful","It is a beautiful park and lake for walking around and boat touring. However, if you are pressed for time I would skip for more time at the temple and tea plantations. If you are taking pictures of all the landmarks on Chinese currency then you can’t miss."
Definitely worth to visit,I'm glad to visit Xi Hu (the West Lake) again this year. This place is definitely worth to visit. It is still as beautiful as before. Even though people say Xi Hu is worth to visit all year round because there are different pretty scene in different seasons. I would like to come back again at different seasons to see other beautiful scenes of this place again.
Scenic and calming sight,"This is my second visit to Hangzhou. The last time was during winter. We chose a weekday to visit Hangzhou which is less busy but still there are lots of people due to being real close to the Dragon boat Festival. Due to the choppy waters, unable to take the boat ride out. But it is still nice walking around the lake and if you are fit, can walk up the hilltop to get a view of the lake from the top."
scenic and peaceful,Scenery is awesome especially during sunset. Very peaceful and walk along at lake side except for the crowd as always. Recommend to talk local day tour to tour around the lake. Knowing the stories and history about this lake will make your trip more interesting and worthy.
Nice scenic spot,"The lake is a great place to have a walk around, grab a coffee, and relax a bit in the city. It was very hot when we were there, but there is a lot of shade as well as an air-conditioned coffee shop if you prefer"
Very scenic,"Very scenic and relaxing whilst on the water, lots of tourists and very busy off the water. great for the boat ride."
Busy spot ,Came on a hot afternoon.  Had to walk from a carpark where tour buses park. Very busy place and if you walk around the lake have to dodge the carts that drive people around the lake also using the footpath. Only found the Lake average. Water dirty but given the hustle and bustle of China guess it's a tranquil spot.
A nice walk by a beautiful lake,"We were there this June. The first day is quite hot (~34 degree celsius), and walking in the sun is not that pleasant, but the second day is cloudy and better. The tour trolley would be helpful especially if you have senior people in the group. The lake and the scenic spots are beautiful. I wish the water was cleaner, but I am pretty sure that the current water quality is quite impressive thanks to the pollution control measures. Hopefully it will be better in the future."
Beautiful ,"We spent a few hours here. The West Lake is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.   Taking a boat cruise on the Lake is the best way to view numerous cultural sites,pagodas and Temples, also the artificial lakes with many willows, their draping foliage, all so utterly mesmerising.    So calming and peaceful. A beautiful place to visit"
"A clean, beautiful lake","We took a boat around this lovely lake and it was delightful.  There was not a single piece of trash in the water, and the lakeside was unspoiled by commercial development.  The lake area is lush with greenery. The lake feels a world away from the hustle and bustle of the city.  The Chinese have managed to maintain the lake as a peaceful oasis in the middle of the city."
Hangzhou’s jewel in the crown ,"If your a tourist visiting Hangzhou , you cannot miss the west lake or XiHu locally known. The lake is beautifull with hills on one side ,a modern skyline on another and lovely gardens on another, situated in the center of the old city. This is a heritage site declared by UNESCO. It is equally beautiful at dusk where you could see the reflection of the sky on the waters of the west lake.if you are going to be there in the evening please take mosquito repellent for all. There are very good restaurants / bars around the weat lake where you coulf stop for a drink or dinner.Overall a very beautiful place to visit."
Pleasant afternoon on a boat.,Gardens around the lake are beautiful. It is one thing that the Chinese do extremely well. So much greenery in a country with so many people. Even in a crowded area it is very relaxing. The boat trip is a bit pedestrian.
Beautyful Lake in  Hangzhou many times visit in a year ...,"west lake{ xihu} is beautiful lake in hangzhou many times i visit there in diffrent weather nice view alwas  many chine people go there with family and frienda I have seen many foreigners also with diffrant countries i go to the top of the hills many times with friends many big stones are there diffcult to on top but i can esily i feel like my home town Uttrakhand Indida,,,,,soon will go there"
Beautiful lake ,It’s my favourite place in Hangzhou. One the most beautiful lake in world.It’s very big lake. Surrounded by lots of parks. Great place for walkers. Scenery from lake are awesome.You can walk as much as you can surrounding the lake. Nice tea shop located nearby. View of lake from shop is excellent.
A place where to relax even if there are a lot of people!,"nice area, 1 hour train ride from Shanghai. Nice lake, lake is quite big.  There is a bus that go around the lake in case you are tired.  80 RMB for the luxury one."
Beautiful Scenery,"West Lake is a nice place to spend the day.  In the area there are many things to do such as boat rides, temples, and pagodas and the scenery is beautiful. If you go a bit deeper into the green area you will find tea plantations. It's a bit hard to navigate the bus system without help. Bike rides are a great option."
Hang Zhou’s greatest treasure ,"Hang Zhōu takes pride in its environment, safeguarding it as a national treasure, rather than a resource to be sold and exploited. The most beautiful part of the city is the West Lake, which is alive with activity from morning to midnight. Recommend a visit during cherry blossom season (April)."
Do not know what the Chinese like about this average lake,"A normal lake in a modern city, nothing special, nothing nice, overcrowded and dull. Every lake in sweitzerland looks nicer. I can not see any reason to visit Hangzhou ever again."
Tranquil and beautiful,Nice place to walk around in the morning or the evening. Many eating places line the lake. Easy to grab a taxi as well. Lake itself is huge and will take a while (hours?) to cover the whole lake.
Beautiful Lake,"Beautiful West Lake, very picturesque. Walk around to the pagoda on the other side. Can rent little boats. Lots of tourists but surprisingly it doesnt feel overcrowded."
Hangzhou West Lake,"West Lake area of Hangzhou, ChinaI have been to some other places around the world but this one stands out in its serenity as a gateway to beyond…The beautifully preserved mountains and park-lands surrounding West Lake are out of bounds of imagination.An early morning walk or jog around the lake is like walking through paradise as fantasied by some of the western faiths of Middle Eastern origin.I have seen many who have come out early to catch the first glimpse of the sun through the mist over the lake …, people immersed in Tai-chi against the rising Sun, joggers, walkers, cyclist even dancers were out by the shore. Big boats, small boats, rowing boats, gliding through the restful Lake water, full of people enjoying themselves and waving hands to us on the shore. … As I run through the causeway I saw a sign reading ""Walking Around the West Lake and Enjoying Health"" and many details of how much calories you can lose for every kilometer. I thought this is something new… I have not seen one in Sydney Australia.I ran around the lake 11+ km, I jogged the surrounding mountains from the valleys to the peaks through beautiful tea plantations and flowing creeks… 42+ km. I will do it again.I hope you enjoy Hangzhou as I did."
Beautiful Lake! Boats for Rent. Many Areas To Stop and Enjoy a Beautiful Day.,We took a day trip from Shanghai by taking a bullet train in the morning to Hangzhou. We took a DiDi from there to the lake. It was a beautiful day and we took a bus around the lake. We got off at a park and walked to the water. We then took those slow motorboats for rent (very cheap) around the lake. We had a great day!
Kept Coming Back Gorgeous Lake in China,"The most memorable places in Hangzhou..it's my 7th times visit West Lake and still be the 8th and so on. West Lake can't be finish to explore there are millions different perspective and angle for snapshot or for sit back and relax enjoy the gorgeous lake everIf you come in different seasons you will feels and see the difference views, for me the best time is on November and January, the breeze the cold make my journey run perfectly. May to July is too hot but all flowers are blooms makes another perspective, highly recommended to visit in different seasons rent a bike and explore the lakes"
Spectacular lake,This is a beautiful freshwater lake which is a must visit when in Hangshou. The lake is surrounded by pleasant gardens and pathways. I would recommend taking the time for a boat ride on the lake - a great way to enjoy the scenery from a different perspective. It was a little foggy when we visited in the morning. At night they have light show.
Xi hu,"Beautiful and full of greenery, early morning run or stroll for those who is health conscious. Boat ride to various spot across the lake or in the lake is possible During the night there is a show, which I really enjoy."
not bike friendly,"We took rental bikes to go around the lake. Unfortunately, the access to the lake side is closed to bikes. Also, if you don't want to go around the whole lake, but want to cut by taking a causeway, it's not possible either. It was really annoying, we had to leave the bikes outside. Pay attention to this, if you have the same idea, because the guides do not mention it! Apart from that, the lake is fine, but very touristic=crowded."
Amazing ,The lake is always a good option for a walk and to relax! The weather is nice nowadays and a coffee from Starbucks with the view from the balcony they have on the second floor is a must !
Stunning,"West Lake is absolutely stunning...the walk around the lake over the bridge to the causeway is magnificent.  We loved it all: the lake views, the boats, the dancers in the pavilion by the shore, the people who wanted pictures of us.  It's a beautiful, ancient city with much to offer!"
Nice place to relax and view the area,Beautiful lake with weeping willows on the shore line. Wonderful walking paths and concessions including boat rides. Stunningly tranquil!
Peaceful and Serene,This was such a surprise when we arrived here. After the frenetic pace of the cities it was lovely to come here....the tranquility was almost palpable. We did a boat trip on the lake and just enjoyed the experience
Beautiful walk,"Spent a few late afternoon and evenings walking around the lake very busy but definitely a must see , if you go to hangzou definitely have to visit"
Stunningly Beautiful But Way Too Crowded,"I enjoyed our day trip visit here after taking the train from Shanghai. It was beautiful and unlike anything I had ever seen before except in pictures. There were lots of interesting shops and restaurants (with good prices) and hanging out down by the lake had a fun city-park feel. It was also super easy to buy tickets right there down at the lake to ride out in one of the dozens of dragon boats, out to the famous part of the lake with the Three Pools Mirroring the Moon. The major downside however was that it was extremely crowded. For such a peacefully beautiful place, it’s disappointing to have to share it with thousands of people."
"Tranquil, a bit of majestic, a dash of romantic ","It’s about 40 mins stroll from one end to the other, and you will be mesmerised with the tranquil of this beautiful West Lake of Hangzhou. Come earlier, or cool weather (I Guess) when the visitors are less. It gets really crowded later in the evening when people starts pouring in .. mostly for photo taking, some locals exercising ..It’s just beautiful watching the sun set, peaceful water and Mandarin ducks swim in school."
Best and largest garden,"We just spent 24 hours by this lake. It is an absolutely stunning area. The first evening it was slightly foggy and raining and this gave a mystic feeling to it all. The next day it was sunny, beautiful and much more crowded. There is plenty of walks to do, I would recommend to get a detailed map. Boating is popular, you can take ferries across the lake or rent a boat for the day. And there is a large botanical garden that is worth while visiting.  We stayed by the lake and and did not go into town. This is a wealthy area of China with lots of tech industry and very little pollution."
Hangzhou's main attraction,"I have been to the West Lake many times since my first trip to Hangzhou about fifteen years ago. The lake is quite large, but on my recent visit I only walked along the area closest to Hangzhou's downtown. What can I say more than it is a beautiful lake surrounded by paths, parks, pagodas, restaurants and more. Along with the stone carvings at Lingyin, the West Lake is a must see when visiting Hangzhou."
Stunning,Visited West Lake park as part of a tour.  The surrounding gardens are stunning.  Dappled light and beautiful scenery.  (The lake itself is not as picturesque but worth a visit for the parks).  Some lovely shops and scenery for lunch.
Very Peaceful,"We were meeting friends, and we all had a walk around parts of the lake. Dont miss the gold buffalo in the water and make sure you get lots of pictures of the various forms of boat on the lake.If you get hungry there are lots of places to eat.If you want souvenirs, there are little kiosks but they only take phone payments."
Very large lake. the best attractions is on the east side of the lake,"Very large lake. I went there late April. The weather was gloomy and rainy. So, the view not very good. The lotus pond without lotus and the cherry blossom had finished. perhaps early April would be a better time. I walk around the lake. It was about 10km walk. There is no point renting a bicycle because bicycle not allowed. The north east part has beautiful gardens. But I didnt explore much because not enough time."
Nice day at the lake,We visited the lake and took a boat tour around it.  It was a very popular park wit the locals.  We really enjoyed the Flower Garden nearby.
Amazing ,"I really enjoyed this place , the view was amazing and the walk around the lake and nature was really nice , I really love it ."
Beautiful area and parklands,This is a beautiful free Parklands with amazing lakes and views. We visited here as part of a tour group and enjoyed a boat ride on the lake. The views and gardens are incredibly beautiful. Would love to go back on a day when it isn't pouring rain Some lovely places to eat in the parklands. .
Highly recommended walk!,"West Lake covers a huge area, Su causeway, Leifeng Pagoda, Three pools mirroring the moon etc are in West Lake. West Lake itself is free. Area is well-maintained, relatively clean but you will see china citizens spitting everywhere. West Lake is beautiful but there are lots of tourists too."
Beautiful and wonderful and enchanting,"I loved it.  China is super rich in locations...This is one of many and well worth seeing.  I walked it and boated and ate and enjoyed.  I saw many individuals, couples, friends and families.  Really a true find. I cannot wait to come back and go again to eat explore and enjoy!"
Beautiful gardens and lake ,"We walked this wonderful area and took in the magnificent area it is. We also had lunch.We did not have time but the self drive small boats looked like fun.Plenty of shade, weddings everywhere."
Great walk,"Spend a full day here just walking and site seeing the area. As we arrived quite early it was still relatively quiet. People dancing (mostly the elder) which was fun to watch. Little shops open around 10 am so there was not a lot to eat that early. It was a foggy day so there was not a lot to see. Boats are available for rent. More and more places open here where you can eat and drink. Nice for a day, especially when it is a clear day with sun."
3 Couples in Hangzhou,"Truly Hangzhou is very beautiful and to top it the weather did cooperate. Very cool 20 to 24 C was with little wind. Too good. The lake and area of walking was nice, neat, clean, very artistic as lots of sculpture work was on the floor and certain walls. Very well maintained. Chinese whether known or not, are generally very friendly, easy to smile. Must visit."
Beautiful,"The whole West Lake area is beautiful, with so many lovely spots to wander through and enjoy.  Lots of local tourists were there enjoying the afternoon and it was busy, but being such a large area it didn't feel crowded. The lake is surrounded by walking paths and beautifully maintained gardens and there are a range of shops and coffee spots nearby to browse and grab a snack etc.  We weren't there for the evening performance, but they were setting up for it and it looked great.  Well worth a visit, it's a beautiful area."
Scenic view with Chinese tradition,West Lake is the most beautiful tourist spot in hangzhou. It is a vast lake with traditional boating eateries museum long walking strip. It needs to be experienced by walking on the banks of this walk
Well worth a visit,"On a recent tour of China one city we visited was Hangzhou and we did a tour to West Lake and went on a boat ride on it's tranquil waters.I wish we had more time here as we only saw glimpses of it's beauty. The boat ride was good but without commentary which was a disappointment. But our bus guide did give us snippets of information.The scenery around the lake is soothing and we saw some flowering Cherry Blossoms.The lake itself features on the Chinese 1yuan note.The weather wasn't kind on the day a bit cold, overcast with some drizzly rain but I would imagine it would be even more beautiful on a fine sunny day"
"Pretty lake, but very crowded","Visited Sat 4/20.  Overcast day with some light drizzle plus normal pollution - visibility ~1km.  Still it was packed to walk around.  You should still do it, but we expected to walk a lot farther than we did . Called it off after ~2k walk and spent day walking around side streets.  Which were still crowded but not as bad as the lake and more fun."
Intoxicatingly beautiful ,"For 300 rmb, I hired a boat for a two hour ride on West Lake. It was really pleasant riding on the calm waters and viewing the intoxicatingly beautiful surrounding area. The weather is spring-like, all year round."
Beautiful ,"Great for a stroll. Peaceful, well kept and great people.  One of the gems of China. A must see of the city."
People and culture are the attractions,"Many western friends complained about the crowds in china. West lake is attractive not because of the nature but the people and culture. I met some friends to walk alongside the lake, sipping green tea (and ironically the most popular place is a coffee shop), and watching people watching birds and flowers. There are some nice and not all are tourists filled restaurants. There are some benches I sat down and just enjoy the afternoon. In a museum near the emperor resort ruins, one can find many interesting history. One calligraphy master had spent his entire life learning from different schools of style. The lifelong learning spirit is admirable. Such a thought pattern has however gravitated towards one side effect of learning for the sake of learning or credentials collection, rather than learning to use and solve problems, among many Chinese students."
Nice scenery,"This place has nice scenery. I took a small boat ride for an hour, costs 150rmb. It’s a fixed rate so it’s all pretty good and cool. The weather is hot and have some wind. I think you should try touching the water it’s surprising cooling!"
Nice lake with beautiful view,It's a very huge lake with lots of trees. Amazing view if you take the boat. 150 rmb for 50 minutes (fixed price)
Beautiful Lake Just Outside the City,"We were brought to West Lake with our tour guide.  Traffic by car and by foot was bad on the weekend, but the trip was worth it.  West Lake is stunning.  The spring brings blooms and mild weather.  Locals and tourists alike find themselves spending time here.We took the boat over to one of the islands amd explored there too.  Beautiful ""lake within the lake"" with little bridges and paths to walk.Then a nice boat ride back.  Quite an enjoyable afternoon!"
Revisiting the West Lake ,"Our last visit was just before the G20 meetings and many roads were closed. This time round we were fortunate enough to book one of the hotels right next to to the lake. However as it was a national holiday weekend the lake (and surrounding area) was packed. While the lake is beautiful as always and great for walks, it would have been nicer if there were fewer people."
Stunning!,"A must do experience if you are in Hangzhou. Do a river cruise and spend the day meandering through the islands and boardwalks. A very peaceful, though busy, place."
2nd time here,"A beautiful park and lake for a stroll, photos etc. We did this as part of a tour both times, and still found it enjoyable the 2nd time."
Nicest Lake we visited,First time to China and was pleasantly surprised with the cleanliness and the politeness of the people. This West lake is a must when visiting Hangzhou.
Wonderful landscape view,"A really nice place with very beautiful landscape view. We visited it during summer time although it was a bit hot but it is worth to take a round trip with either walking, biking or with the hop on/off. Would suggest to take a combination of walking and hop on/off to complete the full circle of the lake. Every corner has its beauty which you shouldn't miss. We have spent almost 6 hours to complete our trip round the lake exploring the secret beauty of this lake."
Beautiful lakeside vistas and historical sites,"We saw Hangzou as part of a 6-cities-in-12-days tour of China. Fortunately it included time to visit the exquisite Xi Hu West Lake area, a very large lake around which the city of Hangzou curls. There is a very large area of parkland surrounding the lake, and it can be appreciated both by taking a boat ride on the lake (about 80 Yuan or $A20 for an hour) or by strolling through the parks and gardens, or both. At every turn there are lovely Chinese vistas of pavilions, pagodas, hills, trees, flowers, fishing boats - and at times a backdrop of the modern skyline of Hangzou city providing a contrast to the natural and historical beauty. We visited on a weekday when it was merely crowded, but were advised that at weekends it is really congested with people from both Hangzou and nearby Shanghai treating it as a favourite day-trip escape from those cities. There is a well-appointed commercial precinct to provide a variety of food and other services, and that area is sufficiently distinct that it does not intrude unduly into the natural charm of the parks and lake. It is also very close to the tea-growing plantations of Longjing, which are worth a visit and could be fitted-in to a single day along with the lake visit. If you are visiting either Shanghai or Hangzhou, a trip to West Lake is highly recommended."
Beautiful lake with activities,West lake is beautiful.Love the water fountain light show here.It's surrounded by trees and it's so clean and green.Love to cycle around this lake. You can rent bicycles to do so.You can do boating in the lake as well. A lot of restaurants around the lake.This is the best attraction in Hangzhou.I've spent hours at this lake just chilling.
For nature walks ,Great place for walks and picnics depending on seasons. Boating is also available for a fee. The parks have beautiful flowers during Spring.
Beautiful lakeside provides a lovely place to bicycle,"It is about 20 miles to ride around West Lake. We made a day of it, riding at a leisurely pace, stopping many times for photographs, eating, and visiting museums, tea farms, and temples. We rented bikes using the Hangzhou bike share. You can obtain cards for the bikeshare at the customer service desk at the subway stations."
Beautiful,"Walked here from Hefang street and so arrived at Yongjin Park. The banks were lined with plum and peach blossoms in full bloom, weeping willows, an arch bridge and a lake dotted with rowboats and larger ferries - beautiful!Took the ferry from Qianwang Temple to Three Pools ... (San Tan Ying Yue). The ferry price of RMB55 is for the ferry to this island, unlimited time there, and then another to any one of 5 piers on the bank of Xihu. If you want just a ferry ride on the lake, you can pay RMB15 just to get direct to another pier (cannot remember which) but the last ferry is at 3.30 pm (we missed that!)San Tan Ying Yue is an interesting and beautiful place for a walk. It is also steep in culture and history and hence probably more meaningful for those with some familiarity with Chinese history and the language."
West lake,"I visited Hangzhou for a week. This region has so beautiful scene with huge Lake, music resto and forest around. Really love this place."
Take a break,"When you are in Hanghzou for business, don 't forget to take a break on Sunday  and go to the West Lake. You'll  see  how Chinese families pass their free time: hire a little boat driven by  manpower  and the shipman wil offer you  tea,  enjoy the beautiful nature from  your  boat or make a walk round the Lake. The only problem will  be the  traffic jam going  back to the city..."
Serene with so much to explore,"Our tour group stopped here and most of the people took the boat ride (which they LOVED). We opted to walk around and stretch our legs instead and I'm glad that we did. While we definitely didn't have enough time to explore as much as we would have liked to, we found all sorts of beautiful areas. We ran into a couple from the US who were teaching in the area and they said that it was their favourite place to visit. The day we went was a little overcast and drizzly but it was still so pretty."
Hangzhou’s landmark,I was having high expectation but kinda disappointed.  Maybe it’s the foggy weather that is affecting the scenery.
Beautiful albeit the crazy crowd!,Visited end Mar and managed to catch the cherry blossoms! Beautiful and scenic although there were throngs of tourists!
Westlake,Picturesque beauty of nature. as far as the eye can see. its well maintained and has lots of activities
Amazing,"If you visiting Hangzhou you must visit west lake, walking area lot of shops, resturants, cafes with great atmospher"
"They say it is the best part of Hangzhou, and I agree","From the time I have come to Hangzhou, I have been hearing from almost everyone that the West Lake is the best place in the city, and after my visit in Jan-2019, I concur with this view. This a huge lake surrounded by several places (hotels, restaurants, places of national importance, etc), and has a very scenic view. The most important part of the story is that it is very well maintained and it is a pleasure to walk around the lake. It was quite cold during our visit, and therefore, we preferred to walk than take a ride or go on a boat ride (leaving them for our next visit). A large number of people visit this place on the weekends and despite the cold weather, it was crowded. We could see quite a lot of senior citizens flying kites, and that was a nice sight."
Divine lake,"For last 20-25 years, West Lake in Hangzhou is the best place to spend early mornings. This time morning was very cold even then you could see a few birds..But in slightly warmer weather, there are these mallards looking so grateful and contrasting...It's wonderful."
Beautiful scenery around the lake,Beautiful lake and paths to hike/walk and look at nature.  This walk can take all day.  You may want to use one of the bicycles available.
Walking along the west lake,This is my second time at West lake the first time I was impressed by its beauty but didn’t see too much of it. This time walking around it for a whole day with nice weather I enjoyed myself. I like the landscaping the interesting sites along the way and the little corners where there are less people and you take take in the sight. At sunset is really nice. There are stops along the way so if you are tired there are rest place. This is especially useful if you have older folks. It is a good idea to walk especially so since roads are single lane and tend to be heavy traffic because is tourist spots.
A beautiful peaceful boat ride!,"On our tour of China we stopped off at The West Lake.. after a short walk through pretty gardens, we came to a big opening and there in front of us was a very large peaceful Lake. We all boarded a wooden boat and headed off for a lovely ride all around the lake, where our tour guide told us lots of interesting facts, the history of the area and pointed out various landmarks like the quaint little bridges. This was a very enjoyable, relaxing part of our tour."
Pure Serenity beautiful,"Wow its big its beautiful , picture perfect , very nice for a stroll stopping taking in the views then off again , catch a boat ride around the lake very nice place."
Afternoon stroll,"Crowded even on a week day afternoon. The view of the lake with the mist hovering above it is nice. Many local elderly folks are also out in the park strolling and exercising, which is nice. Would have been perfect if not for some of the folks smoking and polluting the air 😢😪"
Great Lake view ,"To really appreciate this lake, it’s better to understand more about the history and the related stories.On its own, it’s very packed with tourists from around Hangzhou and within, especially on weekends.Certain areas do not have railings or barriers so it’s better to be careful while walking and enjoying the view.Eateries and souvenir shops are plentiful around the lake."
Boat trip on the west lake,"Took a boat trip on the lake and the view was awesome, with willow trees being planted all around the lake"
"Breathtaking beauty, but make sure to come on a sunny day","It is not a huge lake but considered the most beautiful lake in China.  But make sure you come on a sunny day to appreciate it, otherwise, it'll just be good but not great.  Also make sure you try the following:1) The boat ride to the island in the middle of the lake, San Tan Yin Yue.  That is where the ancient poets, emperors, etc. made a resting place and the shape is interesting (circle with a cross in the middle).2) Walk on Duan Qiao Chan Xue.  On that bridge looking outward towards the lake is considered the ""most beautiful spot"".  And it's associated with a famous ancient Chinese love story.  I'll leave it to your tour guide to explain it to you.3) The tourist park area west of the lake.  Lots of hidden jewels in there.  Ancient temples, amazing tea houses (with the most authentic famous Long Jin Tea) and a great trail that walks through 9 creeks (30 minutes walk).You have NOT visited West Lake if you haven't done these"
Very beautiful,"Travelled to the islands on a traditional boat and, despite being midweek, it was exceptionally busy. This is an extremely beautiful place to visit and several hours can easily be passed in this area."
Beautiful West Lake,"My family and i traveled to Hangzhou last summer vacation.    We arrived there in the morning.There was a heavy rain before we arrived and the air still was wet pure and fresh.so we decided to go to the west lake first.There were many lotuses on the lakes,and the dew was shinny under the sun on the leaves.Sometimes dragonflies would fly in the low air.What a beautiful picture it is! We took a lot of photos there.I was attacted by the view of the west lake.But you should pay attention you would better not go to there on some inportant festivals.There would have a lot of people.    We had a lunch in a restaurant near the west lake.we drank Longjing tea and had some famous good of Hangzhou.They were delicious!    We also visited some gardens.There were a lot of beautiful flowers and most buildings were made of marble.    After that we went shopping.We bought some Longjing tea's leaves for my grandfather,and bought some silk clothes for my aunt.Also,I bought lot of food for myself!    In the evening many places would have snack street.It was also very delicious.But we didn't go out in the evening.we all so tired.    We all enjoyed this trip to Hangzhou.And looked forward to going back!"
A Incredible Trip！,"I arrived in Hangzhou on November 12th with my friends.It was the first time I went to Hangzhou and it's definitely not the last time.On the morning of November 13th,we visited many scenic spots and what impressed me most was West Lake.There was antique and beautiful scenery.The Three Pools Mirroring the Moon was a wonderful sight,which made me marvel at it.At night,33 moons could be seen here!We visited the Leifeng Pagoda and listened to the guide tell us the stories about it.We learned about ancient Chinese culture there.I think it's very meaningful to visit the West Lake.Tips:When you go to the West Lake,the boat tour is a must.Hangzhou is rainy,so you'd better take the clothes and an umbrella.If you need to take photos,take a camera with you."
A trip to West Lake,"I went to Hangzhou for school trip with my classmates on November 2018.We didn't feel a little boring even after such a long trip.We went to the West Lake first.I had read a lot of wonderful words about the West Lake but I was still surprised by the amazing scene.The water was so clear that we can even see some small fish though the water.We took a boat and walk though the grass path.The guide introduced the history of the West Lake for us and I was interested in it because I was a history fan.The weather was rainy and a little windy.So it was perfect for a walk.Fdr lunch,we had some local food such as beef soup and salt chicken.The taste was fantastic!I had a very good time with my classmates."
Beautiful West Lake,"Last year I went to West Lake in Hangzhou with my friends.The weather was sunny and hot, so we decided to ride a boat on West Lake. It's a good place to take a boat ride. We saw many beautiful things. For lunch, we ate the local food named XiHu Sour and Sweet Fish and drank some Longjing Tea. It was delicious."
A Trip to West Lake,"As a Chinese saying goes: ""Up above there is heaven; down below there are Suzhou and Hangzhou.""In Grade 6, I went to the most famous place in Hangzhou--the West Lake.I went there with my classmates.We rode a boat in the West Lake.The scene was very beautiful.But, the  problem was the weather was too hot and the sun was too strong.So you'd better wear a sun glasses and apply some sunscreen.I saw  theLeifeng Tower on the boat.I had a very good time with my classmates."
The Amazing West Lake,The West Lake is in Hangzhou.We go to the West Lake to relax and enjoy the beautiful scenery.Don't forget to bring your camera with you.It is good to visit 2-3 hours.
Lovely West Lake,"The West Lake is definitely a must when visiting Hangzhou!Last year, I went to Hangzhou with my classmates for school trip. It was light rain and soft wind when we arrived at West Lake. We took a boat on the West Lake. The air smelt like grass and a bit wet. I couldn’t stop breathing it in. Then, we arrived in a small island which called “ Three Pools Mirroring the Moon ”. There were a lot of trees, temples and ancient houses. It was really a good place to head for a walk. I also took quite a few photos because I wanted to keep this happy memory. An hour passed, it was time to leave, but no one wanted to do so, we were all attracted by the beautiful view.For lunch, we went to a famous local restaurant——Louwailou Restaurant. We tasted many famous Hangzhou cuisine. Dongpo pork, Beggar's chicken, fried shrimps with Longjing tea, and West Lake fish are among the most popular dishes. They were delicious!West Lake is among my top three choices in Hangzhou! Looking forward to going back!Tip: It is often rainy in Hangzhou, so you’d better bring a umbrella with you if you go outside. But don’t worry, it won’t be rainy so heavily, and it feel really soft and comfortable. Just in case."
Vast Lake,"A must see in Hangzhou. You can just pay 70 yuan for the round trip boat. Once in the island, you can enjoy the scenery and just have a relaxing time. Highly recommended"
Amazing place with great views,"It's basically a big open park that is free for anyone to walk in and out anytime. Within the park there are foodies & cafes, other side of it will be like pagoda or boat rides to the pavilion at the middle part of the pond. The overall experiences was good and nice for chilling. This place was cold during the end Nov season so be sure of enough clothing and bring along umbrella."
Gorgeous view,"Definitely enjoy the boat ride on the West Lake. The beauty of Hangzhou's willow draped islands. The boat ride is slow so you can enjoy the breeze, very relaxing & peaceful. The view is gorgeous! The sunset view is amazing~There is a park/garden near by, nice to sit back & relax after a busy schedule touring in Hangzhou."
Stunning ,"A must-visit place in Hangzhou. Full of history, beauty, mystery and outstanding sceneries. Even though it was rainy and cloudy, I could enjoy a different beauty of the majestic West Lake. Make sure to see the Three mirrors mirroring to the moon, Yi Gong Park and Leifeng Pagoda."
The main attraction,"West Lake is rightfully the main attraction of Hangzhou. I took one of the boat rides to the Island, but you can do very well without those. Just taking a stroll past the shore of the lake is nice. The view over the water is quite nice and I found it quite soothing, despite many people walking past me."
Fantastic night show with lights on West Lake in Hangzhou!,"This was an extraordinary show with singers, musicians, and hundreds of dancers performed at night on top of picturesque West Lake! Impressive, colourful laser lights enhanced the show & lit up the surroundings of this outdoor performance. How they performed on top of the water in a large area is a mystery to me. This is one of the  most innovative, special & memorable shows I've seen in my life!We opted for this ~1 hour, jam-packed show as part of our guided Nexus tour. It was designed by the person who designed the Beijing 2008 Olympics opening show. We sat on bleecher type seats so dress accordingvtovthecwestherv& being an umbrella if needed."
A must visit place in Hangzhou,"I have been to West lake 3 times. But every time, i like this as a new one. Nice walking place. Lots of food options. Several shopping places almost at all corners of the Lake. Only challenge is to find a taxi point while leaving the lake."
Beautiful and Interesting!,"The lake itself is beauty to look at and be on. The surrounding area is always bustling, with plenty of museums, pagodas, pavilions, and parks to explore around. There's always something happening!"
What awesome views,"After a walk through the shopping areas, take the boat ride around the lake.  What amazing views of the small islands, statues, gardens."
"Lovely, peaceful, clean and refreshing","It was nice to see this lake, it is picturesque. People stroll during the day and night. It was a bit chilly, but I was dressed well, wear comfy shoes."
A Never Boring Place !!!,"My favorite place in ALL of china. I have traveled well around the country, and I never get bored of this lake. Always magical and always dreamy"
Really not what I had expected!,"I’ve been suffering the gloomy weather the past few days in Hangzhou and was not expecting much of this trip. It was absolutely amazing! The sky cleared, and the scenery is breathe-taking. Take time to walk and admire the place. Soak in the natural and man-made beauty. Eateries and cafes line the entire enclosed lake. Super long walk. So make sure you arrive at the right part of the lake, or you’ll have to walk a lot to get where you intended!"
The beauty is best enjoyed in the cooler climates!,This was my third visit to West Lake (first two being in summer in late spring) and only now can I say for certain why this lake is so prized by Chinese all over the country. It was lovely in December with the weather pleasant enough to go out to the open in the boat and the stroll along the lake was magnificent and beautiful.
Exciting even in the rain,"When we went here it was raining pretty bad. But we still enjoyed the beautiful pagodas in the background, the many temples and shrines on the way. We were also surprised by a water show in the end. Definitively recommend a day trip if you are visiting Shanghai!"
"Absolutely beautiful, sunset and water show","Absolutely beautiful. I highly recommend walking around the lake during sunset hours when it's not rainy. The water fountain light show is also beautiful, it's right outside the Hyatt. It's quite busy , so watch your bags (security is very tight though). If you want a seat you'll probably have to arrive +40 minutes early, we arrived minutes before and stood at the back, but was still able to see a bit and film all of it. It goes for about 8 minutes. There is also street food along it and many toilets and rubbish bins. A simple walk around the lake is lovely."
"Whenever You Come ,The You Always Attracted","You maybe have visited ,or never have been ,I would say that West Lake always attracts you no matter when you come to visit.Any season spring or winter,any day,sunshine or drizzling,walking happily with your loved one or depressed alone,you will become to feel more comfortable and relaxed for sure.West Lake never disappoints you. I believe the attration of the West Lake is not only because of her beautiful nature sights,but mostly because of her stories which happen everywhere around the lake in the past thousands years. There are many beautiful lakes in the world,but is any lake like West Lake which has so many stories both of classic and morden comedy and tragedy in the past thousands years?Seeing is Believing.The best is you may come to have a look yourself."
Amazing lake,"I advise you to visit this wonderful place and also the beautiful, clean and modern city of Hangzhou! Don't miss them!"
Abreast show on the lake,Went here for a show.i could not believe it was all in the lake.I assume they have placed a platform just below the water. I saw hundreds of performers dance sign ballet and play instruments with a light show going on.. it was marvelous and produced by the same guy who did the Biejing opening ceremony. Really worth it to see .
Fantastic day of sights,"We began walking the entire distance of West Lake at 9.30am and finished at 5pm. We stopped at two pagodas and bought lovely snacks along the way to sustain us - particularly love the tofu fried with spices served in a paper cup. The only entry fee was to the Leifing Pagoda. We saw carp ponds, shrines, groups performing songs and dances in the parks, squirrels coming down trees to be fed by children and I was stopped by some gorgeous old people who wanted to practice their English. All up we walked almost 18km but the photos and experiences were worth it. Should you get tired there are trolley buses which can take you around or you can take a small ferry or a little boat paddled by a local to get you across the lake."
Most beautiful lake. A must for any traveller when visiting Hangzhou.,"This huge lake is breathtakingly beautiful at whatever point you are at. Opportunity to get some fantastic memorable pictures. You can take a ride on the lake in one of the traditional decorative river boats and take a leisurely walk around the lake. This lake is huge but there are different things going on along the way as well as places to purchase refreshments. If you visit try and wait until the sun goes down, very beautiful to see the sun setting over the lake. You won't be disappointed! In the evening the lake takes on another ambience when eateries and restaurants come alive, people coming out to dance and sing, the river boats are beautifully lit up. In the distance the colourful pagoda and Leifeng Tower can be seen towering above the trees looking over the lake and the backdrop of the mountains behind."
Picturesque lake,"It's been said that a visit to the lake is a must when visiting Hangzhou and after our visit, we can understand why. West Lake is huge and a great place to enjoy nature, go for a spot of exercise and capture beautiful shots."
Walk to the other side and enjoy the serenity,"While Xi Hu lives up to it's fame, it's way too crowded 365x24x7. To enjoy the serenity I hiked to the other side of the lake where there's way less tourists. I'd give it 5 if not for the atrocious traffic. If you're going on weekends then good luck getting a cab going home in the evening."
Beautiful scenery and lake ,The scenery at west lake is amazing. Its hard to imagine its just next to the city. There is lots of tourist and locals exercising and trying to take the perfect photos here
missed the snow,"December is cold but not snowing when we were there.   Beautiful scneary all around.   The trick is to dodge the 10k other people who are also there with you.   Winter better than Spring/Summer.    Weekdays better than weekend.   We took the electric golf cart tour around the lake... if you are there during winter, make sure you dress warmly... the moving cart can add a few degrees of wind chills...  burrrr...."
A very beautiful garden and lake,We wandered in the gardens and certainly enjoyed the floral sculptures.  Then we took a boat tour of the lake and eventually relaxed at a Starbucks for a morning coffee.
Famous West Lake Walking,"I visited this place because I remembered during 80’s there was a famous Chinese TV drama called A legend of White Snake, which took place in this area. Hmm.., beautiful and good for walking and also it is close by City center of Hangzhou, just around 180km drive from Shanghai (around 2.5 hours by car). You can also enjoy food plus famous Starbuck coffee in the site.You can also join a boat tour around the lake"
Very pretty lake with available boats,"West Lake is a highlight of Hangzhou, visited by locals and tourists alike. I went on a misty, cool December morning, and spent about an hour walking the paths, mostly on the side of the larger lake. I can imagine that the trails and the lake are much busier in the summer months, perhaps to the point of overcrowding. But it's a very attractive location with an interesting temple complex across the street.  If you have a couple of hours to spare in Hangzhou, this would be a good place to visit."
Okay,"There are better lakes around the world. I don’t see what the hype was about this place. To begin, the lake isn’t even clean. It may be large and tourists could ride some of their boats to transfer from one point to another. But i guess Vietnam’s Halong Bay (even though it didn’t seem as spectacular too when i was there at that time) is a spot higher on my list than Xihu when it comes to that “oohh and aahh” factor."
So Beautiful,The lake is truly beautiful with many interesting sights to stop and look at as you walk.  There is a buggy type bus that would take you around the lake if mobility or energy are an issue.Well worth a visit.  The trees and planting are well maintained.  It is busy at all times of the day.
Beautiful Lake,"If you have time, you can walk around the lake during winter, when the weather is nice and cool. If you are in rush, the local police suggested to us to buy a day ticket from the shop nearby which include all places of interest at a great price."
Quiet lyrical beauty,Just like the ink calligraphy paintings of the masters. Has a quiet lyrical beauty of its own. Avoid the weekends when they Chinese all come out to play. Crowded.
Must Visit,"Take MTR to Xi Hu, had a boat ride visit the lake. lot of thinks to see and eat. If leaving early there, you can take a bus to Lingyin Temple for CHN$2. A must go place in Hangzhou."
Great for a stroll,"Great place for an afternoon stroll, but also very crowded during the summer time. Very nice lotus area"
A popular tourist destination,Very scenic ride around the lake.  Very crowded boat with little commentary.  Food booths were around the lake.  It was raining the day we were there so we did not stay for a leisurely stroll.
Magnificent in any weather!,"This is not just a Hangzhou treasure, it’s a National Treasure! Be aware that on weekends it gets very crowded and there’s not a lot of “crowd control,” but if you head to a less visited section of Xi Hu you’ll still be able to experience the fabulous sights but won’t be jostling for a spot to take a photo. You can easily walk or bike or take one of the small open-air shuttles to further reaches of the lake."
"A trip around West Lake in Hangzhou, China","West Lake is situated in an extensive park outside Hangzhou city.  The lake and surroundings were quite picturesque.  We were on a tour which included a boat ride around the lake.  No real surprises but the scenery was quite nice, with hilltop pagodas dotting the landscape, and a series of special bouys marking the waterway.  The bouys are pictured on some of the Chinese currency.  The area around the lake also provided retail shopping and a very nice pathway for additional exploration."
Beauty,The west lake is a real amazement. the lake was crystal clear and there were catfishes in the lake. the trees with yellow leaves made it a really good spot to take photos. They offer minivan services. The trip is free so why not spend half a day taking photos and exercising?
Try to visit during the daytime and nighttime,The lake is a God blessed place with unusually beautiful views during both the daytime and nighttime.
Amazing,"This is such a beautiful lake and park.  It is so peaceful and picturesque.  I came during November, but I'm sure its even more breathtaking in Spring when the lotus are in bloom."
A review of strictly the lake,"If I were to review all the sights and things to do around the lake (temples, bridges, boat rides, pedestrian walks, gardens, etc.) this review would be a 5 star.  However, as for the lake itself, it is quite average and in some respects not very nice at all.  Case in point:  the water is quite brown and dirty, possibly the reason that no one ever goes in the lake to swim, wade or take part in other water sports such as water skiing, wake boarding and the like.  Plus, the lake is too large to consider it quaint or picturesque; it takes a full hour to take the tourist tram around.  And it isn't large enough to describe it as grandiose or gigantic.  In all respects it is quite average.I live on a lake that has crystal clear, blue water; water sports abound in the summer (parasailing to house boating to paddle boarding to scuba diving).  We can swim in the lake and walk out of the water and not have to shower to cleanse ourselves.  This is not one of those lakes and hence receives a low rating."
beautiful lake ,"The lake is located near the subway. Very convenient to get from the station, the journey takes 20 minutes. The lake is simply unreal beautiful. Very calm, there are animals. See all need a day time. I advise you to visit"
One of the most amazing sights in the world,"If you are even remotely interested in traditional Chinese and asian traditional arts, you just can't miss this place. West Lake has been the inspiration of countless artists thoughout the centuries, and within reason: every landscape you can see from its perimeter has been portrayed in art pieces.The lake is a mix of natural and man-made landscapes, with 10 major ""classical views"" must visit spots and a large number of other incredible sights. Every season is different, and each and every of them is worth visiting. I was there for 3 days in a very warm late november, and the colors were just magical. In 3 days I wasn't able to see everything, it's such a majestic place. I would suggest visiting it in the early mornings from sunrise to 10AM on the Su Causeway side, and later in the day, from late afternoon to early night on the Bai Causeway side, for the best sightseeing experience. Daytime gets very crowded with tourists, so visiting museums or the villas around the perimeter would be better :)There are helpful cars taxing people from spot to spot for just 10 or 20 yuan, so don't be scared to get tired! And resting spots and food stalls all around, for the best travelling experience :)"
Fantastic never ending experience,"This is a really nice area for a walk or bike ride. The landscape around the lake is really beautiful, there are several boat options to enjoy the artificial islands inside and lots of beautiful gardens, monuments or museums around the lake. This can be a short visit or a full day (maybe even more). There are always new things to explore and it's plenty of cafes and restuarants. Really nice!"
A beautiful and peaceful lake,"One can feel peaceful and refreshing when seeing this famous and beautiful lake.Many historical sceneries for visitors to discover like the Broken Bridge in Snow ,So Bridge in Spring,Fish in Lotus pond and many more."
Stunning as expected.,The lake and surrounding parklands are wonderful to stroll around and enjoy. We didn’t make it onto the water to see the central islands but walking round and visiting each temple or pagoda as we went took ages anyway.
Worth a visit!,Guess this is the highlight of Hangzhou.  Spend a full day at West Lake...took the ferry...should try it.
Nice but not amazing!,"We took a boat cruise on the lake and although the skyline looked nice in the mist. There was nothing too extraordinary about this lake. The gardens and trees surrounding the lake were more interesting than the lake itself. Overall, it is not somewhere I would visit unless on a tour."
The Enduring Memories of Hangzhou Show with our friends,"With our friends we took a boat and enjoy the views of the lake, then we went to the show was for the G20 summit .We really enjoyed the show which run for 45 minutes.  It is a MUST see as all happen on the lake, the dancers dance on water with light effects . It worth every RMB ,better to have middle seats ,this allow you to enjoy all corners."
Nothing pretty in Hangzhou anymore,"Be careful, the Hangzhou government has ordered stray dogs to be killed on the spot. Instead of enjoying a boat tour on West Lake you could end up watching the drowning of a stray dog. Started on 15th of November and is still going."
Beautiful & Serene ,"First of all, November may not be the best month to visit Hangzhou if you want to enjoy the West Lake. Weather was overcast & drizzling the three days we were in Hangzhou.  Regardless, it’s hard not to appreciate its beauty & serenity."
Beautiful Lake,"Loved the willows lining part of the lake and view of the trees lining the two causeways from afar. Went on a Sunday, and it was quite packed with people, and also couples taking their wedding photograph shots there.The lake cruise allows one to view the vastness of the lake and get an overall 'snapshot' of various interesting points and places around the lake to visit. It is better to go on a day with nice sunny weather to fully appreciate the beauty of the lake."
NOT recommended,I have visited Hangzhou twice and will never go again. I consider that the streets and the lakes will always be tainted with the blood from all the poor dogs beaten or drowned to death..Shame on the city and the reaponsible people.
Go somewhere else,How can a modern city encourages dog killing in 2018? It tells a lot on the lack of morality and lack of respect for life in this place.
Love the willows lining the shores ,"Peaceful. Tranquil. Beautiful. Entry to the park is free, but pay for the boat ride to get to various sites."
Dreamy historic landscape,What a beautiful culturally rich landscape - the lake surrounded by mist shrouded mountains at least on the day I visited was calming and peaceful. Try and go a little off season as I understand it can get reaally busy during Chinese holidays. Worth getting a boat and enjoying lake from the water as well as from the land.
Beautiful,"It was misty and overcast when I travelled there, but the lake is beautiful. There are lots of people exercising and doing all sorts of other activities. One can walk around the lake, but it is about ten or eleven kilometres, so it is a bit of a hike. It would be a better bike ride. Very restful and refreshing."
Lovely place,Enjoyed our half day tour along Xihu. Took the boat and went to the middle of the island. A very touristy thing to do. Lots of tourists.
So beautiful and a great evening show!,"Do not miss out on The West Lake, to walk the park and take a boat ride was just lovely. There is a lot of people but there is easily space to be alone and just enjoy the beauty of the area. The boat ride was so fun and enjoyable this is actually a man made lake which is massive and the water is actually refreshed every 24 hours by a filtration system, just incredible. But then wait for the show at night there is a cost but do not miss it. It is just simply amazing to see it looks like the performers are actually walking on the water. I would have to say the best entertainment our whole time in China."
Beautiful,"Hangzhou was not far from our house, so we decided to visit Xihu, Hangzhou. We walked along the way in Xihu. It was beautiful: trees, flowers, walls, sculptures made of stones, and the lake itself were combined together into a masterpiece. After walking, we took a small boat Xihu. We could take the boat into the middle of the lake, and I was impressed by the size and beautifulness of the lake. The middle of the lake was very quiet because there were only us which made me comfortable and relaxed. I was not sure it was true or not but the ferryman told us that the lake is very deep and the longest fish living in the lake is two meters. Moreover, there were lots of different restaurants around the lake. It was a great trip, and I will visit Xihu again."
"Beautiful, romantic, scenic and many more","A very beautiful lake located on the west part of a busy city, Hangzhou. If i were a resident of hangzhou, this will definitely be my jogging ground. As a tourist, i find the people of hangzhou a blessed with having such a scenic and beatiful spot right in the city area. Breathtaking views, good and fresh air, with lots of trees and greeneries, there is just nothing more to ask for."
Echanting Lake,Our Tour group went to West Lake in the afternoon for a walk around the lake.In the evening we drove back to West Lake for shoe Impression West Lake
3 days on the lake,"We spent 3 days on the lake and still have not completed the lake yet!Plan your trip clockwise, that is the direction of the buggy."
Beyond beautiful,just go there it is really beautiful and epitomises everything you have seen on idealised paintings of Chinese scenery except that it is for real
Breathtaking views ,"Words can not express the beauty of this place, the ancient Chinese history comes to live when you visit Westlake.  Even though there are so many tourists, you will still be able to enjoy the peace and quiet moment."
A must see in Hangzhou,"Westlake has been famous for centuries. On my first visit here, I only had 24 Hours - and this was a must see. I was able to visit at night to see the night lights around the lake first night and saw it in the sun light the next morning. We took a one-hour boat ride. Although short, I thoroughly enjoyed everything the lake to offer us, and vowed to return and fiend more time. If you have limited time in Hangzhou, visit Westlake and allow three hours (include an 1-hour boat ride). Oh, if all possible, avoid weekend !! Take a boat ride, take lots of pictures (late model cell phone is good enough), take walks around the lake and some of the bridges. If you have more time - I envy you - take your time and walk around the path !!"
Beautiful ,"Such a beautiful area with lush green gardens, lakes, tea plantations, temples, pagodas, pavilions, causeways and artificial islands. It’s worth a trip to look around and take in the scenery and visit a tea making plantation."
China holiday 2018,Very good time to spend out on the lake and get told of the history surrounding it.We had a booking via tour group so was very informative from the local English  speaking guide.
"""most beautiful"" Marco Polo","This lake is a jewel, particularly at sunset. There is a serenity that seems to spread from the lake to the people enjoying the ambiance of the lake. Marco Polo is said to have described Hangzhou as the most beautiful city he had seen; the lake is a good reason."
"very nice to walk around this lake , grat for a day tour","we were in Hangzhou for 4 nights , so we travel by foot along the lake was nice  ( 2 nights is enough) ."
A morning walk by the lake,It was a Sunday morning ... A rest day sandwiched between 2 long working weeks...and it was really a refreshing experience ... The lake is very huge... There are paid golf carts to take you around ( not sure about the route) ... Boating facilities are available... And there are many eateries around... But I tried nothing cause I just wanted to enjoy the picturesque view of the lake amidst the green with a backdrop of mountains... Really beautiful... But it gets very crowded as the day passes... I went in the early morning but was surprised to see already many people ... And as the day passed... It got really crowded... But you can always find a quiet corner for yourself... Enjoy the nature and get refreshed!
"busy, busy, busy","We did a one hour boat tour on the lake. Our bus tour group walked about a km through thousands of people to get on a boat with Chinese tour guides with loud speaker systems  rattling our heads. The lake area is picturesque, but the noise and crowds take a great deal away from the experience. We then walked about a km back through thousands of people to our tour bus. Being an Atlantic Canadian with abundant access to uncluttered waterways and beautiful landscape, I found this to be a ridiculous exercise in getting outdoors in a beautiful area."
Best part of Hangzhou,"The lake is the best part of Hangzhou. But it is not just the lake since there are ""many lakes"" depending on the part. You can ride a boat, walk in the shoreline and around the park (with lots of outdoor activities). If you can, please go as early as possible in order to avoid crowds."
Pretty area - make sure you enjoy a boat ride,"A visit to the lake was included in our tour - was a pretty area but we didn't think it anything special.  Took a boat ride around, which was pleasant.  We only spent a short time, which was good as much better attractions to spend time at - though if you are into gardens, you will enjoy it.  Maybe it is prettier at another time of year, when flowers are in bloom?"
Treasure of Hangzhou ,"If your hotel is a walking distance to the west lake, you should go there before 8 am to enjoy the heavenly scenery to the fullest. After 8 am or so, it’s very crowded and noisy already. Near to the west lake, there’s General Yue Fei memorial place. Yue Fei is very loyal and devoted to his country but executed by his political enemies."
great walking trail and boat ride,"the boat ride is beautiful and I highly recommend. try to get on a boat where you can sit outside or inside the cabin. there is so much to see on the shorelines and you will have a great view from either inside or outside of the boat. I also recommend walking around the park. during summer months there are plenty of outdoor activities like the Ferris wheel, bumper boats, and other water rentals. the day we were in the park there were people flying kites. you can also find people performing Thai chi which is beautiful to watch. next to the park it appears to be an amusement park with roller coasters and larger rides. I am not sure of the name, but if you were looking for additional actitives to participate in that would be another option."
Great for relaxing stroll,Great way to end the day. I went for a walk around at night so the boats you can hire were tied up. Lovely lit up at night with lots of people taking a stroll. Lots of places to stop and get a drink.
Peacefulness and calmness amidst city,"Visited this place in evening and again on another day at night. It's amazing, water is calm, mountains are Serene and once can seen various temples.Must visit place for anyone visiting Hangzhou!"
Heaven of South China ,People wish for Heaven and they have west lakeThis proverb is very true and originalWhen you see the lake you will see this yourselfTry to avoid travelling on weekends or long holidays to avoid rush As this is very convenient to reach from the Shanghai and a perfect weekend get away
Short trip,"Only stopped here for one day. I was here few years ago and lake west seems different. We took the boat and it cost RMB 55 per person. Stopped one island in the middle of the lake west then went to next port. It’s Saturday and many people without manner. Loudly talking that really makes my trip not too confutable otherwise everything seems ok. BTW traffic is bad and places are far away from each other, better arrange car to visit."
Worth taking a walk.,We enjoyed walking around the lake.  You can also take boats out into the lake with spectacular views all around.
Very beautiful ,This lake is amazing! You can really feel the atmosphere when you walking down the lake. Very beautiful and very traditional Chinese. This is number one place of Hangzhou so you have to visit the lake while staying here.
temple,"we had a free day, this temple was the closest on to our hotel. old temple, kept in a good condition, nice view of the lake from the top of the pagoda, the all area is an historical place, which you can spend the all day."
Nice view,We did a lovely boat riding along the lake and it was really great with a nice mountain views. and going back a lot of show that was going on in the park.some are singing & dancing.
Famous lake in Hangzhou,A must visit destination when in Hangzhou. The lake is made up of fresh water according to the guide. We took a cruise on the lake which was quite short. We were told emperor Qianlong from the Qing dynasty visited the lake a few hundred years ago. Lots of Willow trees around and really beautiful. The lake and its surroundings exude a hazy feeling and that is what is special. Place was pretty crowded even though it was a normal day.
"beautiful, scenic Hangzhou","West Lake is beautiful, very nice to walk around after dinner.  All of Hangzhou is very nice, I prefer visiting Hangzhou over Shanghai.  West Lake is surrounded by lovely parks, walkways, cafes, restaurants, and pubs.  During the holidays it can be very busy and crowded, but definitely, you should go during the offseason.  I was there most recently in mid-October, after Golden Week and the temperature was perfect.  Getting to Lingyin Temple was easy and made for a nice day trip."
Walk along side the lake,It's a beautiful lake in the heart of city. A walk along the lake on a bright sunny day is all one needs to relax.
Nice afternoon stroll,"If you have time, it is a nice location to visit and take advantage of the outside.  When I was there in the fall of 2018 there were not a lot of people which made even more enjoyable."
Worth visiting if you are in Hangzhou,I walked along the west coast of the lake for 2-3 hours. It's awfully crowded by other tourists but that's no problem. Alot of sculptures and views to see and boat rides (can be expensive as I saw the upper ones range between 100-200 RMB).
Over Hyped,"West Lake is supposed to be a must-visit attraction in Hangzhou. But if you are not interested in renting a boat, you can essentially take in everything it has to offer in half an hour. Visit it to check it off your Chinese bucket list but go eat at the famous Lou Wai Lou Restaurant along its shores."
Glorious,"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.  Surrounded on three sides by nature and classic scene after classic scene.  Classic stories and poems take place at this lake.  Pagodas and boat cruises, national tea museum and national silk museum close by.  Very beautiful!"
Beautiful at any time,"In China, people always use heavenly beauty to describe the sceneray of the West Lake and you will not challenge it if you have personally visited this spot. Surrounding West Lake, there are also mountains, temples, nunnery, pavilions and pagodas. You can learn so many stories with abundant history behind those scenery spots, some are real and some reflect people's kind wishes. Traffic is convenient in Hangzhou as well, with frequent, reasonably charged and widely covered underground and bus services. A nice place for travel."
Not really sure what all the fuss is about,"Do not go here during Golden Week.....it was busy beyond belief, and we were so jam packed on the boat I thought we might capsize. Because of the volume of people, did not enjoy at all. It is a nice spot, and such, but did not really get why it was such a huge attraction"
Just Too Crowded,although is a place to visit in Hangzhou just a place of too many people.Just hard to relax and have fun now than it use to be
Not during Golden Week,"Don't even consider coming during Golden Week.  Its just going to be people, people, people, people, people, people.  In fact, even on a normal day, there are too many people for me to rate it a 5 star, but that's China today."
Gorgeous scenery and tranquil environment ,"came here with friends as part of an internationalization programme. it was a long car ride though, but I'm glad we made it as it was extremely beautiful and pleasant. would recommend coming here to all!"
Good view,Very good view of sunset. Boating and other facilities are available. Walking trail around the lake is very nice.
Lovely and serene,We spent a couple of hours including a boat ride on the lake and found the experience to be very enjoyable. There are a few casual eating places which we took advantage of for a pleasant casual lunch.
The West Lake in China,This is a day trip. Plenty to see and places to walk. Being a lovely day - the walkways were full of local tourists. No high rise buildings are allowed near the Lake - so you get the feeling you are well out of the city  - with hills on three sides. The fourth side has views of the city in the distance. Plenty of lotus ponds.
Very green,The Westlake is one of the prettiest places we have seen. We quite enjoyed the walk around the lake. I would definitely do this again.
Seminar at China Bamboo research Center,"amazing place to hang out. Varieties of Cultural shows can be witnessed along the lake. the pagodas, and the unique boats floating above the lake are the main attractions."
Beautiful spot in the city,"Loved this place. So relaxing and fun, but very crowded.  Boat ride is nice.  Actually have a nighttime floating theatre production.  Don’t go the first week of October, National holiday.  Beautiful gardens"
Very nice!,"As the first stop in our trip to China, I have to say I am blown away by how beautiful Xi Hu is. However, we thought we would be able to ride a bicycle within the park but was very wrong. There were people everywhere and bikes are not allowed to enter the area. There were people everywhere and very overcrowded. It’s actually quite modern with a traditional twist. Overall it’s a pleasant visit and Xihu itself is very nice. The only cons is the overcrowding that goes on near the entrance."
Serene lake,Lovely boat ride across this impressive lake with great vistas towards the hills and also the city. Very peaceful and serene setting so close to the city centre.
Nice Spot,"Not so much to say. Nice place where all the locals meet for a walk, some sports, fishing or enjoy the view."
Very pretty and tranquil area,Thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the West Lake - the scenery is very pretty and our boat trip around the lake was lovely
beautiul lake,"a lovely lake to cruise on, beautiful scenery and a very relaxing cruise, the gardens around the lake are so lovely,"
A pretty little area ,"It’s not amazing, it’s a lake with surrounding parkland. There are causeways, boat ferries, paths around the gardens etc. Unfortunately it gets incredibly crowded during peak times, so visit during weekdays daytimes if you can. Historically this was a place of significance, but the KFC’s and Starbucks tend to take away from that. Still it’s mostly clean and fresh."
