Must try - Sula stays and Wine tour and tasting session with Pritish,"Sula Vineyard is our goto place for any kind of break that we get, icing on the cake is the tour and tasting session available here.We have always been admirers of the beauty and serenity of this place. Additionally, the wine tours and tasting session with our all time favourite Pritish (for 3 times in a row now) has to be a major attraction. His passion towards his work can be felt during the session and its always a pleasure to meet him and attend his tour and tasting session. Kudos to Sula for the amazing experience and the amazing team that they have !"
Excellent place in Nashik,Excellent palce to visit in Nashik . They  provide a wine tasting tour that has different types of wine . Overall experience is Suberb.
Nice visit,We visited this place in July 2019 with family and friends. There is an entry fee of Rs. 200 per person and you can redeem the coupons issued of full value for any purchase inside the vineyards. The ambiance was awesome with the view of lush green vineyards and with music on.
For Wine Lover,Sula vineyard is a famous wine producing facility located half an hour drive from nashik. It has its own vineyard where grape cultivation is done. Paid guided tour is conducted by vineyard which is quite informative. Guide gives you complete tour inside the factory and shows wine making process and ingredient of different wine.

Must visit for gaining knowledge of wine production,"Sula vineyards is half an hour drive from Nashik. The area is quite huge with cultivation of grapes and production facility for wines. You can take a tour of wine production facility with a guide who explains the various varieties of grapes available and the process of wine making. At the end of the briefing, people interested to taste wine can pay an amount to taste 6 types of wine. The guide also explains the etiquette of wine drinking. It is a different type of experience worth at least visiting once. Ample parking space is available for visitors."
"One of a kind, good food, great info, tour guide needs to humble down a bit","Food at Little Italy was great, the tour was quite informative just that the guy giving the tour needs to humble down a bit. Whilst buying the ticket till the tour end the same guy was with us whilst being on a vacation, I had a feeling I was in school."
Paradise for winelovers,"Having  authentic information  about wine from farm to bottle it was paradise for wine lovers..  It is properly  Properly managed. The  environment was conducive for entertainment with fine music, Italian and Indian food along with world of wine. There were package included  wine tasting and an opprtunity to explore  from A to Z of wine making and  finally could make selection of your choice acording to taste.Viewing  the beautiful wine yard and the  scenery enjoying  with wine of your taste at the open deck resturant  was a  unique experience..Ensure your visit not a dry day.Enough parking facilities were available."
Must visit ,"On a Saturday afternoon around 4pm we reached the Sula Vineyards in Nasik.We were awed by the beautiful of this place. There is a cover charge of Rs.200 per person which you can use to purchase anything at the Sula Vineyards. As we entered, we were welcomed by beautiful decor and a very happening vibe. Do not forget to click some Instagram worthy pictures here. We took the wine tasting tour which started by a tour of the wine factory where a wine connoisseur told us so much about wines and ended with, of course, tasting some wine. They made us taste 6 different wines by Sula and told some really interesting facts about wines. After the hour long tour, we bid farewell to the place with some bottles of wine and happy hearts All in all, we had an amazing time at the Sula Vineyards."
Rasa,The food was amazing and service was also good the way it is decorated the area was quite attractive and the girl name ruhu was adorable and sweet the smile on her face attracts the attention.
Wine lover,It was really nice experience to visit sula Vineyard the staff of sula Vineyard was very supportive and it was really nice .Ruhu is a sweet girl here....
Wine lover,Sula vineyard is a good place. Once a visit is must. Even if you don't drink like me just come and get some knowledge about its making enjoy the smell of fermentation and what not. You can have so many good spots for a click here..if u r a photoholic person....Guide inder sirjee....tussi great ho...üëç

The wine lover place,"It was really an amazing experience the way it is decorated and situated in the gulf of an nature the night panoramic  view ,food was also excellent  the outlet rasa was nice in that there was place to sit outside and the service was also best  and one trainee was there she was also  nice and very  nice and helpful"
The best vines are made here only.,"We, the bunch of folkes visited Sula Vineyards last few days ago. The Mesmerizing experience ever üëå. All the variety of food and vines are great. Also, the experience of making vine is a new thing to us. That spontaneous girl, I think Ruhu, helps us alot to explore the Vineyard. Hope, we come back again. Till then, best luck guys. Keep it up. üëç"
Awesome experience,"it was a great experience at sula vinyard ,the staff over there was very polite, girl named ruhu was very nice and polite."
Wine tasting,This is in Nashik 50 km away from Igatpuri. Enjoy 5 different types of wine tasting by paying rs 400 per person. You will get a factory tour including wine tasting.
If its Nashik... its Sula Vineyards!!,"The place is always bustling with people and at times if super crowded too! The Open Restaurant which overlooks a part of the Vineyard is great only if you get the coveted seats, else the entire experience just fails! Wine, of course, being the highlight of the visit the day to day tours organised are a good experience. However, ours was a free tour since we were residing guests, but I have heard these groups get pretty over-crowded for a regular drop in tour. There were just way too many people visiting and lack of space to accommodate them. Food is also pretty average nothing very great.. it is therefore suggested to stay at the Source or Beyond for atleast 2 days to experience the serenity of the place."
Beautifully designed and explained,"Visited with friends.Lovely experience and really enjoyed The wine and food at the restaurant.Our guide was knowledgeable, well informed and very interesting. My only peeve was the limited accesabilty for a person with mobility challenges.Try and fix that and you have a world class facility."
Nashik trip,Recently visited Sula Vineyard with family. Nice place to visit if you are visiting Nashik.Visiting Sula Vine yard is not free. It's chargeable of Rs 200 each.entry fee can be redeem to purchase of snacks or wine
Wine & Dine,"We went on a guided tour of wine making and tasting, ably and very professionally done by the staff.  We left with more knowledge on wine making and the different types of wines.   The place was tastefully done with bougainvillea hedges,  selfie points and the vineyards in the foreground. Lunch at Rasa was delicious!! A must visit when in Nasik."
Quite a nice place,"We visited in mid Feb 2020, and found the place quite nice. As usually found at a winery there are quite a few spots for photographs etc. The wine making and tasting process was very well explained by our guide Mr Gaurang, and I would go so far as to say he did a great job (even better than what we heard at Napa Valley in USA) !! The lunch at Rasa restaurant was good."
Sula Wines,"This is about Sula wines near Nashik. Nice place. Started by Mr. Rajiv Samant. Sula is short  of his mother's name Sulabha. Good place with lots of fun and food . They explain the process of wine making. Each year the first Saturday and Sunday of February , they celebrate SulaFest. It is fun food and frolic. They have grape stomping as well. But the place is expensive."
Very educational,Enjoyed trip which was partly educational.My friends enjoyed wine tasting. The sula fest was also going on but as it was educational tour i could not enjoy it.In future i will try to attained it.
Fools paradise,"to hit the nail on the head...at the outset I reconfirm that it is a waste of time and money.... the place is located far from the highway and one has to pay a hefty amount to reach here....that apart, its just a place for photo-session as there is no value addition in the supposed vineyard....one would expect that a detailed manufacturing and packaging demo for all visitors as well as sampling for a few ...as is the case with MAPRO in Mahabaleshwar....Alas, all hopes came dashing down....the initial letdown is the hefy fees they charge per person for their no-show....eve TajMahal visitors pay less-where the charges for foreign tourists are 10 times as compared to Indian tourists.....No tourist would want to waste their half day trip visiting the place just for photo sessions and if this is the conditionof One of India's most famous vineyards, then God have mercy on  the Tourism industrythere was no live demo of the wine making process for which one ends up paying Rs 200 per head and if ur lucky then u may have a glimpse of the same.... the food on the deck is expensive with a salad platter costing Rs 160/- excluding taxes....so redemption of entry fees is a misnomer and a fools dream...the staff is discourteous and demeaning and look down upon local tourists favouring the foreigners...indicating that you are not welcome in your own countryALL-IN-ALL....AN FORGETTABLE EXPERIENCE AND UNDOUBTEDLY DISHONORABLE FOR GULLIBLE INDIANS"
Sula fest 2020,"I visited sula vineyards for their fest 2020. Sula vineyard is a good place to visit and the fest is also enjoyable experience.  But I would like to bring some issues to the attention of sula fest team. There were not enough toilets for the women guests and they have to stand in long multiple queues for their turn. This is so appalling. Next, the visitors to the fest are prohibited from  carrying their own drinking water bottles. Instead they have to buy water bottle inside,that too only 500 ml bottle is available.This is such a gross decision considering the humid & sunny weather in Nashik and the amount of plastic dump it created. The basic necessities for drinking water and toilet facility,not attended properly in the fest gives an unpleasant feel regarding the fest.I kindly request the concerned personnel to address these issues and to make sula fest a memory to cherish with."
Wine to start the new year :-),Perfect place to understand the details of wine making and processing. Several instagram worthy spots for photos. Reasonable charges for day tour (just INR 400) which also includes wine tasting session. You get to taste 5 types of wine along with whole lot of knowledge.
"Nice place, a must visit if you are in Nasik","We visited Sula vineyards in evening of 31st Jan 2019. Entrance fees is 200 INR per person but this amount can be consumed in food court or wine tour. There are two options for touring one is with tasting and one without tasting.Without tasting one costs 200 INR per person and with tasting one costs 400 INR per person. Tour lasts for 30 mins in which tell you how wine in prepared and ends with wine tasting.Food court is pretty good , Pizza and Garlic bread is a must try apart from the wines.All in all a good place to visit for 5-6 hours."
FAMILY TRIP TO SULA VINEYARDS,"1. We visited on Christmas day in 2019.  Reached there at opening time... the crowd was building up.  Entrance fee is Rs. 200/- per person which is adjustable against any of the purchases inside the vineyard.2. Winery tour is conducted for a batch of approx 30 members, every hour, by one of the trained staff from the Sula.  Tickets for the same is costing Rs.400 (for adult members, above 21-who are only eligible for wine tasting).  The entry fee amount was adjusted against this purchase. 3. The winery tour lasts for 30 minutes ; wherein the procedures of wine preparation, preservation and storage techniques are explained.  The guide with us was fluent in English as well as Hindi and was excellent in his assigned task.  Cannot recollect his name... Mr. Singh from Punjab...Good Work...4. Tasting part covers briefing on how to hold wine glass, type of glass and minute details of tasting techniques are covered.  (Informative !!.)  Guests are offered six different varieties of vine for tasting (kids are kept out..).5.  The place is ambient... lots of photo and selfie locations....add upto your photo collections..6. Overall a very nice experience...a must visit ..when your are around Nashik.Cheers !!!"
"Nice place, good wine, sunset is really beautiful ","We drove to Sula from Mumbai via Trimbakeshwar temple. Takes around 4 hours to drive from Mumbai to Sula. Nice road, so pleasure to drive. Sula is a nice property, vast vineyard and wine is good. There are couple of restaurants in the property. Wine tasting tour was good, it is conducted every hour. Best time to visit the place is around sunset. The place is outside Nashik and takes around 45 min by car to reach Nashik."
A day‚Äôs trip is more than enough,"We visited Sula vineyards for lunch and stayed back to enjoy the ambience. Nothing much to do except the wine tour which lasts about 30 mins followed by wine tasting. We stayed on for dinner. Indian food at Rasa was average, but the wines were good and we ended up buying a few. Good to go during Sula fest ( feb 1 & 2 )  when the whole place comes alive with music and people."
a nice place to spend time,"you can spend few hours here.photogenic and specially the view from restaurant.can have a tour of taste wines,can purchase if u taste something good wine."
"UBER PATHETIC , REPULSIVE FOOD","Property is good. don't understand why people are milling when Sula fails to offer an outing experience. Except wines, the F&B is pathetic. Besides, if one has to order small finger foods its shocking more than appalling display of offerings it has on the First Floor or the Main Building.Being a Vegetarian, I was forced to order Snack Platter. And to my utter disbelief, I was served with some burnt garlic paneer ( 3 cubes), one Dhabeli ( ...Sick) and about 7/8 French fries. I was aghast at the fare for which I was charged a Bomb 500/- buck.Sula should be ashamed of dishing out such pathetic and cheap fare and pinching pockets of unwary travellers.I think someone should stop this Macabre Charade of Sula and stop visiting it. Its a TOURIST TRAP of sort and nothing exciting about visiting the place and planning to spend a day with family.I STRICTLY NEED SOMEONE IN INDIAN TOURISM DEPARTMENT TO TAKE COGNISANCE OF THIS Venue that is fleecing people each day.NEVER TO PATRONISE OR VISIT THIS PROPERTY UNLESS YOU ARE DEPRIVED OF A GOOD WINE....SIC."
Perfect place for Sunday brunch with wine ! ,we visited the Sula vineyards in the scorching may heat but the chilled wine and lush vineyards made it completely worth it.. the open air cafe serves the best finger food in town and the wines there are brilliant.. they play some soft music and serve you chilled wine... it‚Äôs a cool cafe overlooking the vineyards and it‚Äôs very relaxing .. they have an entry fee that can be adjusted with your restaurant bill so it‚Äôs worth it ... the Late harvest Is to die for ! they have some very cute picture clicking spots in the premise for the enthusiasts.. they also show the wine making process and the various methods used to prepare the different types of wines... they also discuss about other interesting facts on the wine business ... the wine shop and souvenir shops are good too... overall a fantastic experience and a good place for a weekend hangout with friends !
Visit to Vineyard to know Vine culture,We visited to Sula Vineyard in the evening. Overall area of Sula Vineyard is beautifully arranged and maintained. There is Vineyard tour to understand the how it is made and store. They also offer vine taste as part of tour. You have to Pay ‚Çπ200 as entry fee and that Ticket you can redeem at Vine shop Or at the restaurant They have good restaurant as well. Overall good experience
Short Trip with family to Nashik and Sula Vineyards!,"We had been to Nashik in the last week of October 2019... Just a short road trip from Mumbai with my husband and Teenage son!We had booked a stay for 2 nights at hotel Panchavati Yatri in Nashik...best choice we felt as it was a very comfortable stay... Very polite and ever ready to help hotel staff and super delicious food at their restaurants... There are 3 attached to this hotel... All three are very good! We reached Nashik very early..about 10:30 in the morning...so did an early check-in...and after freshening up we went for a spiritual tour of the city...by a local Autorickshaw...who charged us ‚Çπ400 for all the spots...and about 1&1/2 hours.... It was ok...as most of the places are not at all maintained... except Sita Gufa , Panchavati and Kalaram temple...others are not worth your time.Next Day we had booked a wine tasting and winery tour at Sula Vineyards...it was really nice and beautiful... thoroughly enjoyed the day...the afternoon lunch at their restaurant ' Italy' was really good... scrumptious Italian food!We had a good time both the days...the next morning we started back for Mumbai...and decided to visit the Dadasaheb Phalke museum on the way...this was a total mood dampener...as it is in total shambles...and looks like a haunted place... Shamenon the authorities for not maintaining it at all... and wasting the taxpayers money!Please Do not visit this place.All in all it was a relaxing 3 days for our family üòç...Looking forward to more such short trips in future."
A must visit place...,Sula Vineyards... An authentic engaging warm tourist place... Must visit for a vacation for Everyone... Special credits to the chef for serving best food üòç... Five stars to the property and warm service..
Nice weekend getaway,This place is nearly 20 kms from Nashik city. The wine tour is informative and tasting tour is quite an interesting experience. The restaurant is expensive and food quantity is less but views are worth it! Best time to visit the place is in month of January and February.
Tree house at The Sula Source was wonderful!,"Me and my husband stayed at the tree house in Sula Source Vineyard. The tree house was very big and comfortable. The house was private and far from the main house.  Breakfast was delicious. Dinner was not included, but the menu was good (Indian and international cuisine were available). Just make sure you check your bill! Because they charged us for and extra dish by mistake, and they were not able to void it in the system, so they made us eat the extra dish and pay for it. Overall the vineyard was amazing (one of the best ones we had visited) and the wines are OK."
Nice place,"Nice place,  entry should be free rather than complimentary tickets which can be encash in gift shop."
Nice place to spend the evening.,"Nice place to visit once. In my opinion, the place is hyped up and very expensive and crowded too, difficult getting a table  at the gallery.  Tour and tasting session looks expensive again, around the world it is usually complimentary."
Awesome stay,"We had a really memorable stay at The Source Sula Vines. Top of the line service and very warm, friendly and completely service oriented staff. Excellent food. Temperature controlled pool in this season is such a blessing !! Very tastefully done place with a fantastic vibe. All in all a very very pleasant experience. Look forward to coming again !!"
Sula Trip with Family ,Had an amazing time. Got to know a lot of stuff about how to make Wine and know the process too. Amazing places for lunch over there to eat with families and friends. Live music outside with local bands from Nashik. Overall a good time spent with my family over there.
Good tour of Vineyard with tasting ,Knowledgeable guide who could answer many questions from tourists. Few questions remained unanswered due to apparent proprietary information. Would not stay at this overhyped overpriced place. Visit is fine. Would rather stay at Taj for half the price!
Horrible welcome experience ,"The visit to sula in the evening on 14/12/19 was horrible. First of all when we visited the restaurant we were searching for the table, unfortunately no one assisted us. Then i asked the server to assist us with a table. The server informed us that you can sit as soon as you see a table. After waiting for 15 min I fortunately found a table but as soon as I approached near to the table, some other guest sat there. Then we again informed the server that we came first, so he told that sir if u see a table you have to go first and sit immediately, which means there was no que system. The server seemed to be unprofessional. Being such a big brand they should have some protocols in favour of the guest but the service they provided was horrible. THE STAFF SHOULD BE MORE COURTEOUS AND TRY TO PROVIDE MORE WELCOME EXPERIENCE TO THE GUEST."
Very average and over hyped,"We visited this place during October for a day. The place is over hyped and very average. Starting with the car parking area was very shoddy and dirty. The wine tour was very average and dont understand why they charge Rs 200 for that 10 min below average tour (does not include any tour to the vineyard itself). The person giving the tour seemed very annoyed at any questions asked to him. We did not go for the tasting since the reviews were not great. The only nice place is the level 1 bar where you can spend some time. Wine store had good collection. But again, dont understand why were they charging Rs 10 for each bag while buying the wine bottle; Of course its not a fine experience. We tried the Italian restaurant which was very average and very pricey. Overall very below average experience; would not recommend this to others."
Sula wines üç∑,Sula wine is the most visited place in nasik. International famous spot of the nasik and best place to taste fresh n good wine
Sula the heart of india ,There is types of wine red white champagne sparkling Chenin blanc sula brut rose shiraz Cabernet  sauvignon blanc nice taste like dry wines
Great place ,"Went here with business clients, amazing place. You should try Wine making tour and testing session. They have 2 in a day. Even non alcoholic person like me also can enjoy. Restaurant food and service is very good also varieties are very vide and good. Must try when In Nashik"
Loved the tour n tasting,They have there factory tour n tasting program. Since it was not grape season couldn't see real processing but there representative explained everything nicly. We got to taste 6 premium wine. We loved the dessert wine. It was something which I never had tasted.
The good time for everything,Great place to enjoy üòâ 100 words may be less as there are no words Good place to enjoy a great time with some one you love Romance is in the air because it has the intoxicated air of the wine üç∑ factory and lovely open garden till your eyes can see Love to go again and again again with my item Love you all
Nice place but now it‚Äôs very expensive.,I have been to this property many times before but during my last visit in August 19 I found that visiting Sula is no more economical. They have imposed entry free of Rs. 500/person. Additionally to this if u want to taste wine/visit complete property/ see how wine is made then you have to buy  additional ticket of Rs.400/person for what they call is Winery Tour Package.
Lovely place but crowded on weekends ,"Lovely place for some wine and vineyard view... food is okay, wine is the best part. Its better to visit on weekdays than weekends if prefer a peaceful day out there"
Not so great!,One time visit is fine.But as the place is hyped its not that great! If your live in nasik you can go at this place as a short drive or something.Food and beverage is expensive.Wine is average quality if you have tried other amazing wines!
Romantic Evening,This is one of the best place near Mumbai. All must visit this place without fail. Wine processing tour n wine tasting really gives you nice experience. Drinkers/Nondrinkers both will enjoy it. Specially evening time one has to take this experience in their restaurant with nice music and refreshing snacks.Well maintained property which is always neat n clean.All are requested to please visit this place and feel this experience.
Wine City Of India,Sula wine yard is one of the amazing place you want to visit in Nashik.here you can see the viticulture and all process of making wine with minimum ticket prize and a natural scenery in Bonus.
relaxing place,Great place to visit or stay. Enjoyable winery tour and testing.The guy giving the tour was knowledgeable and funny and that made the experience more interesting. Big place with good security and overall management.
Weekday chillax ,"Been to Sula before- but gets crazy over the weekend. This time- being a weekday it was nice, got the front view at their wine tasting restaurant- limited menu and it is just right because the food comes really fast. With the wine, I like the cheese platter. The chilli chicken was yummy. One cannot go wrong with hummus and pita bread.The vibe, music, staff who knows their stuff, small touches makes Sula a great place to visit.Yes, there is crowd! It has become one of those tourist tick mark places. What the heck! It just feels good."
"Waste of time, energy and of course money!","Got info about this vineyard from some of my friends. But the place is a hype with no value addition to your GK in vines and grapes. The place is far from Nashik city(around 20 kms one way) with some part of the road having bumpy ride. Telephone nos given in the website doesn't work. There is no information in the website regarding how much v have to pay for the entry, tour and tasting inside the facility. At the gate, v were asked to pay RS 200 per head and assured that the same can be redeemed for any product sold inside. Once inside, V were asked to pay RS 400 per head for tour and tasting of facilities, if v want to sip/taste wines. Otherwise for simple tour, RS 200. As v were about to take RS 200 ticket, counter Guy told that the tour would b just a lecture session as the factory is closed and vining operation starts only from Jan to March. Utter nonsense, the same can be better understood by seeing some YouTube videos!. So v decided to redeem our ticket charges at the gift shop. At the gift shop I checked with a guy named""Yugesh"" regarding lack of information on pricing etc in the website. As I have seen review in quora regarding charges of RS 250 to RS 100 for tour/tasting and the same was mentioned to him, he first denied any such rates and later he accepted that these rates are for students. May wisdom prevails on him as I wonder whether this place is catering to students to make them""future sharabis""!. Further, there is no price tags in the merchandise. When I checked, Yugesh told that they will never put the same, which is unethical.  Absolutel rubbish and the place is manned by baffoons with no manners. Finding the facility with no more than a few props for photography, v clicked some pics for showing off! and left with bitter memories. Seems the facility is interested in fooling the innocent people by charging them the entrance fees which  they will have to compulsory redeem by paying more for some other useless products inside the facility. One may avoid the place and may take cue from the other negative reviews in TripAdvisor about this place."
Wine and luxury ,Sula is an abode of wines.. wer we could get some limited edition bottles and the luxury  the vineyard resorts provide are very good.The staff's are also very friendly and cooperative.
Lovely vineyards,Beautiful property and great service. Had a wonderful stay. Perfect weekend getaway from Pune/ Mumbai.
Fun.. Food.. Wine.. View... ,It was my first ever visit to a wine yard and see the widely stretched grape vines.. Wine making tour..Seeing huge Collection of wines..!  One can en joy wines and good food. All age groups can gain good experience. Crowds are disciplined. Must visit place in Nashik.
Sula: One day leisure trip,"Its a 4 hour drive from Mumbai on Mumbai Nasik highway. Well, the drive is enjoyable during monsoons but you won't be able to see grape ripening during that time.Grape cultivation can be seen from October to Feb. Entry ticket is ‚Çπ200 per person which can be settled against goodies you buy inside the vineyard.Wine tasting is must which includes a trip to brewery along with the guide which keeps on explaining the different stages of wine making.Cost if ‚Çπ400/ person. Also, the property has Indian & Italian restaurants apart from bar. You can also buy merchandise and Wine.Also, they have resort to offer.. so if anyone is planning one's bachelors, place can be useful."
Place to go ,"Great place. Nature at its best. Food was great and service was just superb. You can shop wine and they have a good gift shop. Overall, great experience"
Vineyard,It is one of the famous vineyards. Sula wines üç∑ are famous worldwide. This vineyards is located in Nashik and has a good attraction.
"Wonderful place, fun and chill.","The wine is nice.The weather is breezing.Really love the live music at the bar.The entrance fee is RS 200/person, so prepare some cash for this.Nice place for young people!"
Taste & Tour ,Decent place to spend quality time with friends. Surrounded by grapes üçáfarm and you can experience the manufacturing process of wine. And also see the unique collection of wine. U can also opt for Tour and taste package!

Educational tour,Sula vineyards is one of the largest wine producing company . They have Variety of wine and Sula is a complete holiday destination.
Best place,"Amazing view of mountains and the vineyard from the open restaurant. A lot of picture-perfect spots inside the campus. The ambience of the restaurant was very classy with choicest music playing in background. Though the food was quite expensive and tasted just average.The Sula wine tour (Rs 200 per person, Rs 400 if tasting to be included) just included showing off some machinery, containers and barrels, as there was no live process going on. There was no tour in the actual vineyard."

Desi Vineyard!,"Sula VineyardsWash away your sins.NashikTired and dirty After Anjaneri , I called Sula to ask  if I can come in my dirty trekking shorts - they said ‚Äòno dress code here just come thirsty üòÄ‚Äô‚ù§Ô∏è ! I did. The lavish #Sula is truly one of its kind. The vineyards welcome you 365 days with stay facilities ( pay premium). Parking is free, you pay 200 Rs to enter which can be reimbursed for any services you buy. I took the #SulaVineyard tour . I was impressed as the tour is designed for Indians who are fairly new to the concept of #wine and they teach you right from how to hold the glass to how one can distinguish between basic wines.  Wine is made from homegrown grapes but the oak barrels come all the way from #California - the best wood for the grapes to marinate in.  #Winetasting was fun and it was a good way to meet other solo travellers. Priced at 400 Rs the one hour tour and tasting was a good investment. Food was overpriced for the taste,  but guess priced correctly for the ambiance! The view of vineyards is amazing as you sit sipping some delicious grape juice. #Sunset is the best time to be here. 6:30 PM is the last tour of the day. I was annoyed by young ‚Äòlifestyle bloggers‚Äô ü§≥who were busy doing photo sessions and disturbing other guests.  I would rather gaze at vineyard than on skinny girls in hot pants and flowing skirts, pouting and trying hard to fit in. It is a vineyard, only way to fit in is to grab a glass and cherish itü•Ç!  I could not have asked for a better way to end the Nashik trip. Kudos to wine capital of India! I did wash away all my sinsüòÅ.#punintended üòå.I am glad to conclude by 3 posts for 2 days in Nashik. Feel free to reach out. Instagram: Tandoori_delight ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè‚ù§Ô∏è."
Fun is in the air!,"This is one of those places where as you enter you feel fun is in the air, Good music and breeze welcomes you as you enter. Little little photo spots along the entry. You can take a small winery tour with a wine tasting session. There are a couple of restaurants one of which you can sit back (if you manage to get a table) enjoy the amazing view of grape farms along with wine and good food. They have a wine shop which sells wine at a discounted price also has a gift shop. You have an expensive option of staying there as well but an overall good place for a day trip!"
Very good experience,"Sula Vineyards is a very pretty place to spend some good hours. The scenic views, good food and amazing collection of wine makes it worth. The tour is brief but upto the point and concludes with the best part where the guests are given 6 different wines to taste. I would give them 4 out of 5 overall only as it can get really crowded and there aren't many arrangements made to accomodate the rush, especially on the deck. Overall it is a must visit for anyone going to Nasik for a short getwaway."
It was just ok ,"Visited Sula vineyard... it was ok, nothing great.... not very interesting...may be its good in month of January when you can do grape dance... Italian restaurant was good...location was good"
must visit,beautiful location.just 20 min from nashik.huge property.wine making tour is very good.wine tasting is interesting.restaurents are good with delicious food.one can opt for the stay option also as hotel in the vineyard is good .
Sula vineyards,"Overall good, but staff at wine bar on the deck is rude as hell, he asked me to get up from my table which was allotted by the manager just because I was going to order food and coffee and not wine and asked me to kill my time by clicking pics.Do not recommend to go on the deck. Rest is fine."
Disappointed with the tour,"Went with my family - mother who is a senior citizen and doesn't understand English, husband.We took the wine tasting tour.In the start when the guide asked for language preference, we told him explicitly it is Hindi since my mother did not understand English. The initial part of tour was conducted in mix of Hindi and English. It was still manageable till then, however the later part which was wine tasting tour was in English only. I fail to understand why was the preference asked if it was meant to be English only? All during the wine tasting tour, my mom was clueless as to what is going on. Nowhere is it mentioned that the tour would be for English speaking people only then why not in Hindi? I gave this feedback to the guide as well before leaving.From what I understand, most of the Indians might have an option of English or Hindi but for some, English is not really an option. I think this should be obeyed and maybe some arrangements should be made which would take care of such sensitive issues. An option I can think of is having different language tours, people would then be able enroll themselves to the preferable language tour. If this is not an option, the ticket should be issued to English speaking people only!Frankly it was supposed to be a good family time, tour has turned it sour."
Good taste! ,"Good for those visiting for the first time, nothing extraordinary, good experience. Their souvenir shops has overpriced items."
Good Visit..,We visited this Vineyards in the month of July... They had a cover charges of rs. 200 per person and It is Redeemable inside. They have multiple Photo Points here where people can be seeing taking lot of Pics. We opted for Vine tasting tour and It was good knowledgeable session. They allow you to SIP 5 different types of Vine. After all these we went to Restaurant on the first floor and was quite disappointed to see the mismanagement there. It took almost 20 min to them to clear the Table and another 45 min to serve the snacks. Big Disappointment. We quickly decided to move to another Vineyard nearby for Dinner.  Rating is for Vineyard tour and Vine tasting not for the restaurant.
Excellent,"I have been here in 2008 and now in 2018 absolutely lot many changes in terms of infrastructure. Enough parking, options for food and beverages and they will take you for an hour tour of properties explaining wine making process and at the end wine tasting session. Good Italian restaurant, reasonable and authentic, good food and service. Good to visit during winter months."
Surprise plan,I visited with friends as random plan was made. The place is too good to go. There was wine tour which you can taste 5-6 different types of wine. They will tell you the process how wine was made. You can even buy a glass of wine with picture clicking view.
Average visit,It was an average visit. We visited sula on our way back from a trip. Its a pretty big place. Made for wine enthusiasts. It has a huge area of plantations. Basic wine tasting and wine making process. Nothing exciting.
Random Visit ,"Very good Place to visit, but missed lot of fun, will suggest you should visit during Jan - Mar you will love it ..."
One time visit,We never visited vineyards and that was the only reason to go and checkout this place. So comparison is not even coming into picture. Just spend some quality time by clicking some pictures and tasting the vines.As they mentioned it was not riping season we couldn't see the actual process of vine making. Still we were able to see and understand various steps carrying out in vineyards.Activites involved1. Vine tasting2. Tour - vine creation and processingChargesEntry - 200 INR per head (Redeemable inside while purchasing or opting for vine tasting).
Marketed wine brand,"Sula is the name that comes to everyone's mind when they think of vineyard. The name has been earned with a lot of marketing and is within the reach of every individual. But just remember, Sula being a mass producer of wine, the quality of the wine is impacted a bit and that doesn't let you have smoothness in the wine. Though the vineyard is nicely built with a spectacular view, one can visit the vineyard to enjoy the wine."
Sula,Beautifully done yo with a view to entertain visitors. Lovely vine tasting session. Dinner also we had there at restaurants within.
Beautiful and serene ,"Beautiful, calming, and great wine! Excellent views from the terrace and good music. Busy even on the weekday that we were there!"
Beautiful as ever,It's a pleasure visiting Sula everytime.. the food and wine is great.love the ambience. The food is priced at higher side
Anniversary Celebration !!,"Wanted to celebrate our wedding anniversary in a place which is close to nature and also not very far from Mumbai. We landed up in the right place ""Sula Vineyards"". It was an awesome experience of staying there because of its location, complimentary wine tour and testing and off course the greenery around. Staffs were very polite and helpful. We did not try a lot of food in the in-house restaurant ""Janus"" but whatever we tried was good. Only thing is wine is sold on MRP and did not notice any discount. There were offers on grape seed oil. Over all it was pleasant 24 hours."
Nice place to hang out with friends and family,"Visited Sula Vineyards along with friends and family, it is lovely place with nature all around you, there are 2-3 restaurant to chose from but the most popular is the one with balcony and view of the vineyard. The food menu is very very limited however the same is made up by the excellent view. I asked if I could get fresh lime water for kids and was informed that they have only canned juices which was strange, also when we enquired about availability of coffee, we were informed that the coffee machine was not working. They also have Little Italy restaurant which we did not visit but I understand that it services good Italian food.Nice place to hang out for 3-4 hours."
Good experience of sula with the tour and tasting guys,Very wonderfull explanation of wine specially Mr.Pritish from the tour and tasting Dept. the way he explained the tastings of wine appreciate his work and was fun loving person the way he mix up with the guests and answers the queries amazing work dude keep rocking with the passion you having for wine and sula .
Excellent trip,The place is well planned and the trip is excellent. Worth trying the raspberry chocolate. Wine tasting was awesome and so was the explanation.
Perfect blend of leisure pleasure!,"The vineyards remind you of Bollywood song backgrounds and you start clicking the moment you step in. The memento stores house thoughtful and beautifully crafted souvenirs. The food is finger licking but once you order your wine you are transported to another world. Came back levitating, would want to go back again!"
Lovely business history,"This is lovely vineyard of India with history of how the business started in India and expanded multifold over the years, lovely wine tasting tour to be taken and good time to see action is March/ April"
Great experience & friendly services from the front staff & the receptionist. ,"It‚Äôs a place of a finite experience. Had work related meeting in the city & decided to experience Sula as usual with colleagues last weekend. We also decided to play chess & it was a perfect experience for us with the wine. The scenic atmosphere, the ambience gets you in the good mood. It‚Äôs a bit crowded as usual but this time we got the table pretty quickly. Thanks to the receptionist Bheena. Apart from tasting one of the finest Riesling wine, we were delighted with the friendly services of the staff. They always greet you with warmness & make you comfortable. Bheena personally took good care of us & spoke in length about Sula, the work ethics & about the making of wine. We also met the assistant sales manager Suyash Gupta who is also a chess enthusiast & has represented India in the nationals. We were warmly delighted with the company & the services. There are other vineyards in the city but the friendly experience we get from Sula always makes us come back again and again. Thank you."
Too Crowded and Slow Service,"Sula is probably the most famous vineyard of Nashik. Hence at any given point of time, it's always crowded especially in the evenings. Getting a table itself is a challenge. Wine is exceptional but the food service is quite slow. Avoid Saturdays and Sundays if you intent to enjoy a breath taking view of the Gangapur Dam backwards and enjoy your wine in tranquility. Music is good, so is the tour of the vineyard. Worth visiting. Recommended."
A visit to a winery & vineyards in Nashik,"Had visited this winery & vineyards in Nashik a long back ago. It is a popular tourist attraction and is visited by many tourists all over the country.This winery & vineyards has become popular due to the production of wine and cultivation of grapes. One can enjoy a wine tasting experience as well as grape stomping. This complex has a vast stretch of vineyards, wine cellars, a wine bottle store etc. There are two restaurants such as Little Italy and Soma in this complex. Also, there is a Greek styled amphitheatre where the annual live music festival 'SulaFest' is being held. It is a good place for photography. One can visit the backwaters of the Gangapur dam located close by.This winery & vineyards is an ideal place for sommeliers, families, couples as well as friends. It is a must visit place and should not be missed while in Nashik."
Over hyped expensive place ,"It's a nice property however the property is expensive. I like wine and have had lots of wine across the world, the wine is not so good."
Excellent sightseeing,Very nice vineyard with an excellent view.kids friendly place with a couple of restaurants.There are two options of visiting d farm a tour n tasting wine combo we took just the factory tour n it costed us 400 rs for two adults n a kid.we can take many pictures their.
Nice Place,Nice place to hang out with friends and family. Go on Saturdays to enjoy the DJ else on weekdays if you like to spend time in calm and natural envt
Vanshikaa‚Äôs Summer Holiday Outing,"Vanshikaa thoroughly enjoyed her outing in Sula Vineyards in Wine Making and tasting visit.. Very well explained & interesting tour of making wines, different varieties of wines and tasting wines was splendid from how to hold the wine glass,  swirl, taste & drink.. And lunch at Rasa was the cherry on the cake. Thanks a lot Rajeev Samant and your vision of making Nashik a Wine District.."
Visit to a wineyard,"Excellent tour of the facility, good wine tasting experience with specialised explanations. The facility is well maintained and the tour well organised. The food court is extremely well served with food and wine"
Sula Visit with Parents ,The property is very well maintained. The food at Little Italy and Rasa was very tasty. There is no lift for senior citizens to go to first floor of viewing deck. The staff is extremely helpful.
I love this place ,"Wow, i can't amazing this type of place. Very nice. I love this place. I have visited with friends and family. I feel so happy. t's nice, but it closing very early.. It would help for many working person."
Best of the Vineyards,It can't be that a wine lover wouldn't have heard the name of it specially if you are in n around Maharashtra. Very nice place. Do take the tour and you will enjoy tasting different but amazing tastes. Restaurants are also good.
Hip destination..Must-Visit place during Nashik travel!,The vineyards are superb to walk around. The Actual winery is also worth taking a tour around. The Guides are thoroughly professional in detailing every aspect of wine-making. The souvenir shops has great stuff to buy from. And so does the wine shop :-D There were sooo many people wanting to but alcohol there. Probably getting it at cheaper rates then outside. Lol.
"Nice ambiance, great attraction","When in Nasik, One must visit this place. Nice place to spent some time.. sunset time is the best to visit. plenty of selfie points..nice backdrops of wall painting ... Go for winery tour if u realy interested. Or else just enjoy your wine at upper deck with nice music.Happy Tripping"
Fabulous,Having visited a smaller vineyard we thought the experience here would not be so good - how wrong we were!This is a well oiled machine with so much going for it - you could easily spend the best part of a day here and they have made it fun as well as informative!It‚Äôs probably the best known vineyard in India and having previously tasted some of the wines both in UK and India we knew they were palatable.  However the tasting showed us that there is more depth to their range of wines than we originally understood and even though taste is subjective they have some very good wines!They also have accomodation which we didn‚Äôt know about which I would definitely look to stay at if we ever returned.Don‚Äôt miss this vineyard if you are in Nashik!
"‚ÄòIn wine, there's truth and In truth there is a Taste‚Äô","As once said, Wine is the most healthful and most hygienic of beverages of all. For all the Wine lovers this place is just Heaven. Located around the Western Ghats region of Nashik, Maharashtra, this place offers wide varieties of wines their production and many more things. One can spend a good weekend here as Sula offers best accommodation around the Vineyards. Having a glass of wine and enjoying the serenity of the nature is the best thing to do here. The food in Cafe is little bit expensive, but good to enjoy. One can also have a Wine tour of INR 300 per person, where you will get to know about wine making process, equipments used during fermentation and every information regarding the Wine and Vineyards. Plus after the tour, you will get a chance to taste some of the best wines available there. One should definitely visit this place once in life time if you‚Äôre a Wine lover. 5‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
The Tasting room!,"This review is particularly for the tasting room restaurant at Sula Vineyard.This was our first visit at Sula and needless to say we were utterly disappointed. There are multiple examples for what happens when customer centricity goes for a toss. Uber, Airbnb, Flipkart got famous just because they put their customers first because customer is the centre of focus. Talking about the food - the prices were equivalent to a 5 star restaurant and the quality was abhorrent. We ordered for a pizza which cost around 500 Rs and atleast thought it would be large enough for its price. ( not expecting much of the tast ). One can still let fore go the food quality and quantity but the staff behaviour was indifferent towards our needs  Water had to be taken straight from the bottle. No cutlery on the table. Staff would respond after 10 minutes of asking them for anything. In short if you plan to visit this place do not have high hopes"
Good place to relax with a glass of Wine ,Good Place to relax with a glass of wine. Good food at Rasa among all the three restaurants. Decent breakfast spreadYogesh at the front desk was a great help.
"Beyond by Sula, Beyond expectations! ","Surpassed my expectations.Excellent rooms and pool. Superb view. Pool operational late in the night which I loved. Limited breakfast menu which was the only down-point but apart from that, my family enjoyed it very much. Definitely recommended at least once."
Hicc,"My Life; My feet; My WayA must visit for a wine lover. spread over a vast area, the place is nicely organised and has a organised tours for visitors. They have a coffee shop as well as retail outlets inside the vineyard. Do not forget to enjoy the wine tasting experience."
Melting hues like these at the Sula Vineyards,"A day trip here is all one needs for a wine lover like me.Away from the hustle bustle of Mumbai/Pune, this place will not only put rest to your wine temptations but also allow you some alone time amidst the stunning expanse of vineyards.At the Sula tasting room, you can enjoy good food and music along with your glass of wine, even better if coupled with great company."
A beautiful evening by the wines,I visited Sula with my Fianc√©. We did the wine tasting tour. The tour was informative as well as interactive. The wine tasting ceremony towards the end was quite nicely designed and they gave extra information on how to choose chocolates with wine.
Begging money for everything here...,It seems tht vineyard doesnt have money and are asking for money everything... from entry to tasting to vine making tour.. Terrible place.. wasted my time.. Restaurant too expensive without that quality...
Nice place,We were very impressed with this winery.  Nice bar area.  2 nice restaurants.  One Italian and one Indian.  Both very good.  And the local wine was surprisingly good.  We really enjoyed our stay here and wished we could have stay at the winery hotel but they had nothing available the time we were there.  I would definitely recommend this place and hope to return one day.
A must see place,"Several years ago I've visited the Chivas Regal brewery in Scotland, and so that was my benchmark.I was pleasantly surprised that the experience was at par or even better in many aspects.  The experience would have been better if visited in Feb-Mar during the harvest season.The view as we enter, the upkeep of the place, the tour of the winery, the professional, well informed tour guide, the wine tasting and of course the souvenir shop .... a great experience.There are 2 restaurants on site.  Food is good, and thankfully given the location of the vineyard it's good that there is a restaurant on site.The only sour point was that my daughter who is all of 10 years of age, didn't get to taste wine.!"
Great place for amazing wine experience ,Loved the large grape plantation and the entire Sula property. Took the wine tasting tour - very informative. Got to taste some of the reserve wines. Should but the wines from their shop. They have some which are not available in open market. Lovely evening spent with family.
"Crowded, crazy touristy place but tour is good.","Its good we did Sula at the end ...get introduced to wine making and all the beauty around it in a gentler way with the smaller quieter ones earlier like york, vallone,zampa,soma etc, else the crazy touristy crowded loud onslaught of Sula may have taken us too much by shock and put us off in many ways.We almost got in their second last every-half hr tour in the nick of time, the guides know how to manage their crowds with headset/speaker phones weaving seamlessly from plant to barrel room to tasting room. In between we went to the top where the restaurant is (fantastic views) but couldnt find a table or server. But no matter we were not hungry or thirsty with two tastings behind us and  much fortified Gavran khana. We made way to their shop crowded with customers here as well, the cashiers busy like crazy. Sula's production is 90 lakh units a year, whoa nobody comes close! Their tanks massive and their barrel rooms fitted with automatic humidity sensors and mist sprinkers. Sula knew just how to grow big, pull the crowds and yet somehow keep things sane. I wonder what happens during Sula Fest?There is a cover charge of Rs 200 (redeemable against spends inside incl the tour) presumably to discourage the typical Indian freeloaders and yet the crowds still pour in. Uncles, Aunties, mothers with kids, honeymooners, college kids, working stags and yes newbies like us. Dont forget to collect your excise pass, one per bottle or you may get caught on the way back like we were cause nobody tells you the important stuff and because who better to harass and make money out of than unsuspecting tourists"
Wine & Dine,An ideal outing for wine lovers away from the hustle bustle of the city close to a dam and greenery of the long stretched vineyards is not only a treat to the eyes but the palate too. The place is green and surrounded by pleasing flora & fauna with facilities to spend a night or two to experience the early morning chills.
Actually decided not to visit at gates!,"These guys have become obnoxious. The parking is away. In the summer, they expect to park the car in some ‚Äú MangoYard‚Äù and walk to the gates. Then pay entrance fees. And again walk towards the facilities. I had been here earlier. These guys are pioneers of vineyards tours.... but now to face idiotic security, unthoughtful customer experience, I have decided to pass on.....We got better treatment at other places."
Great experience and good wine !,Beautiful place to just hangout or do a wine tour and tasting.. well maintained outdoors and restaurants.
Love the place,"We all friends decided to go here as we are wine lovers and this place is the talk of the town.  The vineyard is extremely beautiful with acres and acres of land around, a cozy restaurant overlooking the lands and a 2 hour your of the finery which also included the tasting of their fabulous wines. The tour is worth it as u end up getting a lot of knowledge on wine making. The restaurant above serves lip smacking food especially their pizzas and cheese platter are just too good. While leaving you can also purchase a few bottles from their own store where the rates are cheaper compared to anywhere else. A perfect place for evening to chill for  5- 6 hours."
Horrible experience at Tasting Room,"Went to Sula while on way back from Soma. Wrong decision. Staff were rude at Tasting Room (1st Floor). We ordered a Brut and since we could not finish it, we asked it to be closed. They did not close it properly and the wine got spilled in my car seat on way back. Shame on Sula to have such undertrained staff. Almost Rs 1250 down the drain and car seat issue on top.Not recommended at all. Overhyped.You get better wines from Jacob's Creek at same price."
For Different Wine tasting,"Good ambience, good for a day out with friends or family. Different type of wine tasting available.  Note: Over crowded in weekend , service may get poor/ difficult in getting table in peak time"
Great destination for relaxing,Enjoyed the wines at sula. Had the complimentary tour. Wine tasting session was good and informative. Vinery tour was ok. Good quality of wine.
Wovoyage over promised under delivered wine tasting,"We set off in the guide's (newly appointed) personal hasback with horrible driving skills. We skipped two vineyards out of 3 promised, rnded up at Sula whose guide tour was short of expectations and unprofessionaal. The guide sounded like a parrot hardly any interactive skills. . The wine tasting involved personal demeaning remarks from the guide if you ended up swirling a bubble wine.. i mean.. really.. no sense of love or respect."
Excellent view,"Awesome vineyard view, great wine tasting and exclusive wines. You can get to do wine tasting and a wine tour. The restaurants serve exclusive sula wines and has a vast range."
Loved the place,The entire experience was very good..loved the set up which reminded me of Europe. Sitting with a drink in a open space and having fun with your family was the best. Loved this place and would surely come back
A bit over hyped ,"Wine tour along with wine tasting should be an integral part of the visit to Sula. The entry fee of Rs 200 per person should cover that. Eating at restaurants and buying souvenir should be visitor's discretion. This Sula vineyard setup is more about business than to showcase their wines and processes and to make people aware of wine.We spent couple of hours there, had expensive food in their restaurant and came back without knowing about their wine."
Wine yard at Nashik,One must visit during Sula Fest. It's an international event where variety of wines are available. Process can also be seen through Walk through of factory and wine tasting also available.
A quiet re'treat',"A well built resort, the vineyards are well maintained and the staff are polite.  We stayed one night and took the tasting tour.  The rooms were large, clean and quiet although the resort was fully booked. The pool is small but was clean. There were bicycles to ride but the area is quite small. We enjoyed our stay."
Nice place to hang out,"Sula Vineyard is more than just touring and testing. Once you enter the place you will feel the charm of the place. The music, lightning altogether makes Sula a happening place to hang out."
Wonderful ,"Sula has always been one of the best places to visit in Nashik, situated in the outskirts of the town it has a scenic view of the vineyards. It has  got quite good quality of wine with it's zinfandel being one of it's finest but sula can work a bit more to become top notch."
"A nice vineyards, great wine, nice restaurant on top, great view","We went with friends to do the guided tour and the wine tasting.This place looks like a very popular place for tourists from India.When we were there, I think we were the only one from outside India.The place is very nice, the guided tour is very informative and the wine tasting is fun (I think we tasted 5 different wines).They also have a nice outdoor restaurant/bar upstairs. A good place to relax and check the great view over the area.The tour and the wine tasting is not very expensive.We could not come back without buying some wine.An absolutely must do in Nashik."
One time visit only,"It's too costly ,its good experience to know the vine process ,so much rush is there .food also so costly"
Excellent ,Went at the time of sunset and the atmosphere was electrifying.. The crowd.. The energy.. The music all was addictive.. And the wines.. !!! Oh wow.. I tasted three different ones one red and two white.. All were absolutely great.. A must go place when near Nashik..
Day out at Sula! ,"Sula Vineyards is located around 150km from Mumbai and can be easily drive able.Taking help of navigation will help you find the direction.As you enter the winery all your eyes can see is the Vineyards.The main area consists of a restaurant, winery, tasting cellar, wine bar, and wine outlet.The best way to go about this place is to simply sign up for a winery tour. (chargeable)The winery tour here was very informative and you will atleast end up with some knowledge on wine making and will be able to gain clarity over some common wine myths.After this you can also sign up for a wine tasting session. This is a super fun activity you can avail at the charge of 400per person. They make you taste different types of wine which is made in the winery.Also if your looking forward to chill with a bottle of wine and some grub (appetizers). Select the upper deck section. The view there is mesmerizing.Also if your not up for some appetizers kinda grub they have two restaurants in house one named little italy and another named rasa. We visited the rasa and would highly recommend the food there specifically the malai kofta and Mutton curry with Naan. Also keep your cameras ready as this place is highly instagramable. They also host Sula fest which is probably more interesting Also they have a resort incase if you wish to stay."
A place truly benefiting from the peaceful city of Nasik,"If SULA would had been in Mumbai or Pune, the feel would never had be of an europe-like vineyard. It could have become like any other pub in town. In nasik with the laid-back attitude things just fits perfectly for Sula. The tour design is good, with a generous explanation of their processes and wine tasting, The ambiance is great, and presently the front horizon from the Sula Cafe is clear for many straight line fields in the view. that too is a blessing.All in all a good unique place to experience at upto 3K INR for 2 ppl, you can immerse in a different experience within India."
Trip to Sula for wineoholics ,If you love silent music with the glass of wine to sip then you have to visit  Sula vineyards in your life once. Amazing landscapes of vineyards silent music in background and food to enjoy your wine.A must visit place in Nashik.
Lovely Vineyard !,"Say Nashik City and Sula Vineyards naturally comes to one's mind..Nashik being the wine capital of India.. Sula is the most popular brand and place among wine and vineyard lovers ! They even have 2 Wine Dinning outlets called.. Soma at Sula & Little Italy !There's a sitting deck which has a very serene view of Vineyard and Gangapur Dam Reservoir.A glass of wine and such mesmerizing view is what everyone falls for !Having it's own and different level of reputation as a brand.. visiting this place would require a filled up pocket !My Favorites : Cabernet Shiraz (Red Wine), Sauvignon Blanc (White Wine), Brut (Sparkling Wine), Late Harvest (Dessert Wine)And for the better experience of wine, ask about it's pairing with food to the person serving you.Food: 4/5Wine: 5/5Service: 4/5Location: 4/5Hygiene: 4.5/5Ambiance: 5/5"
Must visit,We were friends of four. We were there for my birthday and the resort made it very special. They helped my husband to plan everything. We had a lovely tour to the vineyards. They would six varieties of wine for tasting.
Wine Tasting,We were here for the wine tasting activity. The place was buzzing since it was a Sunday. The wine tasting takes about 45 mins and is a must if you want to understand how your wine is made and why it tastes the way it tastes. You can skip this if it is of no interest or you have done this elsewhere. Quite commendable the way these guys have built a destination out of no where. Highly recommended.
Fun time with good wine,Me and my husband visited Sula while visiting Nashik. It‚Äôs a popular place in Nashik for weekenders. They keep tours which ends up in tasting 6 fine Sula wines. They have 3 restaurants where they serve their wines with food. They have grapes crushing activity as well. Overall you can spend a day sipping wine and looking out their huge vineyard.
Sula Vineyards - Nashik,One of the largest vineyard in India. Well maintained . The place is little far from the city . Vast area . Excellent plantation . They have a wine your which closes by a tasting tour . They explained about the sourcing of grapes and how it's crushed and showed the machinery of fermentation . Showed the barrels where  it's stored  for ageing . Also explained about the bottling . We had an opportunity to taste 6 types of wine . It's a good experience . Surely a one time visit . For wine lovers you can get good bottles at low rates .
Pleasantly serene ,Had visited for a wine tasting and evening snacks at the cafe overlooking the grape plantation. Very large selection of wines and a good bit of food options to relish with them too. Do try more than just one wine and ask the waiter for the right combination of mix and match. Visit at sunset to get the best view this place can offer. Note that the tour and tasting sessions end at 630p.m but the cafe and the wine shop are open till 1030p.m Parking is not an issue and finding it is not difficult either. Must visit when in Nasik or surrounding areas.
Wining and Winning the Hearts,"Having first stayed in Deolali in late 60s, we did not have the luxury of Sula Wines Vineyards, so old friends made it a point to spend an afternoon at Sula, Wining and enjoying the landscaping of the vineyard..very relaxing with a warm and professional hospitality.. Cheers Sula Wines!"
Vineyard,There was nothing much to see at this place unless you intend to buy vine.  And that's what most people do because the entrance fee of Rs 100.00 can be used to redeem vine bottle. In addition you can taste vine for a fee as well. So unless you intend to buy vine it may not interest you. Of course their vine tastes quite good.
Beautiful Place,"This is one of the beautiful place you must visit in case you are a wine lover. They have lot of variety, good ambiance and vineyards tour followed for tasting."
Sula Fest,"I with my 10 friends visited Sula Vineyards on 2nd Feb during Sula Fest.What an environment there was.Music,wine ,food,friends.Had areal gr8 fun.Deffinatly will visit again."
Casual Visit to Sula,"Awesome tour of Vineyards and the host that we got was much into it, as he was explaining everything in granute detail. Best time to visit is around Feb as they have Sula Fest as well around that timeline which is also recommended to attend"
Beautiful,"This is a must go place if you are in Nashik. You will get good food, nice view all types of wine. We went this place by car. Easy to travel till there."
Amazing,Love to visit there again.. sula is famous for the wine and the place is so beautiful that you cant imagine without visit once
Wine tour is a must do,I was here in december and did the wine tour. It is a must try experience for anyone who has not done it earlier. Would love to be back when i am in Nasik again..
CHANCE TO SEE WINEYARDS,Visited for seeing grape yards as my parents are intrested to see them..entry ticket of hundred rupees is there and that can be redeemed if you can purchase any thing like wine there inside ..it's like a resort and having roof top restaurant..inside again you can pay amount for touring process of wine making in some seasons and tasting of wine can also be done
Sula Fest at Sula Vineyards,"Amazing experience and a must do for music and wine lovers. I was at Sula Fest 2019 and it was great. Great Wine, Good Food, Amazing Atmosphere and great vibe."

Not as per expectation ,"Hope this message is read and considered for future reference. We attended the Sula Fest 2019 on this weekend and few things that we thought should be shared with your team for betterment and for your company and for the benefit of the Attendees.So traveling the world and being part of concerts organized in other cities and countries helps you to differentiate and pick on the good and things that could be done good in a particular event. Would appreciate if below points are considered while you plan the Sula Fest 2020 or other such events:The Bands playing at the Concerts; specifically for both the days should have been updated on the social forums. Giving a person the option to select the day of attending the fest. It was a regret to be a part of the fest on Saturday when Divine and Shankar Mahadevan performing on Sunday.¬†The Bands chosen for the Fest should have been more popular and known that small town bands of various countries. Even a Local Band playing known songs would have cheered and get the crowd grooved as compared to outsiders playing unknown songs.When we entered the path for Sula we were stopped by the bouncers informing that ahead the car parks were only for VIP. We had to park the car at the ground 800 meters before the arena and take a bus for the place. However; another friend of ours was allowed to park at the arena parking itself (He was no VIP). By the end of the Fest on Saturday, the bus were not available for drops when we came out and we had to walk all the way till the car park with the localities outside passing lewd comments. More over the bouncers at the car park smiling and gawking lustfully. (Total disgust). I wonder what would have happened if any girl would have needed help from these bouncers; would they have helped and made it worst.Instead of mob of Bouncers waiting at the entry points and at other enteree checking whose carry wine from the wine shop; they could have been put for better use. There were drunk and local creepy boys taking the advantage of the crowd and touching and feeling girls making it show that it was by accident. This act is so common in our country and hence precautions and assistance for this matter should be with utmost importance.Washrooms were in the most unhygienic conditions. There were no cleaners around to take care of the most basic need of the day. Sorry to say, I understand this was the 12th¬†year of Sula Fest; shouldn‚Äôt Hygienic be on the Top 3 of your list.There were announcements on ‚ÄúDo Not Litter‚Äù; however what all steps were taken to manager littering? People were smoking and throwing cigarette buds everywhere (having ashtrays at several places could have reduced this to a lot of extend).¬†¬† Dustbins were no where to see except few at the place where food was served; but ppl carrying wine and¬† beer glasses did not know where to throw them near the stadium arena.People came from different cities, bought tickets well in advance, had to make plans on their travel, stay etc. only to take back happy memories and to make plans for another Sula Fest the next year. You could make this event much better if the basics are taken care with importance."
Pathetic overpriced poorly managed bad arrangement of washrooms,"I have heard a lot about this fest n currently at the same...there is an unbeliveable queue,im standn since 6 its 645 n im still not in the fest...after paying 3k this is not what we expect...rhe washrooms are stinking noone is cleaning it...very poorly managed and i will advise everyone to pls pls check n then cm here...u pay 3k for ticket n 3k for the tent including taxes...yuckkk"
Huge Vineyards and great place,The vineyards are huge. One can get a change to know how the varieties of vines are manufactured and what are the steps of it. The place has a restaurant for veg and non-veg varieties and its equally good. Must go
Nice,"It's a good place to go with amazing view over there, it's good to go in winter where you can enjoy the weather and have üç∑, relax and eat food roam around the big property, food is also nice would recommend to go"
A Hidden Unexpected Beauty in Nashik,"Visited here during my business travel. It was a very nice and beautiful area (especially when the sunsets) which you won‚Äôt expect comparing to the roads that led you here. The wine tasting host and tour guide do know their stuff and explained questions with great confidence. You will get to know how to properly taste a wine, how different wines get processed and also chill at the bar with in-house or imported wines and snacks."
Most enjoyable and happening place around Nashik,"This is one of the most enjoyable and happening place around Nashik. A famous and formost winery in India, established in 1998, sells the highest number of India produced wine in India. This has been maintained a viberant place with crowd young and old enjoying themselves with thier loved ones. We enjoyed with freinds and family the sip of wine and delicious pizza at the restaurant. Tasting this white wine and other six wines as part of Tour and Tasting experience, we could zero in on what I found best for my preference. We finlised one each of white, red and sparkling wine. Rates are close to what we have outside in mumbai but choices were plenty. Cover charges redeemble inside - 200 Rs per person. Tour and tasting - 450 rs per person."
A must visit if you don't know anything about wines.,It was our first visit to any vineyard. The factory tour was awesome. The wine testing session was fun. Instructor was very friendly. In nutshell we enjoyed the stay.
Overnight stay at Sula Vineyards,"Excellent staff that gave us a warm welcome and offered us a variety of welcome drinks to choose from. Although we stuck to their bubbly wine.The rooms were extremely comfortable and well equipped.Their primary restaurant attached to the main lobby served us an excellent lunch.Thereafter, upon a bit of relaxation in our rooms, we were escorted to a detailed and thorough tour of the winery and wine tasting experience.The facility is highly sustainable energy conscientious with the absence of plastics to the best possible extent - bottled water was served in glass bottles in the restaurants and in our rooms.The next morning, breakfast was served in their main restaurant which carried several edibles catering to different palates.Sula Vineyards has a variety of rooms available to suit a large spectrum of visitors for overnight stays and their respective budgets. Cycles are provided for those who wish to tour around the facility.Truly a heart-warming experience."
Over-rated (IMO only),"I have been hearing this place for almost 10 years, but could visit only last year december. We stopped here on our way back from Saputara.The walk from the parking to the wineyard is dusty, as you have to park in an open field, without any shade. Once you enter though, it is pretty cool. A lot of points for selfie enthusiasts.There are a couple of options for having food inside. We registered for the wine factory and tasting tour and then sat down at Little Italy for lunch. There was a slight trouble in finding a spot though. We wanted to sit outside, but could not due to dust from some construction activity nearby. The food did not disappoint though. The bruschetta and lasagna were very nice.The factory tour is not really a factory tour. They show you an old fermentation tank, the current tanks room and a room where wine casks are stored for aging. The accompanying guide explains the wine making process and that is it.The wine tasting was pretty decent. A collection of 5 wines, along with a detailed explanation. The quantity of wine sample is enough to give a light headed feel for half an hour at least! Do not attempt to drive off immediately after the tasting session!Wines are available for purchase at 15% discount to MRP. We bought a couple (Dindori reserve chardonnay and Reisling), from among the ones we had tasted. We did not pick up anything from the souvenir shop though...I was disappointed that they did not have a vineyard tour. I think that is reserved for those who stay on their properties only.Recommendation: A one time visit with your family. A nice way to spend an afternoon. You can skip the factory tour, but do opt for the wine tasting."
Must visit place,Sula Vineyards is the go to place for any Nasikite for a pleasajt evening. They offer a factory tour and wine tasting. The restaurant offers a wonderful view of the Gangapur dam backwaters.
Fantastic way to bring in the new year,"I arranged for my family of 14 to stay at Sula Vineyard - at the villa called Beyond by Sula. We were there for two nights - too short for the amount of fun we had. Our point of contact was Swapnil, who along with Yogesh and other team members took utmost care of us, making sure we had a memorable time. The Sula team arranged a barbeque dinner for us for New Year's Eve and even a karaoke machine. We had a blast. Food was delicious, a tad spicy for me but that was resolved quickly. The villa as well as the two Lakeview Rooms we had booked were very comfortable. The staff was efficient and very courteous. Overall, we had a wonderful experience. So nice in fact that we never made it for the wine tasting and tour that was included as part of the package. I would recommend Sula to anyone looking for a relaxing, very pampered get away."
"Avoid visiting, waste of money and time.","First of all its 14 KM away from heart of the Nasik city. After travelling outskirts, you will see grapes farms, which is a usual seen anywhere in Nashik district.Secondly they have entry fees of Rs. 100/- per person on weekdays and Rs. 200/- per person on weekdays. Non refundable. Yes its covered smartly, that you always spend more.After entry, major time you will spend in photo shoots with the decorative. Then you will go for factory tour + testing they say.All machinery are not working, and its more verbal information provide with some big containers and barrels around. Not at all worth information, cost 150/- per person.Staff is arrogant.Wine and Dine is over priced and not at all worth.They say they are leading in wine business, but I dont believe so as per the facts on wine business market in Europe.I guess, they are making more money this picnic spot business.Simply avoid visiting, there are much more places around in Nashik to spend time with Nature."
Family outing,"Its a ONE hour vinery tour with tasting, since ours was complimentary since we were staying at the Source.Very informative and the staff willing to answer all your queries.Tasting is provided for six of their reputed brands.Also sit back and enjoy at the restaurant one the first floor."
Amazing,"Great place for wine and dine. Situated at the outskirts of Nashik city, Sula Vineyards is a must visit place for all the visitors, no matter you drink or not. This place is aesthetic beauty. Entry is free."
Wine heaven,"Sula vineyards was started as the first vineyard in India, and it shows. It is currently the biggest winery in India, and holds 70% of the market share. The location of the place is beautiful, and they have frequent tasting sessions which are handled professionally. There are two restaurants where you can have lunch during your visit, or there are some costly accommodations available too. The session involving wine-making and tasting are a must."
A must visit wineyard,"Went with friends for some wine shopping and lunch at their Little Italy restaurant. Varieties of wine, food was good, tried pizzas, pasta, garlic bread with some wine. Food was a bit expensive. Overall good experience, worth visiting Sula if you are in Nashik."
Awesome place,Awesome place to visit...had never been to a vineyard before but Sula vineyard visit was just superb...my son+us(my husband and me) got to know so much about the process wine is made... different types... tastes... And S clicked a lot of pics...üëçüëè
What a fun place it is !,"A lovely place if you are looking for a fun filled half day which is good enough to spend at this place. Afternoons are best times to visit and it is best to wind up the day by a sumptuous meal at 2 of their Restaurants. Surprisingly, they offer no discount for the Wine consumed at their 2 Restaurants. Other Vineyards in the vicinity do offer discounts for consumption. The place is well spread, full of landscape and is very well decorated thereby making it very picturesque - both internally & externally. There are two places - Beyond & Space - for stay which are exorbitantly priced, more because of the demand apparently. Booking is required to be done much in advance. Visited this place two times & found it equally attractive both the times. Have now introduced an entry fee of Rs.100 per head which is weird though it gets adjusted in subsequent expenses that one makes inside the complex. They organise trips to see the wine making process - both without wine tasting & with wine tasting. Tickets again are priced exorbitantly for a trip that lasts merely 15 minutes. Other Vineyards in the vicinity do more detailed trips. Discounts offered on purchase of Wine vary from 5 - 10 % and are in slabs of purchase. In my case, though discount mentioned on Bill is 7 %, the actual discounted amount is 6 %. The much awaited and popular Sula Festival must be visited. It is held in Feb. Entry Tickets as cover charge @ Rs.2,400 per day per person (meals & stay excluded) are again exorbitantly priced. But, all said & done, it is a sought after place."
Overrated killjoy,"Avoid, skip, unless you have never been to a Vineyard. Located off the city, difficult to reach. Overpopulated with tourists, entry to the venue is charged Rs 200 person despite the website stating Rs 100. The much acclaimed tour was nowhere in site, the staff at restaurant cared two hoots and is only interested in you buying the wine, could not provide a cup of coffee. It‚Äôs a bubble waiting to burst."
Experience Vine making process and tasting vines,"Experience Vine making process and tasting vines, nothing else to do.Visited the place with family and friends,Easily located on Gmaps.Huge parking space available.Entry fee of 200/- for Adults, kids below 10 are free.The fee can be redeemed inside on Food and Entry fees towards the Vineyard Tour.The Vineyard Tour charges are 150/- and Vineyard tour with Vine tasting is 400/-The place is very average,the location is good and few tourist spots around the property.The restaurants charges are too high."
A good place but not value for money,The tour and tasting cost Rs. 400 per adult (kids free).  The tour without tasting cost Rs.150. The tour lasts for approx 20 minutes. Samples of six wines are served for tasting.  The cover charge is Rs. 200 per adult which can be adjusted against tour or wine purchase.
Wine and everything related to it ,"This is one of places worth visiting in Nashik. +++wine+food+staff+price- - location ( to reach )++ location ( to spend time, it is near a lake)One thing which Sula Mgt should pay attention to is transport situation. If you are using your own vehicle or have hired one for to and fro, you are ok. However if you have not hired auto/car/taxi for return then you will see really bad situation where auto guys make group and don‚Äôt let other take you without agreeing to pay a certain amount. One way it could be curbed by regular ( may be each two hours) a shuttle to drop off and pickup from main city."
Proud of Indian Vineyards,"This was my first visit to an Indian Vineyard. Having seen several vineyards and distilleries across the Globe, I found SULA Vineyard no less than any other International Vineyard. In fact Sula had latest equipment, much larger vineyards and highly professional Guides who conducted the Tour. The Guide spoke immaculate English with perfect confidence. The Tour was very well conducted. The Place had a majestic look. Both their Restaurants are great - though overpriced. Loved their Curio Shop and Wine Store where we picked up all the Wines that we liked during Wine testing."
Fun @ sula ,Super place..even better @ sundown...fun for all ages ..be it teenagers or the not so old..u can easily spend 4 to 5 hrs here..with the beautiful weather & good options for nibbling...total time pass in style ü•Çüç∑
Differnt experince..,We had visited the Sula vineyards on our trip to Nasik..It is differnt experience all together ..They have a tour of the factory along with wine tasting..you can chose tasting or you can just go and see the factory..they charge 150 INR  just for seeing and 400 INR for a tasting tour of 6 of their famous wines..Must visit if you are in Nasik as you didn't get this experience any where else in India ..This is located approximately 20 kms away from city and you would need a vehicle to go there...they have attached restuarants as well..
Very nice,"We, four adults and a kid, 9 years,  visited in the month of December 2018.It's a good place to visit. Though there were no grapes and stomping was also not there, it's scenic beautiful. Regular entry ticket is Rs.  100 but from 21 st December it was Rs. 200. This entry amount can be redeemed against any purchase ( tour ticket, shopping or food) .We took the tour of wine making ... it was around for 15 -20 minutes."
"Tasting Room - Good food, bad service","We visited Sula Vineyard after a gap for few years. The crowd of visitors have increased, it does not have the laid back feel and more of a tourist hot spot.Anyway, this review is for the food and service at the first floor restaurant Tasting Room.First the good points, the food is fresh and well made. The Nachos seems to be the crowd favorite and it does not disappoint. The salad was fresh and well made. The Spicy Chicken Pizza was good and balanced without overpowering heat. The grilled fish again was fresh and well prepared, the lack of herbs was the only letdown.Now the service, or lets say lack of it. Do not expect any greeting from the staff or assistance from them for seating or menu. We just sat down and grabbed menu ourselves after waiting long enough. Had flag down a staff and ordered. When food came, the cutlery and extra plates were not provided until we hollered one. Most of the staff was busy staring on their mobile phones. While we were there, the Christmas gift for the staff arrived and that took the attention further from the guests.Sula has done a wonder for Indian wine scene and have many firsts to their name. However, off late it seems the focus has gone off the guest service. For me, I can suffer through the hoards of selfie takers over my shoulder while I enjoy the good wine and food. But not so sure that I want suffer the indifference of the staff for next time. The rating given is for the food only."
Lovely weekend break !!,"Great weekend getaway from Mumbai. We stayed at The Source for 2 nights. Lovely, well maintained rooms and property . They have tried to give it a feel of the vineyards of Tuscany. Courteous and attentive staff always willing to help. There are 2 restaurants for your meals . We particularly liked the Italian restaurant Little Italy. The staff were well informed about the wines that pair well with different food.The wine tour was informative with a wine tasting session at the end. I thought the tour was a little rushed but I would still recommend it for someone who in interested in the wine making process. I would definitely recommend The Source at Sula Vineyards to anyone looking for a relaxed weekend break."
"Rushed visit, well organised site","Busy place, nice setting. The tour and the tasting were a bit rushed. Lovely landscape. Not necessarily fun for the little ones (but not a problem to take them on the tour)"
"Exciting place to visit, lot of points for photography & selfie","One of the memorable visit to Sula Vineyards Nasik. Though it is very crowded on weekends and holidays but the guided tours are very well managed. The best part of guided tour was wine tasting which introduces you to different types of wines, how to hold glass and how to taste it. Brut Tropical- the sparkling wine, a sort of champagne (though cannot be called as champagne because it's not made in champagne region of France) was good followed by Dindori. Chenin Blanc was a white wine very sweet in taste, mild but not for diabetics. Recently introduced RaSa Zinfandel was a good variety of red wine.Restaurant Little Italy served authentic pizzas with variety of wines. It's really amazing place to visit."
Excellent visit.,"Has a great selection of wines. Tour was well organised. Didn't learn much, but have been to  a few before."
Beyond by Sula,There is nothing special about the place to stay except the hype created by advertisement. Exorbitant price for the stay includes stay with breakfast worth 1/3 of the normal charges. Any other item is payable at exorbitant rates.Inconvenience to reach the site is enormous. If you compare value for money then not worth it.
An experience worth doing once,"Sula Vineyards is home to the birthplace of Indian wine, and it is definitely a must-go place for any wine connoisseur. It is great to see how India has developed its own name in the world of wines starting from this place. The wine tour is good, but it is best to go here during the grape season so that you can actually see the whole process of grape plucking and then obviously the winemaking. I didn't know that A Champagne is basically just a Sparkling Wine coming from Champagne region of France. Stay at BEYOND BY SULA resort instead of Sula Vineyards."
A memorable place.,"A beautiful vineyard , Dose make you feel out of India. Helpful Staff, Superb Wines excellent presentation of wine making and tasting. Good tie-ups with  restaurants.Overall a wonderful experience."
Amazing experience,"Everything about the place is perfect, from the hotel rooms (very spacious n beautifully designed) to the food to the hospitality. Definitely going back with family."
Must visit if you have not visiting a vineyard,"Was much crowded on weekends, the instructor was very friendly and took us through the entire wine making process.There is a also a 6 wine tasting session conducted by them at Rs. 400 per person. Must go if you want to know and understand different types of wine.The vineyard was large and beautiful with baby grapes hanging around. Wine making process was under renovation when we visited in Dec 2018. Also note there is grapes stamping that happens from Jan to March every year"
Visit to sula !,"Sula vineyards is located in nashik. Well as the name goes, its a boon for all the wine lovers out there. Went there in the evening with friends. Nice weather, slightly breezy. Good food too. There is sula fest which happens in february. (Looking forward for that)"
Sipping at Sula,"This property is absolutely gorgeous. I‚Äôve wine tasted quite a bit and this place was one of the nicest wineries I‚Äôve been to. The tasting itself was pretty dull. The wine was enjoyable enough, but the staff doing the tasting wasn‚Äôt engaging at all.  I was also supposed to do a tour but opted not to because I was told to wait and apparently the tour started while I was waiting. Overall, I do recommend this winery for a sip and see."
Sula visit with friends,Tasting room @ SulaAwesome atmosphereGood musicFriendly and polite staffAnd specially thanks to SHADAB He suggested me red wine which is  really very nice.
Sula vineyards,It was superb. We had an amazing experience. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Nice place and good food. We just loved it üòä
Client Visit,"Excellent customer service by Tapesh Zawar, delicious food, outstanding wine, very classy ambience, a great place to get your clients."
Very Pleasant site and very honest people,The site is excellent. People are not only friendly friendly but very honest. I forget to take my credit card in the liquor shop. They kept it safely with them and acted as per my advice. Sincere appreciation to Mr Sameer Kazi and Mr Prashant Bhalerao.
Sula Vineyards,"Visited the property in Nov 2018. The property is huge and consists of vineyards, a wine making area, a wine tasting area, a parking lot, 2 restaurants (Little Italy & Rasa) and a resort (The Source at Sula) for guests looking for a longer stay.The grape harvest season begins in January and ends in March. For this reason, the wine making tour was a verbal one and did not actually showcase the processes involved in making wine. Although, the process manager guiding the tour was knowledgeable and made the session interactive and informative.A point to note - Their wines are cheaper at the property than they are elsewhere."
Amazing Experience - WORTH IT ,Fantastic experience Great ambiance GOOD WORLD CLASS WINESThe wine tasting and tour are two different events. One has to buy passes for each. Also there is a Rs 100 cover charge that is deducted at the restaurant or at visitors center. The host Mr. INDER SINGH RENU was fantastic knowledgeable chap with excellent communication skills. He conducted an excellent interactive educative  tour answering questions and explaining the process of wine making from the scratch. Amazing how Mr Rajeev Samant created this world standard wine which I have relished back in the US. Wine tasting is awesome experience. The restaurant has the complete matrix of the production. Not too impressed with the food. Getting to the Vineyards it better to have a dedicated vehicle. It can be difficult to get a OLA or cab to get back. So plan accordingly.
winery tour,Last Sunday I visited this place. Nice place to visit. However they are charging Rs. 150/- for winery tour which is of no use as there is no season of grapes and hence noi functioning of operation. However else is good.
good to visit,I knew only Sula vineyard in India so went there. It didn't meet my expectation but worth a visit. Nashik is beautiful and the tour is a different experience.
Visit ,Beautiful ambience good experience sula vine nashik must visited place . recommend to all of my friends.
"Vineyards, wine, wine tasting, food & youngsters hanging out ","Vineyards, wine, wine tasting, food & youngsters hanging out for Rs 400 (you've to pay extra for food though)Like any other vineyard, it's air has that fermentation smell that can make some giddy and others happy...Wine tasting, we paid for, was not like how it's done in France & California but its a good start for Indians who haven't really acquired & accepted the wine yet."
Fantastic view from the Restaurant,The evening view from the Sula restaurant is mesmerising! The tour is quite informative but may be a one time affair..if you are not keen on know how wines are made then the restaurant is the place to go
Short tours with authoritative security staff and management (Anikhet),"The tasting was the only redeeming factor in this visit. The tasting guide did  a good job though there is really nothing much to see. A quick walk through the fermenting area was about it. The part we detested was the level of security posted all around the complex. It starts with a stern demand for a parking fee as you drive in. Then there is a guy near the main complex who demands you do not take any photos. He has no idea why and states that it is management policy. There is nothing confidential or secretive in the vicinity that is to be strictly protected. Having time before the tour, we decided to pop in to the hotel next door to explore room options and were accosted by another guard asking why and where we were going. After some convincing we entered the reception area to face another stern and unfriendly ""Can I help you?"" from a person (Anikhet) walking by. When we asked to speak to someone in charge, he said ""He was"". That shattered our opinion of Sula. We are respectable well traveled seniors, educated, non-confrontational, and law-abiding, and have visited similar establishments in other international wine producing regions. Yet, we have never felt so unwanted as here, in Sula. We explained this to Anikhet and gave him our opinion of his establishment and customer dis-service, but he really had nothing to say.The total lack of respect for visitors, the feeling of un-wantedness, and hostility we felt, totally turned us off. It appears that all visitors are looked at with suspicion as we found other guests being treated the same way. Perhaps, Sula being the leading wine producer in India, feels they warrant that and demand that level of servitude from visitors --who are not only pay for the wine tour, but also pay to park.The tasting tour was conducted very well and that was the only saving grace. Incidentally, during the tour, we could take photographs. How weird is that? We left as soon as the tour ended, giving up our plans to have lunch and buy a few bottles of wine. We had had enough and just wanted to get the heck out of there.The poor treatment will never have us return."
Outing with family,Sula vineyards have added more Magnificence to the location than a few years back. It is a beautiful picnic spot to travel to with family or friends. It affords a beautiful view of the river and Gangapur Dam. Plan to reach there by 5:30 PM . Loiter around take lots of pics ...with wine bottles and other artefacts. Then climb up to the restaurant to view the sunset .. Then get a tour of the wine making process... Opt for wine tasting.. it's a great experience. Once the tour and wine tasting is done ... Settle down at the restaurant and have wine n snacks with the cool breeze on your face .... Enjoy the splendour of the evening at Sula.. It's a fantastic spot to enjoy... Take a tour üòÅü•Ç
Commercialized operation. Mass market,"Went on the weekend and the place was too crowded. Had to wait for couple of hours for our turn of wine tasting. The tour was good and so were the wines.Had expected lower rates than the market, but they were selling the bottles at MRP. Although they have a very good viewing deck, but with 1000s of people already in the property its difficult to find a spot."
Nice place to visit,We could feel good vibes as soon as we entered on seeing those vineyards. The tour instructor provides detailed description of wine production process. You can buy the one you like after tasting.
Good ambience ,A trip to Nashik is incomplete without a visit to Sula as is the common say.This is how well Sula have been able to market their brand. The ambience of the place is really good. They have two restaurants - Little Italy ( Veg) and Rasa ( serves non veg as well).Food is good. Overall a great place for friends and family.In case you are interested in sitting on the terrace overlooking the vineyard come around  4.30-5 pm .
Compulsorily visit !!!,"I think it‚Äôs not quite easy to learn about the art of wine making and wine tasting and thus when I was Nashik and got to know about the Sula vineyard I did not pass it. Their operations starts at 1130 am and closes for entry of visitor at 0530 PM. Thus make your plan accordingly. While you can go around on your own and try and learn the entire process which goes through but I strongly recommend a personalised tour. They current charge is Rs 750/- per person and it last approximately 1 hour along with 6/7 different type of wine tasting. It‚Äôs 6 during harvest season where they show you how the grapes are segregated, poured etc. the harvest season is normally Jan & Feb. in other season since there are no grapes they straightaway takes you to the cylinders where the wine is being fermented by adding yeasts. Thus, you get one more additional wine to taste. Now you decide what suits you best. While I would not describe the details of the entire tour as it‚Äôs best heard from an expert. Our guide was Pritish and he was darling. The more we showed inquisitiveness to learn the more he contributed. Just a note of caution please avoid drinking the entire wine poured in the glass as it might make you tipsy. In case you do not drink you have a lot of place t take pictures to flaunt and restaurants for gastronomical delight. Surely do not miss it if you are at Nashik."
Must See Even If You Do Not Drink,What a beautiful and peaceful place to go relax with friends from the city.  They have wine tasting and a couple restaurants on the grounds.  They will let you walk around and look at the grounds.  Very well kept place.  They have music playing up on the balcony which is nice.
Well organized Vine Tour,Was here with a large group on a weekend. Being a weekend there was lot of rush and chaos. The place however is well organised and clean. The vineyards are nice. Would recommend the vine tasting tour which happens every hour. Staff members explain and show the vine making process followed by the tasting session where etiquettes are explained as well. Morning and afternoon time is extremely hot and sunny. Carry your water bottles. Parking is available.Had lunch at Little Italy (Veg Only) there. Food was ok. Service was ok.Washrooms are clean and accessible.The access road to the vineyards is narrow but manageable. Would recommend a visit here for sure when in Nashik.
Lovely vineyards,"Sula Vineyards can be termed the pioneers in developing not just the Wine culture in the country but also promoting Winery visit as a tourism place.Loved the Vine tour and the wine tasting sessions here. They have developed additional restaurants, lodging accommodation as well as beautified the place to attract tourists.Great holiday option for a weekend"
Sula vineyards,"Pioneer in wines making, A tour of Sula vineyards is an eye opener for wine lover's. All nitty gritty of wine making,  storage and difference between white and red wine will be clear once the tour is taken. Outlet available for purchase including grape seed oil."
"Thanks to Sula, Nashik has an attraction to visit","Excellent place to spend some time in Nashik. It is a pleasant place, but not the way I had envisaged it to be."
Anniversary celebration,"Staying in ‚ÄòThe Source‚Äô was comfortable and good. You get your privacy and the staff is courteous and helpful. But as regard to the restaurant, the in house for only the guests  is stupidly priced and if you step out to Sula bar and lounge there the local traffic is too much. So much so that it looses the fun of staying in a boutique hotel.I personally would like Sula management to look into the matter of dividing the outdoor entrants to a limit or to make something extra for them. Half of the fun gets lost because of the noise and it gives a feel that you are walking in a crowded street of Crawford market or Linking Road.Food quality is good and you get all the wines to taste and drink.Overall a good experience."
Leisure Trip,It was our leisure trip with friends only.We've visited Sula vineyards and the restaurant - Solail.The place was so amazing. They have landscape gardens of Grapes all around the vineyard. They also have Wine processing unit visit session with mock tour to processing unit. The restaurant - Solail served some amazingly delicious delicacies here.It was a worth to visit & must to visit place in Nashik.
Family get together @ Sula Wines,"Overall amazing experience with 6 different types of wines for taste with proper guidance & explanation, Ambience Greenery Music is the best part of Sula.Definately  recommended place to Visit in Nashik.Sula nahi dekha to Nasik me kya Dekha. Number One..."
a beautful place,"My family and I stayed at The Source at Sula and so spent a bit of time at the Vineyards too, what a beautiful place! very relaxing and scenic but also fun. I really enjoyed the vineyard tour and wine tasting, the tour leader was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. The whole tour was fun and interesting and it was great to get to sample the different wines and learn to appreciate them differently.All of the staff I met were friendly and helpful, the food in the bar was nice and the balcony is a really nice place to sit and enjoy good food and scenic views.a really lovely place, thanks for a lovely stay Sula!"
Nice Pace to visit with family and friends,Nice place with loads of open space. Can go there and spend good time with family and friends. Little Italy - good restaurant to have pizzas and pastas.. and ofcourse wine from SULA.. didn't stay there.. just drove to Sula had lunch  & üç∑ then back same day.. will explore staying there next time... Just avoid going there on long chutti or extended weekends.
Must visit ,"They say it‚Äôs overhyped and overcrowded. It is true though but you must visit it for the very informative tour and beautiful vineyards. The tasting included 6 wines- sparkling brut, two whites and three reds. The wine shop as well as the entire place is hustling bustling with people and KIDS! Their first tour starts at 11. Please try to take the first one as we had much lesser people in that tour."
Sula review,"Been to Sula Vineyard. It is over rated, just for guided tour which is nothing but showing the wine equipment they are charging Rs. 150 each which is of just 15 mts  and they call a guided tour.A small quantity of onion bhaaia is Rs. 256/.This place needs to be avoided. A small packet of chocolate Rs. 180. Hope they review."
Good wines and great place with family,Visiting during week days would be less stressful as weekends can get crowded.  The vineyard tour and tasting is good.  Food at Sula is expensive but again it is good.  Staff is courteous and if you are accompanied with senior citizens there are wheelchairs available at the venue.  A good day tour and visit preferably around 4 pm as it would not be too hot and you can get the day view along with the sunset.
Great Scenic View,"I went to Sula Vineyards. The Sula Vineyards is a famous winery that is located in Nashik, 180 kilometres to the northeast of Mumbai and is renowned for its varieties of grape wines, such as Chenin Blanc, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling and Zinfandel. It is great place to go."
Spend a good weekend amidst lush green carpet and the taste of best in class wine and dine,Good for a one or two day stay to chill out. Panoramic surrounding with nice rooms to stay. The trip to the factory with the depiction of the brewing process is fascinating. Guides will inform you about the different types of wines and the details of various vineyards used for the preparation.
Nice vineyard,Sula Vineyard is a nice conserved and maintained Vineyard that is certainly a visit worth.  Best to enjoy with a group of friends.  What is very nice that is possible to have a tour with a guide together with a wine tasting afterwards.  Food is also very nice and not to forget the friendly staff.
Enjoyed sula vineyard,"- great experience, time we spend at sula is unforgettable ,Staff were very courteous and helpful specially Pankaj and Snadeep.."
Fab vibe!,Absolutely love this place; fantastic place to chill with friends.... great service by Vaibhav and Harshit
"Apathetic, low quality, overrated!","First off the winery ""tour"" is nothing much at all, just a peek into a room with barrels of wine..However, we had lunch at a cafe on the first floor which was really sad!While the view is nice indeed, we first sat at a table on one side and were asked to move to another (flaky cheap coloured table at the other end of the restaurant) though there was no sign saying ""reserved"" or anything..The meal was unacceptably poor.. the salad was very uninspiring and insipid.. the sandwich (choice of ONE) was just average.. ""Fresh Fruit Juice"" on the menu was - SORRY served only on weekends..TOOK AGES TO SERVE this paltry meal.. the capuccino was barely acceptable (AND NOT HOT!)Avoid this place - success has gone to their head, hope there is competition soon..."
Vaibhav the best,"Best service ever by him. He made sure we enjoyed the evening.best service best person at sula,good at advising for wine tastes a genuine guy over all"
Visit to Sula,"It was great time we spend at sula, Nice Ambience, Nice View,Vineyard.Well maintained and Specially staff was very helpful and attentive special thanks to  pankaj for best service."
Best place to hangout with friends and family.,Awesome ambiance and very good service. Thanks to Deepak and Sandeep for their professionalism and attention towards customers. :)
Experience the wine,The place is really well maintained. We didn't take the vineyard tour however view from restaurant was beautiful. Sula is completely inline with international standards. If you like Wine this is the place for you.
Amazingly good atmosphere,Amazingly good atmosphere..visit with you family and friends and enjoy tasting huge range of wines in the midst of amazing music and lush greenery of grape yards
Rejuvenate yourself,"One of the precious jewels of the crown of Nasik city,  Sula Vineyards provides an exotic place for family and friends to sit back and enjoy the wine and natural beauty surrounded by it."
Good quality for India,We where positively surprised about the wines and the ambient here and come back to the sula festival. Only the Riesling we habe to talk about üòÄ
Great experience for better insight about Wine Drinking and Wine Making,"Recently visited Sula Vineyards, place is beautifully designed and hospitality of staff at Sula is impeccable. We took Tasting session with Gaurav who explained us about entire process of wine making, and different wine drinking practices, His passion for wines is justified by his explanation. I was quite enlightened by the detailed explanation given to every aspect of wine making and wine drinking, at the end of session my view towards wines completely changed. Definitely looking forward to visit Sula Fest."
Nice initiative but standard needs to improve,"Was there for a weekend with my kids. It‚Äôs just a three hour drive from Mumbai. The entry to the vineyard is welcoming. Once in, there are multiple signage which guide you through the property. They have a in house shop with memorabilia. We were looking forward to the wine process guided tour. This was a very nice programme and we liked it. However this seemed more to be with making the owners famous than sharing the process at the initial stage. However once the tour started it was worth the wait. They have a nice wine shop to buy the products at special prices. The bottles are really catchy. They also have two restaurants and we tried out the Italian joint. Food was awesome and one should not miss this joint. They also have a hotel to stay within the property. Am sure to go back soon someday.I would highly recommend this trip. However there are opportunities to make this a world class project and I really hope they make it someday."
Superb experience ,"We visited the Sula Vineyard last week and we had a good experience. The short complimentary tour of the factory ending with tasting 6 different varieties was fun & we got a good idea about the intricacies of white, red & rose wine etc."
Visit in sula,Nice place to hangout with chilled bottles of wine. Good ambience and best service by Harshal. Would love to visit again.
New experience!,"Unexpectedly got a chance to visit this place, has got a entry fee which is refundable on spending. 100 rs per head.Nice atmosphere though was dark when reached.Has got wine tasting and souvenir shop also a wine selling outlet.Two restaurants in the premises which serves Italian and Indian cuisine.Must visit- heard they have rooms as well"
Nice place !!!  Needs to be visited if ur in Nashik ,"It‚Äôs a good place totally different from the usual run of the mill malls and namby pamby restaurants. Gives u a vine yard feel totally. Entry is Rs 100 per person to stop weird people from coming in. Wine üç∑ tour is Rs 400 per person they make u taste about 5 wines . Tell u  how wine is made and to be tasted . Interesting and educational also elders and kids. Has 3 restaurants. For sNacks , Italian &  Indian . Food is good slightly expensive and over rated by giving fancy names. Has a wine shop and gift shop also . Minimum time required is half a day if u want to Njoi leisurely. Must go if ur in Nashik ."
excellent getaway,"Had stayed in  vineyard view room...its lovely. Restaurants are good. the hospitality of staff was excellent.  Good ambience, great staff, lovely picturesque view,and above all very safe for ladies,children and family .One thing I would like to add is if a Pick up and drop facility is added then the hassle of reaching the resort for outsiders would not be there.We three ladies had booked an OLA from Nasik Rd station but the driver on hearing Sula resort cancelled the trip and we had a harrowing time finding another vehicle to reach the resort.As the bookings are done in advance the Sula management definitely knows the arrival of the guests and may offer the pick up  and drop facilityBarring this the trip was beyond imagination!!!!"
Great Experience,A very well developed place offering one of the finest Wines of India. As it is located near a hill the entire place along with the vineyards look very picturesque. Wine tasting is a good experience to know much about the types of wines. It also hosts a couple of restaurants and a gift shop where Merchandise of Sula are available.Overall a very great experience.
Most famous vineyard in Maharashtra,"Nashik is famous as the pilgrim city among Hindu devotees and as well as famous in  the vine lovers for it's beautiful vineyards.  Spread in acres of land Sula vineyard gives amazing experience as picnic spot . It is the most famous. SulaFest is an annual two-day 'gourmet world music festival' held at Sula Vineyards every year to attract tourists accross all over the world.Tours and tastings are conducted seven days a week throughout the year. Little Italy and Soma are the two restaurants here. The vineyards also house a resort to live in, a winery, and a tasting room in which people can taste different samples and varieties of wines that are produced at the winery. Amazing experience for us..."
Loved the place!!,"Keeping in short and crisp....loved the place...enjoyed every bit of my stay here...right from room, vineyards view, hospitality services...just everything. Serene, relaxing, funfilled, adventurous....Had opted for vineyard view room...its amazing.Restaurants are amazing.Cycling was fun.Wine tour and tasting was amazing.Could not visit the pool and spa...look forward to visit it again but this time at Beyond!!"
Making Business easy ,Sula allows visitors to visit their vineyards. In this way they are making publicity to their brands of wine. They have selected few placed to showcase their processing of wines. You can purchase wines also.
Excellent,"amazing service tapesh was extraordibary amazing service feel like home, loved the environment extra ordinary"
One of the finest place in Nashik,"- I was on 5 day tour which comprises of Nashik, Trimbakeshwar, Panchvati and Shirdi.- Sula vineyard is a perfect getaway if you are nearby Nashik, Trimbakeshwar or Shirdi.- Main reason to be in Nashik was Sula vineyards.- This place is really unique and a different experience.- You have to take a turn from the main highway and drive around 10 km inside.- Once you will reach here at this place you will get a feeling of luxury.This is one of the finest places to visit in nashik.- They have a nice entrance with a good parking space.- They organize a wine tasting tour as well which happens on different slots of the day.- They have two restaurants and I visited the one which is located on terrace.- After reaching on terrace you can see a huge open area which consists of beautiful grape farming, trees, mountains and a lake.- Very close to nature.- This is a nice restaurant to grab the meals, they have lots of options to eat and off course don't forget to taste there homemade Wines.- We ordered Iced Tea, Coffee, Sandwich , Pizza and Onion Pakoda.- They have maintained this place very well.- I will highly recommend this place to everyone.- They also have villa to stay which is a perfect option to enjoy the nature and piece.- They also organize SULA Fest every year in which you can enjoy this place at the fullest by enjoying food, music, shopping and a warm stay.Definetly will return here again.Address: Gat 36/2, Govardhan village, Off Gangapur-Savargaon road, | Off Gangapur-Savargaon Road, Nashik 422222, India"
Visit to sula,"Review:-It was great time we spend at sula,Staff were very courteous and helpful especially Sandeep and Deepak‚Äôs was excellent.We will visit againThankyou for the service"
Visit at Sula Wine,"My Self Suraj, I'm basically from Pune,It was great time we spend at Sula Wine,Staff were very courteous and helpful specially Pankaj and Deepak‚Äôs was excellent.Climate at Sula is awesome... We will visit again."
Visit to The Sula wines....,"It was really nice experience while visiting Sula Wines. The atmosphere and surrounding is too beautiful. The greenery around winery looks stunning.I just want to say that, in addition to a nice wine and food, we had a delightful waitress, jay Arote. He had just the right balance of friendliness and efficiency. He recognized that we wanted time to visit and did not rush us. He and other staff members made certain that we had everything we needed. I will recommend everyone should visit at least once to Sula vines. Kudos!"
An experience not be missed!!,It's a paradise for wine lovers. Vineyard tour is a must have experience. You get to know how your favorite wines are made followed by a wine tasting session. The fee for the tour is rupees 400 per person which is a little high for the experience offered I believe.
Sula wine review,"Sula Dindori very beautiful bottle, Smell: rich, fruity, sweet, intensive.Taste: very fruity, interesting aftertaste.Pankaj Gothe from Sula üç∑ made our experience to another level thank you Sula"
"Good view, good¬†location, tasty¬†food¬†, good¬†service, world famous¬†wine¬†and tours""","No doubt it is One of the finest wines that India has to offer. The place itself is nothing less. It has two stay options, source, which is the stay at the vineyard and the second one being Beyond, which offers the backwater view. It also houses a couple of restaurants, one being Little Italy and another being it's Sula Restaurant with a couple of bar counters too spread across the property. A beautiful experience it offers is the wine tasting, and also has to offer a special Blush wine named source, which is only available at the vineyard only. It also has a wine shop as well a gift shop where you can buy the Sula merchandise. All in all, a wonderful experience."
Very bad experience,Sulla Vineyard receives an entry fee of 100 rupees. while paying bill they refund the kupan money. But no one inform us about that. We go there for three days. At the last day we ask for the refund but they don't give us a refund. And we lost 400 Rs.
Abc,It was an amazing experience.. Vaibhav was a really good host!!Loved it!!Tooo good!!Truely aaaawesome
At sula vineyards,Tapesh and harshal gave us a very good service and we will love to visit more... Thankssss loved everything here

Tasting Room at SULA,"It was an great experience at SULA Vineyards, the cool environment,grape field & Wine with delicious food. The service provided the hotel staff was also an wonderful experience the knowledge shared about wine and how to drink the wine was also great. Special thanks to Shadab."
In a love of Wine,"Today, l was visit to Sula vineyards. Its one of the best place to visit to Nashik. So beautiful view in vineyards and specially thanks for Mr.Sandip for taking awesome care of us. He is very helpful and service was excellent. Good place to visit again and hopefully will have it again.Thank u"
Awesome Location for couples,I visited with my wife last week. She was very happy by the location and üç∑ wine taste. Deepak Ramdal has given best service to us and made our day special. Thanks deepak. Will visit again. Service appreciated.
The best!,"Well we just visited there for wine tasting and lunch. The ambience is very tastefully done whether it's the wine tasting room or the cafe or the wine shop. The interiors look chic. We visited Little Italy for lunch. The food was amazing. We had the customized pink sauce spaghetti, exclusive wine, mushroom starter, pizza and brownie. We were greeted at the entrance, Everything tasted delicious,  the ambience and the service was up to the mark. Definitely going back again! Keep it up."
Not my friends but mine first visit,The staff Mr. Tapesh was so cooperative very friendly atmosphere not felt that I‚Äôm coming from visitor. THE BEST WELCOME.
A wonderful experience,A wonderful experience for at Sula with a wonderful collection of wines and yummy snacks thanks to Mr Tapesh. Will get back soon - the atmosphere is intoxicating.
One of the most informative wine tasting session,"Right from info on holding a wine glass to the intricacies of wine processing were discussed in this amazing session. Thanks Gaurav. You were an incredible host for the evening. thoroughly, enjoyed the tour with you. Cheers.Nehul, sumit and Aaryahi New Delhi"
A great place to unwind yourself with wine...cheese and pinnaple :),had been there in the month of December.....cool weather and excellent place to stay (had stayed @ sula beyond)  the restaurant in the vineyard did not have veggie friendly food....hence we ate outside but overall worth visiting place for a short weekend
Best weekend eve spot,"Surrounded by grapeyaryds, you feel the touch of Farmhouse Do taste a bottle of your favourite world famous wine.Best aroma for all the nature plus wine lovers"
Great personalised wine tasting experience ,"We took the personalised wine tour (2 people accompanied by a guide, vs. the more common standard tour with ~30 people accompanied by one guide)It was money well spent!We had a great time with Pritish - who explained the wine making process in great detail, gave us several ‚ÄòIndian‚Äô examples to help us understand better and patiently answered all our questions. We left with much greater appreciation for Indian wines and some new favourites!"
Enchanting!!!!,"We reached at 6.45 pm. The sun was setting and they had just switched on the lights around the landscape and it seemed we were transported to Tuscany! The place looked enchanting!! I knew I missed the last tour of the day which as at 6.30 pm. However, on learning that I missed the tour as my son fell ill on the way they set up a special tour just for us three.¬†The tour guide (Pritesh Kajale) provided us a wonderful tour of the factory ‚Äì the crushing place, the distilling section and the barreling room. Kajale was extremely patient and answered to all our queries in detail. His in-depth knowledge stemmed from the fact that he was passionate about wines.¬†The lounge too seemed a happening place. Kids are allowed. Sula is just 30 minutes from the highway.Entry to Sula costs rs 100/adult. Kids free For only tour (wine tasting not included) they charged for 50/adult. No parking charge!"
Sula vineyards,Awesome experience.Great service and guidance by soumvik ghost. Good professional skills and knowledge he is having.
A memorable session about Grapes n Wines.,"A great place to visit and learn about wines. A carefully crafted tour by the management and a small restaurant to go with.However plan only when it is time of Grape plantations to see the greenery around. Else, it may not look at its serene best"
Amazing Sula Vineyards Nasik !!!,"We reached there by 3.15pm in evening and really was hungry. SULA have 2 good restaurants where we just relished the yummy dishes.Choclate bomb desert is a must to have it .later we were late for 4.30pm tour as its start 5 mins before time so we took the next tour at 5.30pm .Its Rs.400 with 6 top Sula wines to taste orelse Rs.150 just for the tour.The session during Jan to March one can actually see the whole process from the grapes crushed to the whole process. Off season one can see the barrels, the containers and a tour manager who gives a detail info of the whole place and process involved.Sula first 4 letters the name derived from the enterpreuner's mother SULAbha.The best place for amazing photos specially for selfie lovers like me...And one more thing professional cameras are not allowed in.I took the new Red Sparkling wine and a sweet desert wine.Few bottles of grapeseed oil to make my handcrafted soaps with it.The oil is also best for cooking and frying...The place is well maintained with solar panels and rainwater harvesting each and every thing is recycled..and is utmost used to the level best.Felt really wonderful and amazing clicking so beautiful selfies at such a beautiful placeüíñüíÉ"

Excellent ,Best place in nashik to chillWine and starters at the sula deck are excellent... Little Italy restaurant has authentic italian food. The indian restaurant has the best and most tasty kebabs and indian food... Little far from city and make sure u have ur own transport as there is no way to get bck otherwise...
Nice winery/resort in Nashik ,We arrived quite late at the winery and couldn‚Äôt see the vineyards or tour the winery itself. We were able to take a lot of pictures and buy wine. The restaurant offers a scenic overview of the vineyards and was packed. They also have a wine-tasting room.
Getaway well worth..,"A trip to Nasik is incomplete if you don't visit this place. Had a long pending wish to visit the place and well, it was worth it.The sprawling vineyards, the lounge, the ambience, the music..The overall feel of the place will definitely set your moods right. Hospitality is amazing, courteous gestures and smiling faces all around..There is a nice gift shop there where you can buy souvenirs and the staff there is amazing too...Komal helped us a lot with a big smile all the while. Her beautiful gesture made the made for us. Nice place to click some pictures and unwind..A getaway well worth..."
An evening of winery ,"We were driving through Nashik and we actually didn‚Äôt have the time for a full tour of the wine making process so we just stopped by at their lounge and generally toured their premises.. gorgeous property with unending vineyards, a lovely ambience, and many varieties of good wine and lots of cheese and classy conversations. Only we had a bit of a boisterous pack in the table next to ours who left their whispers at home, and resorted to loud cackles. All is well when with a beauteous glass of wine and a scenic locale though üòâ"
Day visit yo sula,Service by Mr. Vaibhav was great n the food plus wine were good....Thank you...Ambience was Wonderful
Nice place with very Good service,It was my first experience at sula vineyards and it's really fantastic. The Service provided by Mr. Vaibhav was excellent.
A visit to Sula wines,"A Visit to Sula Wines in first week of SeptemberIt was really a wonderful experience while visiting the Sula Wines, me and my family members had a great time over there. The Wines and Food was tasty, Jay Arote suggested us at his best while serving. I heard that the food was prepared by Chef Ravi and Vijay. They are really doing a good job. The Ambience too much beautiful. The Scenery of the vineyard is stunning from the wine gallery. Jay take us to the resorts and we really liked it. Whenever we will come next time here, we will surely stay in resorts.  So, overall it was really nice experience."
Sula vineyards,"I spent very good time at sula.Staff was very helpful and specially Aadarsh was excellent suggested good with good food, thanks Aadarsh you made our day today."
Best service,It was awesome service given by Vaibhav... we are very happy with it... thank you so much for the good services
Excellent service,Service was excellent provided by vaibhav and the food quality was nice I would recommend all my friends to visit Sula vineyards.
over hyped & over rated,"Just been to Sula Vineyards over the weekend. I must say the place is decked up well. Pretty decent. The sessions are time well. However, a caution if you traveling with kids. The kids have absolutely nothing to do. A very boring place. The person explaining the sessions was too boring. It was a dialogue no interaction at all. The wine tasting session is a large room and cool one (much needed after the boring lecture) but be careful of mosquitoes, too many in this one room. The restaurant that serves food is good but again a bunch of lazy people serving around.  The place is moderately charged - only for the tour 150 PP and with wine tasting session 450 PP. Take my suggestion, skip the tour. Not worth. Go only for the wine tasting session. Overall the journey is also tiring (parking at one end & you have to walk all the way to other end). Overall exp, blah!!!"
Party,"This was my first time in Sula Vineyards. As expected food, ambiance, service and most important thing vine all things are perfect. It is near Gangapur dam so scenery is also awesome. You can enjoy your day with no complaints, just feel the positive vibes üòÑ."
Great Experience,Sula Vineyard is beautiful and green. We did the wine tasting tour and had most fun on the same. Gaurav is very knowledgeable and handled all our questions beautifully. Would definitely visit again :)
Sparkling ambience,"Amazing place, with a fabulous person Sounvik Ghosh. I find him really co-operating. They made my afternoon memorable."
Nice expensive resort,"Great resort,  but I feel it‚Äôs is too expensive nice rooms all good but the place is overrated and not value for money . The people serving and staff are too good and very courteous.good for a day and max one night ."
Wineyard,Good & lovely place.. 1) Awesome for photography..2)Sula organise a tour/drink of few wines. Rs 150/300. (batch wise)3)Restaurants inside are good & expensive.4) Dec to Mar every year can see grapes in fields.
Excellent experience,You should try indias first Sparkling red wine its tooo good special thanks to Harsh for suggesting this wine.Hope to see you soon again with a new wine .
Sula Vineyard,Bottle shop HARSH Patel was very informativeOver all ambience is great Next time for sure will spend more time
Sula üòç,First experience of cherishing and enjoying wine. Falling in love with the place. Perfect weekend zone.Please get more of the limited edition Raza and brut tropicale out in other cities.
