Beauty of vizag,Best place to visit in vizag.Superb atmosphere The beauty of vizag can be seen from here.must place to visit.
"Best vizag City view from Kailasagiri, 40 feet shiva parvathi Idol, Rope way, Toy Train",Best View of city is main attraction from Kailasagiri Hills. Hilight is 40 feet shiva-parvathi Idol. Ropeway is best experience. For childern Toy train and garden and parks. one side of the this hill is Ghat road fro two wheeler and four Wheelers. another side Stairs for paligrams.

Beautiful,"The view from the hill top is just mesmerized me, it's very beautiful at night time, will surely visit again for sure in next visit"
Beautiful place,KAILASHGIRI is the beautiful place to view. To reached there you choose two options. By road or by cable car.when you reached there was a toy train to view Kailashgiri. We send one hour there.
Amazing n Unobstructed Views,Kailasagiri has always been a go-to place for me ever since my first visit to vizag back in 2012. Its a fun place for all age groups as it offers u a cable car ride to n from in a very reasonable price. Once ur on the mountain top u have the options for fun activities like horse back riding or a toy train ride around the hill or munching on to your favourite snack in the small shacks or just wonder around n explore the hill top on foot(my fav). It offers u a mesmerising view from every corner and one can just fall in love wid the views of vizag from here. One can see the amazing shorelines n the snaky roads which go along the shorelines as well as appreciate the beautiful lush green slopes of the adjacent hills. You can also offer your prayers to Lord Shiva n Goddess Parvati (Hindu God n Goddess respectively) as we have huge statues of them right at the hill top. All in all its a very amazing place to hangout in the evening be it wid friends or family or as a couple.
Kailashigiri ,Has an amazing view but skipped the train and operated facility they have which shows the amazing coast lines of Vizag. Kids and family seemed to have a jolly good time at this place
Sameeksha By Sachin - Awesome Park with Blessings of Lord Shiva and Lot of Fun,"The ""Kailasagiri Park"", which has been developed over an area approx. 380 acres and at the height of approx. 570 feet at Kailasagiri Hills in Visakhapatnam, is a unique gift given to the city. A cable car ride can be enjoyed to reach the park. The view of the city, the road and the sea while going up by cable car is spectacular. One can also go by road to reach this park developed on the top of the hill.As soon as you enter the park, you see a 40 feet tall white statue of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. There are staircases with shiny railings built on both sides to reach the huge statue on a high platform and the flowery stairway are there between the two staircases, the view is astonishing for any tourist. When you reach the park by cable car, you come across a railway track first and a small but very “real railway station” like railway station built there. There is a toy train there which runs around the park and you can enjoy the train ride as well as the park and the amazing view. This option of joy ride was fun there. We opted for AC coach. Sitting in the train, sometimes passing through narrow bushes and sometimes looking at the artifacts in the park and sometimes getting lost in the spectacular views was an awesome experience. Seeing such a large park in about half an hour without fatigue with the help of this toy train is a wonder. There are entertainment options like dinosaur’s replica, swings and power cricket as well as a Lord Shiva temple, floral clock and some other attractions. Do not forget to visit Kailasagiri Park whenever you are in Visakhapatnam. This park is open seven days a week from 10 am to 8 pm."
Prominent hill top parks with panoramic sea view on the East Coast,"Kailasagiri is one of the prime attractions and a popular picnic spot for all the tourists visiting the beautiful city of Vizag.It is one of the prominent hill top parks with panoramic sea view on the East Coast.

Devenda Goyal,A very nice and joyful experience. A cirular train gives birds view of city. The statue is impressive and facility is well maintained.
Awesome view,"If you come to Vizag this is a place you have to visit. It's a reasonably well maintained public park with a great bird's eye view of the wonderful beaches below from the Kailash giri hills above. The toy train ride is a must and there are AC coaches also to beat the heat. With the available snacks and popcorn s, kids and even adults enjoy the joyride where you can visualise the entire city Vishakhapatnam with the tallest building s as well as the serene beaches"
Spectacular view of Shiva Parvati Idol,"Went juat casually to see this place. This is a hill top park with the main attraction being the Shiva Parvati Idol and the spectacular view of Vizag from top. There are three ways to go to the top. One is the stairs, 2nd is the road and 3rd is the Cable Car which costs 100 / head up and down. We chose the cable car to go and there is a mini toy train to see the whole park at a go. This was also selected as the Best Tourist spot in 2003."
Visit for the ropeway and the toy train,"Even if u r not a religious person and wudnt bother to go up a hill to see Shiv Parvati, u must visit this place just to get a bird's eye view of the entire city.Take the ropeway up and down and the toy train once u r there to get the best shots of the city and the sea. The canteen has good food if u are hungry. Dont buy packed food like chips coz they are costly. Try noodles or anything cooked. But the loo is near the car park and is quite a trek up and down. The children's park is fun even if u r not a kid!The toy train is a must. Buy a ticket in the non AC coach and the best view is from the seat that are away from the platform. U get to see the entire city. Be careful of the jutting out branches that tend to enter the windows in non AC coaches."
"Worth to visit, an excellent place","Tha mountain just opposite to a beautiful beach with multiple options to go above, i.e. By road, by Ropeway, by hiking etc..... After reaching at top it provides a beautiful bird eye view of the Vizag city along with the top view of long curved Beach with the parellal road. The huge statue of Shri Shiv and Parvati is the top attraction and selfie point for the tourists. This place is well managed and developed by the authorities. The toy train is also one of the attraction along with park and food joints.It's one of the best happening place to visit and enjoy the evening."
Breath taking views and toy train,No trip to Vizag would be complete without a trip to Kailashgiri. Especially my little niece loved riding the toy train round the hill top. The view point above the bay will leave you in awe and the twin marble statues of Shivji and Parvati are a sight to behold.
The peak park experience,It was fun riding the ropeway to the park but have to wait in long queues to get the ride but its worth waiting
Must visit,It reminded me of Buddha temple in Pattaya.Amazingly scenic beauty...must visit.It has a great mountain and beach view.There are several view point but I would suggest titanic point and Annapurna point is sufficient.Timber train is also there along with a electric train for peripheral view.80 rs non ax120 rs for ac
Good views,Allow a good couple of hours to see all the sights. The statues are magnificent. Take the row way up and down for 100rp the air conditioned carriage of the train is great. The only down side is the litter and rubbish you can see from train and in bushes.
Out of the world must see place for all who visit Vizag. And the train is also a very good addition to get an aerial vie,Out of the world must see place for all who visit Vizag. And the train is also a very good addition to get an aerial view. It's one of its kind place.We only faced a problem with a photographer who promised and then wanted to charge triple the amount thinking as tourists we will pay anything he demands.There is nobody to monitor these freelancers
360 deg Bird view of Vizag!,"We were constrained with time and our Coordinator asked us to complete it in half an hour. How can we do it when the train trip alone takes 20 minutes!Anyhow, we just rushed through. The tall Siva Parvati idols are majestic. Had a look at the toy train without entering into it. Tried to look at the bird's view of Vizag.Kailasagiri is boldly written on this hill top and one can see it from miles away.Worth visiting this place leisurely enjoying the 360 Deg bird's view of Visakhapatnam!"
Good tourist spot,"Kailasagiri is a great tourist spot offering great view of Vizag city. Other than the huge statues of Shiva and Parvati, Kailasagiri boasts of a huge botanical park and a small toy-train track. Suggest that you buy non-ac coach tickets in the toy-train so that you can see the excellent views of the beach and Visakapatnam city."
nice spot for going with family,"We visited Kailashgiri in the month of Jan 20202. This is beautiful hill located near rishikonda,  main attraction was Ropeway and toy train. There was a huge statue of Shivji & Parvatiji.nice view of beach & city from there"
A quick picnic spot for a day trip ,"We visited in the month of December 2019. This is beautiful hill located in vizag city at a distance of just 25 km approximately . The main attraction was Ropeway and circular train which give u a breathtaking view of Rushikonda Beach from the Hill. Ropeway runs from down of the hill ( near Rushikonda Beach) to the up . The ticket is for two way ,they don't give one way ticket. Train ticket u will easily get from the counter situated at the top of the hill. Besides all this scenic beauty there was a huge statue of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati  too which attracts people a lot . There is a Titanic view point, weather centre , museum , park and eating joints at the hill. Overall good day trip for family ."
Scenic view from the top,The ropeway is very good and the statue of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati is memorable.Breathtaking view of the Rishikonda beach
Kailashgiri is shiva statue on garden.,Kailashgirri is the great fun time place. We can take toy train ride. Fooding also available. Ropeway is available. By 250 steps walking we can reach kailashgiri. Entry ticket :15/-. Ropeway :100/-
Bird’s Eye View of Visakhapatnam,"Even though you can go by the stairs, take the conveyor cars just for the fun of looking at hills and beach at the same time. The statues of Shiva Parvati can be too crowded but the view that you get of the city below and the vast spread of beaches is soothing. You may feel like finding a quiet corner and meditating. The authorities can handle the queues better though as I experienced the mismanagement."
Beautiful and family place,Great place to visit and quite pleasant. A circular train is available too. Lord Shiva and Maa Parvathi statues are mind blowing and give a divine dimension to this lovely place. Children friendly with some amenities like play areas amd lots of places to eat drink and hang around. Elderly access is good too. Must visit...
Beautiful Statue of Lord Shiva & Parvathi,"A Scenic view of the city & good landscape. You can reach here through ropeway or by road. At the top, there are lots of shops, a temple, and a toy train ride,etc,."
Man made park,"In kailash giri, train is going to roam  inside the park, cost rs80 for Non AC and Rs100 for AC.Rope is also there, view of sea beach from rope way is awsome. In between the park statue of Lord Siva and Parbati are present."
Har har mahadev,Om Om Om Shri Mata namah this kailasagiri it's simply good atmosphere I want I was a plan I want to visit this place with my family next my visit thanks god to make my day
Y .n prasad,Good timepass.  The administration should spruce it up further to entice visitors. It should have more food stalls.
Kailasagiri ,Kailasagiri is situated in the uphill and there is also rope way. Super view from kailasagiri whole Visakhapatnam is visible from kailasagiri. Full greenery in kailasagiri best picnic spot also
"Must visit,can spend 2-3 hours","We went around afternoon,well maintained,with proper facilities of parking,local eateries.Take the Toy train ride first, which will give you a quick overview of the place,then you can decide which place you need to go.Lot of walking , no buggies available.The View points towards the Ocean/ Town are excellent.People come in big groups ,have small picnic lunch in the garden.You can easily spent 2-3 hours if visiting the entire plot."
A place to chill out,Good and ambient place for family or friends to hangout. Beautiful view of vizag city. Must visit glass train trip and rope way
Tourist Spot,"There's a ropeway to go to the hilltop. There's a big idol of shiv and Parvati at the top. There are a lot of garden, a toy train and viewpoint."
Glimpse of Vizag city is a rewarding experience from Kailasgiri Hill,The ropeway opens at 11 AM and one can take the rope way from foot hill to go to the top. There is a train ride available which circumnavigates the hill top and provides an excellent view of Vizag city.
Excellent sea view,Kailasgiri located adjacent to the sea offers us a excellent sea view...we can also see the ropeway and the train that runs around the hill...one can also see the cyclone warning centre here and if spent a day fully can enjoy a lot here
Place to get a great view into the Vizag,We had very enjoyable time at Kailashgiri...The journey is comfortable as there are good roads to the place...The place has multiple viewing points that give a great view into Vizag..very good infrastructure has been developed to make it as an attractive tourist spot..worth visiting when in Vizag..
good picnic spot,"good picnic spot to visit with family.there is a great view of the lakes, few rides for the kids, few places for food"
Good family outing place,"Visited Kailashgiri during a recent visit. Luckly the place was not crowded. Took the ride in the mini train and the cable car. the views from the cable car were breathtaking. Place is clean and a good breeze ensures you have a good time. However i did not find a good place to have lunch, had to come back to the city"
Wonderful view,We can get a very good view of the city and the sea from the top. There is also a toy train on the hill which is good for children.
Rope way,Incredible experience. Best experience of ropeway. Clean n greenery. Must visit place. 5 stars recommended. Dining options should increase though
Toy Train & Rope way,"Beautiful hill, beautiful location, kids will enjoy the place a lot.A few suggestions1.The timing of starting of rope way is too inconvenient , it starts at 11 am, at this time at Visakhapatnam city temperature is very hi, so waiting for rope way in such heat is very difficult.2.the arrangements at rope way ticket counter is too pathetic, no shades, no chairs, no wash room, no drinking water.  no Que management system. this need to be improved. 3. for going through rope way the traveler need to go through 2 ques for tickets- one for entry ticket and one for ticket for Rope way, and after that 2 more ques- waiting Que for Rope way and Que for toy train ticket."
Site seeing,"Kailasagiri is a cool place to visit, most of the people prefer for arranging pot lucks and worshiping lord shiva. We have a rope way for children and adults which make travel easy"
Kailashgiri,Superb view from the kailashgiri entire visakhapatnam you could see from the top . Devote lord siva and parvati wonderful status visualize. Very crowded place we enjoyed.
Shiv Parvati,"Small hill, overseeing entire Vizag which is having huge idol of shiv and parvati. There is a toy train which takes you around the hill and have 360 deg view of the city."
Kailasgiri,This park beholds the idol of Lord shiva-durga duo on a small hillet. You have to reach the top by ropeway. The place is very beautiful and the kids are sure to enjoy the place.
A Good Place with Religious Flavor,"Very nice place for spending time. The Shiv Parvati statue is the main attraction. Apart from that, you will find a very big garden all over with small small shops for eating. If you there with children, must try circular train. 20 minutes ride. It can show you Visakhapatnam from all sides from the top. Place is neat and clean. Parking is available."
Kailasagiri hill,Kailasagiri hill is located beside the vizag beach. It is one pf the scenic places of Visakhapatnam.
Something for Everyone,"The place has something for everyone. You could take a car to the hilltop or take the ropeway. The cars are allowed after 0830 am and there was a INR 50 entry fee for vehicle. There is a temple, a 3D cinema for children, a amusement part with dino statues, sculptors, a museum and a toy train which can take you around the park."
"Absolutely stunning view at Kailasagiri, VIZAG","We feel sensations of deeper joy, super greenaries also excellent atmosphere, very well maintained, stunning birds view  of Vizag city along the coastline Bay of Bengal.Kailasagiri’s  top attractions include Shiva Parvathi Statue, Toy Train, 7 Wonders of Vizag, Shiva Temple, Titanic View Point, Shanti Ashram, ViewPoints, Shanku Chakra Naama, Floral Clock,Jungle Trails, Gliding Base Point, Children Play Park, Conference Hall, Telescopic Point.Food Courts, Art Gallery, Road Train etc"
Kailasagiri,"It is so calm and serene  has a beautiful garden to relax and enjoy.We feel sensations of deeper joy, super greenaries also excellent atmosphere, very well maintained, stunning birds view  of Vizag city along the coastline Bay of Bengal.Kailasagiri’s  top attractions include Shiva Parvathi Statue, Toy Train, 7 Wonders of Vizag, Shiva Temple, Titanic View Point, Shanti Ashram, ViewPoints, Shanku Chakra Naama, Floral Clock,Jungle Trails, Gliding Base Point, Children Play Park, Conference Hall, Telescopic Point.Food Courts, Art Gallery, Road Train etc"
Kailas Giri,It's a tourist destination and the beauty of it lies in Toy train journey. From You train we can have bird's eye view of Visakhapattanam city and the sea. Wonderful place with rope way is a must must visit view point.
Beautiful view,A must visit spot if in Vizag Rope way to take u up Breathtaking views Statues are a sight to behold in d open sky
Very nice views from the top,"There are very nice views from the top. We took the ropeway as we were told that by road route is not allowed for Ola/Uber plus kids wanted to enjoy the ropeway. It took us 30 minutes in the queue thought the ropeway ride was hardly for less than 5 minutes. On the top, there is toy train which takes a full round of entire hill in 20 minutes. We missed first train as tickets were sold out. Then we got the tickets of AC coach of next train. However, by that time, it was dark and there were too many clouds. The toy train journey was quite average as there were only few patches in the journey offering nice views. As it was dark so we got mostly night view. Other than a statue, it has many shops and play area for kids. We couldn't spend much time as it started raining. During return also, we had to stand in queue for 30 minutes to come back via ropeway. Overall, it was average experience. I would suggest to reach there around 4:00 PM so that you are not late like us and can enjoy nice views either by yourself or in toy train. If you are planning earlier than take umbrella with you, not for the rain but for the scorching sun rays."
A evening in the lap of God Shiva.,The visit to the vishakhapatnam is incomplete without visiting kailashgiri. The hill top and the statue of the god and Goddess is truly magnificent. The bird view of sea is spectacular. Try to avoid the tram operating here as it goes in a circle and cannot get any exclusive views. If taken try to get right hand seats as they provide the sea view. This is a truly a photogenic place to Capture memory.
Climb high,Kailashigiri could be made more interesting if they provide proper transport to go high up the hill apart from the rope way for which one has to ride many steps .What about aged people or people with knee pain.
Average place,"Nothing great, Top of the hill, one toy train, 3 compartment, 1AC, 120 Pp for ac, 80 for non ac, food stalls, little tit bits shopping,Rope way is an option for up and down, car also go till top, Sea view from top is good."
"Not necesary to repent, if you fail to visit this place","While in Visakhapatnam, If one had already visited other attractions such as, Rama Krishna Beach, Rishikonda Beach, Ramanaidu Film Studios, Thotlakonda & if they don’t have the time to visit this place, absolutely it is not necessary to repent for not visiting this Place. Nevertheless, if one has ample time to spare, one can undoubtedly visit this place. However the major attraction, at this place, I reckon is the cable car. Nonetheless, during the peak season/hour, one has to wait at least for one to two hours, to enjoy the Cable Car ride. But despite that, there is also a toy train in Kailashgiri wherein children will definitely love to travel in the Toy Train. However if you wish to visit this place, try to visit this place, preferably in the evening, as in the morning it will be highly humid"
Worth dropping by ifyou have a car.,I wouldn't go out of my way to make a special visit here as the Aruku Valley is probably more interesting if you have a limited amount of time but the views are spectacular and there are lots of nice cafes to have lunch too. If you have children they will love the train ride.
Not necessary to visit,"It's only a view point, can take pictures of ocean from top otherwise nothing is there to see. Can skip and go to other beaches."
Excellent for ocean view,"Kailashgiri hilltop which can be accessed both via ropeway or road is perfect place to view the beauty of the ocean, bay of Bengal from the top. The hilltop in itself also has many recreational activities both for children and adults. We can take nice pictures with the sea at the background at many of the spots. One popular thing here is the printing of cups and mugs with photos taken here or from phone memory. Nice place to spend couple of hours or half a day."
Nice place to visit,Nice place to visit with Family and friends. We used Rope way as our means of transport as it is a new experience to the ones who want to do some adventurous rides. However it is not too scary though. It is just a 3 min travel. I suggest personally to people who visit first time to try the rope way. It has good view from inside and also you'll enjoy it a lot. LIVE AND LET LIVE.
"A hilltop park, good place to roam with family","Kailasagiri is a hilltop park in the city of Visakapatnam in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. Comprises 380 acres of land covered with flora and tropical trees. The hill, at 173 metres , overlooks the city of Visakhapatnam. To protect the environment, the hill is a plastic-free zone. Its a place that offers a mixture of things including places of religious importance (Lord Shiva Parvathi statue), Toy Train, wide view of the whole city and many other things for the visitors.Good place to roam with family & nice place for photography."
Kailasagiri,Kailasagiri is a hill which had been developed by VUDA into a pretty nice tourist spot taking advantage of the magnificent view of the Bay of Bengal that this hill offers from the top. One can reach the top by a rope-way also. There is also a park and a toy train that children will enjoy.
Nice place,Went to Kailasa giri on the rope way. Children enjoyed well the rope journey. Visakhapatnam view from the rope way car is very good. Train is there in the hill. View point is good from the train. Children park is also there at kailasagiri. But need some maintenance. Most of the play items are in repair. Food items and shopping is there. God Shiva parvathi statue is so good
Good place to visit,A good place to visit but there are options to reach via road but local cab drivers will not tell you. they will drop you at the ropeway which is not worth.there is train ride you can enjoy with your family.
Trip was excellent,The trip was awesome and the kailasagiri.The hill top view is awesome and I enjoyed a lot with my family.
View from top!!!,"Kailashgiri Hill - you need to climb some steps to the entrance of the cable car - by the beachside. The view of the sea and the city, from the cable car while it travels to the top, is amazing. Once at the top you can take the train ride which takes you around the hill in comfort. Overall views of Vizag is best."
Scenic view of the Beach from Hilltop!,Situated between RK beach and Rushikonda. Toy-train ride is pretty good and cable car ride offers you a good view of Bay of Bengal.  Lord Shiva and Parvati idols are primary attraction of this place.
Amusement park,The hill park is pollution free. The cable car ride to reach the kailasagiri is awesome. Kids can enjoy a lot here. Night view and Beach view are beautiful
Hyped,"This is an overhyped,  and not a value-for-money destination. We went during the first part of the afternoon,  when the sun was hot and the skies were clear. The weather was humid and as we entered the park, there was a counter that indicated an entry fee of Rs. 5. A few steps ahead, there was another, this one for the ropeway ride to the top of the hill, with a ticket of Rs. 100. It took us less than five minutes to the top, and then we were back to the heat. A small walk led us to two huge statues of Shiva and Parvati. There was a toy train which was more stationery than otherwise. Lunch time for the engine driver! !Nothing else to do, we returned the same way, the same Rs. 100 ticket worked for the way down.Avoid, if you are not too enamoured with ropeways."
Good place,Good place to roam with family..view is nice ...nice photography place around ..very good lord Siva statue ..
Must visit,The Shiva Parwati huge idol is superb. The ropeway tour to hill top is a added advantage.There is a circuit train on top of the hill giving one full round view.Overall nice experience. Both Ropeway and Train is chargeable.
Better in the day ,"We came in the evening and took the train ride around and it was kind of a miss as at night we couldn't see the city view so well. Overall, it was a lovely place but do come in the daytime to enjoy it more."
High above it all,Our group of four heard about the tram ride to the top of the mountain so we drove over. When we arrived we bought our tickets at the counter and then walked up the many steps to board the cable car. The views in the cable car and at the top were fantastic. We arrived at the top about 12:45. There were also a lot of places to walk around. Many trees and nice photo spots. There was a tiny amusement park of sorts but we decided not to pay the extra. We also took the little train around the top. It goes very slow. They offer A/C train cars but they wouldn't sell us that ticket because all the windows in the train were open. Also keep in mind that they shut the cable car down during lunch time from 1-2pm. We enjoyed the walk at the top so that wasn't a problem for us.
Great way to spend a few hours,Stars with a cable car ride to the top of the mountain which is half the fun and you can explore at your leisure.  Worth while to do while in Visag.
Mandatory to see,"If you are miss this place then u can miss everything..The best place in Visakhapatnam,,U can enjoy here with toy train, rope way,Jumping, Horse riding, museum etc..."
AWESOME PLACE,Very nice and must visit place in visakhapatnam. hilltop beauty and the statue of lord Shiva great feeling.
Must See,"One the best tourist place in Vizag...Roap Way,Toy train, park,,is available here.U can see entire Vizag city from here....Horse riding is also available here"
With family,Beautiful hotel and good maintenance friendly staff good manager and staff delicious South Indian buffet particularly Cascades
Amazing Views,Kailashgiri Hill provides excellent views of the sea and the entire Vizag city. There is a cable car to go from bottom of the hill to the top. There is a nice park at the top of the hill wherein there are many restaurants.
Amazing Views,"The place can be reached using road or via a cable car from the base of the hill. The Cable car offers nice views of the sea, especially during the evening. At the top, there is a big statue of Shivji and Parvati Ma. The lighted statues at night offer good background for pictures. From the top, the whole of the city can be seen nicely. In the evening one can see the whole lighted city, the flickering lights of the cars as they drive along the coast and the amazing ships which come to dock at the Vizag port. There are various restaurants at the top to eat."
Lovely place ,"This place is having huge statue of Lord Shiva and Mata Parvati and this is at top of hills ,From this place you can see Beautiful view of Vizak city"
Great view,i have been to the kailasagiri hill by the ropeway... there are many parks and a lot of greenary there on the hill... there is also ramakrishna mission's library kind of thing on the hil

Beautiful place to visit in busy city,"Best place to get birds view of vizag city especially beaches.it looks so calm and serene from top.the place have beautiful garden to relax and enjoy with family,a toy train runs around the hill to give better view.Best way to reach is hire a cab till downhill,which costs hardly 150 rupees from rk beach and then go to hilltop via cable car.it good place for nature lovers.Small shops are there to have tea and snacks.a must visit in vizag."
A nice drive up the hills with fascinating views of the sea beach,The drive up and down was the best part of the trip. Very few places in India has the combination of a hilly road overlooking the bay.The Hill top is like any public picnic spots. The toy train ride gives a panoramic view of Vizag from the hilltop.
Kailashgiri must visit destination of Vizag- tour,"This is a must visit destination of Vizag- tour. Actually this is my 5th visit. This time I am here along with my family, relative & close friends along with their family (big group). From top tourist gets spectacular views of the entire bay, the ocean and the city of Vishakapatnam. Toy train ride also must do entertainment for tourist. After sunset illuminated view of city & beach road is the most eye-catching towards the tourist. Food price in food joints is little-bit higher side.. Visit after 3pm with at least 3hr in hand."
Kailashgiri,A very nice place.Good view from there.Very well maintained by the staffs. Very cooperative.Overall Avery interesting place full of Nature view
Great visit,Take the ropeway to reach there.. Its a great place to visit during sunset.. View point gives amazing view of sea and city..
Nice place to pass the time,Although ropeway and toy train are attraction certainly arrangements like toilets etc are severely wanting.
Kailasagiri,I was studying in vizag.i like this place very much we went by walk to the hill we enjoyed a lot here..
View & thrills..,"Hill by the sea / air conditioned toy train / cable car ride / many children parks / view points overlooking the city & the coastline / huge statue of Lord Shiva & Goddess Parvati... Well maintained, clean & ideal for spending timw with family, friends & loved ones."
about the place,well there is nothing more exciting to see in kailasgiri there is a big statue of lord shiva and Parvati and a big park but it is located in hills and from there u can get the view of Visakhapatnam and the rk beach that is the best view u will love to see
Great view,"Great place to visit this place both in day and night. In both occasion it's has a different look. Food also available , train view was great."
Awesome Place,Awesome place to move with family. Photographic place. Train journey is cartoonistic and for kids its awesome. Finally great place to relax. Rope car is good to travel for new experience.
Remarkable idols & a train ride,The place was quite nice. We took a train ride that showed us the entire city in a circular view. It completed in about 20 mins. Must to try.
Toy Train is best,"Toy Train which is best here on the top of the mountain, if you can visit during evening you can see the city in the lights. which is so beautiful to watch.also the cable car is good"
"Great panoramic views of the city,hills & sea","Great experience, can get there by Ghat Road or by cable car with great views. Once on top of Kailasagiri, there is train ride again giving great views. Great viewing galleries , great scenery."
Good park on mountain side,"The park is good . Was equiped well i would say however no maintenance. I suggest to ask people force GVMC people should go with their kids and grand kids and ask them to slide on kids slides. Sure no one appreciate as all plastic broken, iron ladders disconnected and also rusted badly. Poor maintenance by VUDA circle team."
Beautyful place,It is a beautiful garden on top of the hill. Great view from this place of the sea beach and the forest. There is a toy train which takes you around the garden. interesting place.
Nice place,"Go in the evening, stay till dark. Nice place to spend time. Lots of food joints. Toy train. View of city and sea."
A perfect Place to spend your evening - enjoy cable car ride and best way to view the city n beaches through Toy Train ,If you are visiting Vizag then u must visit the Kailasagiri as one can enjoy the scenic view of the city n beaches through Toy Train ride
Stunning views ,"Loved the views , train ride (Non a/c is best) go during sun set and then take Cable car amazing city view once again from the car. Don’t miss this place if you love scenic beauty"
Tour,I visited this place with family. It is the best place to visit with family and friends. Here rope way facility is available and little train is there  with ac coach to  see around. When you go there all the Visakhapatnam city will be visible. So many food courts are available.
Nice Place,It is actually a park situated on a hill providing great views of sea and Vizag city. A Shiva-Parvati statue is an added attraction. A mini train ride can also be availed in the park. The bad part is that you have to pay Rs.100/- as car entry fee. But overall a well maintained and nice place.
A lovely experience with great view of Vizag city,"The train ride in the AC Coach is very enjoyable. For the kind of charges ,very reasonable the whole journey of 20 minutes is a wonderful experience where in you have literally an aireal view  of the beautiful city of Vizag"
Very well developed tourist spot,The Kailasagiri mountain top is a beautiful picnic spot to spend an evening. There are two giant statues of Lord Shiva and Parwathi. There is adequate parking space at the top. The views of the city and the sea are quiet spectacular from top.
A good Picnic Spot for ALL,"Kailasagiri is one of the prime attractions and a popular picnic spot for all the locals and tourists visiting Vizag. It is spread over 100 acres on a hill top and provides a titanic view of the city, surrounding hills and its beaches. Nearly 40ft. tall statue of Shiva-Parvati is one of major landmark. The tranquil atmosphere is broken only due to the playing kids. A costly 20mins ride of a toy train [Rs80/- (Non-AC) and Rs.100/-(AC)] is preferred by visitors. Walk around the beautifully laid gardens and enjoy the fresh breeze. Food/Beverage selling venders are in numbers. Take memoirs home and include one with self/family/friend photo-shopped ceramics. Opens from morning 6AM till late evening.One can take route bus from the city. Ropeway was not working currently, but seems to be good viewing proposition from RK beach."
Well done VMRDA.,View from Titanic point was breath taking.The toy train journey was especially awesome. Well maintained. Enjoyed every moment of the visit.
Good,"Kailasagiri, superb place and a must visit place, u can see and enjoy kailasam with Siva and Parvathi"
Kailashgiri Hill,"A verdant hill on the northen side of the city,the kailasgiri offers spectacular views of the winding shoreline and cityscape"
kailasagiri,"The kailasgiri hils offers spectacular view of the winding shoreline and city scape.This hill top park faces the Bay of Bengal,it has seven view points,to enjoy beauty of nature"
pleasure viewing place on the top of the hills.,"In this place on the top of the hills and one can see the whole visakhapatnam from this place, very beautiful view from there, mountains and ocean all come together. there is a circular train just by paying 80 Rs you can take an advantage of seen whole visakhapatnam all together."
Wonderful views,Kailasagiri is a very scenic location providing some breathtaking views of Vizag city and sea. Also hop on toy train.
Execelent ,Good place nicely .beautiful vizag in the andhrapradesh  the location is beautiful I will coming on soon
Nice place to spend an evening. ,"This is located on a hillock overlooking the city of Visakhapatnam. It can be reached by a ghat road or a cable car ride. It also has a toy train ride with views of the city. It has huge statues of Siva and Parvati. The views of the city from here are very good. On one side, you can see the city, dolphin nose and RK Beach and on the other side you can see Rushikonda and the beach. There are food stalls and toy train ride."
Big statue of Shiva and Parvati on the hill,View from the hill is fantastic.  We can see entire Vizag from the top.  There is a big statue of Siva & parvati on the mountain.
Kailasagiri,Nice place to visit in vizag.we can see beach on one   side of the hill.the view is simply super there is temple on the hill
Good place to spend time as picnic,"Usually crowded in weekends, this place is very nice to spend time with family. The way to go up using a rope way is exciting. (You can reach by road, steps or by rope way). Few chats & eateries are available here."
Visit there,Very nice and quiet place. Not much crowded. Would recommend it to anyone who wants to visit there. A spiritual place.
Kaliasagiri,Last time frends went together to kalisagiri and we spent time till 6:30 pm we enjoyed  a lot with frends
Beautiful View of City and Sea from one place!,Beautiful View of City and Sea from one place due to the edge of Eastern Ghats! Lot of entertainment like mini Rail etc. Don't forget or compromise to avoid the Rail trip as it shows Spectacular view of city all around. Great ambience and atmosphere especially in Winter.
Spectacular scenic View_ Beach & City,"Must visit for the people who have visited Visakhapatnam for the first, the hills provides a beautiful scenic view of the beach and the city. Overthat people can try the uphill cable car for different experience. The hills is house to large idols of Lord Shiva and Parvati, hence name after Lord Shiva as Kailashgiri. Multiple fun entertainment facilities available at hill top with multiple comfortable sitting pockets to relax and enjoy the view of the city and beach. Last but also not the least there is cable train which tours the 360 degree of the hill to provide a scenics views all around the hill."
Worth a Trek!,Try the rope way part and then walk down. Greenery welcomes you at each corner of this hilltop attraction.
Best part of Kailash Giriraj is the ropeway,"If u have kids with u, then the ropeway will be a thrilling experience for them. You can have a bird's eye view of Vizag from the ropeway and hill top.Kids will also enjoy toytrain, horse riding and swings in the park. The Vizag view must be enchanting in night,however I missed it as I had visited this place in morning."
Awesome Shiva-Durga,One can see the nice white large Lord Shiva and Maa Durga at the top of hill Kailashgiri. Without seeing this you will lose the trip.
Good place to visit during Winters,"Firstly, you either hire a tourist car. Or take a Uber. If you take a Uber, it's going to burn a hole in your pocket. They charge extra 100 bucks for entry fees and parking. Kailashgiri was fun to visit. The train ride was nice, though people sitting on the right-hand side gets the actual mountain-sea view. The left-hand side folks merely, get to look at the park area, bushes, rocks, and couples cozying up. The place has fun activities for kids. It's mostly a picnic spot where you get to spend your day amidst greenery and landscaped gardens. I opted for the rope-way on my way back to the plains. This place could be an option for day-trips during winters. In summers, you would definitely die of sunstrokes. There's a lot of food options ranging from juice,  chowmein, etc. Nothing too fancy though. The downward journey brings you back to the Tennati Park, which probably is one of the best beaches in Vizag. Never miss the Tennati Park beach. The park is ordinary, but the beach is so serene and clean."
Stunning Views,"If you are in Vishakapatnam, than you should visit this place, as i believe this is the top most point in Vishakapatnam which is accessible by motor car.The place has a round white ball placed on top of the hill, which is visible during day and night from afar. at night it is illuminated which gives the look of a full moon.From atop you get stunning views of the entire bay, the ocean and the city of Vishakapatnam.ideal for photographers."
"Wow,beautiful spot","Kailashgiri, near hotel haritha appughar, with roapway fascility.  Timings from 9am to 7pm, closed on 19 th of every month, see photo.  U can spend 3 to 4 hours here, management is too good, best for family tourists, must see Doppler center on hill"
Kailashagiri,"Nice Hilltop destination. A very huge Shiv Parvati statue, Beautiful Garden, and sea view. toy train is another attaction."
Excellent Hill Top Park,A very Descent Park must to visit. Nice view of the sea and city riding on Ropeway. A huge Banyan Tree is nice spot for photography. Toy train is attraction for both kids and adults. Land scaping is well planned.
Kailasa Giri,A vlarge statue of shiv parvati attracts everyone. White color of tha statue is as described shiva in Shiv Puran - Karpur Gauram karuna awtaram.
Visit to Kailashgiri.,"It's on the top of a hill. Very good place for picnic and an excellent place to see the beauty of Vizag.You can enjoy the ropeway ride and the park. You can enjoy the toy train ride. After getting down, you can enjoy the nearby sea beach. Overall, nice place to spend a day."
Very nice Park with excellent beach views from top of the hill,"Very nice Park with excellent beach views from top of the hill.  There is a Toy Train, which is functional. There are snacks and souvenir/gift shops. There are RTC buses and a ropeway to go up from foothill to the top. Since there was a huge crowd for ropeway, we took the RTC bus, which was overflowing with crowd too."
Unique.. One of a kind,"The only beach side ropeway in Andhra Pradesh. Also has road access with good parking. Must go on train ride around the hill.. Get to see entire Vizag, but the view is great at night. The park is also very well maintained with good plantation and a play area for kids.. Must visit when in Vizag."
Kailash giri.,"Beautiful experience. Lovely view. Statue of Hara Parvati. Circular train, many rides. Children will enjoy an afternoon. View of the Vizag after the sunset, when lights on is mesmerising."
City Hill top view,"Located close to RK beach, this hill is major attraction for tourists. the hillock offers a enchanting view of the vizag city bordered by the scenic beach all along the city. the shiva and parvati statues stand as a major tourist spot on the top, besides other attractions like toy train."
Nice place to see the sunset,"On the way to Rishi Konda beach , this is located on a hill top. would recommend going there to see the sun set behind the hills. It has a great view of the city and the ocean. One can taje a 20 minute train ride around the hill to get a 360 degree viiew. But its too crowded , not well maintained , lot of garbage lying around"
Worth time ,"Take a toy train have corn chat , click some pics , spend time with family , adore the view of city from top and watch the beautiful nature while on the way to the park ! Free entry go ahead !"
Beautiful Structure of Lord Shiva ,"Great View from top ! Nice train ride , photogenic place and more suitable for big group as they can spend more time chit chatting ! Again you need to walk a bit to explore place !"
Good Time Pass place,"Good place to spend sometime with friends and family and children would love playing and going up and down.To go up the hill you have various options: Govt. Bus, Walk, your own 2 or 4 wheeler, rope carGood stalls to attract children and for foodies too.Go in the Twilight to see the beautiful view of the stretch and the blue sea.Could be maintained well as majority of the tourists throw the rubbish wherever possible and don't take pain in finding a dustbin."
Kailasagiri Park,"I recently visited this park with friends.It is locate at the hill top and very famous among locals.This park has lot of activities like toy train,horse ride,amusement park etc.The park is well maintained and clean.Must visit place in vizag."
Enjoy the serene atmosphere and scenic beauty,"Kailasagiri Hill Park - A good place to spend the evening. Specially my 3 yrs child enjoyed a lot. With rope way, toy train and horse riding. All these activities are little expensive though. Entry is rs 5/- but rope way fare is rupees 100 and for toy train tickets are for non ac 80 and ac coach 110. Toy train station is very nice and a good food joint is there. The ride is beautiful as you can see breathtaking view of the whole Vizag city along with the sea. The place looks charming in evening. There is a small children park and also a instant photo shop.the big Shiva Parvati statue looks beautiful in lights. The place is covered ully green grass and flower gardens, trees etc I have enjoyed beautiful viewpoints too."
Great quick hangout worth seeing,"Quiet well maintained place very much within the confines of the city. The massive idols of Shiva and Parvati form the focal point, and it also provide great views of the city and specially the RK Beach. Reaching the hill using the rope way is a delight - it’s a short trip up and down; doesn’t really matter even if you are afraid of heights (rs.100 adults, rs.60 children 4-7 yrs). The toy train is ok and provides both AC and non-AC cabins. The platform doubles up as a food court. There is also a children’s park and other eateries/ shops."
One of the Good Parks In Vizag,The view from the top will be beautiful but nowadays it became overcrowded. There will a trine ride to see the entire park. There is also a ropeway from the bottom of the hill to the top
Kailas Giri,"It is a park situated on the hill top of Kailasa Giri hill in Visakhapatnam. Near to RK beach. Well maintained hill park. You can reach hill top by walking, by car or using rope way. You can enjoy view of bay of Bengal from hill top view point. Toy train available at hill to enjoy the view around the hill. Rented cycle available."
Nice hill top,Nice hill top developed as park. Buses go on top and have regular schedules. Entry fee of Rs. 70/- taken from cars. Rope way starts at 11 am. Nice city view from top.
Good view of the city,"The place is not a place of worship or does not hold any religious faith attached to it. It is just like any other hill, with the idols of Shiva and Paravthi installed. The view from the top is great. Nice place to go and enjoy the scenic beauty of the Bay of Bengal and the coastline. The train ride is not exciting. Heard that in earlier days it would stop at two or three locations, and the passengers could have enjoyed the view. However, today it does not stop and the moving train offers only a limited view. One should come by the aerial cable way and go back by road. The view from the aerial cableway cabins is superb.Overall, a nice place to visit and spend about an hour and half to two,"
Excellent timepass,"Its fun-time here with family. Lot of attractions here to enjoy like toy train, horse ride, E cycle etc. Also snacks and beverages are available here. Good maintained parks to sit, relax and gupshup. We could not use rope way as it starts 11 am."
Greenery spot of Vizag,"Hill on which high idol of Siva and Parvati installed made it Kailasagiri (Hill which is said to be abode of Lord Siva). It is developed and being maintained in good manner. Had a park in which one can happily enjoy the nature. also has a facility of toy train which circumferences Kailasagiri but one can enjoy more on foot rather than  toy train. One can reach Kailasagiri through a rope way also.Drive to Kailasagiri is also a great experience. Through Ramakrishna beach and Tenneti park, beauty of Pacific ocean enthralles the viwers."
Very Clean,"The Lord Shiva & Parvati Statues are very nicely build, Enjoyed my trip to this place, even train joy ride was good"
Decent Enough,To go on top of the hill there is Roap Way facility @ 100/head. The view form the top is awesome. Apart from that there is :1. A toy train that goes around the entire hill giving a very brief and good view of the entire city.2. A lot of shops for snacks and to eat.3. Cycles are available.4. There are quite a few view points from which you may click pics and have a great view of the city.5. over all its a must visit.

A very good place to spend few hours in Vizag,The hill top can be reached both by road as well as ropeway. Ropeway is more thrilling. One can easily spend 3-4 hours on the top with good entertainment.
Wonderful views of Vizag,A trip up to Kailasa Giri offers wonderful views of Vizag. I would suggest taking the cable car - which while not cheap gives an interesting ride up and down. Plenty to see in the gardens as well easy to lose a couple of hours or more wandering around.
Business Trip Free morning to expore,"Lovely views from the mountain, Beautiful well kept gardens. Very clean and safe walk areas ❤️🗻⛰️🙏👌❤️"
Great view of the city both morning and night,"This tourist location is easily accessible from the base of the hill by ropeway . It’s a very nice pretty winding drive up the mountain if you wish to drive up that way . Once you reach kailash giri there is a train which takes a slow circle around the perimeter allowing people to enjoy the view of the city below. It is a spectacular vista . Make sure you sit facing the views of the city . The hilltop offers play areas for children and a few shops For fast food / trinkets / small toys . There is a shiva Parvati statue which is well lit at night Note - it is possible to take in both day time and night time views and this would be the best way to enjoy this place . Options include driving up or taking the ropewah at 4:30 pm , drive around the perimeter or take the train ( cars allowed ) , walk around the hill top till it’s dark ( around 6:30 pm) take the train again and then take the ropeway down ."
Peaceful,Best place to hangarround with friends ...very peaceful place and everything is just clean and natural...best place in Vizag I must say
very peace loving n soothing environments near statue of lord shiva n mata Parbati,those who love devo ke dev lord shiva best place to stay for 2to3 hrsoutside lot of snacks centres train was extra ordinary exp
Really great place to visit with family,"We had been to Kailasa Giri this month with family. This place has toy train to get Sea view and City View in this ride. There is Big statue of Lord Shiva and Parvati. Also, there is ropeway to enjoy ride. Must visit this place."
titanic views,"great height ,views and breathtaking sea nary views. family place and there is toy train and entertainment games for kids like horse ride sand circket plays etc. can spend the day also. cable rope  is for 100 which is damp cheeap against city and sea views. public transport autos ar avaiable ."
Good place for walking.,"Very good place for walking. The whole vizag town is shown from here like a necklace. One thing is bad, the toilet for public is invisible to me😢😢😢😢"
Place to view Vizag city,"Kailashgiri is happening place in Vizag. We have gone there by ropeway. There is ample parking place near Ropeway base point. There is proper queue for ropeway, they allow 4-5 adults in single cabin. The experience is amazing.On the top there are few gardens and landscapes. There is toy train which will take you around Kailashgiri. Seat on Right to see Beach and City, sit on right to see Trees and Gardens.There are small food joints and ice cream prarlour above. The main attraction on top is huge Shiva Parvati statue. You can have professional photos here from the photographers. Remember that Ropeway closes at 8:00pm, they do announcement prior to it.If you go in evening you can see amazing view of hustling bustling Vizag city from above."
Beautiful n must visit,It gives a panaromic view of entire Vizag. It has toy train with AC n non AC coaches. You have a facility of rope way too to reach here. But it seems 19th of every month is a maintenance day and rope way will be closed. Must go for toy train. One hour is sufficient for everything
Ropeway n train on top is good,If u r in vizag and have time..Then u can treat this as third on can be visited attraction Priority 1 borracaves cavesPriority 2 submarine museumPriority 3 lalasa guruThe above priorities don't consider beaches...Beaches are top most priority...Not very safe though bcoz of BAyY of Bengal..But clean and can be visited in morning closer to shore line
Best view of the vizag city,"This is a tourist point in a daily sightseeing tour of vizag city. Few kms from Rushikonda beach , there is a small hill on the top of which there is a temple of Lord Shiva. The view is breathtaking. Car/auto rickshaw  booking is recommended ."
Bird eye of vizag,"A big garden to roam around and has a rope way to reach. They have museum, toy train,eateries. A perfect picnic spot with friends and family. It’s a plastic free zone so enjoy the view and environment"
Giri,Kailasa giri is located in vizag it is good place to watch there is a Roop wap we can see the wee from kailasa giri we can enjoy with family
"If you are a tourist outside India, please pay attention","I think Trip Adviser needs to separate the feedback provided by nationals from that provided by outside India tourists. If you consider going there as an outside tourist, please be careful.First, no taxi or Uber will come back to pick you up. There are almost no tourists, so everybody is wondering what are you doing there. And many other things you need to be careful about. People are however very nice and with the help of nice people I succeeded to return to the city."
I like it,"What a lovely place! You will enjoy it even during hot weather due to plenty of trees under which you can find a shelter. The statues of Siva and Parvati are amazing, you can also use the ropeway to see the city. It's clean, peaceful and beautiful there. It's a must see place in Vizag. Will try to return there again before my leave."
Well maintained place,Awesome sea view from Kailasa Giri. Well maintained park and greenery. Toy Train to cover the hill. Rope way from base of hill to top. Best time to go is during evening to enjoy the most.
Nice place,"Worth visiting, Located on the hilltop, don't miss the ropeway as this is the only way you can enjoy the beauty."
Worth visiting,The view from this staircases is really alluring and board the rope(Only open after 11 am) and experience the panoramic view of the beach.
Excellent Place,"The ropeway is open to the public after 11:00 AM, experience the panoramic view of the beach. Near to this place, there is a titanic viewpoint, do visit and catch the sea view just like you are in a cruiser."
Excellent Place for a long walk and a breathtaking view of Vizag city and shoreline,"Very well maintained place linked by Rope way as well as the road: inside there is also a train which one can take. There are 2 Ashrams and a sthal for all religions. As you venture further, there is a World Class Telugu Cultural Heritage Museum with all the Kings and various rulers of that Telugu part of the geography, acadamecians, sages statues and all cultural leaders in various fields.  The astounding piece is the auditorium at the centre with excellent audio visuals world class. On the whole, a very well maintained and clean parks, lots of flora and fauna especially birds. We thoroughly enjoyed the trip though our driver told us it's just a park and meet you under an hour, whereas we needed more than the 150 mins that we spent to do better justice. Ideal time to visit is around 4:30 in the Eve. Overall score is 8+/10"
A mirror to success @nasim,"Hello travellers,time to time from top to bottom and from left to right till success to failure all depends or comes like a mirror in our mind or as a recap on our eyes or mind..nothing is better or best if you visit this kailasgiri before you think of something else..best is always best but in  silent. mode... Great time with great people is easy ... but God gifted is one piece.. look and visit.. the place and than reply to me.. whether your mind comes to a perfect touch or not while visiting this place... @ nasim.."
"Awesome place, don't miss out",This was my 2nd time visit in Vuda Kailashgiri park.It was wonderful place and view was extraordinary. I visited with my Family. You can reach by Cable car(rs.100 for round trip) or by road in Car.The weather was very nice during Oct-DEC and ideal time to visit.Better to reach by Ropeway as it has nice view. There is also toytrain(AC and Non-AC coaches) available which will take you to the round of the whole park .I recommend it to all.I just love the place.
park on the hill,kailasa giri is a nice half day visit for both locals and tourists with enough for kids and adults to enjoy a day far from the city routine.
must visit for the family with kids.,"an enjoyable experience first by the rope way and then train ride for kids. the view of the city and gentle winds make this place an ideal picnic place for family, especially with kids."
not developed by govt of ap,"If this place would be in malysia or singapore it would have been a great area for publicGovt of ap has not developed it wellExcept food (subnormal quality) and drinks shops, no other significant places on the hill"
Majestic,"If there is one word to describe this place is, it's majestic. Right the in the lapse of shiv and Parvati this park gives you a total birds eye view of the city and ocean. A must visit with kids, there is a train ride that takes you around the whole park and relishes you with wonderful views of the city."
Nice in mini train,Very nice mini tran in kailash giri 7 km from Rk beach adult tickets for mini train 130 ac and non ac 80
Nice Place on Hill Top,A must see place in Visakhapatnam. The hill top view is simply mesmerising . The lawns and gardens are well maintained.
Must Visit Park,Great experience. use of ropeway makes the visit comfortable. But toytrain ride is of no use since it passes through outside the park and at a lower level. Thus nothing is visible from it. One can spend more than half a day here to comfortably cover the whole area.
Beautiful city view,If u wish to view the city of Vizag from 1 place.. this is the place to be.. beautiful view point to view Vizag in its full charm.. can plan to spend 2 to 6 hours here & wont get bored..
A park at the top of the hill,"Nice place to travel this place,  Car can reach at the gate of the park. Better walk into the park, enjoy the beauty take photos,  at the Center big  statue of Shivji & Parvatiji. One can enjoy the train ride."
The best of its kind in Visakhapatnam giving a scenic view of sea and city together.,Must visit place in Vizag for short holiday spending. Beautiful view from top and have Rope Way connected to this hill is a wonderful experience though it is shorter in time.
Good view of the see and beaches,The view from different points pf this park was really good. The cable car is also good to try and you have a really good view from the car. They have one way (One to to down or down to top) or return (You can return to same place) options. The toy train is not so great but one with children may enjoy. Parking was bit a problem.
One Of the Best place To Visit In Vizag,Amazing view from the top of the hill and the rope journey was really awesome the price of the ticket was also moderate and it's a nice place for children's
Ok to visit once. Mainly for the view and an experience of cable car/ropeway if one has not experienced it,"This tourist attraction is way too expensive and i personally feel it is not worth the  bucks we spend. The entry ticket is definitely very nominal at 5/- per person. But the happy story ends just there. If you need to take the cable car the  price is 100/- per adult and 70/- for kid. The toy train at the top is 75/- per person (including kids) for non AC and for AC it is 110/-. This is definitely over-priced. The only plus point is the experience of the ropeway ride if one has not experienced it previously. Also, the view of Vizag from the top is good. Rest of the attractions are just ok. One can try the horse ride over there which is 50/- and reasonable. There are some food outlets but not reasonable either. You can get an instant photgraph clicked there. Opening time is 11 am. Take that into consideration while planning."
Kailasagiri- The hilltop Park,"Kailasagiri is a park located on a hill in Vizag. One can have a great view of the entire city from the top. It is till date the best tourist spot in Vizag, and was also honored for the same by the state government.One can enjoy the view of the city as well as the city by having a ride on the cable car of kailasagiri. It's really thrilling. The toy train also is a good experience as it let's you discover the best of the hill park and believe me  it's really worth the price. I hope everyone will like the place. It's too much tempting. Enjoy your offday if in Vizag."
Nice park,This is nice park constructed on the hill. There is a toy train which will take you on a round trip of the park. The experience is nice. But you have to wait for the schedule of the train. Overall it is good.
Good place to visit,You can reach this place using rope way and the experience and view on this rope way is amazing. You can have nice view of the sea fro rope way. There is a toy train which covers the entire park. The statues of Shiva and Parvati are huge and very beautiful.
Nice place,Yesterday we have visited Kailasa giri hill. Vizag view from the hill is very good. Especially from Titanic View point. Rope way journey is also good. children's park is also a big asset to this hill.  Shiva Parvathi Statue looks very nice.
Very neat and well maintained park,This is a must visit place when in Vizag and it is few minutes from the city. The park can be reached either by the ropeway or by cab that will take you to the main entrance. There are enough outlets selling food items and water around the park. Entire place can be seen by using the newly opened train service which even has an A/C compartment. The train fare is quiet reasonable and runs at frequent intervals.
Amazing views,"Amazing views from hill top, rope way to destination and train journey on top is just amazing and wonderful. 1 to 2pm is the break, so plan your visit accordingly."
Good view point in vizag,Kailasa giri hill has the best view of Visakhapatnam city. We can reach Kailasa giri by vehicle or by rope way (to and fro) We can view entire city and the beach bay feom here.  It looks so fabulous. If you are going with family kids will enjoy toy train ride in the hill. We can see Sri siva parvathi big statues here.  And the rope way journey is good. Titanic view point is nice
A wonderful tourism place,"One of the best tourism available in Visakhapatnam visual treat is available on the top of the hill have to go. have look at the sprawling town with magnificent sea and beach views from the top. one can reach the hill top by car/cab or the Ropeway from the base station. Food joints, mini train ride complement the Kailasagiri.Very beautiful hilltop view of Vizag city, sea front and RK beach. Beautiful statue of Lord Shiva and Parvati."
Tranquility and spiritual blessings,Excellent location with lush Green Lawns and garden and blissful atmosphere made us feel peaceful and spiritually blessed. Though ropeway was available but we preferred to drive up the hill. The road was just excellent
Amazing place,"I went twice to Kailasagiri to fully experience its extant Nd landscaped gardens and all its attractions ( once in evening for sunset views and beautifully lit up shiv-Parvati statue) and once during day time to appreciate its beautifully landscaped gardens ,toy train ,city and sea views and sculpture garden It’s quite near Vizag (just 15-20 mins) on a hill which offers Panaromic views of the cityLots of attractions both for children and adultsA must visit indeed"
A wonderful tourism place,One of the best tourism available in Visakhapatnam visual treat is available on the top of the hill have to go with family and friends
Places of Interest in Vizag,It is one of the choice for entertainment in Vizag on week ends with children and family members together.
Vizag visit,It was nice to visit this place as this is a one the best places of interest in Vizag and the view from the place was so nice. It reveals all the Vizag view.
Enjoy the Walk,Its a good idea to go up the Hill by  Ropeway and come down  by the steps to enjoy the shrubs and birds along the way. About 500 +steps to go down but enjoyable provided one is fit to do it.
Views from the Hilltop,"Kailasagiri , the iconic Mountain of Visakhapatnam  is a place to go up in the early evening and have look at the sprawling town with magnificent sea and beach views from the top. one can reach the hill top by car/cab or the  Ropeway from the base station. Food joints, mini train ride complement the Kailasagiri."
Nice place ,"Kailassagiri Park is on Kailassagiri Hill next to Lord Shiva Parvati statue. Ropway facilities are available to reach the hilltop. A toy train visit is also available to see the park there is a garden filled with variety of flowers. Lawns are to take rest.  Beautiful view of sea,  hills and Vizag city."
Hilltop view of Vizag,"Very beautiful hilltop view of Vizag city,  sea front and RK beach. Beautiful statue of Lord Shiva and Parvati."
Evening stroll,A hill top view of Vizag city is what amazes you from here. Most of the stunning beach roads photos you see 9f Vizag are from this point. The park has changed a lot in last few years. Too crowded. Earlier very few people used to come this place. Theres a cable cart ride but quite a ling que for it. A well maintained shiv parvati statue on top. Real amazing. For a change good place to visit. Good time will be in evenings.
A place must to visit for its views,"First I have to talk about the road from vizag city to kailasgiri hills,it is so scenic with sea shore view on one side of the road and lush green views on other side.once you reach the place,there is a cable car which takes us on the top.there on the top lord Shiva and parvathi statue is there and from the top one can see the good view of lush blue sea and vizag city"
Must visit,"Do not use road. Ropeway is faster and better view. This plae is huge. Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati statue. Big garden. Play area. AC train to take you around Kailashgiri.i. Tip: 1:00 PM to 02:00 PM is lunchtime. Therefore, Ropeway and train will not be operating that time."
Greenery mountain with Shiva temple and lot of entertainments.,Easily accessible from Vizaq city. 20 minutes travel. Rope car facility available to Top. 10 minute train to round the mountain with the cost of Rs.75 (Non-AC) & Rs.120 (AC). Must try. Small and powerful lingam (God) for blessings. Huge Statue for Shiva & Parvathi there. City view from this Giri is awesome.. Must visit in Vizaq.
Good tourist place,good place to hangout where we can see the entire visakhapatnam city and sea view.  Awesome view. There is rope way from Kaila said girl down to top and it was also very good and don't miss it.
Good view of city,The view of the city from the top of kailasgiri hill is very beautiful.The ropeway is reasonbly good to ride
Nice place,It is one of the peaceful place to visit in the city of visakhapatnam.The park is very well maintained
Nice place to visit,It is one of the must watch places to visit in the city of visakhapatanm.The idols are very beautiful.
Nice visit in a rainy day,3 days back we have visited Kailasa giri hill by bike in the evening time.  That day weather was very good and the Kailasa giri road way is nice. Its happy to roam in the hill at the rain fall.  A very good experience
A must visit for experiencing beauty,"We went there in an auto from our hotel in RK beach. The auto was reserved for the whole day, it all depends which mode of transport you prefer.We love airy rides, thus an auto.So the auto parked and we boarded the cable car (fare around Rs. 100 per head)The cable car will take you as per que and first come first serve basis, the same ticket will get you back to the starting point too.The journey in the cable car is beautiful over heading the beautiful blue water.on reaching the other point and crossing a park you will see the beautiful huge sculptures of Shiva and Parvati, its super white and pristine to look at.Close by is a view point too.As I am writing this, flashes are coming back. I have a full video on my experience  and all info.Youtube- Khushi NotOnlyMakeup"
You required to book a cab while going to kailash Giri becuse return to city will be a problem ,Great place to visit including a toy train it has a very good natural scenario top view is very good
Kailashgiri Visit,"The park is made aesthetically and is breath taking beautiful. The paranomic view is just awesome and lovely one can spend whole day there with children. Also there are good play pen, horse riding erc in the park too. But the toilet faciltybis not good at all it is not clean at the same time no water facility available there hence a mess. I feel there should be toilet atleast 2 more place2and should be maintained may be pay and use is not a problem."
Beautiful place and breathtaking views of the coast !,"Just about a 10 minutes drive from the RK beach. The place is accessible by car or taxis. I guess there are public transportation too, but we dint opt for it. The place itself is on a cliff / hill . You can reach the top by driving up or by stairs (quite a few actually...but do-able) or they run a cable car from the entrance at a basic pricing to and from the hill. Once you reach atop the hill, there is a huuuuge statue of Lord Shiva and Parvati...looks amazing when you reach there around sunset (as backdrop). And the other side gives a view of the Vizag coastline and the city view. Amazing !!! Many eateries have come up in the last few years..decent place to spend an hour or two in the evening or a pleasant morning:) Please inquire the timings and closed days before reaching the place. A must visit place !"
Excellent,"A must visit place, nice ambiance and a totally great look. A bit crowded in the evenings, but all in all worth the view."
Beautiful view,It is a beautiful park. Has circular train that takes you on a trip around the hill. Wonderful view is available. Ropeway is also available to go up and down.
Ropeway,Visit to enjoy the Ropeway @Rs.80 per head. A different experience. Nice view. Require atleast 3-4 hrs to enjoy completely
Kailash Giri at Rishi Konda - Visakhapatnam,Excellent view of the whole Vizag City from Kailash Giri Hill on top of the Rishikonda at Visakhapatnam- You can also visit thru' the ropeway available. Worth visiting at least once.
Very beautiful place in the vizag,Obviously very beautiful and visit leasure time in Vizag.lot of peoples passing their leasure time in the park. Obviously Excellent and  remarkable visit.
Breathtaking view of the Vizag city,"Took the cable car to go up to Kailashgiri. It was a nice ride with heavy rains rocking the cable car 😊. Once up, we took the train ride to see the entire park-visibility was a little poor due to heavy Rain but nevertheless enjoyed a lot. The location of the park is awesome and you get a birds eye view of the city. Definitely worth a visit."
"Normal Hill Top Park, No Spl. View from Toy Train","Kailasagiri Park, in my opinion, is more hyped than what it offers, esp. the toy train. The access to the park is by rope way as well as by road. Return ticket for the rope way is Rs.90 per adult and starts at 11AM. The rope way offers a good view of the sea and the city. Rope way operate between 11AM-1PM and 2PM-8PM. 1-2PM is lunch break.  There is a small amusement center in the park, a toy (glass) train and lot of flora/fauna. The park also has view points that offer bird's eye view of Vizag city and the sea. I found the Glass Toy Train waste of money and time. I was expecting it to go around the hill on the periphery and offer a good view from the hill. Though it goes around along the periphery, the view is very restricted. Most of the times it would be moving between walls and the view is of the garbage and litter. Only certain segment has sea/city view. You may go to the view points for the same without the train as well. It takes about 10-15 mins to complete a round. AC Coach costs Rs.110, non-AC is 75. Should you wish to take the train, I would recommend to take non-AC since it has open window for unobstructed view (whatever little it offers). Overall this is a good place for children, or when visiting in large groups. I was able to go around and come back in less than an hour, but if you are visiting as a family or with children, plan 2-3 hours. Beware of auto/taxi charging you a bomb for this place."
Must visit,This is must visit place at vizag. This park is situated on kailasgiri hill. There is a big Shiv Parvati idol in the middle of the park.
Must visit place,"Loved this place, and it's a must visit place at vizag. You can enjoy the sea view from top sitting on ropeway and toy train.nice and Clean hill park."
Must visit place,Awesome place and must visit place at vizag. There is a sitting Shiv Parvati big statue in the middle of the park .
Kailasa giri temple,Kailash giri is a temple situated in mountain top. There s a train which goes round the mountain to see the places. Also lord Shiva and Parvati situated on the top of the hill. There is also horse ride for the kids to go around. Photographs are taken along with Shiva and Parvati. There are good shops available.
Amazing view,"Amazing view A very high place for the area, clean site, good air, seeing the sea from the site, just go to get quiet and hike in the beautiful investor park"
Interesting place,Located on top of Kailasa hills in Vishakhapatnam it is Known for it's beauty and scenery. There is a Temple of lord Shiva. One can enjoy a toy train and ropeway ride to get a scenic view of the entire Vizag city. There is a Titanic point for photoshoots with the Bay of Bengal in the background. it is managed by Vishakhapatnam Urban Development Authority (VUDA).
Nice and relaxing place with great panoramic views of the city and the sea,Great place to wind down especially in the evening or during a weekend. This place offers great panoramic views of the city so a great spot for your photo-op. Views during the night with lights is a highlight.
Beautiful park on mountain top A++++++,Beautiful park on top of the mountain must visit for all.you will CRISP views of city and nice view of sea also
"Awesome views of Vizag,  beach and lord shiva","The views you will get from this hill is awesome it is a combination of city, Sea, Hills in a single view must visit for all"
Place to be at Vizag,"If by foot, it requires strong one. Rope way an option as view from top is good. Big statue will give feelings of daivik."
Awesome views of city beach and lord shiva,"It lies on the hilltop, accessible by car,scooty,ropeway. Views of the sea was breath taking. Majestic statue of lord Shiva and Parvati ji!!! There is one giant football as well for picture taking which is visible from a distance. Scooty parking cost Rs20/-. There is one  toytrain train as well which cost Rs75/- for a 20 minute ride across the kailashgiri hill, but we didn't find that ride worth spending. Other than that spectacular views, would definitely recommend.there are some local eateries too which were just ok."
place for god and eternal beauty,here u can enjoy with members of family the place is really awesome with the scenic beauty welcomming u open handed
Must visit place,"This is a must visit place in Vizag. On top of Kailasgiri mountains, its huge and well. Maintained. Ample parking options. Suggest to go there when the park opens up. Can take cable car as well. Took toy train to view the whole city landscape."
Nice place; interesting place for a walk,My colleague and I were brought to this park by the company we were visiting during a recent business trip to Vizag. As the only two westerners at the park at the time we were definitely apparent to all around but everyone was very friendly and happy to see us. Unfortunately the religious significance of the park was lost somewhat on us but the place is still a beautiful place to walk around and to get a great view of the surrounding city and countryside.
Awesome is less,It is a must vist place if visiting vizag. Clean visitor friendly also the panoramic views from the top of the hill is breathe taking. The only problem is the public toilet is just horrible so dirty that the mere sight of it gives jitters and thinking of using it is just out of question no water no one to clean. So if one visit the sight has to take care of natural call
Nice park,The park is well maintained.Can spend 3 to 4 hrs.Can go for the cable car ride.Thez also a train ride which gives the view of the entire park.There are some eateries and juice points though dont look very hygienic .
Beautiful,It's a beautiful place .It has huge statues of Shiv and Parvathi.Therz a garden and good for photography.One can spend 3 to 4 hrs here.

Excellent is always excellent...sometime we reach ... and sometime we teach..,"Dear Travellers,First of all I am very happy and thankful to all my travelers that they are giving there some moments of time to read and understand about the place, I really appreciate them for there precious time. Yes excellent is always excellent .. when I reached the place of kailasa giri  in VSKP..I found my self in a perfect place regarding the  Kailash Giri has a beautiful park, Giant Statues of Shiva & Parvati.Surrounding the statues is a beautiful Park with large dinosaurs, crocodiles etc on display for children. You can climb the park on a ropeway or walk up. We availed the ropeway and took us 89 rupees each. A must go location. The restaurants are also not that clean. But if you are planning to go with a group of people, excellent time pass location, with good city views.......Take time to understand the place... Beauty always reflects... in every condition...whether we accept or deny...@nasim"
Worth visiting being in Vizag!!,"This place is worth visiting if in Vizag.Parked the car in the parking area for the sake of enjoying the rope way experience.Had a lunch break there after reaching kailashGiri.There's a beautiful amusement park where different rides and fun spots available.Great Shiva and Parvati statue white in colour.Mesmerizing Scenic view of the sea as well as vizag city is amazing.Overall experience was a great, it's a fun package been there."
Fun Trip ,Went by road. Had a round of the place on the toy train. It was great fun. Returned back by the ropeway. Overall a very exciting trip.
Can be seen from Far,"The hill is crown of the city. Stretched more than 5 km, the top is flat. We climb from the far side and walked up to the park."
Offers good view of beach ,Park offers good view of surrounding hills and beach... Apart from that its just to stroll around... Keep expectations less.
Nice place to hangout ,Place is just to chill have to go without much expectations.. Nice views of city and beach.. Cable car is gud.. Train for people who can't walk but waste for one who can walk..
Beautiful park on mountain top,"Picture a 180-degree view of the white sand beach, dotted with palm and mango grooves on a warm breezy evening, as the rush of waves against the shore can be heard. Picture a quiet afternoon at the beach with family and children"
Amazing view of Vizag,Kailsasagiri is located around 26 km from Visakhapatnam. The best way to reach Kailasagiri is by road from Visakhapatnam.
"Nice Park at Kailashgiri, Vizag","There's a toll on the way to Kailashgiri park and hill. You reach there quickly. Parking space on the weekends seem inadequate, and vehicles are difficult to park in limited space on hilly terrain. There is a small rail-road track at the hill. You will find large and beautiful statues of Lord Shiv Ji and Parvati Ji in the park. The view from different sides of the park is decent. Quite a few eating joints are there inside the park. Enjoy !"
Nice place to hangout,Its a good place to visit with family. It gives a complete different view of the city as it is on the hill top. The train ride is another attraction. Children especially kids will love to play in the park.
Good place with an awesome view of the beach and city,This should be included in the list of places to visit and would be loved by all.GOODLovely view from top5-6 people can sit togetherThe entrance from bottom is located on the NHBADRide time (one way) is only 6-7 minutesTicket counter is poorly managedOne can go to the top and take a down ride (car charges is Rs 50/-)

Excellent view,The theme is certainly good with excellent view panorama.  Kids enjoyed the rope way.  Nice ly designed place but as with all other locations it is better maintainable.The upkeep is not so good.  The toy train I good fun for all. Good place for picnics.
Good Place to visit,But must go in winters. The place is good for kids-toy train and the rope-way add to attractions. Weekend get a bit too crowed. The drive up hill is also good
Beautiful viewpoint,"Visited this place on a Saturday evening. Fortunately, the timing of me reaching here coincided with the Toy train timing, so I didnt wait much for the train to start. It took us around the hill top & we could see the whole of Vizag from the train. The city was just getting lit and the sun was almost set, giving a beautiful view of the RK beach, the road, the city, the mountains and the nature. Worth a visit to this place once during the visit to Vizag city, takes hardly 2 hours of your time."
Highest View Point in VIZAG,"Nice place to visit in VIZAG. Full of nature and beautiful view of city. One can relax here and enjoy the toy train ride to have a beautiful view of the city.

Spectacular,"The place can be reached by car, cable car or steps. Very adventurous. Magnificient statues of Shiva and Parwati. A tourist train takes you around"
Amazing view,When in visakhapatnam you have to visit kailashgiri hill otherwise your trip wont be complete. The view of the city from one side of the hill and the view of the east coast from the other side of the hill is breathtaking. You can get up to the hill either by road or by the cable car service.Their is a park up their which would be enjoyed by children a lot.
Personal,Nice experience.Great Place.New addition is a toy train wit a/c coach.Good to see that the place is beautified with care.Overall great place
Used Ropeway to reach Kailasa Giri,"I have ropeway  for up and down and it's 90rs. It's very good and quick way to reach to the top. On top of hill, we have cricket game, bungee jump and lot others"
beautifull view of the beach,"this is a hill top it has joy train ride and horse ride for childrens and a play area, a place that has beautifull view points. we could spend some time and enjoy nature, it has also a cable car ride."
Good Hangout Spot,It is basically a hilltop park which has an Shiva-Parvati statue on top of it. This gives an amazing view of the city. It also has a small train inside the park which gives you a rouond of the whole park. Excellent place for kids
Spend your one evening here with leisure walk,"This place is on a height providing beautiful city views. The breeze here is so refreshing that one does not like to leave having spent a couple of hours here.The place is well maintained and offers everything one may ask for at a tourist place e.g. food, parks, amusements, view points, children play arena, picnic spots, shopping etc. You can reach the top by stairs (2500-3000 steps) or by rope way which is very affordable. View points are amazing and you get to see the city, mountains and beaches. The train ride is a special attraction. The idols of Shiva and Parvati are well lit in the evening for providing great pics provided you use flash of your camera skillfully. A good place for night photography for taking night lit city & beach pics."
Place to spend time for local people,This place is nothing interesting. Place is to spend time for local people not for tourist. Go if you want to do some photography from top of the hill.
Nice Sunset View,One can spend evenings here. sunset time is best.you can have view of entire ciy and it looks great when dark
Great view of the City of Visakhapatnam,"I visited Kailashgiri Hill in the month of April 2018 with my family. The hill can be accessed by a cable car service available to guests for a fee. Alternatively, guests could access the road with their vehicles to the entrance by paying Rs. 100/-  as Hill Charge per car.The mini train running at Kailash Giri provides a nice tourist attraction."
Great City View,I visited Kailashgiri Park in the month of April 2018 with my family. The park is located around the large statues of Lord Shiva and Parvati.

An ok place,"At first instance, i couldn't understand the geography. very confused planning of the tourist spot.we have enjoyed only one location which is before lord shiva, where we could take photograph."
Amazing hilltop,It's a nice hilltop. The view is just amazing from the top. There's big idol of shiva and parvati. Very beautiful. There are snacks available. Also there is ropeway available but only while returning.
visit for the panoramic views of vizag,nothing great inside. but the views of vizag are awesome. park is maintained well. but nothing much to do there. lot of food courts.
Nice Temple on the Hilll,"Nice place with a Toy Train running around the Hill to have a 360 degree view of the Visak CIty from the Hill.  There is a wax museum, child play area, Toy Train and Battery Operated Cars to spend some time around the hill.  A very nice place for family picnic."
"Good View, Visit for sure",Visit this place and get a 360 degree view of Vizag. Its a great view from top and you can chill out for a while doing nothing. Try taking the ropeway atleast for a one way journey
Repeat Visit,This was a repeat visit after a year. My two year old son had a good time with ropeway travel and toy train.
The hill called KAILASGIRI in Visakhapatnam,"This hill is projected into Bay of Bengal, giving beautiful view of Vizag beaches. There is a Ropeway and children train and a lot of small Restaurants. People can take beautiful photos from the tip of the hill, with beautiful coast line of Visakhapatbam, like TITANIC style. There are beautiful statues of Lord Siva and Parvati, Hindu God and Godess. This hill top can be reached by car, Bus or Ropeway. Even thiught it is a nice place, it is not being kept very clean. Ropeway seems to be not to the best conditions. If maintained well it can be better international tourist destination."
Full of enjoyment and good city views,"A must visit place, particularly with children, they can enjoy a lot here. Go in evening preferably. Best thing is to take ropeway. The boarding point for ropeway is about 4 km from submarine museum. It's 90 rs return ticket (to and fro) for ropeway ride which takes you 120 m elevation from the road. There is a grand statue of lord Shiva and Parvati in the center of park. Very good views of sea and the city from ropeway ride as well as the park. Park has many eateries and children can enjoy horse ride inside the park. There is a toy train ride of 20 min duration which covers the  circumference of park with awesome view of entire city. It's a must visit point in vizag city."
