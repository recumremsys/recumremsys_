"architecture is beautiful , but too crowded to experience the heritage",It was way too crowded to experience the heritage. this could have been manged properly by the  management. 
Time well spent,It's a perfect place to watch folk dance in Udaipur. It's located near lake pichola and easily accessible while walking. It has limited seating capacity so I would suggest you to stand early in line to grab a ticket so you can seat in front row to get a perfect view of dance.  It was a great show indeed…
Folk dance,Very entertaining and colourful dance show. Book your tickets 1 day prior. You can book online also.
Could not watch anything,"Could not park car in these congested narrow  by lanes , went round about for quite some time but everything went in vain. It seems that to encourage half day and full day tours, visit by private cars is discouraged. "
Traditional Folk dance,We went to see the folk dance here after hearing about it from several people. It is good value for money and you get to see some interesting styles of rajasthani dance. There are two people that provide the narrative in hindi and english. We bought our tickets after queuing for 30mins but you can book online for quicker entry. We had a good evening overall! …
Top priority in Udaipur tour,One huye show leaves you with good lifetime memories of Rajasthani folk dance. Culture. Puppet show is a treat to watch.. Full paisa vasool show. 
Interesting history,"Nice museum showing some of the rooms in which the royalty used to live. It is great to see how the Mewars passed their time, the decoration of the house, the display of their items...  Also it was fun to try one of the turbans as they use in Rajasthan 👳"
Must Visit,"Would recommend people to  1. Book show ticket online in order to avoid big queue. 2. 2 minutes walking from Jagdish temple 3. Reach show half an hr early to get comfortable seating 4. If you want to take pictures of the show, they take 150 rs  seperately."
Over hyped show,Approach is bad through a waterlogged entrance... have to wait in a long winding queue for the tickets a very slow and painful process and again in a long queue to enter the show because there are no ticket numbers . Finally is the whole effort worth it ...a big no ... total…
Cultural Show,"This museum is must visit place is udaipur. Also there is a cultural show in evening which starts at 7 . The tickets are available from 6p.m or you can buy online. The show consists of cultural dance and shows the tradition of Rajasthan. It shows ghoomar , Dance with pots on…"
Dharohar dance ,"Bagore ki haveli is famous for it's Dharohar dance performance by folk artists. The act is of complete 1 hour starting at sharp 7pm everyday. The act comprises of puppet acts, various dance forms of Rajasthan & great folk music. This haveli is next to Gangaur ghat near Jagdish…"
Glimpse of Rangeela Rajasthan through cultural show,"We went there to watch the show (dance and acts). The ticket costed Inrs 90 (for locals) and 150 (for foreigners); the show was 45 mins long. It comprised rajasthani folk dances, acts and songs reflecting local culture and traditions. The combination of colourful costumes, Folk…"
There are better places to visit,"This would have been a beautiful home but like so many, it has been let go. Now it is being refurbished but in my opinion they would do better to turn it into a beautiful boutique hotel."
Dharohar folk dance ,"Went to see the dance show here, and it was amazing, really great value for money. The dancing was great, the stories behind each were explained (in English and Hindi) and even included some puppets. We bought our tickets online, and good job we did as when we arrived at 18:15…"
Evening cultural dance and puppet show,"Don't miss the excellent traditional cultural dance show and puppet show in evening, 7 to 8pm.   Tickets start selling at 6.15pm.  It's very popular so you would need to queue up early and get seated. Well worth the wait."
Must see the folk dance show,"We saw the show on 11th Feb. Different regional dances of Rajasthan - Jori to Ghoomor,  Also there was outstanding Puppet shows. Folk drama. Everything was done so professionally that we felt that it is done in its authentic form.  We enjoyed every moment of the 1 hour show. We…"
The dance show was fantastic!,"Didn't get back to tour the museum itself.  But we were able to see the wonderful dance show on a Saturday night!  Tried to buy tickets early in the day, but box office didn't open until something like 6:15 before the 7:00 pm show!  We didn't expect the huge crush that there…"
Go for traditional show,"Visit during evening time to watch the cultural show, it is really good and worth visiting. Make sure you go on time since there are limited tickets available. Also there is an option to book the tickets online."
Restored Haveli,"After the City Palace, the Bagore Ki Haveli may seem like an anticlimax, but we must remember that while the former was the abode of kings, the latter was home to the prime minister. The haveli has been painstakingly restored. In fact, there's a room which shows the condition…"
Beautiful Haweli,Its similar to a museum which displays the culture of the rulers especially the mewar kingdom that time
Really promoting our heritage ,Udaipur beautiful  place in Rajasthan which is famous for mahal and jheel. Thos place is also known as jheelon la sheher. I went to BAGORE KI.HAWELI  to enjoy shoe but this place was really dirty  full of muddy water.Show was good but arrangements were not good for audiences. 
Nothing great,Some of the performances are good but the rest are okay. You need to book the ticket on advance else it gets too crowded at the counter n you may not get tickets. But its not worth the hype
Ok,It was ok. Show starts at 7pm and it was an hour show with different folk dances from different parts of the rajasthan.
Do not miss the culture show,"We were very keen to catch the cultural show here and queued up very well in advance to score the tickets. People start flicking around an hour before the show and you should also try to get here soon as the tickets and the seating are available on first come, first serve basis.…"
Ok,We have been here at 6.45 pm as they show @7.00 pm but today they have 1 more show @8.00 pm. So it is advisable to buy tickets little early. Nearby gangaur that is must spending place in evening.
The Cultural Program is a Must See,We had gone to see the cultural program at 6.30 pm since it is rated very high and it definitely did not disappoint. But we missed seeing the Haveli as such since the visiting hours for the Haveli closes at 5.30 pm. So if you want to see both then you must go before 5.30 pm.  
Nice,"We visited Agra,Jaipur,Udaipur,Delhi  with my family (wife and 2 kids) in Christmas 2019 holidays and so visited this attraction during our stay in Udaipur.  We did not visit the museum but went for musical night folk dance show in evening and it was very nice experience."
Excellent,Worth a visit. Across Rajasthan one of the best places to.visit. You should ensure that you reach by 6pm for tickets.
Bagore ki Haveli,Would rate this as the best thing in Udaipur and its best to book tickets online through the their website only. There are multiple sites who show up rates incl to n fro which is not needed. The cultural show is fabulous.
Nice rajastani musuem,"This haveli is on the bank of gangaur ghat and is at a walkable distance from Jagdish mandir.We need pay entry fee of 55rs to watch this musuem.This musuem had nice separate puppet musuem where we can see lot of puppets for sale.There are some olden days items,models and hand…"
Nice evening show with traditional dances,"We attended the dance show in the haveli  courtyard on New Year’s Eve and the place was full.  The dancers were very good, costumes are very good to take photos and the brief puppets show was fun. At the end they sell the puppets, if you like them. Definitely recommended "
Good dancing,Excellent dance show and a museum which is good value for money. Line up early to get the tickets otherwise you may have to go to the 2nd showing. Line up early to enter for best seats.
Must see the folk dance in the evening,This is a old haveli where kids adopted into the royal family were imparted training. It runs a very good folk dance programme in the evening. You will have to reach well before the show time to get your ticket.
Evening Cultural Show well worth it,We went in the evening to the Cultural Show and thoroughly enjoyed it. Our guide got us in there early and got us really good seats. It gets packed so best to arrive in good time. The show was really colourful and entertaining and the lady that danced with lots of pots on her…
Lovely experience of dharovar folk dance show,Must watch this show to experience folk dances of Rajasthan. Enriching experience. An hour show cost only 90 rupees.
Book early. Skip the queue,"The is must to-do thing when you visit Udaipur. Since I was there for 4 days, I stood in line on one day and bought the tickets for the next day lease knowing that the tickets are available online. Had I known this, I would have booked it online and skipped the long queue that…"

Baghore ki haveli: a confluence of Rajasthan folk lore,"If you have a little more than an hour of evening time to spare in udaipur, then don't miss "" Baghore ki haveli "" for anything else in the world. What to expect :  Show time 7 pm one hour duration only (all incklusive) 3 quick folk song and dance sequence. 2 interesting puppet…"
Dance show at bagore ki haveli,This place was beautifully lit and well organized. The long queue was worth it. The dance and drama artists were well supported by amazing live musicians. The pot with fire dance and the pot lady who danced with numerous pots well balanced on her head were the highlights of the…
Average point,"Located on the sides of Lake Pichola,it's an Museum with lots of ancient things like clothes, weapons, utensils etc. Can be covered in 30 mins. The place is partly under renovation."
Great show but pathetic entrance inside the premises,Amazing cultural show ....one hour well spent if not for the entrance ...that was filled with sewage water.  They could have easily cancelled shows instead of making us walk on makeshift ramps on the sewage water.
Pretty nice,Bagore ki Haveli is worth seeing especially regarding cheaper tickets that to the palace. Great evening shows everyday
"The museum is diverting, interesting and a little bit different.","The Bagore Ki Haveli is a former townhouse and royal residence that is now a museum focused on Rajasthani culture. A few of the rooms have been restored as they would’ve been used by the royals of Merwar with information about the rooms, functions and activities. Some of the…"
Excellent cultural evening show,"Museum is under renovation but the evening cultural show ""Dharohar"" starting at 7 pm and another at 8 pm is fabulous taking you to the cultural tour of rajsthan dances  and music. Duration 1 hour but fantastic and just 90 rs ticket worth for a show.  Must visit. Go early for…"
Lovely,The place is small but lovely. Make sure to visit the evening show. Tickets can(and should) be bought online as in the evening the line is crazy. Be ready to pay more as they charge something for online purchase. The guy at the counter has no idea about online tickets service. 
Good show but tickets are hard to get,Had to get the tickets the day before for the following day. Cheap entry and good way to spend the evening.Can get a bit cramped but get there early to chose your seat
Good collection.......But seems repetitive!,"The Bagore Ki Haveli Museum is one of the most adorable properties to visit in Udaipur. Located bang opposite Gangaur Ghat, this museum offers a great insight on Rajasthani culture and traditions. The puppet section is loved by kids. But sections like the one that shows Rajasthani marriage traditions is very repetitive with almost same statues featuring all over the section. Entrance tickets is Rs. 50 for adults and Rs. 25 for children. Mobile cameras are free to use while SLR and other such cameras are chargeable. And remember to click a few incredible snaps from top of the museum that offers great views of Pichola Lake."
Personalised Rajasthan Tour,"We went for the Rajasthani cultural dance.. it was fantastic.Pricing - reasonableCamera - cheap .. only INR100 I thinkShow duration - 1 hourShow content - music, dance, puppet dance, pot dance.."
Hidden gem,"A small courtyard where a cultural dance and puppet show is organised from 7-8pm. Limited, non assigned seating on first come basis means one should buy the tickets( around INR 100/-) well before time and be seated by1830.time well spent!"
Folk dance,It was just opposite to out hotel on the lake side. The folk dance happening here at 7 pm is must watch. You must get there by 6pm to make sure you get the tickets. They make sure to adjust everyone. The show was awesome. It goes for 1 hr
Amazing,Bagire ki haveli organizes cultural program rajasthani dance forms and kathputli dance every evening from 6-7. Do reach the haveli well in advance for the tickets
A restored haveli - now a museum,"Jan 1: We were here for the show a week back and this time, we came to visit the museum. This is infact a haveli that has been restored and converted into a museum. The hard work shows - whether it is the katputlis, paintings, glass work, art work. They have a huge collection of…"

Crowded in the evening,So we went to see the dance after knowing from some place. You have to buy tickets at around 6.45pm and show starts at around 8pm.
Dharohar Flok Dance Show at Bagor ki Haveli is awesome,Bagor ki Haveli is at walking distance from the City Palace.   The Dharohar Flok Dance Show at Bagor ki Haveli is awesome and it depicts the rich culture of Rajasthan. We loved the ambience and the seating arrangement.  The live show in the haveli of rajasthani folk dances…
Why you should NOT miss this Rajasthani Cultural hub!,We did not visit the museum but we attended a FANTASTIC evening cultural show. The show includes enormous information about the Rajasthani culture and presents the folk dance of all the regions of Rajasthan. The performance by artists were mindblowing.  Things to remember :  1.…
The performance is very good ,This is one of the most popular show in Udaipur and you shouldn't missed it if you are here.  The guy did the puppets show is a genius and he controls every movements and dance of the puppets effortlessly.   The ladies dancers are all very professional too especially one of the…
beautifully restored Haveli,This is worth a look see just for the building alone it is still being restored in places but it is a wonderful place to see what some of the buildings looked like prior to being rescued.  The turban display is actually very educational this is a language all of its own &…
Haveli is a must visit,Lovely haveli to visit. We had all the time to see it as we went in the early afternoon  Gets crowded in the evening before the cultural show for obvious reasons. Well restored haveli and worth the visit Book tickets for cultural visit ahead the previous day or earlier in the day
Amazing place!,This is one of the best places to visit in Udaipur and one can even experience the folk dance in the evening.
Disappointing Visit,We only visited the museum during the day and did not go to the evening show (which other reviewers rate highly).All credit for the restoration which has been undertaken to this building but I was left disappointed. More information around the displays or better still an audio guide would have made the visit better. The wedding display was good and a good way to learn about the various rituals that form part of a hindu wedding. Would I visit the museum again? No; Would I recommend it? Only if you have spare time.
Very awesome show.,"It was a refreshing experience,  all the dance they put through were awesome.After all days work it was quite a experience.  I dont know how they manage the expenses as the ticket was 100 rs only."
Must visit place in Udaipur,"Even if you have only option to visit one place in Udaipur, you must see the Cultural show at Bagore ki haveli. Should be on your 1st priority.The show is of one hour from 0700pm to 0800pm. Tickets booking starts from 0615pm. Be there by 0545pm to get good seats."
Beautiful local culture.,This place has lots of formalities but the place is cool. Very good architecture. Price was reasonable.
Rajasthani culture show,Very good show with reasonable rates. But sitting attachment is not proper. Very small place and stage for artist is very small. Over all show is worth watching.
Nice place,There was long que.but worth the wait.the  performance will stay in your for a long time a must visit of udaipur rrajsthan
An evening to cherish forever ,There was a long que. But worth the wait. The performance will stay in your heart for a long time.A must visit of Udaipur.

Must visit if you love tradition,"One of the best attractions of Udaipur. If you are interested in knowing the culture, tradition and the art of Rajasthan, do visit Bagore ki Haveli and enjoy the dance performance in the evening hours. The ticket is priced at Rs 90 for adults currently. Dance performance was a…"
Average Museum,"There is not much to explore in the museum. There were no guides when we went to heritage either, so we couldn't learn much about the culture or history. It's close to City Palace, so you can pay it a visit if you have time in hand but not a necessary visit. Hope this helped."
Great experience,"Do not miss this little treasure! Much smaller in scale than City Palace and quiet, too! No crowds At all on a Sunday morning. The first few rooms including the puppet museum will involve the hard sell to buy souvenirs. Nice prices though. They are currently doing more…"
Just waste your time ,"Not maintained at all.... Everywhere is bad smell, garbage... I don't know why is tourist spot... Not recommend at all... Pls don't go just waste your time... "
Beautiful cultural heritage,This is a must visit place in udaipur. Near to Ganagaur ghat of lake pichhola . At evening there is a cultural program from 7 to 8 everyday cost ₹90/- pp. Worth to see this. 6 folk dance and 3 puppet show. One has to take tickets from the counter at 6:15 pm . First come first…
Evening show is a must visit!,"Tickets open at 6.15 in the evening everyday, do not miss this show. You will get to experience the culture of all parts of Rajasthan through their dances, songs and puppet shows. The artists are very good in their respective fields. Be prepared to wait for a long time for the tickets during the weekends."
"Nice architecture, interesting displays","Enjoyed our short visit, especially the (life-sized) displays with traditional wedding sceneries. Also enjoyed some of the views on to the lake from upstairs, where we also found a number of people selling various (home-made) crafts / gifts."
Tired looking,"Situated on the edge of Lake Pichola and so with wonderful views. The haveli was very tired looking and in need of some tlc, as were the museum rooms, including turbans (the world's largest), a puppet room, costumes, etc, but many of the 130+ rooms are not accessible to visitors. We didn't see the cultural show, but perhaps that would have been the better option."
Amateur Folk drama in a dilapidated ruin,"Some amateur artist (except the Puppet Show artist) try to showcase the Rajasthani folk culture in a dilapidated Haveli. The audience is crammed into a small open space, made to sit on filthy cushions. Ticket price is Rs.90. Show is one hour (7pm to 8pm) Try reaching by 6.15pm to avoid a long queue. I'm surprised to that the municipal administration has permitted such a dangerous place to be operational, no fire safety or evacuation system. Wheelchair people to please check for access."
Super Experience,"The place is famous for its heritage show.One must visit the museum tooLocation is close to lake, so better to go early enjoy lake view and then have visit to museum and watch show 7 to 8 and then go back home Lanes are small so auto is preferred mode to travel Show is a mesmerising experience to have They perform Rajsthani folk dances."
Beautiful Heritage. ,"The visit was quite short to the place. It was old haveli converted to Museum and art performance. Evening art was missed but the museum is worth a visit. The terrace shows wonderful view of Pichhola lake and I like the most is puppet museum. Do take your camera with you, you…"

Nice folk show,First day in Udaipur we went to the Indian folk show in the Bagore ki Haveli museum. All I can say is go! If you want to see how India looked like or get a taste of Indian culture. I would surely recommend.
Nice for a  change ,I enjoyed the foke dance n music. Great view out side of the lake too. It starts from 7 pm to 8 pm. It is better to book seats early you might have less chance to get same time tickets as they have fix numbers of seats.

Dharohar- Heritage,"Bagore ki Haveli's main attraction is Dharohar Folk Dance Show. An evening dedicated to the folk dances of Rajasthan, which is sure to enthrall you and leave you spellbound. It is a salute to the culture and heritage of the state and does so in a smashing manner. A very rustic…"
A nice evening  out,The queue starts early for this. So arrive before 6:15 when the counter opens. The seating consists of benches and mats on the floor. The dancers were very well rehearsed. 
Culture Defined,A good showcase of the Rajasthani culture. Tickets can be booked online (refer to my pictures for details). Advised to come early to get front row seats (on the mattress) they are the best. 
Catch the show,The haveli is quite small as compared to the city palace and probably will take not more than half an hour. The show is from 7 to 8 pm. Ticket sales start at 6.15. Ideal time to reach here is 5 pm. See the haveli till 5.30 when it closes and then wait for the show ticket sales…
Good cultural show but....,"Inside the museum, there should be a proper sitting arrangement. Difficult to sit for whole 1 hour without proper seats. "

Not a 'must' see,"Bagore ki Haveli isn't worth going out of your way for. A room full of puppets and stuffed elephants, another displaying dusty turbans, rooms enacting a typical wedding. The area around especially the ghat is a 'must' see. As is the evening 'cultural' show which begins at 7 p.m."

A great evening of entertainment ,"I really enjoyed the display of Rajasthani culture and dancing offered at Bagore Ji Haveli. With descriptions in both Hindi and English, visitors from far and wide could enjoy the experience.  The dancing was especially impressive!  I was not (due to personal reasons) a fan of…"
A Potential Death Trap. Beware.,"The evening show is a Fire and Safety Hazard - visit at your own peril.  Bagore Ki Haveli is a museum located in an 18th century building on the bank of Lake Pichola in Udaipur. It's multiple halls contain art, artifacts, and everyday articles from the lives of the Rajput…"
Waste of money ,TripAdvisor has been disappointing me lately.  This is another example of why.  I’m not sure why this museum rates so highly.  People must be have low standards or are culturally illiterate.  The museum itself is a dump and waste of time.  I did not bother with the show.  
Beautiful evening back in time,"We went for the show, first of all it's very reasonably priced 90 rupees, don't go with online booking they charge you a bomb.  Show is set up on the first floor in a courtyard with a old neem tree. It was quite mesmerizing to just sit under the neem tree and soak in the…"
Amzing experience,It was really amzing experience. The show was almost 1 hour . And they show different typesof rajaysthni dance. And also show puppet show in this. Overall worth watching. 
Must visit spot for cultural program,"Bagore ki haveli is located near gangaur ghat which is few kms away from City Palace. Don't even think to take your car there as roads are narrower, steep and crowdy with local peoples and two wheelers. Instead park your car for free near lake pichola and hire a auto.  At…"
Interesting to see the dances of the area,"The dancers were very good and the costumes were colourful, and the music good. There was also puppets and a 72 year old woman balancing pots on her head. It is worth a visit, but if you go try and get there at 6 (it starts at 7) as it gets very busy and you will end up sitting…"
Interesting place,"This is a typical residence of the minor nobility of Rajasthan, which has been converted into a museum.  What is not to be missed is the evening programme of traditional dance and puppetry.  The show lasts a little over an hour and is very popular, with a limit of about 200…"

Hertiage with Traditional Folk Dance,Excellent place to relax in the evening with traditional Rajasthan folk dance. Very popular with Western tourist and get crowded quickly with people looking for places. Finale performance was the best by Old lady balancing the layers of pots on her head at 70 plus age.
An old haveli turned into a museum,"The place is definitely worth a visit if you have interest in art, culture, music, dance, architecture etc. The haveli is still being restored and there are many things in museum like various kinds of headwear, musical instruments, old utensils, a room full of handmade puppets,a hall displaying various wedding ceremonies of Rajasthani wedding. Museum closes at 5 in the evening. There's a nominal fee for museum and there's a one hour folk dance show in evening 7 to 8 and then 8 to 9.

Wonderful ,We reached a bit late & the show had already started. To our amazement we found the theatre to be almost full. It doesn't have any a.c. so it was hot inside. Apart from this discomfort there is nothing else to complain about. The puppet show & the dance performance was…
Wonderful introduction to Rajastani history,"I had no idea what to expect when I opted to attend this show other than it was recommended by the guesthouse that we stayed at. I was pleasantly surprised by the visual storytelling of the Rajastani culture - we were entertained with music, dance and so much more.  It is an…"
Total waste of time,"If you have ever been to any street performance or watched any busker, you will find this a boring performance.  Half of the performers didn’t dance. Costumes are great, the 5 minute balancing act at the end was good, but apart from that, you’ll sit there bored."
Enchanting place,Bagore ki haveli has a show at night where all the flavours of Rajasthan are in abundance. It's packed most days so get the ticket in advance.  There is a 72 yr old dancer in the troupe and she is just fantastic. She is poetry in motion. It's magical and has to be experienced to…

Bagore ki haveli beside Pichola is another important spot in Udaipur which tourists shouldnt miss. Monday its closed.,Bagore Ki Haveli has a museum and there is a dance show from 7-8 PM every day except Monday. Tourists can visit the museum and then enjoy the dance show beside lake Pichola.
Folkloric dance show,"Wow... It's at night (around 19:00 to 20:00) so if you have nothing else to do, it is the occasion to see some traditional clothes.  Apart from this, avoid the show. I have never seen people so negligent, I mean some didn't dance at all just moving a bit the shoulders.  We…"
Nyc place to visit,It is a very nice place to visit especially in the evening.. a must watch show in the evening for people of all age including children.
I loved this place,The music and dance cultural show was excellent. And the next day we went back to see the museum. The building is fun to explore and we loved seeing the room with all the puppets!
Yet another haveli,It's a lovely haveli although i have seen better ones. The cultural programme is lovely. They fill up the place to the brim and in summers it becomes difficult to sit tightly packed for an hour or so.
Superb!,I went to the evening show and it was absolutely brilliant and unlike anything i've ever seen before. The atmosphere was wonderful and it was great to experience another culture's entertainment and heritage. My favourite part was the puppet show and the when the ladies danced…
Double whammy ,"The museum is quiet and totally unvisited...  I know so  much more about turbans now.  The living quarters of a noble family in a restored palace. When you visit in the day buy your ticket for the evening performance of gorgeous Rajasthani dance,  music, puppetry and then at…"
Musical Attraction ,Many people. A few dances. Traditional dresses. Nice puppets. Ok. You must arrive early to buy and get a good seat. 
Excellent Haveli,"Must visit a place, situated on the lakefront view of Lake Pichola, one of the most picturesque places of Udaipur."
Folk dance and puppet show,"One of the “must go” places of udaipur. They showed 4-5 exceptionally very good folk dances of Rajasthan. Puppet show was also good. Its a one hour show, from 7-8 pm in winters. Have to reach atleast an hour before to get tickets and grab good seats for the show. Photography allowed only after payment for cameras. Overall a nice place to end up your day.."
A quaint museum in a beautiful haveli,"The museum this haveli hauses does provide visitors  a quick glance of Rajasthani culture.  But the display, the explanation, the direction-line and even the custodial are far away from the caliber of a world class museum.  Having said that, the architecture of this haveli by itself is worth a visit.  It is a drastic change from the bustling old city outside during my visit as the first visitor on that morning.  Get your camera ready.   You can take many beautiful shots in the many courtyards and toward the lake."
Cultural extravaganza,"Bagore-ki-haveli is next to the Gan-gaur ghat.One must reach by 6.15pm to get an appropriate seat as its on first-cum basis.You have to pay 150/- for camera(even mobile) if you wish to click pics/vdos.Even if you dont pay but click,they keep a watch & ask you to pay.The program includes different art forms of Rajasthan.The star of the show was a 72 yr old lady who performed in maximum dances & steals the show with her last performance.A must -see show.90/- pp for Indians."
Good dance show,Great folk dances every evening from 7 to 8 pm. To see the Rajasthani authentic music and dance show.A must see for everyone visiting Rajasthan for the first time.
Lovely setting ,With 100 rooms to go through this is a very interesting building  From the rooftop there are wonderful views. The puppet room has dozens of different types and sizes. The royal wedding section helps foreigners understand the process of an Indian wedding 
Delapidated,Delapidated building 100 rupees entrance fee.A fee nice things to see. Worth a quick look if you are in the area

a run down place with very narrow approach in the middle of city ---book tickets in advance,"as the board claims, this was built by the PM of the state of udaipur. the haveli( big house) is in the middle of a living city ( part of old city) ...has very narrow roads, with small shops on both side of the road, almost no parking facility, haveli in depilated condition ....…"

Bagore ki haveli stood out like a mini palace with ambiemce that will take you back in time. The puppet ""darbar"" was is something to be seen and quite click worthy. IN the evening rajasthani cultural…"
A small Temple,Just a short walk from the Palace this Temple has some intricate carvings. Small by Indian standards but still an interesting site to visit.  Steep steps up from the street means access is somewhat restricted.

Dhrohar show- classical rajasthani dances and puppet show,"I had seen this type of rajashthani dance shows in jodhpur and Jaipur,but this was best among all. One hour show takes you on a journey of whole rajasthan culture. Need to reach there by 6:00 o clock to get ticket for 7 o clock show.  "
Mr n Mrs,"Good presentation once inside but terrible service to purchase tickets and would not accept entrance voucher issued by suppliers. Had to purchase tickets again and nobody at venue are polite or understanding , THE WORST CUSTOMER Service"

the Venice of India,Known as the Venice of India this place is very beautiful. A lot less hustle and bustle than Jaipur there are lots of great narrow streets to expolre with shops offering all sorts of trinkets. There are many good restaurants overlooking the lake and many small boats offering…
Nice place to visit,This is good as you get to experience local folk dance plus lovely puppet show..but the standing in a queue is little bit more while you are with kids or old aged it gets uncomfortable..
Potential fire and stampede risk,Beware !! Super bad management of people no lines senior citizens and children made to wait in line for 30 plus minutes. Only 1 entry and exit gate. If a fire breaks out many will end up dying in the stampede for sure. Be careful. Nothing against the artisans but management is…
Interesting cultural program,The cultural program is really good and worth watching. Ticket counter starts at 6:15. But reach before 6 pm as there is a huge line during peak season. There is nothing much else there. Place could be better maintained
Folk Dance show and Museum,Very impressive folk dance. Must watch if you are in Udaipur. The museum is also worth watching.  Must buy ticket in advance.
Cultural show a must-see,The evening folk show is really a colourful spectacle. And a good piece of showmanship. Highly recommend going.
Cultural treat to experience dances and acts from all over Rajasthan,"This show runs every evening. In peak season come earlier in the queue as there are only 250 seats inside. The show includes various dance and act forms from various parts and tribes of Rajasthan. The sitting is inside an old Haveli, some chairs, some steps and some mattresses.…"
Must visit,I'm writing this for the artists..specially the 72 yes old woman who performed some ofthe folk dances from different parts of rajasthan..don't miss the opportunity to witness the rich cultural heritage of our country..but was disappointed by the staff who were rude..had reserved…

JOHNSON DSOUZA,"Had a wonderful time, the show is amazing with cultural dance show from rajastan,the puppet show and end up with a great finale"

Great show,"We went in with the assumption that this will be another of those boring ""musical fountain"" equivalents. But, we were proved so wrong, the show is fantastic and should not be missed at any cost. The traditional performances, music, compering (both in Hindi & English) make it a…"
Leela jaise koi nahi,"This is the place where the car comes and takes Leela away and ranveer tries to swim across and stop it. You are not ranveer, dont try it. but do visit. Beautiful views all around"
A must visitin Udaipur,"We got bit late to watch the show, and was worried if show was really worth ,  But I assure you it's a must visit when you are in udaipur, lovely cultural show and you get to know about rich culture of Udaipur(Rajasthan). It is advisable to reach on time and occupy front seat so…"
Revealing the Rajasthani Folk Dances in the Folk way.,"When the ticket for Dance Show in Bagore Ki Haveli in Udaipur received through the transporter, we thought of a big theater like the ones in Thailand. The tiring walk of more than a km from the parking lot through the busy lanes of the city, however, killed our desire. Till the…"
Cultural show at the Haveli is amazing,"Please do not miss the cultural show at Bagore ki Haveli.  The Best is at the end of the show.

Evening cultural show is a MUST,All of the dance presentations are introduced very well by the show comperes/ MCs / hosts in English and Hindi . The show finale gets a well deserved stand up ovation.  You should be there well before time to get a good place to sit and view the show.   The only point I felt bad…
Beautiful Dolls,The doll collection is great to see. Colorful vibrant. It has entrance tickets. Do visit during evening hours for puppet show. 
Great cultural show,"We went to Baghore Ki Haveli twice. Once in the morning and again in the evening for the dharohar dance show. In the morning, we visited the museum. There was one room filled with puppets. The museum has lot of stuff of yesteryears and how the rulers used to live. For the…"
Must Visit Show....DAROHARA..!!!,"If your are visiting Udaipur,make it sure to witness the beautiful n amazing DAROHARA DANCE SHOW.  The DAROHARA Dance show and puppet show was worth watching..... the show made our day COMPLETE....The performance of 72Year Old Mother will make you Dump....."
Good cultural program in evening,This one is recommended for sure. We liked the dance enactments and the puppet show in the evening. The couple who manages it are doing a great job. One of the dancers almost 72 yrs old is highly appreciable.

Got there for the show (7-8pm) around 620pm which was good guidance as it was already very busy. Got a seat down the front and waited for the show.. I paid for the use of my camera phone as I'd read that…

Traditional doesn’t always mean good. ,Can’t fault the show as such. Traditional and with prelude descriptions of every dance. That said it wasn’t particularly entertaining except for the 74year old lady who you have to take your hat off to for her stacked pots act.  Bit of ‘camera’ police where you have to pay extra…
Good place,"Meusium opened until 5:30 PM, tickets sold until 5 PM, we reached at 5:02 but couldn't get the tickets.puppet show starts from 7 to 8. Tickets sold from 6:15."
