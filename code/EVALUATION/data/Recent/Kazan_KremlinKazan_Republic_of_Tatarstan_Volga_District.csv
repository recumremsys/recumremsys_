Iconic location and attraction,"This is not one building but an enclave containing a mosque, church, museums,  cafe, market stalls etc. It occupies a commanding spot overlooking the river confluence high on the hill. We visited more than once to enjoy the views."
You have to visit this place!,"What can i say? Just go and explore this place. So beautiful! Does not matter wether you are a small or big group, it is convenient for everyone!"
WOW!!!,Simply - a must do. Spend many hours over several days visiting all the attractions within these kremlim walls.
Beautiful setting ,Very well kept. Impressive. Muslim and Christians getting together. Rich in history. Excellent view over Kazan
Worthwhile the visit!,"The Kazan Kremlin is a combination of religion, culture and ancient history. Great view on the city and the Wolga."
A beautiful historical centre,"There are many beautiful buildings and museums in the kremlin, including the well-known mosque, the church or the leaning tower. I especially recommend the Tatarstan Museum of Natural History. There are many exhibitions as well. Next to the mosque, you can usually buy handmade gifts if you want to. Inside the kremlin you can find perfect spots to see the city and the Kazanka river. If you are in Kazan, you can't miss the kremlin. :)"
Must visit,Very beautiful sight . Nice place to visit with family and friends. And also very beautiful for pictures
A must see,I had the privilege of living in Kazan for almost a year. I visited the Kazan Kremlin many times and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I highly recommend taking a few hours and enjoying the atmosphere and taking in the history.
Lovely chance to experience traditional architecture,"Though the ""summers day"" was chilly wet and windy this was a lovely opportunity to get up close and personal with a most beautiful building.  The grounds are very well kept and the building are amazing.  The colour of the rooftops was breathtaking.  We spent a few hours wandering through the main shopping area of Kazan, meandered up to the Kremlin and spent a lot more time wandering.   Allow 2 or 3 hours if you want to immerse yourself in the Kremlin.  It can be visited in less time but you will not get the best from it.  I loved our visit."
Great buildings inside !,"Didn't expect that there are more great buildings inside the compound of Kazan Kremlin (let me call it a ""Castle"").I kind of walked around the Kul Sharif Mosque and the nearby on my first day but decided to return after I found out that there are lot more attractions included inside the Castle.The tatarstan president's residence is inside and so are the Hermitage Museum, the National History of Tatarstan Museum and the Annunication Cathedral.Too much to see in just one day. So, I suggest more than a day be alloted for this castle alone."
Amazing!,"""Kremlin"" means ""fortress"" and that means that there are kremlins in various Russian cities. This is one is amazing with beautiful blue mosque and Orthodox church as well as other interesting buildings. It has a great view over the Volga river and part of the city. A beautiful wrought iron gate includes pagan symbols evoking the very rich history of this region and the fact that people of many different religions live at peace with each other in this well-off academic city and capital of Tartarstan."
Highlight of visit to Kazan,"The main attraction of visiting Kazan, the site is quite large, there is an Orthodox Church and the Mosque"
"Old, beautiful","Old and amazing. Just to walk around the Kremlin itself is free, and most of what there is to see there is free as well. They have local artisans who set up booths as well, so you can get some really neat souvenirs that aren‚Äôt ‚Äútouristy.‚Äù I recommend seeing the Qul Sharif Mosque and Orthodox Church while there. If you're in Kazan you just can't miss this."
Beautiful,Access is easy and free. The whole area and city actually are exceptionally clean. People are friendly and helpful even if sometimes there is a language barrier. The kremlin is beautiful. Worth a visit!
Main attraction in the city,This is the main attraction to the city. It is well connected. Pretty much in the centre. Don't miss it.
Kazan Kremlin,"The most serene place in Russia. We went early morning to see the Kazan Kremlin. There was absolutely no one, though it was a bit chilly, Awesome and must visit for every traveller travelling to Russia"
A very beautiful place!,"Highly recommend to visit in Kazan! A place where different religions coexist in the neighborhood with each other. Very beautiful, you need to see it."
Unmissable!,"Many people prefer the Kremlin in Kazan to the one in Moscow.  If you see both, you can perhaps understand the sentiment.  The interior of the Kazan Kremlin is probably more photogenic than the one in Moscow!  A great place for photo buffs and history buffs. Several towers, the huge (and very beautiful) mosque, the Anunciation Cathedral, and several grand buildings.  You can easily spend a half day here.  We were on a group tour, so we had an excellent guide, who explained the main features.  However, we were on a tight schedule, we had a budget of just about two hours, barely enough to get a good general idea!  I strongly recommend at least three hours.  Another strong recommendation: please get a guide or go on a conducted tour.  The place is simply too huge and too complicated to properly understand, if you simply go on your own. The mosque alone is worth more than an hour!"
Amazing a place,When you come to Kazan you must see this beautifulüòçüíì place... It's a amazing a place... We love it...
The Kazan Kremlin is one of the most beautiful I‚Äôve seen so far. More impressive than Moscow Kreml. On top of that not ,The Kazan Kremlin is one of the most beautiful I‚Äôve seen so far. More impressive than Moscow Kreml. On top of that not as touristic than in Moscow either.Simply love Kazan in general - can only recommend this beautiful city.
"Amazing place, picture perfect","It's a must visit place if you are somewhere near Kazan. Worth all your time spent.  Kazan has a beautiful walking street towards Kremelin which is exact replica of Arbat Street of Moscow. The Kremelin has beautiful architectural marvels like church and mosque in same compound.  Also,  an amazing skyline view of the Kazan city across the river.  There is a museum inside the Kremlin."
A nice Kremlin with a nice mosque and cathedral ,The Kazan Kremlin is a nice place to visit. The mosque and cathedral were both rebuilt since being demolished by the communists and are worth a visit. The view from the walls over the town is lovely
Take a tour guide,"I highly recommend to take a tour guide for your visit (approximately costs 15 EUR per group, not per person!). The tour lasts for 1.5h.We have visited Kremlin, the Mosque, Church. Tickets to museums are paid separately."
Kremlin,Must visit this place Kazan kremlin  very beautiful architecture nice view highly recommended all age group
Fabulous complex,"Constructed as a fortress, there are several buildings to discover and appreciate. I could be kind of unfair with my selection, but the buildings I liked the most were the Qol Shariff Mosque and the Annunciation Cathedral; they look awesome from every point of view, and their interior are pretty nice. For R$100 I accessed the mosque museum; it is a small room with several articles, maybe written documents the most of it; it would be helpful to have signs in English to get a better understanding of things. Next to the Annunciation Cathedral there is a nice garden, and in the middle of it, a monument dedicated to the architects of the Kremlin is found. There are other buildings that look great, and have different purposes, like the Governor‚Äôs House, the Syuyumbike tower, and so. There are also some squares or small plazas that look nice, too. The view of the city from some points of the fortress is magnificent. I visited the Museum of Weapons Spirit of the Warrior, it was small, just one room exhibiting mainly ancient weapons (X-XII centuries??) like swords and spears; I kind of liked the little figurines illustrating the tartar warriors on their horses; the admission ticket costed R$250 which seemed high to me. The surrounding area of the fortress is nice: buildings, a garden and a river embankment. At night, the towers look very nice with their lights on."
Beautiful and Well Kept,"Easy, pleasant visit with several sites and museums.Walk around or you can spend the day there. Highly njoyable!"
Multiculturalism the way it should be,"Equality is the key word, its on display at the Kremlin. There is no minority with more rights than a majority to create tension. There is no pushing of one's values and beliefs onto another, and then terrorising them if they have a differing point of view. No they have a church and a mosque side by side as a symbol of unity.It's a beautiful place the Kremlin, its as if you have entered a time warp that has sent you back in time. The architecture and stories behind the buildings makes you day dream of what it must have been like. Kazan was our first stop on our trip, and the media back home had nothing but bad things to say. This city and especially the Kremlin shows that maybe we are the ones who need to have deep look at ourselves and the way in which we define equality and unity."
Very nice and interesting place,"Of course , if you go to Kazan for tourism it‚Äôs obviously for visiting the kremlin. It‚Äôs a wide and interesting place . The only thing I can add after you read hundred of comments , it ‚Äò that the museums is on renovation and outside wall are covered"
Nice Kremlin ,Take your walking shoes. It a great place to take pictures and enjoy the views of Kazan. The Kremlin is like no other I have seen alike. You don‚Äôt need a tour guide but good to do your homework what you will be seeing.
Beautiful !,Walking around these area is amazing. The view of the city is breath taking. Take confortable shoes because from here you can walk everywhere.  Take your camera and be ready to take some great pictures.
Have to see,"If you saw the Moscow Kremlin you must compare it with Kaza≈Ñ Kremlin, In my opinion White Kaza≈Ñ Kremlin is worth to visit."
Wonderful Place,"It is a place where you will see different types of buildings like Mosques, Churches, Museums, palaces, ...etc. You can know more about Tatar through the museum. Anyway you have to visit this place and Kazan city in general. I loved it very much"
White Kremlin,"Referred to as white Kremlin Lots of historical places all in one surrounding That has got to be quite a unique setting of anywhere in the world! A highlight of KazanMosque, churches in close proximity and the unity in religion across Russia was astonishing did not expect that üòäLoved Kazan üíù"
A must visit,"A huge place, with many historical buildings. From mosque, church, and museum. A good visit, don't skip this nice place when you visiting Kazan"
beuatiful,"very pretty, not crowded and just seems untouched by tourists. Walk around in the day and by the evening lights."
Must ! ,Kazan is one of my favorites cities in russian and the kazan kremlin is a place to go for sure! Its beautiful
Most Noteworthy Sight in Kazan,"This is the best sight we have been to in the last 2-1/2 weeks and can see why it is a World Heritage Site.  It is a complex that has half a dozen museums, the mosque, church, gardens, walls, government buildings, etc.  Although we did not get a tour guide, which are available where you enter, I would recommend one because clearly there is much to learn about this place."
White Kremlin ,"When you come in Kazan , first must do is Kazan Kremlin or White Kremlin. Entrance is free to entry for everyone."
Stunning location for beautiful Kremlin,"Kazan is an old city , a center of aTartars.  This heritage imbues it‚Äôs art, architecture and buildings inside the walls.  I was enchanted by the beauty of the mosque and we privileged to watch initial wedding preparations. Form many points inside the walls one can look over the river- with boats and people enjoying the day. Off the ‚Äúbeaten track‚Äù for TSR voyagers and worth the bypass."
As a working Kremlin....,"there are quite a few structures-buildings not for public visit. Signage needs to be improved in my opinion. A lot has been said here, a lot very accurate. It is very apparent the Kazan population is proud of the history & heritage of their region. We did learn a lot about it in the museums. But we had to read a lot to get there. I can sit down on the internet and get the info. It would help if the information could be delivered in a more visual manner. I don‚Äôt care to go to a beautiful location and have to focus on a large amount of text to know what I‚Äôm visiting. We did not visit every museum as it was such a beautiful September day, we didn‚Äôt want to be inside reading. Still a must do in Kazan."
"White fortress, blending of cultures","The Kazan Kremlin (yes it has its own Kremlin!), is of a breathtaking whiteness, and is the only surviving Tartar fortress in Russia, with parts of it dating back to the 10th Century. It has several towers, and both a mosque and a cathedral within.There is also a tower that used to lean but no longer oes, since being shored up. A beautiful place to visit. And the mosque is itterly magnificent. As are the views over the river. I fell on love with Kazan!"
amazing,"you have to visit the Kremlin if you are staying in kazan, the view is of the river easy to walk to from bauman st"
Must-see feature of Kazan,"If you are spending more than a few hours in Kazan, there's no excuse for not visiting its Kremlin. It is key to understanding the history of Tatarstan and offers memorable architecture, art, and a terrific small natural history museum which kids will love."
Nice,"It's really nice place where you are going to find a lot of information and history, the problem is that you have to pay a lot in every single building that you visit but not all of them worth it."
Spectacular!,"Kazan is known as the sports capitol of Russia, but visitors need to take a day away from the games and visit the Kremlin. It is a combination of Christian and Islam sites.The mosque is soooo beautiful with its soaring minarets and a stunning chandelier hanging from the dome inside. The church on the side of the garden is older but noteworthy as well. Behind the church, there is a great view of the city featuring the unusual, new agricultural building in the foreground. To walk the Kazan Kremlin comfortable shoes are recommended."
need to visit Kazan Kremlin,Need to visit Kazan Kremlin you will found both Mosque and Cathedral at night you must take photo of Kremlin.
So worth the visit,"Not as crowded as Moscow, beautifully kept grounds; you can climb the stairs and shoot arrows and get a great view."
Interesting to walk around,Well worth taking a walk around if you're in Kazan. Only need half an hour for a self guided look around.
"Beautiful Place to visit,1-2 hours, great surrounding location too..","The Kazan Kremlin is open to all, however if you are not covered 'modestly' (i.e shorts, sleeveless tops for women etc) then they will provide you with a small down. Once you get inside, there is a array of history to view, including a viewing deck of the prayer area, a small shop (which is decently priced) and a museum, which has an entrance fee. If you are looking to purchase goods/ornaments, i would suggest findings the signs for the Museum inside the Kremlin and you will see a small shop,these are cheaper then the two at the first entrance (as enter the building).Outside, there history, nice walks around the kremlin, tours and at times live music.Well worth a visit for a few hours."
"Beautiful city, so much to enjoy.","Family visit with Russian in-laws, visited and explored the Kremlin and the city and surrounding area for 2 days. Church and mosque sat happily side by side, both exquisite designs. The city itself has bars and restaurants in bucket loads. The whole experience was mainly wonderful. The one thing that will always get in the way all over Russia seems to be the huge guided tours ran by despot guides intent on their own self importance so we never got to actually appreciate the inside of the Kremlin mosque. M"
Kazan's all in one!,"That's the dream of any tourist, in just one place you have a little bit of everything just few meters away of each other: museums, a church, a mosque, public buildings, palaces, a tower, a great viewpoint at the far end of the entrance and the walls wrapping things up.I got in in some of the buildings like the mosque, the church and the art gallery, it was worth it. Just be prepared to be unable to understand things as signs may not come with their translation in English, especially the museum in the church's basement."
Tartar culture,"A beautiful city, the third largest in Russia. Steeped in tartar culture. Beautifully layed out. A must to also visit the old settlement. Highlight is the Qul Sharif mosque. Stunning architecture."
Beautiful mix of Russian and Tatar culture and religions,"Kazan Kremlin - unique mix of religions and cultures.Initially it was the capital of Kazan khan, with tatars living inside of it.1554  it was conquered by Russian Tsar  Ivan Grozny,  he made several attempts and spent more than a year to win the Kazan.Now on the territory  of Kazan Kremlin  there are orthodox churches as well as Qul Shariff mosque - making the unique blend of different cultures and religions."
Wonderful ,Don‚Äôt miss it. Very interesting place to know some of Kazan‚Äôs history. You will find a mosque besides a cathedral. Nice views of the town.
A quick but thorough excursion to see the highlights of Kazan's vast and long history.,"Kazan's +1000 year history has been very well preserved in the main, and a trip through Kazan's Kremlin is a great place to start one's appreciation of the city. In the company of a very knowledgeable and well-spoken guide we (a small group of us attending the FIFA World Cup) had a very good tour through this striking landmark. The blend of great architecture, the mix of Muslim and Russian Orthodox places of worship, and the parks along the Volga river which bisect the city makes this an easy place to be and from the Kremlin one can see the postcard perfect views of the city below.  This is not just a single tour of old buildings, but within the Kremlin there are tours within tours, including the famous Mosque, the original city walls and the original wooden buildings. Everyone was welcome inside the mosque, and for those (many) football fans, men and women alike not suitably attired, they were well prepared with suitable wraps so anybody could enter. From the Kremlin the tour didn't stop: names, places and people so often heard of, came alive as we toured beyond the Kremlin walls; Katherine the Great, Ivan the Terrible, the academy where Lenin was educated, the many statues and parks dedicated to Russia's greatest poets, musicians and performers, made this tour an absolute pleasure, and I was disappointed when the tour was declared over. There are many beautiful parks and avenues that make Kazan a wonderful city. Having had mix reports about Russians being rude and unfriendly I could not been more surprised by the welcoming smiles across the city. English is a barrier, as most speak no English at all, but somehow we always managed to get the directions needed, the menu order right, and naturally we were blown away by the efforts made by the city for the World Cup 'invasion' Well done Kazan, a return is certainly planned."
The most attractive landmarm,"Kremlin and the mosque are nestled in the heart of Kazan city. They can be seen more miles away. The beautiful architect of the mosque making it a distiguishing and mesmerizing spot. I would say Kazan as a city is all about those two sites, the Kremlin and the mosque. I would highly recommend to visit those two sites at day and night times as you will have different views and perspectives of the places."
Stunning,"I don't know where to even start. How to encapsulate such a magnificent site in a few paragraphs?Kazan Kremlin is a jewel, utterly fantastic and completely deserving of its UNESCO World Heritage Site status.The whole area needs a few days. The Suyumbike Tower is majestic, the Kul Sharif Mosque jaw dropping and the Ascension Cathedral is enchanting. It has so many little parks and gardens and tremendous viewing points over the city and Volga River.The Presidential Palace is sumptuous and the Hermitage Museum is full of treasures. It's free to enter and Is advise you to go as often as you can during your stay in Kazan. However, it is well worth doing the tour. It costs 1500 group rate departing from the white tower at the entrance wgen there has assembled a group of 15.Make sure to walk along the walls for unparalled views and along the Kazan Kremlin embankment which runs from the walls along the river where there are lots of cafes and great views.A true wonder, an anazing place."
the Main Thing,"This is what you come for, and it is wonderfully worthwhile.  There is a 17th-century church noticeably by the same architect of Ivan the Terrible's who built St. Basil's on Red Square Moscow.  There is a splendid 21st-century mosque, justly famous."
Great Place to explore,"The Kremlin has a lot to offer. Several churches, several very interesting museums, great views of the city, the mosque and the palace. You can go on the wall and one tower where there is another amazing view."
One of the must see place in Kazan,During the world cup we visited this place as it situated very near to the Kazan arena stadium. One of definitely like it as it depicts the very traditional Kazan.
A Jewel that‚Äôs it !,Beautifully restored and kept it dominates the Kazanka river. Full of excellent museums a cathedral and a mosk included. Excellent promenade around with remarkable views.
Pretty disappointing for a UNESCO site,"The walls and view of the Kremlin as you approach it are interesting. Inside there are some small museums, some state buildings and very few coffee shops. No terraces or restaurants. The usual mosque and church you find everywhere. The best is the view of the river."
Great day tour of Kazan,"I spent several hours touring the central district of Kazan.  My private guide Mila Yumatova, was recommended by the local tourist information center.  Mila spoke excellent English and really knew a lot about the history and culture of Kazan.  We visited the Kazan Kremlin, Bauman Street, Kul Sharif Mosque, Annuciation Church, Suyumbike Tower, and Kazan Federal University.  Kazan recently celebrated their 1000 year anniversary and it was very interesting to learn about the history and culture with Mila.  I highly recommend the use of a private guide to make a visit to Kazan more rewarding.  Mila was great."
Open air museum ,Must to visit and touch to old Tatarstan. Some property is closed for visitors. Very clean and friendly staff.
Beautiful place :),You can spend here many hours walking. The mosque is the most beautiful I have ever seen.There is a museum of the history of Tatarstan. If you don't speak russian go just at the second floor. :)
Kazan Kremlin,"Situated in the downtown Kazan, easily accessible by metro and busses. A must visit while in the area."
Top tips for English speaking visitors to the Kazan Kremlin. ,"I visited, and thoroughly enjoyed, the Kazan Kremlin this week.  As most of the signage isn't in English, and the Russian guidebooks don't cover Kazan in detail, here are my top tips. If you find this helpful, please let me know!1. The walled enclosure of the Kremlin is open 24/7, so you can get great photos of the buildings lit up at night. The Kremlin is free to enter, and there is an entry fee for many of the museums and exhibits.2. There is an audio guide for the Kremlin - essentially a walking tour around the outside of the buildings. It costs 250R and you have to leave some ID as a deposit. I got an audio guide, and didn't find it very useful, as I couldn't identify the buildings which were being talked about. I stopped using it very quickly. 3. If you're into history, it might be worth getting a day pass for the museums. For 700R this gives you access to 7 museums, including the Mosque, the Hermitage and the Natural History museum.  I thought it was worth it. It doesn't cover the Museum of the Patriotic War - but that was only 80R extra - about ‚Ç¨1. 4. There are official tour guides at the gate, who are very helpful. Unlike in other countries, these are Govt employees and will not try and hustle you into taking a tour. If you do want a guided tour it will cost 1500R - and the guide will take up to 10 people for that. I was on my own, but if I had been with a group I would have used a tour guide. 5. My main frustration was that I couldn't find the entrance to the museums. I entered various likely looking doors where I was escorted back out again! There is one entrance to the Natural History Museum, Hermitage, and Museum of the Patriotic. To find it go straight forward from the gate, passing the M√©nage Exhibition centre, and it should be the second door on the low 3 storey building on your left. 6. The Natural History Museum is over two floors, and the stairs to the upper level are easily missed. I returned to the entrance early and the ticket lady brought me back through the ground floor and showed me the stairs. Ground floor is mainly geology / mining / cosmology information. The upper floor was much more interesting to me, with some incredible fossil remains and reconstructions. There was a lot of interactive stuff for kids. No English signage, so worth getting an audio guide. 7. The Museum of the Patriotic War is spread across 4/5 rooms and is worth checking out. You will find it as you exit the NaturalHistory museum on the First floor (2nd floor if you're from the US). It's a quite traditional Museum layout of display cases. No English signage or information but it's fairly self-explanatory. 8. The Hermitage is up on the top floor. As other people have mentioned, it's a rotating exhibit, so it may be a gamble if it appeals to you or not.  When I visited there was a display of exquisite pottery / porcelain. There was no English signage so I don't know what I was looking at, but it was beautiful. 9. The Mosque has been covered in detail in other reviews with helpful tips, so I won't repeat them - just to say, it's a fabulous building!10. My final point is just to say that everybody I met in Kazan was friendly, helpful and full of good humour. Many times they went out of their way to guide me places. (I came here via Istanbul and while that happened there also, it always happened to be via a carpet shop!). It would be great if they could improve their English language information before the World  Cup, but even if they don't, the hospitality will ensure fans enjoy themselves!"
So much to do and see in the centre of the city!,"Each visit to Kazan brings me to its Kremlin, which unlike Moscow's is open to walk about in without a ticket. There are some good museums inside (the National Gallery is a favourite), shops with Tatar handicrafts, and some nice views of the Volga River."
Must visit!,"There are few places where you can visit a cathedral and mosque in the same square. The history, the varied architecture are unique. You can spend hours, or do a quick walk-through in one hour. Do consider a trained guide who will enhance the experience for you."
It's a must,"Having made it to Kazan, it woudl be a pitty to miss one of the great things this city has to offer. It is very nice, and definitely very worth a visit."
Must see in Kazan,"The place is amazing, full of vibrant history and symbols of cohabitation between two different cultures. Everything is very well preserved .The place is quiet , not two many tourists, and this makes the experience more deep"
A must see in Kazan,If you visit Kazan you just have to visit the Kremlin.  It is very easy to get to from Bauman  street. You can walk into the Kremlin and see the whole site which contains a few great buildings.
Very Impressive,This is a great site in Kazan.  We went there our first day on our vacation.  We got a guide from the tourist center at the front gate.  She was very friendly and informative.  It's a beautiful location filled with history.
Must see.,"Went as part of three country tour, so seen a lot of buildings prior to this, but well worth it. It wasnt very busy when we were there, which was great. Fantastic views and great history."
Very interesting fort to visit,It is a place full of Tartar history. Kremlin walls are well preserved. Of particular interest is the mosque and church side by side. Very nice views from kremlin.
Not so little Kremlin in Kazan,"Thanks to our personal guide we had a wonderful visit at Kazan Kremlin.  In comparaison with the Moscow Kremlin the Kazan Kremlin is less impressive, although a selection has to be made among the many items.  Not easy without the assistance of a specialist."
Views,Whilst the Kremlin in nice to see and as good in its own way as moscow the outstanding thing is the view of the city.
Very good place ,"It's very interesting very beautiful and clean, nice weather, once you are in kazan you must visit, amazing panoramic view"
One of my favourite city centres,"I love Kazan Kremlin for its history and cosiness. Many attractions in the city centres are crowded and touristy, but Kazan Kremlin one is really beautiful and great for relaxing walks. You will enjoy the architecture and the marriage of cultures in this wonderful place."
It's a cracking little Kremlin,Well it's not little by any standard other than comparison to the immense Moscow Kremlin.The mixture of architecture is varied which makes this a beautiful place to visit.Great place to go.
Must visit if visiting Kazan,"Probably the second must visit place in the city (no. 1 being the Mosque), not nearly as large as the Moscow Kremlin, but very nice to walk around and visit just as well."
Fabulous place..,"... just to wander around, taking in the sites and absorbing the history. It is a UNESCO site, and deservedly so. The museum's and galleries are themselves fascinating and it would take a couple of days or more to really take everything in. There's no charge for entering the grounds and I'd really recommend that you at least have a wander around, especially in the evening when its a bit quieter."
The Heart and Soul of Kazan; a UNESCO World Heritage Site,"I was impressed by the pristine white wall of the Kremlin which ran around the entire complex and by the Towers of the Kremlin.  It gives out that middle ages vibe. the complex itself is immense, very clean and well maintained. just walking around it is a treat itself. I love that this Kremlin has something for everything. there's the Qol≈ü√§rif Mosque, the Annunciation cathedral for Christianity and the Soyembika Tower for the tatar heritage. You can enter the Mosque. Lots of good photo opportunitiesTake the Kazan Metro and get off the Kazan Kremlin station. it is right there."
A must see,"The Kremlin of Kazan is a spot you can't miss if you are in the city, there's a Mosque a Christian Orthodox Church and a view point that is amazing from where you can see the palace of agriculture and the river."
One of place have to visit in Kazan ,Nice place to visit if you are in Kazan it will be intrested for the children to know about history.
A Large Kremlin,Every old and larger city in Russia has a Kremlin of some sort. This is a large and diverse one well worth seeing. This is a mixture of many centuries and religions represented.
Very Interesting and beautiful,"I would highly recommend a visit to the Kremlin.  Not as crowded as Moscow but very interesting.  The exhibit at the Hermitage was well worth the cost.  The WWII museum was also interesting, though no one spoke English and the exhibits were not in English either.  Still worthwhile."
Beautiful Mosque and Nice Surroundings,"My partner and I visited the outside of the mosque on a Sunday, which just so happened to be the day that Mexico played Portugal in futbol. However, even though we visited around 3:00 PM, there were not many people around the Kremlin, so it felt as if we had it to ourselves, which made for some excellent pictures! (see attached). The surrounding area is quite lovely as well, as there are some vendors selling souvenirs. Having come from South America before Europe, I appreciate that the vendors don't yell out to you or come across as pushy.After visiting the Mosque, I highly recommend taking a stroll along the Kremlin Embankment. We spent half a day there because there are so many delightful surprises along the way, such as life-size games (chess, twister, battleship) and you can rent rollerblades or bikes! It's wonderful on a sunny day."
This is where you start your tour of Kazan,"The Kremlin is where it all started. This was the former fortress of the khan of Kazan, conquered by Ivan the terrible in the 16th century and rebuilt as a traditional Russian Kremlin with an orthodox cathedral replacing the former mosque. The Kremlin today contains a museum of Tatarstan's history, a beautiful art museum with local and Russian painters (especially good collection of Kazan born painter Fishen, a real discovery for lovers of Russian turn of the century-painting) and a museum of Tatar Islam. With a modern mosque built inside the Kremlin the site now reflects the dual Tatar/Russian character and history of Kazan. The mosque itself is worth visiting as a example of modern gulf state style bling, but not especially interesting otherwise. The Kremlin has no good cafes or restaurants. Be sure to eat and drink before coming here."
Impressive complex,"The Kremlin is the main attraction of the city. You should start your tour at the 1st of may square. You enter the Kremlin through a beautiful gate.The whole building is surrounded by a massive wall that can be visited at some points. There are many beautiful buildings, churches and the hugest mosque of Russia.Many of them can be visited.Please note that many museums are closed on Monday."
The Peace mix with the cultures,Kazan Kremlin free to visit the great history and culture the mosque & churches next to each other .The Kazan Kremlin mix of the Peace with the beauty of the cultures .
Impressive complex,"The Kazan Kremlin is a mix of different cultures and history blended together along the Volga. The main attractions are the opening gate, the orthodox cathedral, the Tatar museum, and, of course, the Qul Sharif Mosque. It's worth spending a few hours wandering the grounds to see and appreciate each of these attractions."
Nice historical place,"Free to visit, great historical architecture,  nice views,  open till night, churches and museums,  Volga river, President palace"
Interesting and very well preserved complex,Very nicely preserved and maintained historic complex. The mosque and churches are interesting to visit and it's possible to spend hours wondering around in the complex. I would recommend checking out the nearby Ministry of Land(etc.) which is housed in a spectacular building to the east of Kremlin.
Must see,First sitysight of thw region. Welcome to have your mind about wonderful Kazan. Better to visit in summer
A great place,"Simply worth visiting even a few times, Not everywhere you get to visit a mosque and a church and see the great history in one place"
"Beautiful place, too much to say, must-see.","Very beautiful mosque, nice place to buy different national souvenirs. A lot of exhibitions, Gorgeous Kremlin's walls. Sweet Tatars!"
Peace between Islam and Christianity,"The kremlin of Kazan is pretty impressive. Right outside the Kremlin is the Musa Jalil Statue, honoring the legendary Tatar. Inside the Kremlin, there is the Kul Sharif Mosque and the Anunciation Cathedral (Ru: –ë–ª–∞–≥–æ–≤–µ—â–µ–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π –°–æ–±–æ—Ä), which shows the unique and impressive mix of cultures and religions between the Muslims and Christians."
qolsarif mosque,The place was so big!I got to listen to people talk about there culture! Most of the people were sweet and respectful.
Guided tour,"On a business trip so had limited time for the tour, but our English speaking guide was understanding and very knowledgeable about which highlights we should see. Definitely worth visiting, lots of history and more accessible, less official and Military than Moscow kremlin. I will definitely return for a more in depth tour and look around."
great and you can feel power of this place,Amazing to see 2 different religions to have church and mosque next to each other. Greta feeling and very nice view over the city. You can walk around for free or buy a tour.
Bene!,"So romantic place for walking! Lights, buildings gave me feeling of old century atmosphere. You are gentleman, take your lady with you"
Nice little Kremlin,"The place is rather small but concentrates a few beautiful building, the most spectacular being the Kul Sharif mosquee. It is not a very large area, it connects the central Bauman street to the river, where you can have access the docks and come by the building of the ministry of agriculture which is beautiful, with a lord-of-the-rings-tree-like in its center!"
Signature of Kazan City,"The architecture complex of Kazan Kremlin forms major attraction of the city and signature city skyline. Kremlin accommodates dozens of museums every of which worth of visiting. Kremlin is a house to the residence of the President of Tatarstan. Two major spiritual complexes are located inside the walls of the Kremlin - Annunciation Temple and Kul Sharif Mosque. Each of them requires special visit and time. Kremlin is housing national galleries also. It would be better idea to book visit with the guide as every building inside Kremlin is living history and guide can tell story of each place starting from the main gate Spasskaya Tower with the clock. If you plan to visit all expositions it would probably take at least one whole day or probably few days complete visit. Sumer time is probably the best time to visit. We visited Kremlin in winter so the access to the castle walls was restricted. Kremlin walls offer fantastic view over the city. Definitely this is a must see place in Kazan which requires special dedicated day. Access to Kremlin is free to public, however, museums and expositions might require small entry fees."
Must seen as soon you are in Kazan.,"Kazan Kremlin is a Unesco World heritage place in the very heart of the Kazan.You don't need to buy any tickets to walk inside the area, but you need them to visit some museums or order a guide service. Some crafts made of stone, wood, metal and leather can be purchased here. There are some cafes and restaurants. Enjoy old historic buildings, and a nice view of Kazan city and Kazanka river."
Great architecronic place,Great buildings and great views over the city and river Kazanka!!! A must visit for everybody visiting Kazan!
Kazan Kremlin was off great historical and cultural interest,"Very interesting with the mosque, cathedral, museums, art gallery and presidents palace. Excellent views over the Volga river too,"
Main attraction,This is main tourist attraction in Kazan. But you need to hire a guide to learn more about history and religion of this aincient place. Without guide you will have just beatifull photos only.
History place,Kazan Kremlin the most important place of this city. Goverment place as well. Good view to the Kazan river
Amazing history and architecture,Despite being minus 17 degrees we totally enjoyed our walk around the buildings inside the Kremlin. Everything was free and the architecture incredible.
The best Kremlin!,This is an amazing place that you cannot miss. I liked it better than the one in Moscow. It's free to visit and it's mosque is one of the best I've ever saw.
Impressive ,"Visible from far away, the Kremlin with its unique skyline is a landmark you can't miss. Walking up from the city side, you enter through its ancient gates. From there you can choose several routes,  passing the mosque, church, president house and numerous other old buildings. When visiting the city you should not miss this impressive location with lots of history and thick walls which protected this area for ages."
Third capital of Russia,"Kazan, this city, that some people call third capital of Russia, probably because of the historical roots, nation's independent role, world connections after USSR breakdown and growing population, has changed a lot since 1995-1999 period, when the author of this story had a chance to see it in person, and still keep hanging after 2005, when it celebrated its milenium.Not everybody knows about existence of its ""own Kremlin,"" just like those, that all the Russia's medieval""Golden Ring towns"" have, and which  was declared a World Heritage Site in 2000.In 2015, Kazan was visited by 2.1 million tourists, which is a 20% increase in comparison with 2014. The Kazan Kremlin was visited by 1.5 million tourists in 2015, but there is still some room to squeeze in. Among those built after 2000, that this author therefore did not have a chance to see at all, but which are certainly ""must go and see exhibits are: a single-line Metro, opened on 27 August 2005, the Millennium Bridge, a cable-stayed bridge that spans Kazanka River and has the shape of its M-like pylon, popular recreation area opened in 2005 - Millennium Park, located in midtown along lake ""Kaban"" which literally stands for ""boar,"" new 2009 ""Kazan cat"" monument at the intersection of downtown streets Baumana and Musi Dzhalilya, 2010 luxury ""Farmers' Palace"", 2008 ""Sponsor  monument"" to commemorate a honored city citizen, 2013 family center ""Kazan"" for bridal ceremonies, 2006 center of philosophy named under Heydar Aliyev, 2016 ""Plumber"" monument to commemorate World Skills Russia international championship, 2005 fountain on street Petersburgskaya - a city present from St.Petersburg Putin-era authorities, 2005 Pushkin bronze monument, that replaced  old plaster one of 1956, 2005 Monument of Bulgarian Cool Gali (1183‚Äî1236), 2003 monument of Kazan Kremlin builders, that depicts 2 of those, Russian and Tatar, 2005 Qol Sharif one of the largest mosques in Russia and in Europe outside Istanbul, 2005 museum-memorial of Second World war, 2009 church of saint Kirill Archireiski, 2004 church of Sergius of Radonezh and many others, some of them are placed inside Kazan Kremlin, while others are posted outside it."
particularly nice Kremlin,"Particularly nice Kremlin in Kazan, in the capital of the Republic of Tatarstan. And the city of Kazan interesting and very beautiful."
Amazing Kremlin (Fortress),"Loved the Kazan Kremlin (Fortress), in parts had an almost late medieval feel to it.  Very well preserved with amazing views over the city and the Volga river.  Can easily spend 2-3 hours exploring the complex, the Mosque was especially nice."
Well preserved,"Most interesting atraction in Kazan. Nice for walking, excelent view to the city and interesting church and mosque."
One of the best Kremlin in Russia,"Unlike the kremlin in Moscow or Novgorod, Kazan Kremlin is predominantly white. It is located at the high area, so that you can see Kazan city from the Kremlin. There is no entrance fee. The complex is quite huge, so take your time when visiting Kremlin. There are many attractions in the complex. There are few cafes inside."
Beautifully restored buildings with amazing views,The guide books seriously downplay the beauty and history of this place; it's absolutely stunning and well laid out too.
Awesome Unesco World Heritage Site!,"This is an outstanding Architecture Ensemble to visit in Kazan. Unesco World Heritage Site, and totally deserving. Well preserved, and well restored. Cathedral, towers, mosques, churches, museums: it is all there. A must to visit!"
Brilliant city!,"So much to see in Kazan!  Kremlin,  The Mosque,  Kazan Arena home of Rubin Kazan Football Team,  local Tatarstan Restaurant Dom Chaya,  the Cauldrun,  The River Volga,  Millenium Bridge etc. Spent three weeks as Volunteer at World Championship Swimming,  Diving,  Waterpolo July August 2015 and would love to visit again."
"Must visit, when in Kazan","Really beautifull place is Kremlin and Kul Sharif Musc inside of it, It is picturable views from here to Volga River. It is really good idea to see  also Blagoveshchensky cathedral that was built in 1562.  Must visit!"
best they have,"Nothing like a Moscow kremlin, plus they local big boss sits inside this structure, so about a third of the area is not available. Watch out, there is very little shade, and no public restrooms that i could find here."
must visit while in Russia,must visit KAZAN & Kazan Kremlin while you are in Russia . It is a very beautiful city where you would want to come back. Thank you Kazan for hospitality. I would definitely come back there soon.
City tour,"A beautiful Kremlin that's free to enter and with visiting both in the day and at night. There is a small charge of 50 rubbles to go to the top of the tower, which is well worth it for the views"
Great nice to visit,"I liked there very much.Historical, spacious, interesting to see. May be a little hot during the day, especially in summer.Nice souvenir shops.No body speaks English there!"
Nice place for one-two hour visit,Very nice place to visit historical buildings and buy some souvenirs. Nice view from the wall but not much to see.
Leaves you breathless - visit both in daylight and at night,"It took us about 2 hours to go around with an audio guide that was almost useless. The audio guide is long (18 stops almost 4-6 minutes audio for each) and not very coherent. You really need to fish for useful information though it does add to the experience if you don't know much about it.There are two toilets to visit, thus that should be no problem, drinks are also served in some spots to escape the heat.Perfect photo stop to take a picture of the other side of the river: behind the Annunciation Cathedral and if you go up along the walls, you can pay 50 rubels to go up in a wooden constructed tower to get the best view over the Kul Sharif Mosque.Though we could not, it must be worthwhile to return at night for a view of it!"
Cremlin,"Nice place to visit. Everytime I got to Kazan, I always visit this place. Huge and beautiful mosque, interesting historical museum. Nice view to the river. Art musueum don't impress me at all."
Very interesting,"A most interesting place to visit, so unlike other places I visited in Russia.  The very modern mosque is fascinating just for the fact that it is there, but also great views around of the city."
I am a visiting professor at Kazan University and will spend one month here. ,"It was a delight to see the coexistence and tolerance on display in the beautiful site. Photographing at night is the best I found a piece of smooth marble to rest my camera on in the courtyard, that is how I achieved the perfect reflection. The streets are safe and spotlessly clean I walked for hours at night with never an incident."
Beautiful Kremlin,"Great Kremlin to walk around, free admission. Very nice architecture and spotless square. Make a point of visiting the Mosque and other sites around."
Must see when in Kazan.,Must see when in Kazan. Take your time to stroll around and enter the churches and the mosque. The church has very nice painting of many holy men.
White beauty,"The Kazan Kremlin includes many old buildings, the oldest of which is the Annunciation Cathedral (1554-62), the only 16th-century Russian church to have six piers and five apses. Like many of Kazan's buildings of the period, it is constructed of local pale sandstone rather than of brick. The renowned Pskov architects Postnik Yakovlev and Ivan Shirjay (called Barma) were invited by the Tzar to rebuild Kazan Kremlin in stone. The cathedral bell tower was erected in five tiers at the urging of Ivan the Terrible and was scored to resemble the Ivan the Great Belltower in Moscow, but was pulled down by the Soviets in 1930.  The most conspicuous landmark of the Kazan Kremlin is the leaning S√∂yembik√§ Tower.It is an ideal place for a business trip and a simple friend walk. The view from it is just amazing!"
Beautiful! ,"The Kremlin in Kazan, Russia is very beautiful and something you don't want to miss on your visit. It's very old snd beautifil place for a walk and learn the history of Kazan."
Great promenade ,Some amazing views open up from above once you enter the Kazan Kremnlin. Everything inside is fascinating and the fusion of Christianity and Islam is at its best in the Kremlin and generally all over Kazan.
Very nice to walk around,"Situated at the top of the hill. As you approach the Kremlin you see the white walls in the distance, which look superb. There are plenty of attractions inside the walls such as the Mosque and some museums. Unfortunately it was raining whilst we were here, so we didn't spend as much time as we'd have liked."
White Kremlin housing beautiful mosque and impressive cathedral,Kremlin complex overlooking the confluence of the mighty Volga and Kazanka rivers. Feel the great diversity of the huge blue domed mosque and the magnificent cathedral (worth visiting inside) situated next to each other. The beautiful gardens add to the grandeur.
Historical ensemble of highest quality and mix of cultures,"The must of Kazan, the heart of Kazan, the symbol of Kazan. Plan one full day for exploration of many churches and beautiful view points to the city."
Must see,If you are in Kazan then this is the place to visit as it will provide you with a glimpse in the past of Kazan.  The government houses its offices there too.
Diversity at its Best,"Those who have spent some time in Russia and have visited cities other than just Moscow and St. Petersburg realize that Kremlins are a common fixture. Kazan's Kremlin, other than being completely renovated and immaculate, is unique inasmuch as it encloses edifices of many religions, Muslim mosques and churches of many denominations, existing side by side in peace and harmony. In addition, museums and galleries, the Tartarstan Presidential palace and wonderful views of Kazanka River provide more than enough to occupy one's time. Strolling down Bauman Street, a pedestrian road leading to the Kremlin, is filled with hotels, restaurants, bars, shops, more churches and fountains and provides a wonderful relief from the traffic of this small but bustling city.All in all, a fine way to see the heart of Kazan's popular sights."
Great views of city,"The impressive walled Kremlin in Kazan provides wonderful views over the city, contained both the Kul Sharif Mosque and Orthodox Church."
Cultural centre of Kazan,"Kazan's Kremlin is probably the city's best tourist attraction. The mosque is fascinating and well worth a visit, though it is relatively new within the selection of buildings here. The cathedral is absolutely beautiful with fabulous art - particularly the east end. There are several museums within the Kremlin - we visited the Natural history museum which was astonishingly good, containing remarkable artefacts! We were only in Kazan for three days but found ourselves drawn back here each day to see more."
Must visit,This is one of the most important cultural places to visit while in Kazan. Do not miss it as there are museums and cultural treasures here.
Very impressive!,"Kazan Kremlin is actually a place which you must visit to. At the entrance there is a tour agency where you can take a guided tour. Price is not crucial, 500 rub./person. We were group of 2 people, so we paid 1000 rub. for 2 hours excursion around all territory of Kremlin plus visiting the Mosque and ancient orthodox cathedral. Of course, you can go to see all these places on your own for free. But if you need to get to know some piece of history also, I would recommend you to try to take a guide."
Good place to walk around,"We visited Kazan Kremlin on our first day of Kazan trip. Kazan Kremlin is very beautiful. There are a mosque and a big church inside Kremlin. There are also a few museum in it. We spent three hours walking in the compound. Good place to visit. Or I should say, it's a must to come here when you visit Kazan. After visiting Kremlin, we walked out from the compound and we found a tourist information center. The young worker who is a good English speaker helped us to explore more great places to go in Kazan. Good experience :)"
wonderful,The first place I visited was the Kremlin it was wonderful and no there are electric car for old man and
The main sightseeing hub in Kazan,"Almost everything you want to see in Kazan is right here: Orthodox churches, the Kul Sharif Mosque, and half a dozen little museums in the vicinity. The Kremlin sits up high and provides amazing views of the city on three sides. Bring a camera and be sure to come see it at sunset when the mosque lights up."
Great Experience,"Wonderful fortress to visit offering amazing church, mosque and other buildings to view. 2nd world war museum well worth viewing. Great views of Kazan from the Kremlin/Fortress walls. Unlike United Kingdom Free Entrance to Kremlin. Cafes in Kremlin for tea/coffee breaks."
A piece of ancientry in the heart of the city,"Worth visiting, take a guide and you will learn a lot of legends and facts about the city and its history. A great example of tolerance and good neighbourhood, a church and a mosque in a close proximity"
"UNESCO object: Red star, orthodox cross and Muslim crescent at one place","If you want make an uncommon photo, you will have happy chance for that: red star on the Kremlin tower, cross on the orthodox church and crescent on the biggest in Europe mosque at one shot.  As it a space to feel  peace in the world ."
Must see,"If you are in Kazan, you must see this great architecture composition. Old Kremlin has hystorical soul."
Great Attraction,"A fantastic cultural monument. Full of history, detail, features, churches and beauty! It would take weeks to fully explore and it would be worth it! Fully recommend any visitors to Kazan, to make a point of visiting for a full day at least."
"When in Kazan, definitely a must-do","Even though we are talking about a Unesco world Heritage site,  the Kremlin is much more than expected and much more impressive than any photos. It's entrance it's free and you may roam as you please through such a majestic fortress."
Wonderfull Kremlin,"A very authentic place with the combination of Historic, cultural and religious places and monuments. An impressive immaculate white wall surrounding the buildings, a magnificent view and an entrance castle full of symbols. Must see in Kazan and in Russia."
Maybe a better Kremlin than Moscow's,"Very accessible day and evening. Great views from many sides. Interesting buildings within; mosques, churches, shops, etc. Good photo opportunities."
White Kremlin,"Kazan Kremlin it widespared touristic place, and when i came to Kazan, first i went to Kremlin. admition is free. But near eneter, some people try sell expensive excursion. (around 700 rubles), So, inside you can see masque and cathedral. Very very beautiful place"
"UNESCO site, must see","You can spend a whole there in Kazan Kremlin just visiting all the museums (9 total), churches and mosque. Make sure to visit the National Museum just across the street as well."
The place is fantastic. The white color of the kremlin isnvery suggestive and –º–µ—á–µ—Ç—å is stunning. Don t miss this place!,"Most important thing to see here is the mosque. Really amazing from the outside especially for the blue and white color, not so much inside. You have to wear something on your head if you're a woman in sign of respect. White color of the kremlin is amazing and also the view from it unforgettable"
Best spot in the city,Nice place to have a whole view of the city and also visit few historical buildings. Don't have to pay any entrance ticket
Excellent ,No1 attraction in Kazan and you can see why. Stunning place to visit. Make sure you cater for time here.
If you're in Kazan,Interesting and worth a stop.  Take the tour and hear the stories.  Make it number one on your Kazan tour list!
Very beautiful sight,"It is really a beautiful place to visit  when travelling to Kazan.It takes you back in time while being in the present.Once there try visiting the museum, government offices and the the beautiful churches there."
Definitely a place to visit in Kazan,The place where christian and muslim cultures merge together.You should definitely visit the temples inside.
Must to see!,"As one of UNESCO, it is amazing place. Beautiful Mosque, historic Cathedral, wonderful museums! Worth to spend 4-5 hours. Furthermore the building with night light is great for photo taking. National History Museum can offer paid Audio Guide in English. But Hermitage Museum can't and all the introduction in Russian. It is a bit shame for tourist no Russian."
Beautiful! ,Very beautiful place!  Had a very nice walk there with my husband. Love mixed architecture there. Also if you are looking for souvenirs this is the good place :)
The essential symbol of the city,"Kazan's old fortress with its many monuments is the political, cultural and spiritual centre of Tatarstan's capital city."
Historical and cultural hub,A place where old (but renovated) christian chirches located together with newly built islamic mosque.
An interesting Unesco site,Kazan Kremlin is a well maintained historical area worth visiting. There you may visit both an Orthodox chuch and a mosque which are really beautiful inside.
Visit to the Kazan Kremlin,The Kremlin in Kazan is worth going to. The Qol≈ü√§rif Mosque and the museum in the basement is educational. Walking the Kremlin is interesting and we decided to go to the Kremlin several times. Be sure to go to the museum of the history of  Tartarstan statehood in the Kremlin. The history timeline (in English) in great to understand the Mongol period.
Very nice views over the city,"It's beautiful but from a Unesco World Heritage Site I was expecting a little more. Also if you've seen the Moscow Kremlin, this is little in comparison. The mosque is ugly and the entrance gate only average, so why go? Because, unlike the Moscow Kremlin, it's free. And, the squares and gardens are well kept, the inside of the cathedral is absolutely magnificent (do climb them stairs), there's a very interesting museum about the complete history of the region that costs only 60p (less than a euro) and if you walk along the wall or climb into the little watch tower with the wooden roof, you'll have very nice views of the city."
"Moscow has one too, I believe.","A far more relaxed place than the one in Moscow.  It may not have a Red Square or St Basil's outside but the contents within the walls are arguably as beautiful and certainly more accessible. The Kul Sharif mosque is the most stunning for me, and don't miss the interior.  The Annunciation cathedral runs it close.  It does of course have a miraculous icon inside - Our lady of Kasan.    Outside can be found the Syuyumike Tower which has a distinct lean and behind the cathedral is an amazing viewpoint across the city.You will also find modern sculptures around the ground - these, I think are temporary exhibitions.Like anywhere in Russia, it is always a good idea to read up a little of the history and legends of a place - here is no exception.   The legends concerning the tower are particularly interesting."
Historic,"Nice place to visit and breathe some history , architecture and beauty. I recommend everyone to take a look on that monument once his feet touched Kazan."
it was interesting!,"I saw variant Kremlin in different cities: Moscow, Astrakhan, Nizhniy Novgorod, etc. But in Kazan Kremlin is very interesting joining 2 different world: Eastern and Western. Recommended to visit!"
Splendid History and Architecture,"Kazan's impressive history is summed up at this location. The Kremlin, the church and the new mosque all sitting proudly together on the river. You really get a sense of the history of the place here and it is a must visit if you're in the city."
Must see! Highly recommend a tour guide,"Beautiful spot! The Kul Sharif Mosque, although recently built, is incredibly scenic. I very much recommend going inside. We hired a tour guide, Oksana, at the entrance to the Kremlin for 800 rubles ($12 at the current exchange) and she was wonderful, very knowledgeable and friendly."
Yes Excellent,The is a Great place to visit the surrounding area has been redeveloped so even more to see and do with the river esplanade
"Open Kremlin, Magnificent","By day, or by night when the area is floodlight and magical, this is a ""must see"" exploration area in Kazan. Wonderful buildings, mosque and orthodox cathedral close by each other in symbolic and real peace. Much history in this area, and some fine museums as well. I explored daily at different times.TIP: if you can cross the river, especially at night, to see the Kremlin view in full floodlighting, it is well worth it. Breath-taking."
great place,"be sure to visit. You can touch the history, very clean and well-kept area. very close to caf√©s and restaurants, observation decks."
Stunning building,"To keep it short, if you like a brief history lesson and beautiful architecture, this is a sight to behold. The Kazan Kremlin sits on top of a hill and provides stunning views of the surrounding area. Thanks to the large area in which the Kazan Kremlin sits on, the sky also slightly bends around. On a non-cloudy day, if you have time to visit, I surely do recommend going. If you'd like to go inside, there is a small fee that you'd have to pay but is negligible for the most part. Nothing much inside for you if you do not read Russian as everything else is Russian."
Incredible,The Kremlin is justifiably a UNESCO world heritage site. Stunning river views and wonderful architecture makes a visit a must.
Free beauty and history,"It is definitely a must see in Kazan. It is free and beautiful. I suggest starting the visit from the south entrance, leaving the best for last."
worth to see,"worth to see, free entrance, beautiful church. nice walk and promenade for photographing. very clean and interesting."
Kazan Kremlin great attraction by night,The Kremlin in Kazan is a true landmark made complete with the presence of the Kul Sharif Mosque. The best moment to take pictures would be in the night from the Most Millennium Bridge.
Kremlin.,The only thing that I didn't like was the lack of english explanations for all the buildings. So do some research about everything before you go or otherwise it's just a collection of buildings.
interesting place,"interesting place to see, old fortress, strange mosque added to the construction, represents muslim majority"
Beautiful place with history ,"Make sure to arrange excursion to go around with somebody who will be able to tell you the most interesting and important stories. You can pay for the guide on the gate if u want to listen in russian language, but in other languages might have to book in advance."
–æ—Ç–ª–∏—á–Ω—ã–µ –≤–∏–¥—ã,great landscape over Kazan and Kazanka river from The walls. Very beautiful and enjoyable place to feel history of Kazan.some museums inside.
Excellent !,"You can spend 2 hours very easy here. If you have time go inside the museums it has. The views are amazing, the inside streets really quiet and clean. The architectures are awesome.The only thing to remark, is that lot of the buildings (the mosque for example) are brand new (10 years old for example)."
Stunning,"Stunning, just stunning. This is of utmost beauty and not a museum. The Kremlin is used by the Government."
Very interesting! ,This was a nice adventure. It's gorgeous in the Snow. It holds so much history. I would recommend visiting it and the museums right outside its gates.
Kazan for the world games?,"Although I doubt many people would go out of their way to visit the Tatar capital of Kazan, the world games will bring many there. Once there, walk around the Kremlin and visit a new but interesting Kul Sharif mosque near the Volga river. The University has an old library with lots of historical documents. Tolstoy and Lenin studied there, and supposedly others who discovered lots of stuff 'first'. The city is also very proud of its deceased bass singer Chaliapin. Getting close to the asian part of Russia might seem exciting, but big cities are still big cities."
"Impressive! Fascinating! Free, easy walking.  ","Impressive! Fascinating! Free, easy walking.  The kremlin (fortress) is well- restored, and a historical and cultural treasure. I visited one museum -- The Great Patriotic War [WWII]; worthwhile."
Spectacular,"The Kazan Kremlin is different of the Moscow one and has its charm. The walls and towers are built of white stone, from one of the sides you can climb up the wall and then - the tower. On the territory there are some museums which unfortunately were closed for unknown reason when we came, governmental buildings and the famous by its looks mosque - Kul Sharif. There is a small crafts market where you can get some souvenirs as well. To my minute visit to the Kremlin takes about half a day. I wouldn't recommend to leave it for last minute or leave for it just 1 hour, especially, if you have a chance to stop by some museums."
Be prepared to walk around the vast immaculate grounds of Kremlin,"I had only a short time and did a quick tour to the Kul Sharif Mosque and the entrance leading to it. But overall, the place is immaculate and spotless.  Very well kept and maintained buildings upon buildings that are historical and aged.  That was a memorable afternoon with a heavy hail-storm and I was told it had never happened in Kazan before."
Evening visits are the best,"During the day, it can be hot and bustling.  To really appreciate the beauty of the area and give yourself breath and time to appreciate it, I recommend going in the evening for a wander around.  Obviously, to hit the museums, shops and sights during the day is best because they're shut later on!  However, for great views over the river, for a romantic or simply a relaxed walk and an opportunity to appreciate the beauty of the place without the press of tourists - the evening is my favourite time to go."
the Unity,"The Kazan Kremlin is a wonderful place to visit and a must-see sight of Kazan. I came to the Kremlin wall quite early (approx. 6.30 AM) 'cos I wanted to make pictures of it without tourists. It's a bright, quiet and peaceful place which unites different religions (there is a church and a mosque in one space) and cultures (the Museum of the history of Islam and the Hermitage). Besides, the central Goverment of the Republic of Tatarstan is located here as well. The Kremlin has some great panoramic views on the city and the Volga River. And I loved a tiny, but cosy park near the Cathedral. The Kremlin is full of little wonders so come here anytime anyday (the entrance in the Kremlin is free of charge^^)"
A sophisticated alternative to Moscow's Kremlin,"The Kazan kremlin, standing high on the banks of the River Volga, offers a wealth of experiences within its walls. The most outstanding feature has to be the newly constructed mosque, where you can visit not only the main areas but also an interesting museum."
Fascinating and accessible,Interesting and accessible. Good views of the Volga. Could do with more interpretation boards. Mosque and Orthodox church a must.
Very very touristy,"Nice, but not much history left to see. And there's hoards of tourists. If you think you know what that means, you don't - come here and you'll see."
Must see. Must revisit,Only managed a speedy visit in the evening & at the start of winter. It was very cold & dark but this was a wonderful insight into Tartar culture & history.The Qolsharif Mosque is particularly stunning. Would love to go back to get a proper visit
Beautiful,Very nice place tot visit! The mosque is beautiful! And it is free! It looks like there is a museum about tatarstan in the kremlin but the real museum is in front of the entrance of the kremlin. Also nice viewpoint of the city!
Must see it,Very beautiful and romantic place. I love it especially tonight. If you going to Kazan you just must go to Kremlin. Magnificent buildings and unbelievable atmosphere.
üòä  wonderful Russian Kremlin with an Islamic flavor,I really enjoyed being inside to check the wonderful buildings inside with a lot of museums specifically the Islamic museum
Interweaving Islam and Orthodoxy,Very attractive place where Islam and Orthodoxy are intertwined. Beautiful Orthodox churches and magnificent mosque Kul Sharif. All Kremlin is surrounded by walls with powerful towers. Beautiful views of the city and the River Volga.
Lots of museums but no English,"Beautiful buildings with many museums but was told that there's nothing in English except for the National Museum across the street. In my opinion, other than the Mosque, the rest was just a picture taking opportunity lacking awe / the amazing feeling that I've experienced at all other UNESCO sites."
The Kremlin,"A beautiful place... great place for a walk in any time of the year, it is amazing just to watch at the different buildings and architectural styles. If you have more time there are several expositions that you can visit. Every time I go to these museums they show something different. The themes are changing and the halls are just as big for you not to get tired of walking and looking around. It has become my favorite place to spend the weekend at."
Quiet in Winter,very scenic with nice contrast of Mosque and Orthodox Church. Pretty chilly in the Winter but it meant no crowds
heart of the city,"In this complex are present at various cultural and civilization influence of Volga Bulgaria, the Golden Horde and the Khanate of Kazan; its architecture is mixed, there is  architecture Tatar, Italian and Russian . The entrance into the territory of the Kazan Krem is  free.Only in territory of residence of the President of the Republic of Tatarstan is visited only under permission of the Administrative Office of the President."
Small but full of vibrant history,"Kazan Kremlin is not so big as the one in Moscow - but it's also the epicenter of local and all-Russia history. Many beautiful buildings and monuments and museums and churches. Ivan the Terrible is said to demolish all the mosques, but when Kazan celebrated its 1000th anniversary, a very beautiful Kul Sharif Mosque was erected there. It's open for tourist - you only have to wear plastic overshoes to enter there. The local staff is very helpful. I expected it to be very grand and luxurious inside - but it is rather moderate - maybe not to distract the praying men from their dialogue with God. A lot of not expensive souvenirs!"
Beautiful ,Kazan is an extremely beautiful city. The Kazan Kremlin is the most beautiful Kremlin I visited in Russia so far. The place is simply breathtaking.
Made to impress,"The must-visit place in Kazan. We were visiting Kazan at winter, there was very cold (-26 C) to walk but the white Kremlin walls, towers, mosque looks fabulous in the snow. Also it contains lots of stores with interesting souvenirs.Extremely recommend the Kazan Kremlin to visit."
The Heart of Kazan,"Free entry, unlike the Moscow Kremlin, is a bonus for those wishing to see the Kazan Kremlin. The home of the Kul Sharif Mosque, an Hermitage museum amongst other historical sights. The Kremlin also offers great views across the river Kazanka and over the Agricultural palace- a nice place to walk around and enjoy an hour or two of sightseeing."
Unique place,"Two cultures in one place - very special feelings when you see mosques and Christian churches on the same grounds. Bunch of souvenir shops with nice associates. Not all of them though accept credit cards, only closest to the central entrance."
Beautiful,"It was a cold day (-17 degrees C) but anyway i decided to visit th—É Kremlin. It is really beautiful there. The view is awesome. If you can visit Kazan, this is a place to visit."
Kazan a must place to visit,"I have visited the city of Kazan and definitely is a gorgeous city. It has a beautiful mosque you should visit and of course the kremlin. Food amazing!!! Lots of cultures are mixed in here. If you visit Russia, really need to go to this city."
Superb,This UNESCO World Heritage site is well worth a visit. I travelled on business. We were given a guided tour of the Kazan Kremlin. This was superb and well run.
Kremlin spectacular cultural,Kazan was exciting multi cutural experience enhanced by the Kremlin and the mosque plus Volga river cruises
white Kremlin,being in Kazan you will not miss it. in the nightime when light is on - very attractive. enjoy romantic walk.
While you are in Kazan,Its a place you need to go and visit. Nothing spectacular but good to see while you are in Kazan. There is the castle and Mosque as well.
UNESCO Heritage in the Center of Kazan',"Old Kremlin in the historical center of the city, which looks surprisingly well preserved for an ancient city with a rich military history. The building looks strong, yet not massive, and really beautiful.I would say it's a real tourist attraction well worth seeing - I would have visited it again and seen the museums situated in the area, but for the shortage of time... And I was glad I'd follwed my friends' advice and saw this magnificent place. And I woul advise visiting it to my other friends, too."
to see first visit,Hundreds of years Russians traveling to Kazan go to see the kremlin with its towers and legends. Nowadays the huge mosq is erected and the walk there may be a nice hour or so
Beautiful Buildings,The Kremlin is well worth a visit. The buildings are beautiful. There was no admission fee to the complex so we could wander around taking photos. There were some interesting exhibits on display inside the mosque such as ornate copies of the Quran.
Very interesting Kazan Kremlin . . .,". . . although the very first thing to greet you is a sign telling you all the activities you cannot do on site including skiing, drinking, dog walking, skateboarding, cycling, shouting, singing and so on.  The buildings are beautiful, as are the statues. Worth a visit."
"The city in the plains, called steppes","That year 1980, I with mu parents have had some beautiful journey downward the course of the great russian river,the Volga. We started from the Kazan, in what we landed after we did the flight by the Aeroflot plane from the Moscow. After landing we proceeded toward the banks of mighty Volga where at some point a very nice riverboat awaited for us ( the group of Yugoslavs including our family). On the way there we managed to acquire some impression about this city on the Volga and in the plains, called in russian language, the stepi. It is a capital and largest city in the Republic of Tatarstan, within the Russia. Kazan has a very rich history, that starts from the times of the Tzar Ivan the Terrible and going through the era of another great russian person,i.e. the Tzar Peter I the Great, comes to the present times. Before the rule of Ivan the Grozni (Terrible), here was some Mongol Khan, that governed with the city and vast territory around it.The great battles were led not only with Mongols and Tatars as the conquerors of the huge russian territories, but also with the people rebels as Stenka Razin and Pugacev that opposed to the tzars's power. Kazan is mostly positioned on the left coast of Volga. The old historic part of the city,the Kazan Kremlin, is very near to the Volga and to the narrow earth passage over the bay (the levee with the road on it). The many recognizable buildings adorn the Kazan within the Kremlin, as the churches,cathedrales, the mosque. With white walls around the core of Kremlin and also white facade of the churches and blue and yellow gilded the cupolas, especially on a sunny day it gives You wonderful picture. People is very polite and gentle, with asiatic face features, a little bit inclined eyes. Of the old buildings in Kremlin, I'd like to mention Spasskaya Tower, the Annunciation Cathedral. It was very clean everywhere, when we had been there, as generally in all other soviet cities,we visited in that time."
Interesting,"Was amazed how clean this place was. Lot of interesting history here and was very suprised when we see the big moske inside the walls, really beatiful."
Nice and free,It was nice to walk around the Kremlin in Kazan. Everywhere was clean and well-kept. There are also good views of the city.
Was a stunning atmosphere!,It was small than the original one but should see at night with all those lights! It was a great experience to see that!
Nice place,The Kazan Kremlin is a very amazing historical place. Please take half a day at least for seeing it thoroughly. It's a good idea to take a sightseeing bus trip after walking inside and around Kremlin.
Main monument in Kazan,"Main historical monument in Kazan by Kazanka river in the very centre  of the city. Free access. Excellent view  from  the walls to the city. Prepare yourself for long pleasant  walk. Everywhere you may find the benchs, rest, have your drinks."
You can see that beauty 24 hours a day!,Kazan Kremlin is open 24 hours a day so you can see it either in the sunshine or with wonderful colors of the night. It is full of amazing churches and breath taking views. Here you can see and feel the history and that is amazing!Most of all i liked the Kul Sharif mosque: it was amazing either outside or inside.The official website of the Kazan Kremlin is there http://www.kazan-kremlin.ru. You can choose appropriate google-translation
Lovely spot,Breathtaking spot with a tinge of history and great civilization..You'll fall in love with Kazan once you'll be here.
Spectacular,This is the city's most important sight and is worthy of a whole day of exploration. It was interesting to walk the base of the walls and then to investigate the exhibitions within. The architectural style greatly interested me.
Islamic city,Good place to walk. Very tall Islamic church inside. Old inclined tower from Russian imperial dynasty. Kazan was the capital of Mongolian invaders for hundreds years. Most of people are Tatar and Islamic in this region. In front of the gate there is a monument of labor and portraits of  Russian revolutionists.The strait alley from the gate is more cosy and better to walk. On the alley you can find Hippo beer bar which has more than 200 years history.
Superb masterpiece,"Incredible gathering of buildings with all different purposes, it takes your breath away. Especially at summer around 6 pm."
UNUSUAL PLACE IN RUSSIA,"If by any chance you fly to Russia, Kasan is a good bet ! Kasan Kremlin is worth visiting , majestic and white ! also, depending on the weather try a boat tour along the Volga River ! Enjoy it !"
Beauty of Tatarstan,"Kazan still has a lot of Soviet character, which I really enjoyed. Kremlin is a mix of well preserved past: Annunciation Cathedral built by Ivan the Terrible in 1552, and Qul Sharif Mosque built by Turkish architects in 2005. It is a mix of Orthodox Christian and Muslim cultures that coexists peacefully in this small and cozy city. I love Kazan and Kremlin is the heart of the city that is amazing!"
Historical continuity cultural diversity,The Kazan Kremlin and its monuments represents exceptional testimony of historical continuity and cultural diversity over a long period.Different architectures are amazing.
A lovely sight on a summer evening,"This is a fascinating location. It has been almost completely restored, though some work is still going on. The best way to start is seeing it from below by the river Kazanska at sunset. You can easily see why it was a formidable defensive position. Inside are neoclassical government buildings, barracks for soldiers and horses, an old orthodox cathedral and a modern mosque.The rest of Kazan is also being restored with many old building looking splendid and others which will. There is a big variety of mosques and orthodox churches often very close to each other reflecting the  dual ethnic origins of modern Tartarstan."
A real highlight,"A beautiful sight to behold, the Kremlin is undoubtedly a top sight in Kazan. There are quite a few things to see there including churches, a mosque and a few museums. I was lucky enough to visit a small but very worthwhile exhibition of French Impressionists at the Kazan Hermitage. The guide we hired at very reasonable cost proved to be a wealth of information. Take your time to thoroughly enjoy it, of course weather permitting...we had our share of bad luck having endured minus 25C but still enjoying it greatly."
"KAZAN, RUSSIA in 3 DAYS....","Kazan is a beautiful city and a three day visit is adequate.  If you are travelling to Russia, you should NOT miss out on this city! 1: The people are friendly and most speak English (compared with other cities in Russia) 2: Most of the attractions have English translations 3: The city is extremely unique as it fuses Tatar culture with Russian4: The entire city was revamped in 2004/2005 leaving it well suited for walking and tourismFirst and foremost, you will not require a car since all attractions are within walking distance of one another.  I spent a significant time researching everything from the perfect hotel to the attractions, so this review will benefit you....HOTEL:  Hotel Crystal is excellent (within walking distance to grocery, just across the street from the train station, has stable water/heat, free WIFI, front desk speaks English, they will store your bags both before and after your stay if requested, and  has air conditioning and windows which open this is essential (even in the wintertime) since you won't be able to regulate the heat which is around 80 F.  The country regulates the heat, not even the hotel has this ability!  Ask the front desk for a complimentary city map, which is also in English.  This map was extremely helpful and has the attractions on it including street names.  Bring your own shampoo, soap and ask for additional towels. The aforementioned bathroom amenities were lacking, however the hotel was very clean, new and nicely decorated.  ATTRACTIONS: *Before booking your trip you must know that most museums are closed on Mondays*Day 1: I recommend visiting The Museum of 1000 years first.  This is the furthest walk you will encounter, however well worth it.  This museum is new, cheap ($1.50), and will provide the foundational history of Kazan enabling you to fully embrace the unique culture here.  English translations are throughout the exhibit.  After this you can walk across the town to the Central Market.  By hitting the market first, you will be able to compare prices here versus the vast quantity of souvenir shops present on Bauman street.  This market is amazing!  From the spices, foods, Tatar hats, banya fixings, Egyptian perfumes, silk wraps and more...NOT TO BE MISSED!  The Central Market is in Muslim area of town.  While on this side of town, be sure to visit the old Tatar settlement Soltanov Mosque and Nurallah Mosque.  It's beautiful with unique buildings and parallels the Kazan Lake.  Be sure to read (online) the purposed history regarding the lake and Ivan the Terrible.  Interesting....  Day 2: The Kazan Kremlin is beautiful, be sure to read about the suyumbike tower (online) and it's history.  While in the Kremlin there are many museums of interest such as the Hermitage and across the street is The National Republic of Tatarstan Museum.  I visited both of these (cheap) and worth the visit.  English translations were present in both.  While you are in the Kremlin you can walk around within the walls, read about the history and enter the cathedrals and mosques.  Don't pay for the Kul Sharif Mosque museum as this was essentially a child's art show and one of the most expensive museum ($3) we paid for.  However do enter and look around...Day 3: Walk around Bauman street and the city.  Be sure to read (online) the historical significance of the hotel and buildings.  The Museum of Soviet Life ($5) was interesting and they allow you to try on old (original) soviet uniforms and pioneer/komsomol uniforms and take photos.  This alone is worth the money :).  Along Bauman there are fountains, the coach of Catherine The Great, Nicholas Cathedral, Theophany Church, GUM shopping center, theaters and more.  While I visited there weren't any opera's performed, however if you are interested you can check out Kazan Opera House.  FOOD: Although the food is not the healthiest, it is much more tasty than traditional Russian cuisine.  Horse is considered their delicacy here however I didn't attempt this.  Unique Tatar food that is cheap on Bauman: Kulinaria (English menu), Dom Chaya receives good reviews however there wasn't an English menu and it is packed/very busy, Caf√© Skazka is a strange, but delicious, restaurant with a large English menu.  I ate my favorite thing there: Gubadiya.  This is a sweet yet savory pastry with cultured Tvorog, raisins, and rice.  Very earthy and interesting.  LOVED IT!  Within GUM, on the third floor, there is a great turkish kebab place called Sofra Kebab.  Fresh and delicious as compared with American mall food courts.  If you would like to try Georgian food check out: Khinkalnaia (this is the phoenetic attempt).  Although the prices are more expensive here than the other restaurants, it is worth it.  Any of the lamb dishes are recommended.  Try the tarhun, a tarragon soda that is delicious...OVERALL:  KAZAN is fabulous!"
Go and see for yourself!,"I hated the weather, but very much liked the sights!!! A must see while in Kazan! It right next to he biggest mosque in Russia and this is also very much worth to see! And it is also a bit of a sport activity after a good meal... Close to a variety of sports areas and in the evening evem more beautiful!"
a historic heart,"I live in Kazan and it is very beautiful city. Of course it's better to come here in late spring or summer, because of snowy and cold winters.Kremlin is its heart. The area tells about the history and people that managed to combine two religions. Muslim and Christians live 50 to 50 hand in hand in piece. So that the architecture - churches and mosques are close to each other."
Beautiful!!,"Kazan Kremlin is a must see if you visit Kazan.  The mosque is truly beautiful, it's very unique and very grand.  There are great views of Kazan from the Kremlin, a good photo point."
I love Kazan City!,"What a beautiful city it is! Kazan is the 3rd capital of Russia ( that's what they call it).The Kremlin is a very important landmark - a must see! One thing - go in the warmer time of the year. I lived in Kazan for 6 years and let me tell you, winters can get pretty cold and nasty with the strong winds blowing little pieces of the iced snow in your face... No, I prefer the late spring - that's when the grounds are happy to get the weight of the heavy winter snows off, trees get their first green leafs, the grass is fresh!"
A mixture of styles,"Grand churches and Mosque in one enclosed environment right off the main drag of town. The Mosque wil lgive you ""Nikon finger"" as it is so beautiful you will keep pressing the shutter."
Historical Kazan,"First of all Kazan is deserving to be much more frequently visited landmark not only in Russia but also in Europe. It is a lovely, full of history, cultural, beautiful, clean and vivid city. It is one of the most civilised cities in the region. For instance, when you step on the car way, all the cars stop and let you cross the road whether there is pedastrian crosswalk or not. The cousine is very rich and cheap. There are very nice and luxury restaurants and cafes as well.Kazan Kremlin is a place must to be seen definetly.  It is a World Heritage Site. You should asign couple of hours for  this magnificent place. You can learn and feel the history of Tatarstan and Kazan here. You can learn much about Tatar culture.By the way Kazan is one of the richest cities in Russia. Tatarstan own nearly 20% of natural gas resources of Russia.You will never forget Kazan and want to be back again."
Great view,"Having just been to kazan to watch my football team,the kazan kremlin lit up at night is beautiful to look at.kazan in General is a great place to visit very clean,the locals are very friendly too."
love it,absolutely gorgeous view over the Volga river...must see ..specially the mosque Kul Sharif......breathtaking...at night..with all the lights..stunning
Best Kremil so far,"As we were in town as they say, it radiated like a jewel on the opposite side of the river, a beacon of mysterious beauty, a marvel to behold like a fabulous lady who may or may not be approached. The white walls gleaming in the night lights so romantic.In the day time you enter a tranquil space that entices you to explore each corner, the buildings on their own are worth the trip even if you don't enter, each space asks you to guess its story, it's unique place in the world even though ultimately borne out of conflict with that bad lad Ivan the not so good responsible for the downfall of Kazan itself.Looking at the leaning tower (why did that girl jump) the mosque, the trees even don't wish you to leave, it has a mystery that the Moscow or Nizhniy sites do not, maybe it's the curly toed slippers and quirky smoking caps.  People are friendly, although as Boris Yeltsin said to the guys during perestroika ""you can have all the independence you wish, just so long as you remain inside Russia"" the feel is different but its still Russia.Visit and explore, shopping was almost fun for a chap, picture me at home in curly slippers and a wee hat."
Mystic Beauty!,It is centrally located in the heart of Kazan. Its architecture is impeccably artistic & outstanding. The city itself is clean & tidy. The bright blue & white colors of Kremlin gives it a remarkable presence on the street. No one can miss its sight! It resembles the marvel of the Russians & their culture.
Must visit,You must visit it ..... spend some time there in museums and walking around.....it is fantastic at night .... and it has free WiFi
Worth every minute,"I highly recommend to visit this place, preferably with a good tour guide. The place is amazing but the history of the site is even more! A guide would tell the stories about the differences between Tatars and Slavs and how come they get on well together. A story that modern Russia could be jealous of. As about guides - the official ones on the sites I recommend, however I took the tour in Russian, don't know about English. It cost extremely cheap - 700 Rub. for a group of 7."
Beautiful and charming,"Kazan's Kremlin is a beautiful and charming place. It is home to the largest mosque of Central Asia, as well as to Tatarstan's Presidential Palace. It is located on the highest point in town, overlooking the rivers and with stunning view on the surrounding mountains.You cannot visit Kazan without visiting the Kremlin!"
must-see in Kazan,no entrance fee if you don't wanna visit the museums. Very cool to see mosquee and orthodox christian church united in one Kremlin. We visited on a Thuesday and it was not crowded at all!
Out of a Fairytale!,"This is one of my favorite places in all of Russia.  The mosque inside the kremlin is both striking and unique - apparently it's the largest mosque in all of Russia.   Everything is meticulously maintained - it looks like something out of a Disney fairytale.   But more than that, this place has a great energy.  Locals go there for walks, concerts and wedding photo shoot.    When I was there a flash mob was going on outside the kremlin and young Russian singers were belting out American pop in the square in front of the mosque inside the kremlin.  It's wonderful place to spend an afternoon."
Don't Miss This!,"If you have to see one thing in Kazan, this is it.  The Kazan Kremlin is truly fascinating.  The old fortress has commanding views of the Kazanka and the Volga.  Don't miss the cathedral and the beautiful mosque."
Amazing place,"Full of history, very well kept and maintained, located in the very heart of Kazan. The personnel, guides and security are very friendly, love and know their city and this very amazing place. Beautiful at day and night, not extremely crowded and easy to access all the important points inside.Some exhibitions are also located inside the Kremlin and it is recommended to check in advance what is in and what are the opening hours."
Nice,Safe and nice to walk with families. Great views and very clean. The mosque is in the middle but closes early. The kremlin itself is open 24hrs my hotel said.
churches & mosque,"Free entrance, there are tours but they are only in Russian.  Inside the Kremlin you can visit the Mosque or churches and have a panoramic view over the river and the new city.To enter the mosque you need to cover your head and PAY 2 rubles to get plastic socks to put on top of your feet.  You can climb on the 3rd floor to view the mosque praying room from above.  There is a museum on the lower floor (fee to enter) but I did not find it very interesting.  Most of the paintings are just printed posters.museum on the bottom floor is"
Most beautiful white Kremlin in Russia,"While Moscow has its famous red Kremlin, and Nishny-Novgorod its dirty-brown one, Kazan with its white Kremlin over the shores of the Kazanka river is a truely beautiful site. Kazan was one of the 3 former capitals of Russia, besides Moscow and St.Peter. And, by the Kazan Kremlin you can truely see this. Fully deserved UNESCO World Heritage Site."
Huge and beautiful,"It was a highlight of our trip. The whole Kremlin is a UNESCO World Herritage site so it truly is a special venue. There are many museums, archeological complexes and sacred buildings inside. You have also a very lovely view over Kazan."
Oh Boy what a beautiful place !!!,"It is really worth visiting this place and there is no entrance fee!  The area houses the presidential palace, museum, government offices and a grand view facing the beautiful sea!"
Castle in mint condition,"Beautiful lights in the evening. Most of the places were closed. I cannot say about daytime, but probably not much better, beuase most of the buildings seemed to be in official use."
"Nice, well restored Kremlin","Kazan, the capital of Tatarstan, is worth visiting, even if it is (right now) a huge construction area.An exception is given by the Kremlin, which is already completly restored. The main attraction there is the beautiful Qolsharif Mosque, which can be seen all around and inside the Kremlin. It gives a nice contrast to all the orthodox churches all around russia."
"Crossroad of 2 worlds, 2 nations, 2 religions.","It's great place to touch to  1000-years history of 2 religions (Islam and Orthodoxy) and 2 nations (Russian and Tatar), which where growing together in peace and friendship. You can see big Mosque-Cul Sharif and on another side of the street-Orthodoxy Cathedral. All Kremlin's buildings are from the white stone, but one tower is from red bricket.It is tower of Tatar Khan's wife-Suyumbika.I want to tell you a legend about it. When Ivan the Terrible conquered Kazan Khan, he wanted to marry the queen Suyumbike, as she was very beautiful. But she said that only if Ivan will  built seven-storey tower in 7 days, she would marry him. Ivan built a tower in 7 days. Suyumbika climbed the tower and fell to the ground. Since then, the tower begun ti fall. But this is a fairy tale. In truth Suyumbika was honorably sent to the  estate Kolomenskoye in Moscow, her 2-year-old son Enaley became a colonel of the Russian army and rode a horse in front of russian worriers. Still this time Russians and Tatars lived in piece and Suyumbika tower included in the list of 600 falling towers of the world."
Very Good Kremlin...,"It is very nicely kept, well organized and very clean Kremlin and really worth to make a visit.From probably one of the top to see Kremlins in entire Russia.Leaning tower, mosque, church etc are all inside this compound.Do not miss it."
Great place,"I liked the kremlin so much I went there many times during my month stay in kazanwe went there during the day, we go for a walk and to see the mosque and the church there, we went there to buy some souvenirs, to talk photos .....etcIt's a more beautiful place at night, we used to bring some food and drinks with us and go for a walk.there were usually not so many people walking in the kremlin at night, actually we were there only people there but it's lots of funjust take care of the prices of the food there during the day , it's double the price outside"
an amazing Kremlin complex,This is a real must-visit place in Kazan. Very beautiful and exciting. The area is beautifully lighted in the evening
Best sight in city,"Is one of the best kremlims in Russia and a top attraction in kazan, walking around the walls in summer time or when snowy but chill is the nicest walk in the city"
An excellant place,"The Kremlin is amazing! Everything is in a very good condition, everywhere is very clean. There is a lot of shops with souvenirs there. Don't loose the chance to see the Kremlin in night! It is very beautiful!!!"
"Pristine, striking",Kazan Kremlin set atop a low hill stands out above the bend in the Volga river. The museum and Orthodox churches are amazing and a must for this excellent city.
Great views of Kazan Kremlin,"Beautifully situated place of tourist attraction, recently restored."
Interesting,"Lots of history, great views of the Kazan and Volga rivers, and the magnificent Kul Sharif mosque in the centre of the Kremlin was a very unique feature"
Don't miss it,"Only downside, and it is typical of most of my customer experiences in Kazan, was the complete lack of English (or any other language) signage.  Apparently, there are 4 museums within the Kremlin but I had no way to tell."
Worth visiting,"The territory of the Kremlin is rather big, very clean and picturesque. On the grounds of the Kremlin there is a very interesting museum as well as the beautiful Kul Sharif Mosque. In Spring put on all your warm clothes because it is very windy."
a passage in time,"seen/been to lots of Kremlins in Russia. Kazan s is the most structured, beatiful as a pearl, preserved carefully, planned in detailed. Very well organized museums, exhibitions inside. Deserves several hours of attention"
Kremlin in Kazan,Good to see - but read a bit about the history before coming.
"Modern, comfortable, english difficult",All the comforts and clean rooms in a historical area.
"Beautiful, but nothing is written in english","Worth visiting, but hard to understand what is what as everything is written in cyrillic...."
A Real Surprise,"The Kazan Kremlin was really the star of our very successful visit to Kazan. I had decided to include the city on our tour of Russia on a whim having heard about the Kazan Kremlin. It was one of the best decisions I made about our trip, and ther worst was probably to allow only one day there!The kremlin was absolutely stunning. Right from the pristine white of the walls and the mosque right through to the well looked after flower beds the place was absolutely spotless.Many of the buildings inside the kremlin are used for offical state visits, and the president of Tartarstan actually has his recidence there. So it isn't just a museum, but actually still a seat of power. And you get a feeling of that as you walk around the streets inside the fortress.We booked a tour with a guide at the entrance to the Kremlin and this turned out to be another good decision. She didn't speak English though, so my wife had to translate for me as we walked around. English speaking guides are available, however, some prior notice is required. We later found out that our hotel could also arrange English speaking guides that could guide us not just around the Kremlin but also the rest of the city. So this may also be an option if you wish to combine a visit to the kremlin with a tour of the city.The guide was very friendly and easygoing and had an excellent knowledge of the history of the kremlin and the buildings inside it. And she quickly guided us around all the main attractions of the kremlin.The main attractions were of course the mosque and the cathedral, but there are of course much else to see also. I found the visit to the kremlin very enjoyable and I recommend anyone visiting Kazan to make it a priority to see during their stay."
Like a magical island of beauty and quiet,"The Kazan Kremlin has undergone very extensive recontruction of the past few years. I dare say, there is still some ongoing work. But right now, it is one of the most delightful places in Kazan. It's very clean and peaceful. Architecture of many types pleases the visitor at every turn. The Kul Sharif mosque (1995) is definitely worth a visit. But women, be aware, you must be suitably covered/modest - head scarves and ""shawls"" are available at the door. The Annunciation Cathedral (1554-62) has been exquisitely restored. It's absolutely beautiful. Don't miss the lovely garden outside, near the entrance. It's a jewel in summer with beds bursting with flowers, green arbors with benches, and an imposing statue in the center. During the summer months, you can find food stalls and gift/souvenir shops open. One very special gift shop is actually ""in the wall"" of the Kremlim. A little harder to find, but well worth the effort. The views from the walls are wonderful as is a stroll around the Kremlin on the outside of the walls. A favorite place for Russians to wander! Also you may take the new Metro to the base of the hill quite near the Kremlin - very convenient!"
