Beautiful,Been here many times before. Beautiful surroundings. Great for lunch. So relaxing you don't want to leave!
Slippy wear good shoes,The gorge is fantastic unfortunately we did this as part of a trip and it was very busy and the water was not deep but it was flowing very fast and this made it difficult to cross. Also people didn’t social distance and pushed past people and I saw a few people fall. I wore beach shoes and still found it difficult as it was slippy and I could still feel all the sharp rocks. Husbands shoes had a much better thicker sole than mine so he was off like a mountain goat. Some lovely views and the water is not that cold and you do get wet. Some people didn’t go into the gorge but there are areas where you can dabble your feet.
Amazing Experience,"The canyon is 300 m (980 ft) deep and 18 km (11 mi) long, being one of the deepest in the world. It was formed through abrasion of the rocks by flowing waters over thousands of years. As the level of water rises during winter months, visitors can enter the canyon all year around only the deeper parts in the summer. 4 km (2.5 mi) of the canyon are walkable after April, when most of the snow in the Taurus Mountains has melted and passed through on its way to the Mediterranean Sea. Saklıkent means ""hidden city"" in Turkish. The full length of 16 km is only possible to discover with professional equipment and knowledge of advanced canyoning. Some adventure centers offer guided tours with an overnight Biwak camp and about 30 waterfalls to rappel."
Excellent value for money dayout,"This gorge is stunning and even better than the cheddar gorge at home. After walking through the gorge you can sit on comfortable pontoons in the river and enjoy a cold beer, it's fabulous, and for the thrill seekers you can sit in a large do-nut and flow all the way downstream."
Nice area,The water is amazing. I will come here again. If you like trekking welcome here anytime. Suitible for childeren
Amazing walk and really fun adventure ,"Like all the reviews will state, remember to bring water shoes. The gorge is amazing and so cheap to enter. We walked about 1 hour up the gorge and the picture that we took and the scenery was breath taking. If you are in Fethiye I would definitely recommend that you take a trip out there"
Worth dropping by,"A very crowded place, lots of people smoking. You can park the car for free if you drive away like 200 meters, diving shoes highly necessary, 20TL inside, cheaper outside. Guides are highly annoying and useless. Further you walk, less people. The waterfall is easy to climb, if you ever have been to climbing training."
Wow - a must see,Completely blown away with our visit to Saklikent. A must see if you are visiting Turkey. Cheap to enter and the photo ops are second to none. Highly recommend.
Amazing!,"This place was so beautiful and so much to do! As well as the views there was also water rafting and zip lining. As well as really nice food, and a beautiful setting to eat in!"
Beautiful - freezing water,"On a mega hot day it was wonderful to be able to stand in the rushing fresh water at the top of the gorge then get into a ""raft"" with a paddle and wizz down stream down the gentle rapids to cool off. Turkey truly is one of the most beautiful places Ive ever visited."
Gorgeous,"Awe inspiring experience, though quite exerting, if you go up the gorge all 4 km till the sinkhole where the stream starts."
Go early and bring water shoes ,It was a great way to spend a few hours out of the sun.  People very helpful and would definitely recommend to others as great value for money.  Make sure you go to the toilet before you go in !!!
Saklikent Canyon ,"We booked the Saklıkent trip with trip with Overland Travel from Fethiye. As we want private guide and driver, we did the best choice becouse, travel companies offer just jeep safaries to Saklıkent or day trips to other sites likes tlos or yakapark. We booked with Overland Travel amd our guide make us trekking and canyooning in gorge. Later we went to another canyon known as Gizli Kent very clsoe to Saklıkent. We did enjoyed the waterfall at the end of the gorge there. Both 2 gorge in one day with Overland Travel Agency. If you want private tour, highly recommend"
very nice,"Very nice chill place .Not good for any disabled ,babies or old people .Water shoes necessary .Water is not that cold as some opinion (in August after noon)"
Great cisit,Awesome place - bring your own water shoes or hire some on arrival.No lockers available so travel light!
You should see when you are in this area,You should visit to see . It is hard to walk inside of water but it seems like Jordan Petra . Weekends are crowded .
Take water shoes,"It's nice place beautiful nature, some places dirty should clean up, take water shoes or u will struggle, for older people or kids may be difficult, but it's fun,  go check waterfall near by their will be signs it's beautiful"
Lovely & Impressive. ,"We hired a car & drove here ourselves. We arrived about 10:30 & it wasn’t too busy. Parking & getting tickets no issue. The canyon itself is lovely. There is a bit of a river crossing to begin really cold water but a rope to hold onto. The water here was about a foot deep. We walked as far as we could until a large boulder blocked the way and it wasn’t too arduous. We wore water shoes  which helped climbing over some of the rocks, but we passed people in flip flops & crocs. By the time we came out it was really busy so glad we took our photos on the way in when not too many other visitors. It’s worth doing but go early."
Breathtaking experience in super deep and beautiful george,"We had a great time.  The rocks are amazing and you walk through some shallow water, rich with clay you can put on your skin for a mini spa.   Go as dar as you dare.  We stopped before the boulder ‘cascade’ where you have to squeeze through a hole big enough for one person crawling.Do wear the helmets provided as small rocks do fall from time to time."
"Great day out, make sure you're wearing water shoes.","Great day out. I suggest going as far as possible into the gorge as the view gets better the deeper you are. You can get the bus from Fethiye return for 30TL, bus stop is around the corner from the main bus depot outside the white mosque (ask the bus driver if unsure). You definitely need water shoes, but you can buy them really cheaply outside. 20TL for the cheapest shoes and they were actually really good. Or if you're short of money you can buy second hand ones down the road. It costs 9TL entry for adults, under 6 year olds go free. The first bit is probably the hardest, getting across the river. However it's a great experience, just make sure you have correct footwear on or else it can be dangerous."
Nice adventure and astounding scenery,Really loved Saklikent river which is a beautiful light blue and turquoise river between a valley. We had a long walk and trek in the river which was very cool in the really scorching hot summer and was really refreshing. My advice to other travellers would be to be cautious of the type of footwear- do not wear slippers that can be easily broken as the trek in the river entails fast water currents and rocks. Wear special shoes adapted for water. We had a lovely time with my family and fiancé. Us the young ones went for the trek in the water and the older ones stayed in the café which was in the form of wood houses in the river. Really nice day overall. It is a recommended attraction in Seydikemer (Fethiye).
A must see,This gorge is just simply magnificent and must see if you're ever in this region. The water is clean and very soothing. Loved it and I'm sure you will too.
Beautiful place. ,We had blast walking through the canyon.  It was a great change of pace from being at the beaches.  The canyon and water was beautiful.
You have to carry cash!,"Establishments do not accept credit card you have to carry cash. Which we did not because we have been warned not to! Because water stream at the entrence of the valley was at the level of my knee and we’ve been informed that it will reach almost chest level at a certain point(I am 6’0”). Since TL is not water proof we left our cash in the car. After you pass the powerful water stream at the entrence, you take a long walk and I mean a looong one. And during this walk water stream is not a problem because it becomes very thin and height of the stream is 1’0” at max. We did not come across with that water stream of chest level and down further we go it all started to look the same. So we turned all the way back. By the way, two small rocks fell from up above while we are walking, although they did not hit us I recommend borrowing barets at the entrence they are free of charge. One last thing, rocks you are walking on are very slippery I highly recommend wearing seashoes. Flip flops will make the experience much harder."
Extreme and beauty,"My family and I traveled to the gorge by bus.I recommend, be sure to cross the mountain river and go into the gorge, to overcome some distance (of whom there will be enough). I advise you to pay the guide if there is a lot of water in the gorge (it’s safer and calmer, and you’ll get clear instructions). Shoes are best taken with rubber.The length of the gorge is 18 km, it is unlikely that you can go all completely. Even if you manage to walk a couple of kilometers, your impressions will remain unforgettable. You need to go meaningfully and carefully.This is my most unforgettable and vivid impression of Turkey."
excessively Touristic,"Very touristic,not  an  interesting  place for nature seekers, very crowded  and artificial .The restaurants are maybe the worst in town."
HUGE NATURAL BEAUTY,"The park, which contains a natural wonder that must be seen in the region, like Saklikent Canyon. Some parts of the road from the main road to here have also been made and it was fine. When you arrive, the staff who try to attract you to the car parks of their restaurant welcomes you. But I still found a free car park, I think. When you get out of the car, there are restaurants with left and right, some of them are cooling places on summer day. Here you can relax on the return. Here, Müzekart does not pass, you enter the area by buying tickets from the box office and a magnificent canyon welcomes you. Immediately after entering, you walk through a narrow bridge and reach the place where the water flows and you can go down to the canyon. It is strongly expressed that you have a hard hat on your head here. These hard hats are abundant in a box there. In this region, you flood the ice-cold water and start seeing the canyon. Although it is not easy to pass through this entrance area where water flows fastest, it can be full of fun. Passing by holding onto the existing rope and you have to be careful not to fall. After passing, you walk and enjoy in the imposing canyon in the water that flows lightly. I did not go to the end, even though I proceeded quite a lot. It was a really nice experience. I would recommend it to everyone."
It’s amazing ,It was very quiet when we went there but it was worth seeing it if you go winter time make sure you got right clothes
BEST DAY OUT! ,"I have visited the Saklikent twice now. It’s an amazing day out. Definitely recommend a visit here. We had so much fun. Walked through the gorge, knee deep, ( do not wear flip flops ) we also done the water rafting that i would highly recommend. Lunch was very yummy also! If you are gluten free it’s no problem. the lunch spot is absolutely stunning.... So glad we done another trip here ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
great day out,i would definitely recommend this adventurous trip. not very far from where we stayed. The stepping stones were a fun memory for kids as well as adults. Make sure to take good walking shoes /trainers.
Just keep walking!,"Like paragliding from Baba Dag near Olu Deniz, exploring the nearby Saklikent river gorge is a once in a lifetime experience everyone can afford and must not miss. You do not need any special training to do it and the views and photo opportunities are richly rewarding. Several tips: good shoes and comfy clothes for walking through knee-deep cold water, waterproof cameras only, by all means - go to the WC before entering. And the main point: try to reach as farther in the gorge as you can! The deeper you get inside, the more beautiful the surroundings get!"
A Must-Visit!,"Visited here for a second time recently, having first visited five years ago as part of a Jeep Safari. The Jeep Safari in itself was brilliant, but Saklikent was the highlight for us, and we wanted to go again to spend some more time there - you can feel a little rushed on the organised group tours as you have to travel from location to location, and don't always get to spend as much time in each place as you'd like!This year, however, we booked a private excursion through Volume Travel and we assumed this would just involve the hiring of the minicab and the driver to get to and from Saklikent, but we couldn't believe it when Ibrahim, our brilliant guide, offered to accompany us all the way along the gorge (despite him not bringing any swimming shorts!); we would have been unlikely to have ventured as far in as we did without him! I highly recommend taking a good pair of water/beach shoes - nothing that can easily come off your feet - as the water does run fast in some places, and the rocks can be quite slippery. Water shoes are available to rent there for a matter of a few lira, but they aren't the most comfortable - you're definitely best to bring your own. If you do venture further up the gorge, be aware that it does get quite deep, so wear something you're prepared to get wet up to your hips in, too! Aside from the gorge itself, for an additional fee, you can opt to zip-line across the river, or raft down the rapids. Across both of our visits, our whole family have had a turn at the rafting, for which there are a couple of price options, depending on how far down the river you'd like to go. The first time we visited, 5 years ago, it was a month or so earlier in the season, and a lot busier. For this reason I actually found the rafting a little daunting as there were so many rafts (and paddles!) everywhere. It looked a lot more enjoyable this year, with the river being so much quieter (almost deserted!) mid-October. There is a restaurant on-site, which although very inexpensive, really isn't the best quality. There are others round the corner, a little further down the river which we would choose to go to next time. A fantastic day out for the whole family to enjoy. It would be high on our list of places to return to (yet again!), next time we're back in the area."
Truly beautiful,It was too busy when I went here. I had to wait in the queue to buy ticket to enter the canyon/gorge but it was worth the wait. As far as I know this canyon is 17 kms long and you can walk it all over if you have time. The water is cold which is cool to get cooled in the hot waether ;). There is a rope to which you can hold and walk in the water to access the gorge. There are also places around where you can eat and drink. You can also have adrenaline sports such as rafting and bungee jumping.
skilikey wow day out,"scenary and park is a must to do..but buy you day tours in hisaronu or oledeniz , 10 or 12 pounds for the same tour  trip advisor is selling for 20 pounds plus...I've been going to this part of turkey for 20 years ."
Dramatic and well worth a journey inland.,It was very hot the day we visited the gorge and such a lovely surprise to find the pleasant coolness inside the gorge. Scenic journey up into the mountains by dolmus to reach Saklikent.
Beautiful  !! ,"Gorgeous place to visit,  you don't need the so called guides when you get there , it's easy to find your way , river rafting is so good , never laughed so much !!"
Wonderful ,"This nature spot you can easy visit by dolmus bus, leaving from the dolmus station near the mosque in the center of Fethiye. If you have a top up card it cost you 12,25 lira. The trip is about an hour but definitely worth it. Take water shoes or good slippers with you as you will have to walk a part in the water to see the canyon."
Super expérience! ,"Really cool and welcomed cold water in the hot summer months. Go early ! it gets packed wall-to-wall people. Wear good closed toe shoes and a waterproof bag for your camera. It’s a really different experience, we thoroughly enjoyed it!"
Not worth the journey,"Dirty, filthy toilets, come on guys this is the 21st century, you need to really raise your game. Food and drink too expensive on top of the parking and entrance fee."
Wonderful,"Amazing canyon. The cold waters are refreshing and giving you good energy. It's pretty normal that many tourists come around because of the beautiful view and the instagrammable spots, in which it wasnt overfilled in october. All in all a must do when you are in this area."
Gorge-ous,"We visited Saklikent as part of a day trip which included Patara historical site and beach. Saklikent was certainly the jewel as far as I was concerned. It is a spectacular geographical feature, and the opportunity to walk it was brilliant. Getting across the initial stream was a challenge but after that, walking the gorge was simple. We didn’t take a camera/phone/go-pro but hugely regretted it. If you can confirm it is water proof, then I highly recommend taking one as it is an amazing spectacle. We also participated in river tubing down the river from the gorge mouth which was also a great experience and a fun way to end the day."
Fun fun fun,"Brilliant fun. A wooden walkway takes you part way into the gorge where you can then choose to continue in the gorge through the rocks and running water. The water at the begining is fast flowing and freezing cold but there is a rope to help you get through this small crossing.  After that the water didnt seen as ice or rapid. You will need suitable footwear, we wore trainers which were perfect for the job. Saw lots of flip flops flowing past as people had struggled to keep them on!!! The rocks can be slippy so it is not suitable for anyone who is unsteady on their feet. Be prepared to get wet upto hip hight as some areas are a little deeper. We made  it go the first waterfall but couldn't go under it to see further on as I didnt want the contents of my rucksack  getting wet, wish I'd left it in the car!!!Went to the riverside cafe where the food was poor quality and overpriced but the setting was perfect.Definatly would go back"
Day rtrip,Beautiful location. Lots to do. Well worth a visit. Particularly enjoyed the river rafting. Food not great though
Amazing!,It is such an amazing National Park! We walked through Canyon and felt the nature. Water was cold but worth it.
Gorgeous Gorge,We came here after there had been quite a heavy rainstorm the day before. This was quite apparent as the water was quite cloudy. The Gorge is quite spectacular and evidently the second biggest in Europe. You can can walk quite a long way in time permitted by the tour but the rocks were quite slippery and didn’t fancy twisting an ankle or the like. The was also an opportunity to do rafting or have a go on a zip wire. We decided on something a little less strenuous and had our legs and feet nibbled by fish ! It was strange at first but I can now recommend it.
Water very cold but worth the trip!,"We visited this as part of our jeep safari. Once you have got through the very cold water at the start, it was interesting to see the rock formations. We also had our photograph taken at the end of it in a natural shower!"
"Great half day/day trip, very easy to do independently; practical info Sept/Oct 2019","From Fethiye white mosque take dolmus to Saklikent, it's the last stop so just look for the sign on the window (for cheaper dolmus tickets purchase Kenti Kart from any kiosk/store and add money on that instead of buying single ticket from the bus; Kart costs 8trl and gives you 1-3trl off every ride, you'll just need to tell the driver where you're going and then swipe the card on dolmus, it'll show you fare and remaining balance). The trip from Fethiye to Saklikent takes about an hour, buses leave every half hour and the last bus from Saklikent leaves at 19:30. Bus ride will take you through many nearby villages and the dolmus can get rather full during the trip but that's part of the authentic experience for us. There are changing rooms and toilets (1trl) before the entrance; entry to the gorge costs 6trl adult, 4trl student. You can buy ocean shoes right by where the dolmus stops, or rent them right at the beginning of the gorge itself. There will be people offering to guide you through the gorge but it's not at all necessary as the trip is not very demanding physically, just apply the usual caution and if not sure, check your step before taking it.The mud is rich in minerals and used by locals so feel free to get it all over you for the entire hike. You'll be able to easily wash it off in the water or small waterfalls that you'll pass. Saw bunch of locals carrying out the mud in bottles even :) Be prepared as in wear shorts/tank top or swimwear, either rent (10trl at Saklikent) or buy ocean shoes beforehand (15trl in stores in Fethiye), and pack your valuable items in ziplocks or similar into your backpack. You will get wet but entirely possible to carry your backpack so it won't soak. After the hike, the buffet nearby dolmus stop is a great place to chill and snack. A good plate of tomato-garlic sauce, aubergines, rice and yogurt sauce cost 20-25trl. Local pomegranate juice is a delight, small bottle cost 10trl and is more than enough. Nearby is another, much less visited gorge called Gizlikent, 20 minute walk uphill from Saklikent, didn't visit this time but will eventually. All in all would recommend doing this trip independently rather than paying 5x price to a tour company, but different strokes for different folk of course. Enjoyed the day in Saklikent and will return!"
A highlight of our trip (despite it being VERY crowded),"We had a wonderful day walking through the Saklikent Gorge and then having lunch on the river.  You start out the trek into the gorge by walking on a narrow wooden walkway (with railing).  Not far in, one must decide to stay on land or continue on in the water.  Most of the access to the gorge requires walking in the water.  This would not be good for someone with balance issues.  There are many people at the mouth of gorge.  We walked much farther in that most people, but it still took walking for quite a while to get away from most of the crowd.  The gorge is beautiful and worth seeing if you are a nature lover."
Great day out ,"My husband and I love it here - it’s one of our favourite trips and we do it every time we’re in the area. We book a day trip through Pioneer Travel which includes hotel pick up, a stop off at a traditional carpet factory (which is great, really interesting!), Saklikent, lunch at a trout farm and a visit to Tlos. Would highly recommend booking a trip as there is loads to do, and you get plenty of time at each attraction/site. Saklikent is beautiful, with lots to see and do and perfect picture opportunities. Suitable for everyone."
Superb visit ,"Words can't really describe this gorge, to get there, get the dolmus to Fethiye bus station, then get the bus that says Saklikent, it's about 9 lire each way, it takes about an hour, don't worry the bus goes through several small villages on the way, it does look like that you are not going there, just wait tho, you see signs for Saklikent Gorge club, this is the stop, you will know when you see it. There are self service restaurants, go over the bridge to the entrance it costs 8 lire to get in, some advice if it's you're first visit, wear clothes that you don't mind getting wet, don't wear flip flops, but wet shoes, there is some climbing to do, take a bag, be careful if you take a camera, I used a sling to keep my d90 safe, I recommend that you use a guide as some places deeper in the Gorge do require some help, find guide John, you pay a tip on you're return, (what you think its worth.) it's cold water at first, then you head up into this amazing place, the water fall is freezing. The return bus goes from where you get dropped off, have fun.This is John our guide."
summer holidays,"we went to saklikent with an excursion of Mobius, with the bus, we stopped by a Vcarpetfactory, then the sklikent, nice but not Wauw,lunch buffet, and Tlos very nice tour."
fun day out ,"We visited here yesterday ( 23rd of September2019) it was a lot of fun from the get to. We paid 5 lira for parking and 8 lira entry each which is pennies really. We saw the signs for footwear rental but didn’t really know what to expect so didn’t buy, maybe we were being stupid but maybe for those who don’t know they could advise footwear when buying tickets. As we had to do this barefoot as were wearing trainers  and we still made it to the top ( in much pain) but we did it we were very proud.We did the mud masks and my skin felt amazing after, I’m into a lot of beauty products and this is amazing. I washed it off at the waterfall at the top which was freezing but refreshing.all in all a day good day , but rent or buy shoes."
Good day out,Third time here over over last ten years and hasn’t really changed much.The whole site bit tacky and commercialised but the gorge is still worth a visit..Try it as part of a tour to the trout farm and the historic Tloss tombs and amphitheater.
Visit as advised by a Cypriot Friend.,"We visited after recommend by a friend.  Went Via Bus to Cathie and a second bus.  Easy, stay on BOTH buses til the end! There are people employed to direct you to the right bus.  Valley was lovely, the The tourists mainly locals. Corn and local tea at top. Saw a Hawk grey wagtails and unidentified little birds in the Pomigranate Orchard by the bus stop.  To walk up the Valley you pass an area where a strong current comes across.  TOP TIP: GOOD FOOTWARE BEACH SHOES! Flip flops will come off and go downstream.  You may trip so think about cameras and Phones and water! The Mud around the rocks is rich in minerals, locals use it as Mud packs, maybe take a plastic bottle to take some Home- back to your Hotel.   We went rafting on the rubber rings which was good, would recommend."
Such and amazing experience ,"We hired a jeep and drove to this place ourselves it was relatively easy to find. We found it to be very busy but it wasnt really and issue, naively we allowed a man to help us through the canyon which was probably unnecessary as at the end he obviously wanted money. Never the less it was still amazing the water is freezing and it can be difficult in places to get through as it involved climbing up a few rocks but not constantly, the clay under your feet is natural minerals so you can speRead it all over you to leave your skin feeling amazing at the end. When you reach the farest point you can wash under a natural shower. It was less that £20 each to enter the canyon as well and onsite is a little restaurant, also for those who cannot or dont want to go through the canyon you can float on rubber dingys around the park. If you're close enough to visit this place please do you will not regret it."
SAKLIKENT PARK,Absolutely fantastic place to chill out for the day whether you walk in the gorge’s freezing water or sit on the raised platforms above the water and gaze at this truly beautiful secluded Gorge.
Amazing,"We visited here courtesy of jet2 we had a fantastic day our guide Yusef was great. Yes it was busy but it would be because so may people want the chance to see it. Initially it was ice cold and the current was strong but if i can get through then most people can. We had taken water shoes with us but you can hire shoes. It is amazing, stunning, beautiful and a must see."
Too crowded on Saturday,"The place was packed out with mainly Turkish tourists on the day that we went. It meant that there were quite a few queues for water shoes, tickets etc so probably best to avoid Saturdays. It's nice to sit on the platforms above the river and have a meal and drink (food wasnt very good though). The gorge is accessed via a walk along a riverside platform and because of the crowds it wasn't clear how to enter the gorge. I went in the wrong section which was very rocky with fast flowing, painfully cold water. I had to turn back. The correct access point had many people coming and going with locals wearing flip flops, carrying children etc. I recommend taking a decent pair of water proof shoes as the pair that I rented were uncomfortable I didn't bother going back down the main entrance but my grown up son and daughter did and they enjoyed the walk into the gorge. If you have any mobility problems then I doubt that this would be for you.. Overall though it's a very interesting area and worth a visit, specially when part of a tour to other locations."
Truly excellent,"This place  is a big contrast from the beach resorts where people like us tend to gravitate towards. The gorge is beautiful, if somewhat treacherous in places. We were cornered by a guide at the entrance who helped us navigate. This cost about £20 and was well worth it as we would have turned back long before we actually did without his help.You need water shoes but try not to take much else other than camera, you won’t need much more that that.Amazing."
Stunning,Saklikent gorge is beautiful. Rock formations are amazing. Once you get through the initial cold water the water is shallow and warm. Def need water shoes as rocks are slippery and hidden under water. Well worth a visit.
Busy ,The place is packed but if you don't mind that it's beautiful. The river is fast moving so be careful
A natural beauty,A wonderful place. The gorge is fantastic but I reccomend either buying before you come or renting water shoes as these are definitely needed if you are going to go through the water and into the actual gorge
rafting and resting,"After the very soft but fun rafting experience (it is suitable for everybody, no danger at all) we had a nice day relaxing on the sofas upon the fresh creek. The place is fine but a bit crowded."
For Nature Lovers!,"It is a nice place to visit if you are a nature lover.Walking down the river, and having the chance to feel its refreshing water is beyond amazing.You can also buy corncobs and enjoy the delicious food!Many outdoor activities await you such as rafting!"
Very busy ,A lovely gorge but total rammed with people. Couldn’t hardly move. I wouldn’t advice going in August. Been before and wasn’t so bad think it’s  something you only need to see once.
Spectacular,"The gorge is spectacular and can be walked and waded through. A rivulet passes through it. At the mouth of the gorge seversl streams come together in waterfalls, forming a fair river.Do bring shoes which will allow you to do that or rent plastic shoes in situ. If you want to walk a fair bit be prepared to get your bum wet.The place is popular with Turks, which gives it a nice, bustling atmosphere."
Things To Know Before You Go,"We had a great day out at Saklıkent gorge but we wish we had known a few things before we went: - you definitely need water shoes - and they need to be comfortable as you will be walking for up to 2 hours.- don’t bother bringing towels with you - leave them in the car.- you need to take minimal things with you: water, a snack, suncream, your phone to take pictures! - put all your things in a RUCKSACK not a normal bag as there is one point where the water is waist high. It’s a great day out as long as you’re prepared!"
Geology beats commercialism,"The gorge experience is fabulous but the restaurant experience is a bit basic now.The geology of the gorge is amazing to walk through, including the initial cold water of the fast flowing river you have to cross. Once in the gorge the water is much warmer and shallower.Last time we went the restaurant at the opening of the gorge had menus and service but now it is a much more limited menu with you queuing up to get the food served. A change for the worse."
Great family fun,"We came here as a group of 9 ranging from age 13 to 50s.  Fantastic fun for the whole family. Felt really lovely and cool whilst temperatures outside the gorge were high 30s. The initial section is very cold and water can be thigh high in places, but after that mainly shallow, although there are some deeper sections. Good footwear/water shoes are essential and it can be slippery in places and there is a certain degree of hazard which probably wouldn't be allowed in the UK, but that does add that element of fun. Be prepared to get very wet and take appropriate clothing. At the end we had a lovely meal in one of the waterside restaurants back at the top, with traditional low level seating and hammocks suspended over the running water, a lovely end to a lovely day."
Great for adventurous individuals ,"Zip lining, rafting, walking in and around the canyon. Then having Turkish tea, lunch and ice cream with the family!Advice: wear appropriate clothing for each sport; purchase a waterproof case for your phone, have swim shoes/socks so you can walk by the gorge(some available to rent), sunscreen needed and your insect repellent band."
Fantastic!,"This is a fantastic place to visit but you must go well prepared! We went purely to walk through the gorge but there are other things to do there if you enjoy zip wires & riding down the river in a rubber ring! Places to eat and watch the river and relax are also available.You walk across a bridge to get to the gorge and you then have to scramble over slippery rocks to get into the very fast, icy cold river! I would strongly advise wearing rubber shoes, you can hire them at the gorge. We went with TUI and they advised us to wear yellow helmets in case of falling debris do we did. We were the only people with hats on! I wore a swimsuit with a short dress over it and that was ideal attire. My husband wore shorts and a top. Once you are in the river, the water went to the top of my thighs, you hold onto a thick rope to help guide you into the gorge. It is then a mixture of shallow water, slippery rocks, sandy mud and fantastic views of the gorge. We walked into the gorge for 40 mins and stopped then as the gorge became very narrow and it became more difficult to climb over the rocks.We loved the walk and looking at the gorge. So many different colours, shapes and heights to the gorge. It was a great experience."
A quiet walk at a Turkish beauty spot?,"This is a must see if staying in Fethiye.  It is about 40km from the town and an easy, well-signed drive to reach it.There is a small charge to enter, and you walk along an elevated wooden path above the river for a short distance to reach the waterfalls and the ford.  There are shops there selling drinks and snacks and seats  set in the water - abandon any thoughts of keeping dry.At this point you may wish to complete your visit and turn back.We chose to wade through the river to walk further into the gorge.  The river was very very busy with other visitors, all slipping and slithering through the fast flowing, ice cold water.  This was a challenging experience.Once at the end of the flowing river the walk was still quite slippy and wet.All that aside, the gorge is very beautiful and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience!Tip..... Be sure to hire some of the waterproof shoes from the various stalls (5Tl well spent) and do not carry anything likely to be damaged by water!"
A true adventure,"A real adventure for two 50 somethings and their 11 year old son. We were advised to get here early, so arrived around 9.30-10am. No queues for tickets or anyone on the raised walk to get into the gorge. Not like 3 hours later when there were hoards and hoards of people battling their way in. Take note and where good waterproof footwear (Keens or similar), swim ware, you are going to get very wet. We all want photos of our experiences but go very careful with expensive gear if it is not waterproof. Crossing the ice cold water at the entrance is your first and coldest part of the trip (apart from re crossing at the end!!) Part way along we met an official guide who tagged on to us. Maybe we looked up for an adventure and were wearing the right gear. Who knows, all I know is we could not of got to the very end without him. From here on in we were treated to explore the gorge to the end waterfall.  You will need to be up for an adventure to get there. Lots of clambering through small holes and climbs of 3-4 meter on slippery rock, deep water and very sticky mud to navigate. In my opinion this should only be done with an official guide who knows the area, and is going to turn themselves into a ladder (literally) for you climb on their legs and shoulders to get up steep slippery sections. We got to the end waterfall something not many can say. A great achievement for us and to swim in and under the waterfall was a great experience  Our guide then got us safely back, where we were more than happy to pay his fee for treating us to a true adventure. Thanks Jan (John) you really made our day."
A must do if in the area,"Only a 40 minute drive from Kalkan (taxi return trip 340TL) this natural site is truly beautiful. You walk/wade through the gorge so swimwear and wet shoes are a must. Also a waterproof bag for valuables (phone, money etc). You will get wet !!Highly recommend the separate activity based from the restaurants of tubing down the river, safe but lots of funMain advice is get there EARLY. We got there at 9:30 and that was perfect"
Excellent day out! ,Some Turkish friends took us here yesterday and it was fantastic! Well worth the trip and only 8lira to get in!! Our children loved it! Tip: take minimal stuff with you as walking through water etc was hard carrying a bag with towels etc in (we packed prepared as didn’t know what we needed) really all you need is a camera - the views are breath taking! Loads of local eatery options there too - we had an amazing meal on the water!
Rent a car and get there early - but so impressive,"We parked for 6TL, and entry is 24TL for 2 adults and 2 children, so pennies in total for a half day out.Get there by 10am as the crowds were there by 12.30pm who were terribly unpleasant - 4th August...heaving by then. People brining strollers too...who does that!?So we had a great day as we got there early, but take good grip water shoes, as health & safety is non-existent.You walk up the flowing gorge which is so beautiful and steep almost in a cave the whole way. Take a waterproof camera too.We then came out and went up the other end of the village away from the restauramt with sofas on the same flowing gorge which everyone goes to, and you will find a very lazy restauramt seating style with hammocks and sofas on a small stream. The food was so cheap and the remaining day was so relaxing. Free bucket of bread with meals too. Go in a tour and I suspect it would be exhausting, so go private (car rental £25 a day)"
Jeep Safari Stop,This was just a quick visit. I would have preferred more time here as it was all rushed if you wanted to enter the canyon/gorge and also maybe float down the river in an inflatable tyre with paddle. It appears to have extended since my last visit with multiple zip wires on offer also. Can be a right sun trap. I would have liked to have gone to the gorge but only being allowed 40 mins to get there and get back to our jeep put me off. If you want to spend a decent amount of time here I would book it as a separate trip. Can be quite costly by the time multiple people do multiple activities. The gorge was only 8tl to enter which is just over a pound and the river paddle was a tenner per head. I dont know what they charged foe the zip line as I didnt do it.
Gorgeous Gorge!  Zip lines and water rafting and lunch in the river,"Most trips to Saklikent are through tour operators and include lunch.  We went once with Intrepid tours and ate in the river which had seats in the river, and a second visit with Survivor 4x4 jeep safari, where we ate at the top of the gorge and walked down to the waterfall, but then drove to the main bottom of the gorge.Access to the gorge is about 6TL and is worth it.  Once past the small waterfall, you can trek up as far as you want (4km).At the bottom part they offer zip lining across the river and ringo rafting / tubing down the river.  Both are priced at 75TL but you can haggle down if you're a family etc.  We got it for 60TL each (2x adults, 2x teens and 1x eleven year old).  Tubing is well worth it.  Ziplining is short and like a mini go-ape.  The kit is a little old and ropey.Go, you won't regret it!"
You have to be sporty!,"Visited this place with my boyfriend last week. It’s a beautiful place, but be sureto bring watershoes. It’s very very hard to walk here. We are both athletic, but still it was tough! You are climbing under and over big rocks, it’s slippery at some place and there is a strong current. My boyfriend has a problem with his ankle and it was almost impossible for him to walk here. Tip; go fun rafting overthere, its so much fun!"
Saklikent park,"Reaching this national park was easy even though the road is narrow and not too much signs.Very special place, extremely cold natural water even in mid August"
The gorge walk is well worthwhile ,"The gorge walk was a great trip but not for the faint-hearted or anyone who is not up for an adventure. That said people of all ages and physique were enjoying the challenge. Parking is free of charge and it's not expensive to get in - 8 lira per adult, 4 lira per child/student. It's also worth planning ahead just a little. So some ideas to consider:1. Get there as early as you can - ok, we went there during Turkish holiday time so there were hoards of locals but actually the fact that this wasn't just a tourist trap for unwitting foreigners was great. Doing the gorge before rafting down the river meant we missed a long queue for the gorge.2. Don't take loads of gear with you. Get a waterproof pouch for a phone, money and car key. You can buy a pouch in one of the stalls for 15 lira.3. Footwear: wear jelly shoes. Flip flops and sliders are likely to come off and then you'll be barefoot which wouldn't be good. Trainers would also work but they will get muddy. 4. Clothing: whatever you like but you will get wet. Even if you only do the first bit you will go into water up to your knees at least. Shorts and tee shirt are fine. We saw some topless men but if you're going right into the gorge you should have a tee shirt on.5. Helmets are available for you to pick up and wear. Few people did take them and for most people they aren't necessary. If you're planning on going deep into the gorge it would be better to be safe than sorry.6. Once you're beyond the entrance and in the reception area there are guides who will offer to help you. Again a deep exploration of the gorge would warrant hiring the service of a guide. I can't say how much they are because we didn't use one. Consequently we got to a point where we could work out the route but not the method for conquering it. That was the point of our return.7. Prepare for the unexpected. A lot of the time you will be walking through muddy water unable to see where you are putting your feet. The rocks can be slippery and it's not unusual to step lower into water than you expect!8. The first water you enter at the start is fast flowing and very cold. Once you are through that the water is slower and not so cold.9. Don't forget to stop from time to time and look up and tale in the view. The rock formations are stunning but if you are always looking at your feet you won't even notice them!Enjoy!"
Stunning,Beautiful and breathtaking walking through this gorge. Was quite difficult in places especially for young children. The fresh water was so cold but refreshing. The scenery was a sight not to be missed and a chance for some stunning photography.
Fantastic site,"Absolutely fantastic site. Even the ride to the site, drive by little villages, etc.. are part of a really nice experience. The canyon entrance has plenty of facilities and activities to prep for a long hike or do white water rafting or simply get rest. The canyon itself is amazing, easy hike on the man made pathway which then turns into a moderately challenging hike in the water. In any developed country, the authorities would prohibit hiking through thigh deep white water which is perfectly fine and allowed in here, and that's also what makes the experience fun. I noticed it's quite common to apply the natural clay as face mask or write stuff on marble rocks with it. It's also very pleasant thing to spend the day there when it's extremely hot, as the canyon is well protected, and the white water is very very cold. Must experience."
Wonderful,Bert nice  trip to go with a family!We went 4 times and we loved it so much.We had a great time .The personnel is very helpful and friendly especially for kids.There are nice shop reasonable in price as well.
Very busy,"When we went it was wall to wall people. I suggest you take waterproof shoes, you will probably get a little further up the gorge which was quite spectacular except for the throng."
Superb day out in great surroundings!,"Saklikent is an excellent destination. White water rafting, zip wire, chill out zones and the excellent Saklikent gorge. Organised trips, which include a mud bath, a Lucian Ampitheatre and the wonderful Patara beach is an absolute must."
Nice and cool,"Very nice place to visit at summer time the running water is cold and it makes you feel refreshed my kids aged 7,10 and 12 loved going and playing with the mud .. it cured skin rash that one of my kids have ... Was a good experience"
Good to see,Visited here with a family of 5 and enjoyed seeing the gorge - beautiful sceneryCost 8lira each so 40 in total which is about £6 totalPersonally I think it is extremely dangerous for small children and wouldn’t take one there but lots of people did.The water is freezing but beautiful- do wear swim shoes n not flip flops as the rocks etc will hurt your feet7lira to park so about a £1 and the toilet needs coins 1 lira for using it Very cheap and the toilets were good condition and clean.Spent a morning here and is nice to see!
Great experience,We visited Saklikent gorge as part of a day trip with Alibaba tours in Fethiye. The gorge is stunning. Make sure you wear shoes with some form of grip as you are walking through the water and there are rocks/ pebbles underfoot. They sell these or you can hire them prior to entry to the gorge at a low price. We arrived early afternoon and it was really busy. We also had the opportunity to go on the zip wire or rafting. My son and I went rafting in inflatable rings. The views were fantastic. I would definitely recommend  a visit
OMG,"A natural beauty in the hands of inappropriate people, the coffee shop built in the middle of the gorge. They are out of their mind not to protect this wonderful place better, so many people visit without adequate shoes or dress, so many of them throw their cigarettes around or the bottles. It was just horrific to see it all, we could not enjoy the beauty of it and are very disappointed..."
Place where I will back ,"Full of fun and enjoy, crossing curves by running water 12-14C I will keep in my memory so long. Special shoe and water protector for phone & camera must be if you decide walk more then 200 m"
"Rafting Good, Everything Else Just OK. ","We visited here as part of a day trip via Mobius. As we were only here for 2 hours we didn't have time to walk up the gorge, but instead the kids went on the zip wire and then we all went rafting. Been in the park for 5 minutes and it had already cost me £65. Kids enjoyed the zip wire which took you over the river and then a bus ride back. Rafting was quite enjoyable, the water was a beautiful shade of turquoise and COLD!! The only downside was all the life vests we were given for the rafting absolutely stunk of BO. Another downside was the amount of flip flops which had fallen off people's feet and lay abandant on the river bank. Also thought the park was far too commercialised and took away the natural beauty of the place. Would I go back? Probably not, but the rafting was fun."
Enjoyable Day out at the Gorge but I wouldn't recommend going with Focus Tours,"We did the day excursion from Calis five years ago with Seaside Travel and then again this July with Focus Tours. The Gorge is worth a visit and we enjoyed wading through the water for the short time we had there. Last time we went the 'Seaside' guide gave us lots of information about the gorge and then afterwards at Tlos too. He walked round with us part way to show us. This time, having booked with Focus they subcontracted out to a company called Moibus. The guide Deniz told us very little indeed. He simply asked if we wanted him to come over and help us buy our tickets. He completely left us to it and at Tlos too. We all got home early after being treated to a visit to the obligatory carpet factory too. All in all  I'd recommend a visit but the guide and company you choose to book with does make a huge difference.My kids enjoyed the dingy ride down the gorge five years ago. We decided it was too expensive and too rushed this time for all of us."
A great day out,"Get there early. Ideally before 10am. That way you can park close to the entry. We did buy waterproof shoes which was a bit of a con, but thought of it as a local tax! It’s a great place to visit but it has become quite commercialised in the past 10-15 years. Tickets to enter, stalls to go through, camera photos, official guides. Some of the charm has been lost but still a great experience. Don’t be stupid and hand carry your iPhone! It will get wet or broken. Do wear loose fitting clothes that can get wet - they will. You do need to be quite fit to get through some of the areas where boulders have fallen and the water is rushing. With some help, most able bodied folks will get through."
Go during the week.,"Beautiful location and only 8tl entrance fee. We didn’t have a guide and managed fine. It would be really difficult though for people with mobility issues or small children. Can’t believe that we saw so many people clambering over the rocks and into fast flowing water while carrying babies!! Or people attempting to walk through fast flowing water and over slippery rocks wearing 3” heels (not joking!),The gorge is beautiful and worth seeing. It’s just such a shame they don’t limit the entrance numbers. There’s no health and safety to speak of and we didn’t see any facilities for first aid. The cafe inside the gorge is self service and tea/coffee/cold drinks are available at ok prices. Be prepared to be sitting next to chain smokers though, nobody seems to care less about passive smoking!! By the time we left I felt like I’d passively smoked 200 cigarettes!! So much for the fresh mountain air! We’ve been to the gorge on the weekend and it is so crowded it seems unsafe. It’s worth visiting during the week and going earlier. Rubber beach shoes are a must and can be hired inside the gorge for 5tl or new pairs can be bought for 20tl. We bought ours as £3 seemed a small price to pay to avoid verrucas or fungal nail!  All in all, the gorge is worth a visit"
A must visit cooling scramble up through the gorge,"It is initially a little chaotic and the first feel of the icy mountain water is a shock but continue through the gorge and it calms down. It is worth agreeing a price for the help of a local guide and either buy or hire wet grippy footwear.It would probably not pass Uk H&S risk assessments but that is part of the fun.Certainly need a bit of fitness and not for the less mobile.Try to park your car under shade and if you want to make a full day, try rafting or paddling a ring down stream"
Great fun!,"Went here as part of a trip, loved it its awesome! water is freezing which is lovely, walked down the rapids, and up the gorge through the mud, thoroughly enjoyed!"
"Great experience, nice way to beat the heat and get some cooling shade,","Not too strenuous and fun for a half day, we took the Ottogar / Dolmus bus from Kalkan, cheapest way, but check first on schedule You can taxi as well if you want. No need for guides or to book with anyone, just show up pay and do it on your own. Now about payment, no credit cards and no Euro taken. Go with Turkish Lira, July 2019 is was 8tl for adults and 4tl students/ kids, very affordable. Also, take water shoes, water socks, decent sandals you do not mind getting wet. You will only be in water up to you mid thigh, depending on your height. No gad checks, so waterproof bags are a good idea for phones, etc, there are merchants selling waterproof pouches to wear around your neck if you wish, many people were buying them. We used common plastic bags and my back pack and had no issues. Rental shoes are available and also for purchase, 4tl to buy and 3tl to rent. Food and drinks available decent enough selection, no need to pack a lunch, we were there for four hours due to bus schedule and that was enough time certainly if you are walking in all the way. About one hour travel time by bus each way via Kalkan. We were caught without lira for the day and managed to find someone to convert euros with. Also did not notice the pay as you go, literally at the Ottogar washroom, guy not impressed I had no lira and both myself and daughter really had to go, skipped out and pretty sure was being cursed at in a Turkish. We know better now. Last note the cold part in the water is very short and worth it, about 50m, after that the water temp is very tolerable."
Spectacular Gorge but slightly spoiled by all of the commercial enterprises at the entrance.,We walked about a mile into the Canyon and the further we went the fewer people there were so we took some great photos. It is quite easy going if you have the right footwear and well worth the effort the further in you go. Thoroughly enjoyed that experience but the area around the entrance is spoiled by too many people trying to sell you activities or food/ drink etc which is why this hasn't received a 5th star.
You will be surprised,"We visited this area as it was recommended from many people. It is basically an area where it has a river, they have put all their tables on top of the river, a great idea. The food is good but dont expect much. You can go for rafting or paragliding.. talk a walk between the two mountains to see the source of the river from within rocks and trees. It was a great afternoon visit."
Day Visit to Saklikent Gorge,Well worth a visit and a great day out. We walked the entire length of the gorge but one word of caution - As we got into the river to start the walk we were assisted by one of the official helpers which was very useful as he knew all of pitfalls and there are a few challenging climbs on the way. However he was expecting to be paid for this. We were going to offer him a tip any way as he had been very good but I did hear stories of people being asked for 300 Lira
Beautiful nature,"Very nice place to visit, you can walk through water but need water shoes,or just enjoy the rest of place, service is available , food & drinks also along the river are ok"
must do,This place is amazing loads of things to do and wonderful restaurants with waterfalls which you can sit by the stream nice and cool place.
Good on a hot day,"You will need some plastic/boat shoes - can get near the entrance for 15-35tl.  I read that you must get it before going because it costs a lot, not true.  I bought a pair for 55tl before going! But these shoes are a must, we kept seeing Flipflops going down the river.  It’s is stoney and rocky and the flow is quite rapid and wearing open shoes are just silly..  Water is ice cold- my feet and my kids‘ couldn’t last in the water for more than 5min - water was suppose to be warmer in the canyon.  Apparently, you cannot go into the canyon without a guide (says the sign - but we know it’s like the Wild West here, no one follows rules). It’s not at all suitable for children under 8.  Just the first bit, the water is butt dip - for my 5 year old, I would have had to carry her across.  We took some pics and left.  We ate at the nearby restaurant with the water flowing past us that was kind of cool. Especially with floating Flipflops!"
Nature at its best,"You will need to have strong rubber shoes, and be prepared to get wet to get the maximum experience of this natural scenic place."
visited before,we had a stop off here on our jeep safari you can walk along the river bed or they now have benches which are in the river and you can sit here and cool off after your walk also you can purchase food and drink
Eğlenceli bir macera (Terlik Getirmeyi Unutmayın),"Saklikent makes for a fun adventure with friends or family. We walked upstream against the current to a beautiful waterfall. Great for those who enjoy nature and don't mind a hike or getting their hands a little dirty. It's best to go with others to work together and share the view, worth the experience. Warning: you should bring water shoes (although you can rent as well for 4 TL) and dress accordingly for the outdoors (the water reaches up to mid-thigh or so at some parts of the river)"
Great Alternative day out,"Went by taxi to saklikent from olu deniz as we didn't fancy the full trip. Cost £65 return, including a trip to another waterfall and the taxi driver waiting for us. Paid additional 7 tl to enter the gorge, initially it is a wooden walkway and seating areas but then if you want to explore you need sea shoes, or to rent some very cheaply there. The water is initially icy cold, then have to tackle the gorge to the waterfall, we didn't quite make it as it was extremely rocky, slippy And the water was quite high level due to bouts of rain, the gorge was initially shut due to danger on arrival. There is an ice cream shop, rafting, Turkish pods to get lunch on the river etcIt was a great day our and glad we did it ourselves rather than the full day trip"
Gorge-ous,"Alright a little pun but this place is beyond this world so beautiful and amazing with water flowing chilling mountains trees everything that you possibly want (well) you can find, definitely recommend."
We love it!,"Third visit to Saklikent. We love it here, but the best advice is to arrive early to beat the crowds. We don't walk the gorge (arthritic knees), but it is magical to sit with your feet in the cold water, enjoying nature and the awesome power of the water. Great to see the addition of a sloped access in addition to the stepped part of the walkway this year so it is completely wheelchair accessible now. The only reason I didn't give 5 starts is that H&S is a bit hit and miss, but if you are sensible and careful, you will be fine!"
Stunning place,"Absolutely gorgeous place, we were taken here by animals excursions, we walked up the gorge which is stunning, then had the fun trip tubing down the river, all sorted by Animals excursions, animal made the trip amazing with so much knowledge! Well worth a visit, and made better with the wealth of knowledge from Animal!"
Great And Wet Hike,"After reading reviews (apparently not well enough) my husband and I decided to make the trip out here from Ölüdeniz.  We didn’t intend to really swim or anything, just wanted to hike it and see the gorge.We read that water was at most knee deep but that was far from the case. It wasn’t a big deal but had we known better we would have worn clothes we were ready to get wet in. At some points further in the gorge the water was as high as waist level and we were jumping on top of boulders and then back off them into deeper and muddy water on the way back.We didn’t make it all the way to the waterfall but plan to return next time wearing better clothes and go all the way. We didn’t hire a guide and found that if we came across a challenging spot we could just wait around and watch how others (including the guides who are familiar with the terrain) approached it and follow suit. We worse open toed hiking sandals and found those to be sufficient. The water was really cold at the very beginning but once you get past the part at the very beginning with water rushing over boulders the water got warmer.We loved it and hope to come back with friends!"
Beautiful place ,"What a beautiful  place Need water shoes and the river current is strong Could nt  go that far into  the gorge , Lovely areas to sit and lovely little gift shops .Fresh pomegranate juice was yummy !We did the river tubing which was hilarious and great fun but don't ask to be tied to your partner ( adults only ) The current can be quite strong but not deep and you can ground  yourself in the shallow bits , would of been easier if we were not tied together ( at my request )"
Average Rafting,"It's not crazy, but it's okay, I liked the coldness of the water. If you want some nice fresh fish, that's the place to go; ask for Memet!"
Soo Cold,"Been there to do rafting, it felt great because we had lots of sunburn and the cold cold water felt like a tsunami on my skin. The nature is amazing, though it was quite crowded."
"MUS-GO: beautiful, adventurous and fun!","Joined day trip for transfer, paid ₺8 admission each person; May 31 not too busy; spent happy and fun 2 hours here at Saklikent Canyon 11-1pm! From entry, we walked n a well constructed path along the cliffs with rapid water beneath! Just about 5 minutes, we could see the beautiful hidden canyon and rush running water and streams. We stayed on the dry sides and admired the gorges and scenery for a little while!  So beautiful, hesitating no more, we rented wet shoes for ₺5 each, then bravely and carefully walk on rapids and muds, with feet soaked in refreshing cold water! Super fun as we’re stabilized each step and holding hands to keep the balance. Staff  renting out shoes occasionally come out to help people to cross the water for free! There was a rope for people to use while crossing but we didn’t use it! We zip-zap crossing the rapids and streams five times! The last one, we were bravely enough to cross the most fast running stream, so much so much fun! For those who do not want to adventure at all, there is a very nice rest area to soak in quiet shallow stream water just to enjoy Turkish Tea or Coffee!!!The park also provides other activities like zip lining, rafting and buffet lunch which we didn’t try!"
Incredible place,This place is incredible. You will feel so tiny between the high rocknountains. In summer it is a real nice a nd cool place. Take a walk trough the fresh but icy cold water. It is wonderfull.
Excellent,"Great views good to go and see. Water is freezing, you must go and experience it, once in a life thing. Loved it. Also joined a rafting activity which was about 15 minutes, 70 Lira per person but was worth it. Also natural mud sources which you can rub onto your skin.A must visit if you have enough time in hand"
Nature standing beautiful,"We did visit this place with young kids and older members of family and only walked part of it as the water is too fast, which we were aware of but still worth a visit. We walked a short part and then had lunch. There are a lot of places to eat. Great experience eating next to nice cool water in the heat."
Very beautiful canyon,One of beautiful canyons in the world. The nature is unbelievable beautiful. Need to take with you swimwear and sea shoes.
Beautiful experience ,"The gorge itself was beautiful - amazing experience which I’d highly recommend! The spring you reach through the gorge was amazing! Fresh flowing, clear water which is also drinkable for anybody wanting to try natural spring water (though it’s difficult to position yourself to do this). Lunch was included with our visit which was great and we were able to enjoy comfortable and peaceful surroundings whilst others could do activities such as white water rafting and zip lining. Also a pool for anyone wanting to swim or sunbathe! The zip lining was ok - I wouldn’t do that part again by t that doesn’t take away from the amazing time we spent here!A bit further from the gorge itself they had some beautiful shaded hammock areas over water which I would have loved to spend time in as it looked beautiful!"
Trip,"Nice place to visit , really beautiful nature and the do not forget to take your student card there will be half price off."
You have to add here in your list if you travel to Kaş or Fethiye,"I have been here with my car, it’s not hard to access actually there was public transportations from Oludeniz Beach and Fethiye city center but i have no idea about from Kas. There is small average quality food restaurant in the entrance, and car parking is not free. Prices are normal in the restaurant not expensive for touristic place. Before you come here i want to inform everyone that wear something makes you better to move. Also before you start to explore here you have to rent shoes if you don’t have because there is stones in water and you can’t walk against them. When you do all of them, go to the deepest place :) when you go deeper water comes to above your legs and there are big holes into water when you go deeper be careful about it."
Great fun,We went during a planned jeep safari.We are st the trout restaurant and food was buffet. The gorge was great.We went down the rapids on the tubes great fun- expect a bruised bottom.If you have kids do tie them to you as a lady did panic when she couldn’t see her daughter but all was fine.
Nothing much!,We went on a quiet day in april.there was only 3cars in the parking lot but anyway we still went.paid our entrance fee and had a walk thru.the river current was quite strong as it rained the previous night.We chose our shoes on the rack to use so we can we walk down beside the river and ohhh boy the water was freezing and of course we weren’t able to cross the river as it’s not very safe so we just took some pictures here and there.They should’t take whole amount of entrance fee if the area is closed during bad weather anyway it was worth a try
Saklıkent kanyonu,Beautiful place to see the real craziness of nature. You are taken walking in the canyon through the strong River. Remember shorts or swimsuit as you get wet. The park has also zipliners and rafting.
"Gorge not open after 500yds, but don't tell you that, not worried about entrance fee as minimal, but day wasted !","Long journey to get there, only for it to not be open 500yds in, of course they don't tell you that, you simply find out 5 mins later as you round the corner and its all taped off ....goodness knows what the hoards of coavh parties thought who had given up their day and not a small amount if money for the tour  .... it was non existent !"
Out of season visit ,"I found Saklikent Gorge a bit more obviously touristy than other places around the same area.  It’s the only place I’ve had to pay to go to the bathroom in this area, even Pammukale didn’t charge for a loo stop.  Whilst the entrance fee is a bargain, when we went, the upper gorge was closed off, I assume because the waters were too high.  However, it didn’t obviously say this anywhere at the entrance, so we paid for a 3 minute (admittedly very scenic) walk through the canyon to a small grass bank.   This was the end of the road and we went back, total time in attraction - 8 minutes."
Nature,"Well worth a visit, your imagination will go off in a tangent somewhat wondering what if, stuff like what would happen if a flash flood happened , what if all them rocks came down on us, should I be wearing a hard hat (not they it would help if one of them boulders fell on my head).You can then go tubing down the river from here which is fun."
Canyon,"There attractions like canyon walk, rat rafting, mud bath, relaxation fish lunch. Price of rat raft differs from 30 - 40 lira depens on tour provider."
Great day trip.,"To get into the gorge you have to cross an ice cold river which is fast flowing.  There is a guide rope which helps!  It’s always cool inside the gorge and the further up you go the more of a scramble it is, a stream runs down the gorge and there are pools to wade and rocks to climb over.  Teens love it.  After you exit the gorge there are restaurants serving fresh Trout and chips whilst lounging on a platform over the river.  You can hire a ring to float further downstream which is fun."
Don't miss it,"A very beautiful bond between human and natural, healing skin mud, great cup of tea beside the natural water flow. great for all."
Jeep Safari,One of the places we visited while on a jeep safari. Excellent place to visit but I would recommend rubber shoes for walking through the rapids. Only 6 lira entrance fee and well worth the money.
Beautiful Sakklikent,"We went with some friends to see the gorge first and then went to eat in the riverside chill out area. The Gorge: Not suitable for anyone with mobility issues or back problems! You need water shoes (some areas provide them for a small fee, but they’ve been worn by other people).The rocks in the water are very slippery and uneven, the water is very cold as well. Nice to go on a hot day, very refreshing and in the deeper areas, you can rent inflated rubber rings and oars and go rafting! In the back entrance to the gorge, there are lots of steep steps, which is a massive task for elderly, low mobility and young children. The river-side chillout areas are fantastic, you can order food and drinks and relax - it’s really nice and cool if you’re not up to the gorge.It’s a massive site with lots of areas to explore and chill and there is a children’s area to explore also!If you want a certain area or attraction, there are staff dotted about, just ask for assistance. This place is excellent for active people who want a good day out!"
Saklikent,Used to be a nice place to visit but has now deteriorated into an overpriced tourist trap.if you have never been maybe worth a look but don't go back
"Great to explore, More than just the Gorge","When we went to Saklikent Gorge, the water level was pretty low. But not too low, because you still had to use the budy system to get across the fast flowing freezing waters, where a rope was used. It was a stunning place and wonderful to see. It is a site that should not be missed. There is not just the gorge, you can do rafting as well.Give it a must see, you will not be disappointed."
Excellent gorge with many small natural waterfalls,Excellent gorge with many small natural waterfalls A natural green stream of water running between mountains with small waterfalls
Stunning natural wonder,"This place is a must if you are anywhere near, the gorge is very narrow in places and has sheer sided towering cliffs. Entrance to the gorge is via a pathway suspended from the cliff wall, after about 300 meters you can descend to the riverbed where depending on the time of year you can hike down the gorge, the water is very cold and flows quite strongly. Good walking shoes are needed if walking down the gorge."
Another must see,"Travelled here on a Saga tour and realised fitness essential to visit here. The canyon is some 18 kilometres deep, with steep sided rmulti coloured cliffs and icy, icy cold streams. A footbridge takes you to the entance, but to get inside you have to wade through an icy cold fast running river, holding onto a rope,  or companion! Not for the unsteady but worth visiting nonetheless.."
Visit day.,"This was a lovely place to visit but wear sturdy shoes that are strapped to feet, as the current is very strong and flip flops not suitable as the many flip flops floating by testified to lol.There are lovely little sit by the river decking areas to sit on and have lunch , very pretty.The water is very cold as it is high in the hills and has mountains around it so lovely fresh but cold water.Well worth a visit ."
Rocky canyon,Great fun wading across the river and going into the deep canyon!Lovely scenery and a different day out. Best to wear old trainers for wading to protect your feet as it is rocky and uneven in places we found.Very impressive and pretty .
Day out ,Unfortunatly we could not go up the gorge due to heavy rain following a thunderstorm .only a £1 each to go in
Impresive miracle of nature spoiled by mass turism,"The gorge stayed at the top in our list of To-do activities around Patara. Stunning miracle of nature which unfortunately was intensively commercialized. The place around the entrance remains rather a loud oriental bazar separated from the gorge by a barrier with a cash point: long line of souvenir stands, food galleries, restaurants, shoe rentals, parking space. The gorge is overcrowded. We also followed the pilgrim procession in the ice-cold stream along shady natural corridor and then drunk hot tee in one of small tee houses trying to imagine how this fantastic place would have liked without people."
Must visit the gorge,"We paid for a jeep safari, £9 i think, we visited a few places , saklikent gorge is a must what a lovely place very busy , food we had was spot on , fisk or chickent and a salad buffet , plenty of food, and it was included in the price, a truly great day out, will be back for sure"
Fun day,Great day out with tour guide had a laugh and fun experience you get to cross the river in the gorge and walk through ice cold water from the mountains well worth the money. Cheap to enter a trip to definitely book.
Adventure,"Exciting day at the gorge.lots of outdoor activities - rafting,bungy jumping,zip wire etc.Great place to watch and eat huge  home -made Turkish pancakes"
So beautiful,"Make sure you walk to the back of the gorge to the duck pond, you will find eutopia- the prettiest spot ever."
Worth a visit,I did not get to saklikent this year but have been loads of times and never been disappointed.  The only down side now from when i first visited is that there are loads more people and it has been made safer and more commercialised but if you have'nt been before it won't matter to you and you will have a great time.
Must see,"Apparently it's the third biggest gorge in Europe, well worth a look - only a day trip from Olu Deniz"
Magical,"Great day out....suggest you hire your own taxi to take yo7 there, much cheaper than the organised trips"
You don’t have to get wet on a visit,"We visited here in October an got there early 10.30am by car. Official car park is very close to gorge entrance and was very quiet. You can enter the George and walk a short distance along the suspended walkway, at the end of the walkway is an open area with a small basic cafe. Here you can chose to sit a while or decide to get wet. Worth a visit it’s very pretty"
Jeep Safari,Great visit although cut short by a storm. Did river rafting which was fun. Chose not to walk along Gorge this time as have done many times before. There was a storm brewing so just got on with the river rafting.
Great,"Excellent day out as part of the jeep safari.. recommended 100%.. be prepared to get wet.. food nice, and everyone was friendly on arrival."
day out,this was lovely to see. i jumped in the pool of water and lasted 45 secs i thought i had taken a stroke my body went inot shut down mode as it was around minus 3 .i was out the water literally and the sun was so hot i was dry in 10 mins.there are other little walks and you can sit and have a pancake. there is a bar which has a cirlce of fresh water in it and there are trout swimming that you can touch gently before you order them to be cooked!!!!
Nice Experience,Saklikent is a nice place to explore the beautiful nature.You can walk in Mountain crevice and there are some activities you can do it like a self rafting.
Beautiful,A lovely day with the kids. Very young children may have to be carried. There is a fantastic zip line available and water rafting. A swimming pool with loungers also there for those who want to relax. Such a picturesque place to visit.
Amazing,Is a most enjoyable experience. Beautiful scenery and amazing gorge and spring water. Sensible shoes a must for full experience .
Amazing,Wow we did a private trip to here & it was amazing. I would definitely recommend suitable water shoes for walking into the water which is a must. Really amazing views & a must do if visiting the fethiye area.
Wonder of the world!!!,It blows my mind to see such an amazing natural attraction in the world. Only thing i wish i wore shoe to walk further. I will be back. Had sweet corn there that was an amazing end to it all
What a Day,"Our visit here is was Amazing, age group 19-55, what an experience, a guide definitely recommended if you want to get to the end, we didn’t have one but , near the end hi jacked one, who got us there and we tipped him on the way back. My 19 year old said it was the best day he’s had out ( that included a nearby bungee jump)"
Great day,"I'll start with a warning. .getting to the end is very hard work!! Up very slippy rocks and through chest deep water. The good news of course is you dont have to go the end to enjoy this place!! Fresh spring water fed rivers at the bottom to paddle through, and a stunning walk through the gorge (as far as the 400m mark!)can be done by anyone with minimal exertion. Water shoes recommended as even the shallows are slippy, they can be hired for about 3 lira. Together with an entrance fee of 7 lira, and plenty of restaurants to relax in after your exertions. It is easily reached via dolmus (from fethiye it leaves regularly from bus stop by the mosque)it makes for an inexpensive but excellent day trip."
Brilliant ,Visited the gorge as a stop off on an excursion with Animal excursions. We paid a small fee to enter the gorge it’s high rock faces and flowing water were amazing to see there is a great restaurant riverside which is cheap also and you can sit on tables that are in the river. There is many activities available on site we did the rubber ring rafting which was a lot of fun!!!!
Saklikent wonderful as usual,"So much more to do than last time we visited, you can do white water tubing, zip line and fish nobbling your feet. great value for money through the gorge at £1 only"
Cold water in the rocks.,"Everything is warm.Only water is cold.Amazing nature is full of everything.Clean water, clean air, good here.Raft is fan and crazy.Speed on raft is slow.Teenagers can get it."
Amazing,"We did this walk with Turkish friends and it’s an absolute must if you enjoy a beautiful walk wading through water. Make sure you have good water shoes and a light weight jacket as it can get surprisingly cold in the shade. After the walk we visited a fish restaurant (I can’t remember it’s name)  just down past the car park, near a river. This had to be one of the most memorable meals I have ever had, good honest Turkish style fish and chips in a stunning setting."
Beautiful ,"Came here whilst on an organised jeep safari. It is a truly beautiful place and definitely worth a visit. The water is beautiful for wading through the rocks - but you need to wear beach shoes. Other activities include river rafting, bungee jumping and zip slide. The lunch was excellent, especially the grilled fish. Would recommend a visit."
Go early...,"If making your own way try and get their early, the queues to get through tight sections and pools will be less hassle, nice stroll up gorge for about 20-30mins, depending on time of year the pools could be 3-4 ft deep and a bit of scrambling. Definitely do the ringos down the river afterwards and you can ask not to do mud bath if that doesn't take your fancy...then stop for picnic on river."
Lovely place ,Never been before plenty of bars and shops also quieter streets with bars if you want a more quieter bar. Already planning next years holiday. Loved the fact  that you are not hastled by thr shopkeepers as you pass by everybody is so friendly.
Get a guide! ,"We travelled from Calis with one change at Fethiye which cost a total of around 16TL per person each way. It took around 70 mins by bus from Fethiye.We arrived at 1030 and it was still fairly quiet (packed by the time we left at 1300).  Hi We brought our own jelly shoes. We weren’t planning on having a guide - we were going to make our own way up the gorge.  Just by the main water crossing, one of the official guides latched on to us, and it turned out to be the making of the day.We probably would have turned back when the water pools started to get deeper, but with his expert help of the terrain and “helping hands”at critical points we made it all the way to the waterfall. He took our rucksacks at times and took some fantastic photos of the two of us.There was no cost to the guide, but we gave him a fairly generous tip at the end (which he negotiated upwards!). It was such a great decision to take him - it turned a day out into a real adventure that we will remember for some time to come."
another vist,This time i did not go in gorge but  just watched the actives and  the trip i was on had a  lunch in the  trip and it was excellent  yes it does  get very crowded when the jeep safaris start to arrive
for the adventurous,We went on a Tui trip. The gorge is absolutely icy and very slippery if you are not steady on your feet. Must admit I only paddled but most people ventured further.
Nice place,"Nice place worth seeing, but very crowded, and need to be careful if you want to go to the water, as can be slippery"
A must for anyone in the area,"Saklikent is a wonderful place to spend the day either relaxing dining and drinking on one of the many pontoons situated in the cool waters flowing out of the gorge or having an adventure filled day walking through the gorge seeing how far in you can make before you turn around for a cold efes. Very few making the full 18km but at 2km there is a waterfall which is a good turn around point. Or if you are feeling more adventuring you can ride the gentle river in an inflatable ring, bungy jump or go through the tree tops on zip lines there’s something for everyone. With the entrance price to the gorge being 7tlr and 70trl to do river rafting it makes it a very cheap but enjoyable day"
Very nice experience,We had an afternoon off in Kalkan after docking at the port.We hired a taxi and went to saklikent and xanthos.We went all the way to the waterfall. It took 45 min each way.Wonderful experience extremely beautiful place lots of people and lots of fun
Be there early ,What a fantastic place. We started from Fethiyeh  very early in the morning and took a dolmus (minibus) to the park and got in first. It's a totally different experience when it's only you walking through the canyon. It takes about an hour to go through the track and it's amazing.
Awesome ,I really loved this place. It looks like we can see the cradle of life by seeing the start of a river. The water is soo cold but i think cold water has it's benefits so it's ok for me.The tubing is a new experience and amazing but watch getting wet because the water is soo cold.Really loved the place.
Fantastic family day out,"This was our third visit over the years and again not disappointed. Great family day out. Be prepared to get wet (just over waist height when we went) if you make it all the way to the end. Carry as little as possible as this will get wet too!  Wear wet shoes or hire them at the entrance.  Can thoroughly recommend eating at one of the little local cafes on the way to Saklikent, just pull over at the side of the road."
"Dirty, disgusting area of pollution and trash!","Went in mid August with a group, and I have to say I was deeply disturbed by what I saw - trash everywhere, plastic floating in the river and all along the river coast, especially at the cafe area, and no one cares.  Lots of trash was obviously there for a long time, owners only care to take money off tourists.  Sadly all this trash will end up in the sea. This whole area in Turkey I found to be an environmental disaster zone, where in most places recycling is a non existent option.  If you care about the quality of your experience and who your wallet sippoerts - don’t go!"
"Go early, get wet, and relax after","Visiting Saklikent was a highlight of our holiday.  We paddled and waded through water along the gorge.  Much was easy, but some parts tough and strong hands needed to clamber up and over rocks, or across deep sections.  Afterwards  we enjoyed the cafe beside/over the water. Good Turkish pancakes and 'breakfast'. And we should have gone rafting if we had allowed time.But if you take one thing from reviews: DO GET THEIR EARLY.  By the time we finished walking, it was heaving.   Many local tourists don't make it so far along the gorge, dressed in full clothes, flip flops and yes with handbags.  But the more central part gets very crowded and can't be avoided.   Go with water shoes or hire them (or trainers that you don't mind submerging), and expect your clothes and stuff to get wet. It took us about an hour to get to the first waterfall. I understand there are more further along, but the rock blocking the path at that point is totally unascendable for normal people. Rafting in tubes is run by private companies from sites near the Park entrance. It looks fun - about an hour to go down river and get brought back.  We also stopped for a mud bath at a cafe on the road out - worth trying for a few lira."
Interesting for a couple of hours,"This is an interesting place to spend an hour or two, with a cafe for a tea overlooking the river and canyon, which you can walk along. Scenery’s nice but it was popular and it felt a bit touristy."
Beautiful but very busy!,"The gorge itself is stunning but very, very busy! I’d of liked to spend more time here but we were on an excursion so it was limited. We got picked up by a guide who showed us up the canyon which we didn’t really want but found it difficult to get rid of him! Then he looked pretty disappointed with the tip we gave him even though his services were not asked for! Anyway the gorge is stunning, the water is very cold make sure you take appropriate footwear if you’re going to attempt to walk up it (seashoes are perfect) and we also did Ringo Rafting which was great fun. Maybe next time we’ll get the dolmus and spend more time here."
Grim ,Such a beautiful place but spoilt by making money! Place was dirty and over crowded! Such a shame! Rafting is a must though as was great fun once away from all tourist nonsense!
Perfect,"I recomend all turist to visit this wonderful place,don`t leave fethiye without visiting Saklikent National Park, the water is amazing and very cold"
Exhilarating ,"What a beautiful place! It was soooo much better than I expected! The dolmus from Fethiye cost 12.75 lira each way and took about 1 hour. Entry was 7 lira for adults and 3.50 lira for students. You can rent plastic/jelly shoes and helmets but I don’t think they were useful for those who rented them. I wore hiking sandals and although still slippery at times, they did the job very well. I do not recommend plain sandals or flip flops! You start off on a little bridge above and to the left of the gorge and at the end there are snack bars. This is where you can decide to watch everyone or actually enter the water yourself. At this point, I was just going to watch but the adventure gripped me and I went in! The water is freezing cold  and goes up to the knees but it’s only for a short distance. You can help yourself with the use of a rope as the current is quite strong. Once across, it’s like a pebbly beach and there is only a bit of water here and there. The sights are spectacular! The further you go, the more water there is and the deeper it gets. I gave up once I entered a pool that went up just past my groin. To be honest, I’m not sure how far I ended up going but I did spend almost 2 hours at the gorge. Don’t keep anything in your pockets, keep your phones and cameras in a bag high up on your back to avoid getting them wet if you slip on the rocks in the water! Enjoy!"
Excellent scenery,Interesting walk in Saklikent. The scenery’s great and the walk in the canyon is good fun. A little bit crowded when we went but i’d still recommend it for a couple of hours entertainment.
Beautiful scenery fun activities,Fantastic gorgeAmazing natural springs and river gorge to see and experienceLong queues when we went but our guide bypassed easily Bungee jumping and ziplining were there but we only tried the rafting! Great fun. Worth the trip
Hot Day,"We arrived at about 10.30 a.m. after pick up at Hotel at 09.00 a.m. and had to cross over the river to pay 7 Tl to enter the gorge. You really need a couple of hours to take it at a comfortable pace, we had a total of about an hour so I didn't reach the end of the gorge as we had to go elsewhere for lunch. There is a possibility of going down the gorge on rubber rings and some zip lines and you can get food and refreshments. However at around mid day it got very busy with large queues at the entrance and toilets etc. We had a few women, I passed on my way back, still heading up the gorge, so most on the bus have them to thank for the hour sat in the bus waiting, after which we missed the slot at the very busy restaurant; where we had some average food and an over priced drink (No Alcohol served n the place). The gorge itself was quite impressive after walking along the side and over the rocks through the freezing cold water. Take a pair of crocks or similar so you can easily rinse them off although they hire some fairly poor plastic shoes. Of course as we were on a trip we had to visit  a carpet factory when we could have done with the time at the gorge."
This is an absolute must visit ,"We loved it here, paid approx £1.50 each to get in to the gorge which is beautiful, climbed over numerous rocks and caves to reach the end. Then ate a chicken kebab each from the kiosk at the entrance to the bridge which cost less than £1 each which was delicious. We then went white water rafting on the river, worth doing too. This is an absolutely fantastic day out"
Best views cold water amazing activities,"So my younger brothers loved walking around and playing in the cold water of the river, they enjoyed a simple zip line and kayaked by the beautiful view of the river and the mountain. I did bungee jumping for the first time and it was an excellent experience."
Go early!,This is a great experience even in the height of the summer tourist season. The gorge is spectacular and you are allowed to walk through the falls and upstream. The rocks can be slippery. My best advice is to wear really good shoes that grip the rocks. Don't take anything that you don't want to suffer water damage. My partner tried climbing up a waterfall. He slipped and banged his head and his passport fell from his top pocket into the water. If you're a woman then wear a sports bra with pockets for keys etc - safety above water levels.
Amazing National Park,We  arrived there at 12 o'clock. It was very very crowded. I recommend you to get there at 9 o clock. The entrance fee is 7 TL and for students 3 TL. Prices are fairly good.There are lots of places to eat. you can sit on the platforms over the river and enjoy your meal. You have to wear water shoes or you can rent shoes there for 4 TL and you have to wear shorts because you will get wet at least up to your knees. The water is freezing . The rocks and the view is amazing. There is also rafting there float down the river for 50 TL. I recommend you definitely go and visit saklikent . It is fantastic
Definitely worth seeing,"We visited this place on a trip. This is the second time we have been here. There is a small entrance fee and you can get get access to the gorge which is lovely and you can get some lovely pictures walking along the walkway and when you get to the end you can take more pictures and grab an ice cream, coffee or cold drink. Prices are fairly good. I would not recommend the walk up to see the waterfall. We did it and it was miles up in sometimes very uncomfortable water and stones. You can hire wet shoes for 4tl to do the walk but we never managed to get to the end due to time and also people coming back said the water went over waist deep to get through. Good place to visit though."
Good family trip,I have enjoyed with my family a good trip today.Ticket 7 TRY for adult and 3.5 TRY for student. You can put mud on your body.There is also a rafting activity.There is a lot of resturent and water near you it is safe and amazing for family.Prices is good.
A must if you are staying in the area,"If you have not been before then this is a must. The main attraction is the gorge and a walk up the mainly dry riverbed. That said the first few hundred yards involve crossing a shallow river so you will need suitable shoes. Other options include rafting on large rubber rings from Saklikent several mikes downstream - this is a really great family excursion and is safe for all apart from young children and the elderly. The main disappointment is the government run catering facilities which dominate the entrance to the gorge. They have invested nothing on this in the last 30 years in the knowledge that they have a captive market and has become seriously tatty and reminiscent of what you would expect 40 years ago. Unfortunately most tourists are forced to use these facilities either before or after an excursion as it’s the only option if you want to eat or drink on the river. For us this is a missed opportunity in such a beautiful location, there needs to be some commercial restaurants here to compliment the venue. That said we will be back next year as there is something very special about Saklikent."
Mountain rift,"You will see longest mountain  rift ever , with very cold strong spring , be careful , wear suitable ,"
Saklikent Gorge - Excellent!,We loved this.It is about a 4km round trek and expect to get wet in cold spring water up to your chest.We had a guide that made the clambering a bit easier and kept our valuables dry.What an experience!
the things you need to know,"1. Arrive early, before the tour groups arrive. We were there at 10:00 and there were many people but it wasn't packed yet. 2. Leave everything that you don't want to get wet in the car. You don't need a swimming suit. We hiked with our cloths that later dried very fast.3. Parking is 5 lira. entrance is the 7 lira. children 0-6 free of charge.4. You begin with a short walkway above the water. then you reach the springs. 5. If you have young kids (like us) - this is the point were you should hire a guide. we did and it was an excellent decision. would not have made the whole way without him. he helped us with the kids, and knew exactly where we should put our feet, where it is deep, and where the kids could slide. 6. You need to cross the river in knee-deep freezing water to reach the gorge. The water in the gorge is not freezing (the springs are at the entrance to the gorge) and most of the way it is ankle or knee deep. But there are some pools to cross which are chest-high (kids need to swim). 5. You walk as far up the gorge as you like, and then return the same way. We reached a point where you can only continue by climbing up a waterfall with a rope. I guess this is where most people head back (we did).* we are experienced hikers and so are our kids. We did see kids (as well as some adults) freak out on the way. So just turn around when it's too much for you."
Great family day out. Go early to avoid the masses.,"No need to go on a tour from one of the coast resorts.  If you've got a hire car, drive up. Plenty of 'free' parking if you park at one of the restaurants, or pay a small amounnt (15TL, I think) to park in the official car park.It gets very busy, so if you can arrive before 10am, you'll avoid the crowds. Definitely the best way to enjoy walking up the gorge.  A small charge to enter the gorge, I think it was about 20TL per person.  Take shoes you don't mind getting wet and are grippy (not flip flops), or you can hire 'jelly shoes' once inside the gorge for 4TL (I think).  Some are also on sale near the car park for about 10TL.  You will get wet, at least up to your knees, possibly more depending on how much water is flowing, so dress appropriately.  Most of the walk is dry but depending on how far you want to walk (about 2km to the 'waterfall' where you have to stop - it's a very small waterfall). Lots of clambering up slippery bits if you want to and you can swim in some of the pools along the way. Or you can pretty much stay dry and not go so far up.  The water is freezing.  The rock formations are beautiful, the sides of the canyon smooth and glistening in the sun.  If you arrive later, you can get stuck with coach trips and organised tours, etc.After you walk back, get on a tractor inner tube and float down the river, where a van will pick you up and take you for an optional mud bath before taking you back to the start of the gorge and the car park.  I think this was about 80TL for a group of four for a 45 min trip.  The company by the official car park which we used) is marginally cheaper than the group operating from the other side of the river.  The ones we used didn't insist on wearing helmets either.Plenty of places to eat at the Gorge, traditional Turkish low seating on platforms over the river mean there is natural 'air con'. Food is very average but fine. The setting is lovely. Although, again, if you get there later, it can feel a bit over-run. And it is very touristy. Would definitely recommend it as a day away from the coast.  Whole family had a fabulous time."
Excellent place to spend a couple of hours,"Was very busy, so would be good to get there early. Gorge is pretty, water cold. Need water shoes to get to stream, but can get them there. River rafting very enjoyable, worth the extra charge"
Good day out !,"My top tip is get there early, it is a good day out but it gets very - very busy, there are various things to do, zip wires, rapids in the tyres, but we went to walk the canyon, make sure you get someone to explain the rules/way in, not all speak English and my Turkish is limited but just about got to understand. The walk up through the canyon is nice and cool makes sure you where trainers or water shoes as you feet will be wet from the moment you set off, if you want to go all the way up to the water fall then make sure you are prepared to get wet. We went up the gorge around 09:30hrs made it all the way to the water fall. The amount of rubbish thrown around is disappointing to see and fag ends, the water fall was perhaps also disappointing with a lot of rubbish around and even a big black drainage pipe wedged behind it not stunning !!The walk back down though we noticed the arrival of helpful Turkish lads who were now engaged in helping you the awkward rocks/pools and then asking for tips, they had removed the helpful ropes that were in place when we went up, it was also getting very crowded, it is not a wide area towards the end with the amount going in and flowing out if they all got the end it was going to be a big queue and very crowded, glad we did the walk first but it was lovely and cool, the water at the start / end is very cold, like icy cold. Overall a good experience and day out, plenty to do when you return to the park area, we used a local guide from Kalkan which would be my other top tip, we had no worries about parking, he took us straight in, we were dropped right at the gate, all payments were sorted we just enjoyed the time there and then went onto other places in the afternoon."
Busy,"We last visited here twenty years ago and have noticed that the entrance area has become much more commercialised.  There is a massive car park, lots of cafes and numerous shops.  The river itself seems a bit lost amongst them.We visited as part of a private family tour taking in tlos and gizlikent gorge as well.  The organisors also arranged for us to do the rafting down the river on rubber boats.  This was great fun and probably the highlight of the day.  We sat in rubber ring boats and floated down the river for about a mile.  Again as in all of turkey there was no health and safety rules so this made it more fun as it was all a bit dangerous.  We were then driven back to the entrance.We then went into the gorge itself, however so were what seemed like 20 thousand others.  This made the whole place seem overcrowded and less fun.  I would advise an early visit if you want to experience the magnificence of the place.  However it is still a special place, but has become too popular for its own good."
Over crowded and noisy,"Disappointing to say the least. On arrival we were greeted by a man who just wanted to sell zip wiring, tubing etc all at an additional cost. Complete lack of changing facilities given the amount of people surrounding us and the tubes themselves looked patched and old. We did walk into the gorge which was also over crowded and littered with debris - cigarette ends, plastic bags and shoes to name a few! We were also pestered by a photographer on entry even when we told him ‘no photo’ these were naturally on sale at the exit. The eating area was confusing with having to pay in one queue collect a token then collect from elsewhere. It all looks rather shabby and dirty given it hasn’t been open that long. They really need to restrict numbers provide more clean changing facilities arrange a better entrance system simplify the eating area and give the place a damn good clean up and maintenance overhaul."
Take jelly shoes or old trainers,It was busy with mainly Turkish people - took the advice of an earlier review and bought tickets at the first restaurant - I recommend coming as an independent group because you sit in the authentic restaurant with a hammock swinging over the water and geese otherwise you have to queue- we hired shoes for the gorge walk which were comfortable enough but wish I'd brought some crocks!
Excellent morning,We were at an advantage in that we have our own car but I would heartily recommend getting to the gorge earlyWe left Kalkan at 0845 we were in the gorge for 0930Small fee to get inAbsolutely empty at the time - perfectBy the time we can back down at 11 it was packed Amazing experience when quietWe had a guide (which is a bit of a swizz really) but he guided us right up the last few steep and slippy bits to the waterfall (2km point where you have to turn around)Excellent morningWe then did the rings - mehBefore looping back through the hills to take in the ruins at Tlos and Xanthos
Great Views,"Enjoyed our day with the family last week. We went with a safari tour but you can access the area by yourselves too. Great views good to go and see. Water is freezing, you must go and experience it, once in a life thing. Loved it. Also joined a rafting activity which was about 15 minutes, 70 Lira per person but was worth it. Also natural mud sources which you can rub onto your skin. Reccommended!"
A very nice day trip,A nice day trip and a different place to visit. The narrow gorge is awesome and views are superb. A must visit if you have enough time in hand
Mesmerizing,I just fell in love with this place. Beautiful view and perfect setting for relaxation. Great activities and the nature is mesmerizing
Perfect when weather is hot,We came here with a 10 month old when the weather was 36 degrees Celsius and too hot in the open. This place was perfect with ice cold water to relax in and have fun. There is free parking but loads of restaurants wanting business. My advice is to eat at the ones furtherest from the gorge because they are the cheapest and same quality food and service. Had an amazing time here and good three hours spent.
Fantastic ,"Absolutely brilliant, well worth a visit. Cheap to get in, beware of the guides, they are good but expensive. Certain degree of physical exertion required."
Jeep safari visit,We visited Saklikent Gorge on a Jeep Safari excursion. It is an amazing place and a must see! Make sure you take your water shoes!
Beautiful canyon,"It is beautiful.  Water was very cold and crystal clear.  You must wear water shoes.  We had a hard time at first but we managed to pass the first part, where it is very cold and rocky."
Great excursion ,"I came to Fethiye mainly to see Sakilkent Milli Parki and it was my first day tour. What an amazing tour. Walk above the wooden bridge through the rocks with a running water behind us. The water was extremely cold but I managed to walk few steps only. A great highlights in Fethiye. Hundreds of shops, restaurants and stalls everywhere. Long lane for tickets which costs 7 TL for adults and 3.5 for students till 17 year old."
The Gorge,Well worth a day out might be part of an organised trip ? If you are going interdependently there will be an entry fee.  Walk up the gorge to a certain point and return to have a cold drink.
Interesting but overcrowded,The canyon is worth seeing and we thoroughly enjoyed the river rapids ringo experience.  However it was massively overcrowded (August) and i’d hate to see how they’d cope if there was some kind of emergency!
Saklikent Gorge,Awesome natural feature that needs to be seen to be believed.Wear stout shoes that you can get wet as it involves crossing rocks and wading through the river that emerges from the hill side.Don't miss it out.
Still wonderful,"Hard to believe they didn’t discover the gorge until 1986...how?  First visit was in 1991. The gorge is still amazing but it is far busier now and it makes it far more difficult to navigate the walkways. They are starting to monopolise on ways to make money, but it is certainly worth a visit!"
Amazing,"Just beautifull, you can make some great pictures and tou will remember this trip 100%. Very romantic activity for couples."
Amazing!!,"This place is definitely worth visiting! It has the loveliest canyoning so make sure you have enough time to walk through the canyon, raft down it, then bungee jump or zipline.. it's amazing and worth spending your day exploring the canyon (or at least half of it)"
Worth the trip,Definitely worth the trip. However I think it should be made more obvious how difficult it actually is to access the gorge. You have to climb down a steep waterfall over rocks etc that can get rather treacherous.
Turkish canyon ,We took an organized trip from Fethiye and that was a second stop. Even we came quite early it was rather crowded and took us a while to get through the people. The gorge itself is breathtaking definitely worth the efforts.
Fun time with family,This park was a fun adventure with the kids. Going upstream was easy but on the way back was a challenge. Water was COLD but was refreshing on a hot July.
Beautiful but crowded and disorganised,This place is truly beautiful. The waters are fast flowing and freezing cold. It is such a tourist location with so many people and long queues. The queue going in and out is along the same route and is somewhat chaotic. You will need shoes suitable for water if you don’t like rocks underfoot but not flipflops or sliders. I saw a number taken by the current with no chance of retrieval. They do hire out water shoes if you need them.
Jeep Safari to Saklikent Gorge,"After visiting Xanthos, our jeep safari went bounding down the back roads towards Saklikent. Our first sighting of the river was at the side of the road a couple of miles out from the main park. A little way up the road and our driver pulled off the carriageway and into the river for a little off road water driving which was unexpected, but amazing. A short ride into the park we decided the first thing we should do was rafting. Helmet, check, life jacket, check, rubber ring and paddle, check. Chuck yourself into the ring and off you go down stream with the tide pretty much meaning you don’t have to do anything but steer, and spin. Really fun start to the day. Onto the gorge. Make sure you wear beachwear as you will get wet, so many people looked like they’re going for a night out. The gorge is busy but it doesn’t spoil the walk or the shear beauty of the rocks caverning above you. There’s a couple of points that you need to do a small climb but there’s people that will help you. The prize at the end is a waterfall which you can refresh in before making the journey back. The restaurants in the park are a good standard and you can relax on the cushions or even in a hammock by the side of the tranquil stream, you might also see a peacock. We had a brilliant day at Saklikent Milli Park, I strongly advise you visit."
Beauty!,"You should definitely visit and see this natural beauty. Enjoy the cold water, take your swimwear. Also you need sea shoes because the water runs very fast! But very crowded!"
Great trip to gorge but very busy,"We went here and went the tubing which is good fun and reasonably priced thorugh 5km distance is a bit optimistic. The river is cold though and remember your rock shoes. The gorge itself is great and i recommend wading in water and floating in it for a little bit but beware its cold. The gorge is stunning if not too full, and a lot of litter and lots of abandoned flip flops which is sad."
What a lovely day out!! Throughly enjoyed! ,"We decided to visit here on our two week holiday and I am so glad we did, it is so cheap for the entrance fee and parking, we decided to hire some of the jelly shoes as it is not advised to wear flip flops and I agree as some of the rocks in the water are very slippery. Which was a bargain at 4TL! When you first go in this is the busiest bit as everyone is sat down, I loved the benches in the water you could sit on. It was shaded too so it cooled you down in the heat. Was lovely! We eventually tried to make our way down, and we were being hassled by a guy trying to sell us all sorts of things do please watch out for this! He was trying to be helpful, helping us down but he was there touting! This didn’t put us off as once you are actually walking in the gorge it is even more stunning. Walking near the water fall was hard work though, everyone holding onto the rope at the same time was a challenge!! On the way out we went for some food on the beds on the river, I really enjoyed this but it was slightly confusing how to order etc. I absolutely loved this place!! It is a must place to see and experience for sure."
Amazing! Adventure,"This Place is Amazing, perfect views and nature, but if you have kids don't take them with you, don't take a bag inside, you will get wet."
Busy but beautiful,"It's one of the biggest attractions in the area so unfortunately it will ALWAYS be busy! But the further you go into the gorge, the quieter it gets. After walking for about 5 minutes, you reach your first mini waterfall which weeds out the tourists from the hikers! You'll need proper rock shoes (which can be bought for 10TL in the car park). Flip flops will be washed away in the fast current at the beginning. Be prepared to get wet!!! Take valuables with you at your own risk. If you plan to hike to the end (Apparently 4k but it can't have been more than 2k) you'll need to leave phones/cameras in the car or have waterproof pouches for them; water levels reach up to belly height in some places. You don't need to waste money on a guided tour to get here. Just drive/taxi and it's self explanatory when you get there! (Taxi's are so cheap, it'll likely only be 30TL max).Toilets and refreshments on site. (1TL charge for toilets). Definitely worth a visit :) (the gorge, not the toilets..)"
Beautiful ,"If your here go in, at seven Lira it’s well worth it. It’s not disabled friendly though and getting down to the water is tricky. Across the first part is by rope because the water runs fast here, again tricky. You can hire water shoes before you go down though. It’s very busy as well. But well worth it.The views above, below and in front of you are amazing, you can walk as far or as little as you love me before you turn back. You’ll get a sense of it anyway."
fantastic place to visit,"we thought we would take a day out and explore the river ,it was a lovely day out ,very easy to get in ,and there is extra activities to do once you are there like the rapids on rubber rings ,zip wire ,bungy jumping ,it was so refreshing to walk through the gouge as the mountain water is so cold in such heat ,we had lunch there food good to and reasonably priced  but remember to feed the ducks as they might join you for lunch   ,worth a visit ."
A great adventure but very busy on weekends,"A lovely park with an amazing gorge/canyon to walk down with rock pools and fantastic views. You can but plastic aqua shoes there for 15 lira however wearing trainers will do just fine, as long as you don’t mind getting them wet! The water at the start is very cold because it comes straight from underground however as you walk into the canyon it gets a lot warmer. Try to go in the week if you can and as early as possible to get a parking space.Highly recommended."
Another hidden gem of Turkey,"Saklikent Canyon is a great place to relax and do activities like rafting, zip line, and mud bath. The best way to visit it is by car or on a jeep safari where your lunch is included as well."
GO FIRST THING IN THE MORNING,"The canyon itself is beautiful and well worth the walk all the way to the end. However, it is incredibly crowded and had we known it would be like that we would have ensured to go first thing in the morning to enjoy the canyoning a little more peacefully. If you’re experienced in slightly technical slot canyons, then you don’t need the guide they ask you to go with. But there were people at specifically hard spots anyway helping everyone along. Where chacos/tevas etc or else rent the shoes they have there because flip flops will ruin your time."
Day Trip,"Went on a day trip here first time visit, enjoyed the walk along the cliff edge, also the river running past as you sit and have a drink or a bite to eat, well worth  a visit"
Stunning,stunning breathtaking views of such a beautiful place especially the river rafting down the freshwater gorge
Awesome,Beautiful place with picture perfect location.  Must visit if u are in antalya or fethiye. Dont forget to take plastic shoes from inside the place for comfort of your feet.
Not to be missed on a Turkish holiday!,"We repeated our visit to Saklikent many times, it was that gorgeous! An adventure wading through the shallow rushing waters to walk through the gorge that is 800ft deep. Stunning vistas that take you breath away. Exiting don't miss lunch by one of the river of pond restaurants. Fabulous food and impeccable Turkish service & atmosphere. Rafting another day is wonderful!"
Calming,"Called here with jeep safari, what a beautiful place, walking through the mountain gauge, in the mineral water after crossing a freezing cold section with a rope to help you, crystal clear water and very nice rest area, where you can get a drink."
Wonderful landscape,"It is a must see in Fethiye. Amazing landscape with a water fall, Clay mask is for free:) Huge rocks formed an incredible landscape in thousands of years. It’s an adventure in the river canyon."
Stunning,Superb scenery. Walking through a gorge hundreds of feet high. Wear beach shoes to walk through the river very cold water
"Rude, rip off merchants! ","If I could give it zero stars then I would! It's such a shame because it's a beautiful place & this is the only bad experience we have ever had anywhere! The signs outside aren't brilliant so your not too sure what to take in with you, towels, more money, cameras etc... nobody ""claims"" to speak very good English ( ok this is my ignorance as I don't speak Turkish). You pay your money to walk the Gorge, once the other side you are told that you cannot walk the river without a guide, totally understandably. You ask the guide how much? They reply with a price, which is reasonable, you proceed to ""shoe hire"". We then overhear another tourist arguing with a guide over the price once they had returned, they had been quoted 7tl per person, the guide was trying to demand 120tl per person, slight difference in price!!! It set alarm bells ringing for us as we only took a small amount of money in  with us, when we questioned our guide his English got very bad that apparently he didn't ""understand"" what I was saying, more alarm bells, so in the end we declined going on the river walk. He ranted at me and chucked my shoes at my feet and walked off to find the next lot to rip off! I'm not sure if this would be better visited as an organised tour or not from some of the other reviews."
Amazing scenery ,Great place to visit and have a walk up into the gorge verry cold water best to wear eater shoes or something that won't slip on stones rocks there are ropes to help get across and it's a beautiful place too see
Day trip,"Absolutely beautiful place to visit. We visited as part of an organised tour where we went to Tlos ancient village looking at the ruins of a roman village. Saklikent gorge was amazing, beautiful clear water and amazing scenery"
worth a visit,"this is a beautiful place for a day visit, lots to explore and very quaint, experience the colds waters walking through the coves, places to eat nik naks and  to buy"
deepest gorge in europe ?,"absolutely amazing place ,don't go across the river in flip flops you may lose them, you can hire beach shoes to safely cross the river, well worth going."
Stunning natural gorge,Be brave and try the walkway built on the side of this gorge.  The place to rest at the end is worth the (short) walk.
Wow,"You can not miss a trip here. Outstanding natural beauty, a walk through the gorge is a must, wading through the mountain river is invigorating"
Definitely worth seeing,"The view of this gorge will forever remain in my memory - natural beauty combined with an easy extreme trekking along the gorge. I recommend taking a suitable footwear, since the entrance to the gorge leads on a shallow but fast stream with a rocky bottom."
Superb! must do in fethiye,"we did this with guide tours company, oludeniz. Mehmet our guide for the tour was fantastic. He told us the history behind saklikent which means the Hidden city and was found by a shepherd. the canyon is 18 kms long but only 1 km is accessible out of which we walked around 700 mts. Met a family from Israel on the tour who were simply superb! you need to carry floaters, cream, mosquito repellent and a stick if possible can be sourced before getting into the canyon. please wear shorts if possible as the water reaches your waist at certain points. it was fun and i thoroughly enjoyed walking inside the canyon"
Cool gorge and a great day trip from Fethiye,"Spent a half-day here. The gorge itself is pretty cool. The walk up the river requires water shoes or some pretty hefty sandals (my flip flops were not up to the job, but shoes can be rented inside for just 4 lira. I made a big mistake not taking advantage). The initial bit of water is pretty cold, but the rest is very warm.Foot outside the gorge is pretty decent. Nothing special, but the the prices are fair and the portions are plentiful. Fresh squeezed fruit juice is available, too.The public minibus/dolmus from Fethiye was supposed to be only about an hour, but due to crowding was more like 1h45, so budget time appropriately. Cost from Fethiye was something like 15 lira, give or take (can't remember exactly, but very reasonable given the distance.)"
COLD WATERS,I went with my friends daily trip I was brave as always but my god the water was strong even hard to walk. Ate bass fish definitely tasty after rafting experience. I'd sure recommend here
Just WAW!!!,You need to visit it without any hesitation. The place is sooooo  beautiful. Note: you will need comfortable shoes.
Family teip,"We had a great adventure, shame we hadn’t made it the whole way.The day we went, the water was up to our neck at one point, became just a bit to hard to make it. Other times we have been there has been no water, depends how early into summer you go. Wear light clothes shorts and good tight waterproof shoes for walking through water"
What a fantastic place. Great fun,Came on a day trip from Calis and what great fun my wife and I had. Lovely place and walking up the gorge in the water is great fun. Wear good shoes as it’s tricky in areas but we both got 600meters into the stunning gorge. Excellent place to visit and cool off.
Sue eyre ,This is a really fantastic day out it’s so beautiful. Walking in the ice cold water is a bit of a shock at first but once in its so refreshing and beautiful
Freezing cold fresh water.,We went for a short visit and ended up staying much longer than we expected. There is a walk up to the beginning of the gorge around the rocks on a wooden walkway - very sturdy and no problems. Then you hear the amazing noise from the waters coming from the gorge. A few sprays of welcoming water on the way. You may need to rent some shoes to walk on the rocks up the gorge - you also have to hold onto a rope as the waters are a little bit deep and fast flowing. Once on the gorge you can escape the blistering sunshine as it is mostly shaded - which is a welcome. There are small souvenir shops and you can buy tea and coffee if you dont fancy walking up the gorge. There are also a few seating areas where you can purchase food - like Dim Cay. Really good day out - would recommend it.
Worth a visit,"Saklikent is a wonderful place for a day out with all sorts of facilities, the only problem is it is not particularly good for people with mobility problems"
Ice cold fresh water,We were here for about 4 hours as we went till the end of gorge. It's not the easiest thing to reach the end but it's really worth it as you see a nice small waterfall at the end. There are some people working there who help you to climb up the rocks if you need assistance. The place is mostly shady which is nice as Fethiye can be really hot on peak summer season. We would definitely recommend this place to everyone who visits Turkey.
Lovely cool day from the hot summer sun,"We did this August 17 not knowing what to expect but wanting to get a cooler day from the 40 p,us degrees. Organised tour took us straight there ,booked our entrance and we walked into the gorge .Some lovely cool sprays before we walk waste high into the flowing river,holding a rope i might add We walked as far as you can to the public ,bed to be wearing sturdy shoes,also need to be aboe to climb a few rocks etc The exit same way and we s0ent around 1.45 hojrs to walk up and back .The next bit was the river ring ride we did at the adjacent river bank.Great fun and around 1mile in a ring down the river is cooling .Small food bites and a beer then walk down to the small water fall close by ,can't recall it's name. Lunch here out of the sun ,a nice walk down and into the river bed following it 30 minutes to the waterfall,thena steady climb back up and a well deserved homemade ice cream at the top....great day,see some countryside and refreshed inn the water ,grab lunch ....super day out"
Jeep Safari with Evergreen,"Just returned from this excellent excursion. Visited Turkey many times & this trip is a must. Seeing traditional Turkish villages, mountains & forests . Visit waterfalls as well as the gorge & river which is a must with rapid riding & delicious lunch followed by mud bath visit. Evergreen company excellent especially Errol the guide & Jadon the photographer who captures your day on a personalised cd. True Turkey."
Amazing Day!,"Booked through Focus Tours and our tour guide was ""Captain Jack Sparrow"" who just made the trip so enjoyable from beginning to end. We enjoyed the raging down the river in rubber rings so much! Beautiful location. We shall return!"
Freezing water,"Water was. Old but we'll worth it!! Not recommended for people with bad heart's!! This was part of our Jeep Safari a trip that has to be done! Water rafting looks amazing, I'm not quite up to that myself!! 😂😂"
Where good footwear,"Went here on a half day trip with an excursion group from hotel. This place is amazing. It takes about 40mins (for me anyway) to get to a curtain point then you walk back the same way you came. I think you can go more, but that includes some climbing, as it gets more slippery and advance physical body strength, to what I saw personally. Any age can turn up for this place, but I recommend from 3/4 years up for a child and a good leave of fitness of elderly folk as at the beginning they is strong waterfall that you need to cross, to walk along the Gorge and at parts along the trail as some area dip quite deep too. I watch a little small girl almost got submerged in a pocket the father didn’t see and quickly yanked her up as they was both shocked by all. Also the water is clear and quite cold in some parts too. You need really good level of foot wear too, as the rocks can be quite slippery. I wore good travelling sandals and was slipping around with the small rocks getting under my feet. So trainers your willing to get damaged or those sea shoes you can get that has a plastic vase at bottom. They do hire shoes and hard hats for the day of 4 lire’s and they wash the shoes after you’ve used them too. What I’ve been told you can do water rafting there too, but I didn’t see it, so it maybe up the river from the gorge need to ask when you visit the place."
Brilliant,"We spent the afternoon at the gorge, beautiful site,  water freezing water shoes recommended, don’t know why we have never been before.Plenty of cafes and shops"
Part of a jeep safari daytrip,"Loved the time spent here, had an hour free to walk along the river, managed about 3/4 a mile along the gorge before returning for lunch. Then onto the river rafting, loved that in what couldn't have been a safer environment to cover a couple of kms downstream. Great llocation."
Amazing place,"You must visit. Go by dolmus from fethiye you won't be disappointed. Lots to do there including bungee jumping, and rafting."
Great Adventure,Great time at the gorge.Bungie jump. Zip wire. White water rafting.Walk in the canyon for 500 metres.The water is cold. Rent shoes the river bed is very stoney.Lovely time
Lovely trip as always ,The gauge was under construction this year but we were still in awe of its magnificence plenty to do here rings ride the river or zip line over it or just sit and enjoy the landscape with a cold drink I hand with the River lapping at your feet at the river front seating
Lovely trip to Saklikent Gorge,"We stayed in Oludeniz and caught the bus to Fethiye and then from there to Saklikent which drops directly at the gorge.  I can't quite remember to cost of the buses but the whole trip including getting into the gorge was cheaper than taking an organised trip and much nicer. The last bus went back from the gorge about 6pm ish so plenty of time to do as you please.  There  are places to eat and a gift shop.  The gorge is stunning, which you can walk up as far as you like.  You will be in flowing water so some kind of wet foot wear is required and you will find that the bed of the gorge will go up and down in places.  Initially you need to cross an area that is more flowing than the rest, but there is a rope to hold to help you across.  It is very doable, just take your time and enjoy this stunning gorge.  The site does offer hard hats but this is not enforced.  I guess rocks must fall from time to time, just depends if you want to take your chances.  In England you wouldn't be allowed to even walk the gorge I'm sure!  There were all ages at this site and i'm sure in peak season it will be packed with people."
Peaceful and amazing,Need to visit here the gorge is a true work of nature and man. Awesome river rafting and excellent food available. Recommend a jeep safari with Evergreen Jeep safari for this place to visit.
Did the Zip Wire,omg what an experience if you go please try itAt 72 years of age it was amazing and only 10 uk sterling
Jeep safari,Went on jeep safari one of the stops beautiful time there gorge lovely nice to sit by river with feet in cool water rafting bit pricey and take lots of cash for drinks ice cream and entrance fees remember to wear trainers or coverd in footwear or be ready to buy some plastic shoes or loose your flip flops
Lovely day out!,"We hired a car for staying in Oludeniz for 2weeks and drove to the gorge for the day.Its a lovely scenic place, inexpensive day out and was a great place to explore.I'm six months pregnant and managed to still enjoy it so you don't have to be ultra fit to enjoy this day out.You can hire swim shoes from the shops there or do what we did and just bring your own. Definitely recommend visiting here!"
Lovely place to visit,"Definitely worth visiting when in Turkey, we visited as part of a day trip in a jeep safari, definitely worth doing this type of trip, the tour guides do their best to make the day fun and there is plenty to see!"
Wild,"would highly recommend a trip to Saklikent, what to expect, stunning views, laughs galore, sore feet and something youll never forget, we managed to get to the 500m mark but the current was quiet fast on the day we visited and the sight of the BIG boulders you have to get round did it for us lol"
Visit to Saklikent Gorge,"Had a wonderful half day trip to saklikent gorge around 50 km from Fathiye. Dolmus (mini bus) are available from Fathiye in hourly basis and it takes around 1 hr to reach there. the journey itself is quite nice through rural turkey. Visit there is splendid, ticket is 7.5 lira per person and you can stay inside the gorge as much as you want. Beyond a point in the gorge, you need to take a guide and also special shoes are to be worn. I would strongly recommend to visit the place."
Day trip,"We have visited the gorge on many occasions as a family and a couple. It is good fun with lots to do.  You can walk up the gorge itself or go down the river on rubber rings, there is a zip-wire too. You can eat here too admiring the views"
Gorgeuos Gorge,This gorge is beautiful! Just do not visit during the weekend as it gets really crowded with people who loves to take a million selfies even if they block your way.
Amazing place,"It was an amazing place for visiting..The entrence fees are 7 TL .. And for students 3.5 TL (get your university card with you) You will walk in wooden bridge over the river then you reach the river and small waterfall it is nice place to take pictures.. There was 2 mounts and the waterway through them ..There was a beautiful resturants on tge reverYou can reserve rafting , zip line, climbing from there"
Relaxing afternoon,Lovely relaxing time here. Had a light lunch and drinks. We sat on a boat which was moored to a jetty. Big comfy cushions to relax on in a stunning environment.
A most impressive natural wonder.,"The first sight of beautiful green water heralded an impressive natural wonder. After exploring the gorge, and lunch you can go  rafting, experience a zip ride or a mud bath or all three"
Day of fun,"I have visited here 3or4 times now,  and each time it is still special.  The walk up the gorge is breathtaking.  Expect to to get wet if you want to reach the very end,  as you have to cross over the gorge to reach the top, but definitely worth it.  If you want to make this into a full day,  book a jeep safari with deep blue travel company"
Wonderful place for all types,"The canyon is simply beautiful.it is a great option for all types of travelers. weather you just want to see the canyon opening and sit on the water, walk 100m and sit on this great fountain in the restaurant on the water, or you choose a walk into the gorge - from 5 minutes to 2 hours, and keeps getting more challenging and beautiful as you go."
Amazing views and great fun.,Simply cross the icy water and walk into the gorge to catch some stunning views. An ideal trip for the whole family or friends in hot summer days. We also had lunch and did rafting which I highly recommend to try it. Good 4 hours spent with a lot of fun.
Wow...is all I can say..,"What an amazing feat of nature, the gorge forged by water. Visited out of season with friends so did not walk through the river, it was wonderfully cool, the scenery was fascinating. Would love to visit when warmer."
Adventure,"Although I visited first back in 1992, I revisited recently and we did an extensive walk within the flowing waters of saklikent along with a good fish meal at the end of our travels. Its good to see it hasn't changed too much. well preserved."
Stunning scenery,"Beautiful gorge that is a must to see, has to be on your list of places to go , you certainly won’t regret it"
Surprisingly good trip,"Wasn't too sure what to make when booking this trip...was part of full day trip. Great scenery, can walk quite a way into the gorge. Spectacular views along the way. The first part of the walk requires you to cross a river where locals will offer to help however this will come at a cost and will pester you along the whole walk...take your time and cross slowly...beware the water can be very cold. Overall a great little trip suitable for family of ages 6+."
Great if you're adventurous,"You need to be physically fit to do the whole course, and not too worried about lack of health & safety! Don't go if rain is forecast as the valley trek could get flooded!"
A GOOD Day Out,"Very popular Tourist attraction approx. 90 minutes from Fethiye. The most popular way to visit is by a 'JEEP SAFARI' bookable with numerous Tour operators in and around Fethiye/Hisaronu/Ovacik. You can also travel by Hire Car or by Bus (Dolmus). The journey will also pass or visit Tlos & Yaka Park. Saklikent offers many Riverside Restaurants (very busy in Peak season), Gift Stalls, and Tree Houses as well as the Canyon (entrance Fee payable). The Jeep Safaris can be good fun, especially if you don't mind getting 'Wet & Dusty' !!"
Beautiful,"Me, my husband and 5 year old daughter come here on a part of a jeep safari tour. It was fantastic. We would love to come back here if we are in the area again. We were feeling brave along with a whole load of of people climbed down the rocks into what can only be described as the coldest water on earth! I'm not kidding it was freezing! but when you manage to walk through it to get to the other side, it is worth it. Walking through the canyon's was amazing.While we where here we opted to do kayaking and it was fantastic! My daughter was not a fan though. She was in her own ring which was then attached to my husbands. There are a lot of activities on offer here."
Wonderful ,"We visited family of 3 . We had walk around the water . There were plenty of people to see attraction , it would s definitely worth to see it . There were good restaurant to eat and reasonable priced too."
My wife and I were taken here as part of a Jeep safari.,"This is a truly wonderful place to visit, as long as it is not too busy, but it is a popular tourist attraction, so go with the flow.This area Of Turkey is supplied with millions of gallons of water from the mountains, and even in mid summer there is water flowing everywhere.We were brought here given a trip up the Gorge(upstream) then had a very nice lunch, then drinks by the water to relax for a while.Remember a small coin to use the toilets .After we were offered the choice go downstream in a rubber ring or drive the short distance and meet up with the rubber ringers as they came down stream.But remember this is fresh water very cold from a mountain.If you go on one of the Jeep trips to here, be ready to get WET!The tour guides had a professional photographer who took many more wonderful pictures, so we could enjoy our visit.Please note these are memories from 2008 on our first trip to Oludeniz."
Canyon tour,Really enjoyed this trip brilliant day.you can do zip lining and white water rafting and the trip through the canyon was amazing
Saklikent gorge,Great place to visit either as part of a jeep Safari or on the local bus.. Lots of water. I've been 8 times at least.
Nature & Adventure,"Adventurous canyon with cold, wild water. You should be carefully attached to the robes while walking. Not very suitable for elderly, risk of fall."
Amazing,"This is a fantastic day excursion. The gorge is surrounded by a high rock face alongside which there is a wooden walkway. To enter the gorge you need to walk through the water which can be very fast flowing and has a rocky river bed. If you opt not to walk any further there are a few picnic benches where you can sit and enjoy the views. In October the water was ""freezing""."
A MUST VISTS,Fantastic place. Wear beach shoes as the stones and walk ways are rather slippery.The water is very cold. Bring loose change to give to the boy helpers.If you go on a package you get the meal which is basic but very nice
Great time at Saklikent,"Walk through the gorge, which is magnificent to see.  Rafting on the river and mud bath.  Had a great afternoon out.  The river rafting is on rubber rings and you have one each.  We were lucky as it was not busy and there was only our tour group - we did not have to wait and had plenty of time.The mud baths are fab and worth recommending, make sure to slap it on and rub into your skin, well worth the cold shower afterwards.We did the tour with Evergreen Jeep Safari and we had a great time."
A great day out,"White water rafting,Bing jumping zip lines and rock climbing in a beautiful setting. Gorge is amazing but was very busy. Lots of cats in the resteraunt area"
