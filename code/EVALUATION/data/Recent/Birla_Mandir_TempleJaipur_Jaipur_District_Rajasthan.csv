Quite place to sit in silence and connect to God,"Birla Mandir is a beautifully carved white marble temple of Lord Vishnu & Goddess Laxmi.Our experience of the Birla Mandir Temple was great since we reached there in morning for Aarti and there was not much rush.  After aarti & darshan of lord we sat inside the temple in silence for a while then strolled in the garden space outside the temple.Its a bit on elevated place.  Just before the gate on the left is a Ganpati Temple too, which too is very nice place to visit."

All white,"We just arrived  in India the previous night and when I found out we need to remove our foot ware to enter the compound, not just the main building, I thought; ""forget it."" I viewed this building from outside the perimeters of the building. So, this review is from the outside."
Mandir with timings,Note this mandir is closed 12 till 3. Lord knows why.  Big structure from outside but not missing much inside.  Guards have real attitude pushing everyone out on a rude manner at 5 to 12.  No courtesy for anyone coming to give 5 minutes extra or even wait to close on time.  Only…

White and new and unimpressive,"It lacks size to be impressive, it lacks age to have any big cultural meaning, it lacks decor as just being white does not help and apparently it has no real religious living. So yes, have s short look at at but do not expect anything really memorable."
Nice change of pace. ,"I went to this temple and then walked to central park to see something away from pink city. The area seems higher end , cleaner and has usable sidewalks. The temple is very nice and clean and pleasant experience. Nice to see something outside of walled city area. Central Park…"

Quiet peaceful place in hustle bustle of city.,This is a must visit place in Jaipur if you seeking for peace and solace(though it gets crowdy but still). This is made of white marble and located in main city. The temple complex has it's parking and you can hear peacock sounds and even see few(we saw 4) in hill behind temple complex. It is advisable to visit in morning or evening as in day it gets hot.
Bad service,The temple looks beautifull . But too much of rules and regulations which can spoil travallers mood. Even cannot take pictures at the temple.
Nice ,"Beautiful temple. But the attitude of staffs in temple leaves bad impression. Temple with too many restrictions . (From my observation) - cannot take picture (even outside the temple)- cannot lean on the wall- cannot touch the wall inside the temple- cannot use the water apart of drinkingIf u do, the policeman/guard? will shout at you in front of everyone. End up, u would not feel the peacefulness and the serenity of temple. Not recommended. -may be just a one time visit-"

A new experience,The temple itslef is beautiful but we were also lucky enough to be there during a religious ceremony which really brought it to life with wonderful colours and music. The spraying of water on the congregation was also welcome on such a hot day :)
Impressive working temple,We had a short visit in the evening. The exterior is very impressive but the added bonus for us was to see it in action as we went inside. We just stood at the back and watched people paying worship to there religion - it brought it more to life. It is not far from the Old city…

It has the ceremonial prayers ( Aarti ) in morning and evening and the head priest sings the prayer with loudspeakers playing the song for everyone to hear. It’s has a huge hall and the building is white marble building. People of all religions can visit the temple and just standing with hands folded and eyes closed can bring peaceful vibrations in the place.Great parking and overall a very clean temple.
Cool Place ....Birla Mandir ,Birla Mandir ...made by one of the biggest Business House - The Birlas. They have made such Temples at many places in   India. This is one of the most beautiful of all. Located at one of the busiest crossing of Jaipur city and its hard to miss by any in coming Guest in City . Made of White amarble from Rajasthan only. The idols of Laxmi Narayan are worshiped here. Just few steps from here the City's Gsnesh Tample is Located. I must visit place.
Late evening visit will be good for visitors,The temple is well build marble architecture and the surrounding view is nice. One can road outside the temple and can view the Shiv temple (private maharaja property) above in the hill top.
Superb!,My next stop was Jaipur and just like Mumbai in my free time I managed to visit this marvelous marble creation an holy site for Hinduism. I really like the carvings and elaborate use of white marble.
Good place for visit ,Birla Mandir Jaipur is at very prime location and in the evening time one gets pleasure in seeing the surroundings and doing the worship
Spiritual,This is one of the temples you can visit anytime of the year. And best part is that it is accessible from all part of Jaipur as it's located in centre of Jaipur.
This one IS Brand New,Indians have an idea that pretty much anything still standing but built in the last 500 years is Brand New. This little Temple  literally in a 20th century marval. This attracts some negative comments because of this. How devoted is a private family that builds something like this for the community.  There is a couple of statues on the western side  and a famiy museum below the Temple. The  Temple has some lovely stained glass and a translucent marble panel. the windows are best viewed in the afternoon . I you visit late in the afternoon the museum may be closed
Larger than life - gain a perspective!,"This is a very nice temple but what I'd recommend is spending time in the temple complex in the evening. The twilight creates a golden glow (west facing temple) and the ambiance is just mesmerizing - golden glow, large monument, kids playing, huge garden, busy city in background, birds chirping and traffic... gives you a perspective and fills you with gratitude for the vacation you're blessed with :)"
Extremely disappointing!!!,The temple architecture is ok but that's the only plus point. The temple was too noisy and no efforts made by priests or cops to maintain the decorum.  The aarti was made discordant and unsettling but the non rythmic banging of thal and ghanta by the priests. Did not feel iota of peace or spiritually at this temple. Extremely disappointing!!!
Very beautiful,"The temple is relatively new, built in 1985, so our tour guide told us. It’s built in white marble and exquisite in its design. You have to take your shoes off before entering the temple and no photos are allowed to be taken in or around the temple. It’s really beautiful and well worth a look."
Birla Mandir Temple,Birla Mandir built in 1977-85 by Birla family.It is a lord vihnu temple .Location is beautiful and peaceful.close to baapu bazar. Spending 30 minutes is enough Beautiful Temple made of White Marble.

The Birla family's gift to Jaipur,This white marble temple built in 1977-85 by the superrich Birla family looks especially beautiful during sunset. It is a Hindu temple but the three domes represent the three main religions of India and there are even figures of e.g. Christ and Buddha so everyone should feel very welcome.
Quite place to relax your soul,Place is good and very quite. This place will definitely help you in refreshing your soul. Place is quite clean but people should also take care of cleaniness

Beautiful ,"Started this as our first tour one of the day.  The local was local and the temple was beautiful but very bare except main deities and lovely stain glass windows with images of all the hindu Gods.  The outside indicates three religious based domes - Hindu temple, Punjab gurudwala and Muslim dome (not sure what’s its actually called!) but inside area was empty. Good to see 3 different religions in same architecture.  Worth a visit"
An absolutely calm and quite place to spend some lonely time in the heart of the city.,"Recently I had the opportunity to visit the Birla temple, my first time despite living int he city for over 20 years.

Birla mandir at evening ,Beautiful temple..Very well maintained . The evening Arathi at 6.3p was very good . But crowded though.  Don't miss the panipuri and pavpaji outside the temple.

Overall may take around an hour to complete the visit."
Great place for aarti,We visited this temple when it was evening prayers (Aarti) and it was lovely to see - but the mandhir is also very clean and white and beautiful carvings - worth a visit!
Beautiful place,Soothing for the soul. Do attend the aarti to be able to get the essence of the place. Ignore the commercial establishments.
Don't miss,Amazing architecture on white marble. Must visit. The best time to visit this temple either early morning or late afternoon.
Drapped in white!,At 1st glance it looks nothing extraordinary ; enter and you see the intricate craftmanship which honestly I did not expect considering that it is not as old as the palaces in the royal state. Good to spend an evening gazing at the beautiful sunset and gathering your thoughts. Max 1 hour required. It also has a museum showcasing the antiquities belonging to the Birla lineage.
Nice holy place,Birla temple is good holy place away from city center. Statue of radhe krishna is awesome. Entry is free of cost. You can spend time over here.

Masterpiece,"Went on a family trip to Jaipur this August. Had a wonderful time in Jaipur. The atmosphere of Jaipur is just awesome. A very clean and royal city of Rajasthan. Often referred to as the Pink City, it houses the famous whitish Birla Mandir made up completely of marbles. It's just a marvellous piece of architecture. Situated along JLN road,this temple has visiters from all over the country throughout the year. A very fantastic place to visit. Adjoining it is an old fort(on Moti Dungari Hill) , which remains closed most of the times of the year.I will definitely recommend everyone visiting Jaipur to come and see this magnificent temple of Laxmi Narayan. Hence also reffered to as Laxmi Narayan Temple."
"Religious, Beautiful Architecture and must visit in Jaipur. ","This is one unique and famous temple, with white Marble stones, very few idols, also has some unique Stain Glass work display for an Indian Temple. Laxmi Narain is the main deity.It's Not on an elevated hill point (sometimes can be confusing like being on hill top; as right above this temple, there is another, that one can sight atop a hill besides an old Fort). Visit well ahead of closing time so to have peaceful darshan & take good pictures.It looks good both in day & night.If short of time, please plan visit around early evening to get both day and night time views."

Beutiful place and a must visit,This temple all built in Marble is a beautiful piece of art. It was very peaceful to sit at the porch after darshan. A must visit if you are first timers in Jaipur.
Beautiful temple high above the city of Jaipur,"This white marble temple is beautiful and definitely worth a visit. My husband and I had never been to a Hindu ceremony before so we made sure to include this on our tour of northern India. Sadly, we were told that we weren't allowed to take pictures inside, though I saw others taking pictures here and there. The evening ceremony we attended was short, about fifteen minutes in total, but was uplifting and energetic which I absolutely loved. You will need to remove your shoes to enter the temple and it's a bit chaotic in the designated area for parking and shoe storage, but we were lucky to be paired with a guide who was able to have our shoes stored in an interior cubby instead of out in the open. Once the ceremony was over the sun had fully set and we got to see the temple lit at night which was equally as beautiful. It was like we were completely removed from the city once we were up near the temple, too. It felt private and secluded in the nicest way possible, like Jaipur was miles away. Even if you can't make it to a daily ceremony, I would recommend stopping by to see the gorgeous architecture and the stained glass scenes from Hindu events and history."
White marble work,This beautiful temple is a good place to visit in Jaipur. The sculpture in white marble is magnificent and elegant.
Spectacular Temple of Marble,"Just 32 years old, this one is literally new age temple build with tons of white marble with fine carvings depicting a blend of both modern and vintage architecture.

Poetry in white,Birla Mandir on JN Road is well maintained and managed inspite of the huge crowds that throng it. I went one evening in peak Summer only to find hoards of devotees and tourists. The parking was a little inadequate due to the tourist buses occupying most of the space. The guards manning the gardens are strict and this is probably why it is spic a and span. A must visit place early morning or late evening.
Excellently Maintained,Very nice place which is excellently maintained; well organised and well designed with a lot of aesthetic design sense.Has a tranquil atmosphere well located and the ambience is nice too. A must visit for people who have time to spare.
