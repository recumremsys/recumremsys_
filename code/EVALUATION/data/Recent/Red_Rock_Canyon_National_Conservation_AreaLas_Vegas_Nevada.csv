"Great hike, selfish visitors","I was at Calico Basin Red Springs within the Red Rock National Conservation Area yesterday evening (10/9/2020). The new boardwalk the BLM installed since the last time I was out there is great. There were several professional photographers there taking photos. Unfortunately, they were posing their models in the meadow, laying them down on the vegetation, and having them climb on the rocks. The damage they have caused will take years to recover. Despite signs being posted about every 30 feet reminding people to stay on the boardwalk and trails. I wish the BLM had the budget to station their rangers in the high use areas, in and around Red Rock."
Off the Strip,Cool to see something off the Strip.   Just a quick 30 min drive to see beautiful scenery.  good change of pace from the strip
BREATHTAKING views!!!! ,"I LOVE Red Rock. It is gorgeous and very peaceful. The views are truly breathtaking and I love to go every time I visit Vegas. You can take the tour, but I recommend driving yourself (if you rent a car). You can explore at your own pace plus it only cost $15 per car to get it so you save a lot of money by not doing a tour. Tours are 100+ so if you and another person go you are spending over $200 vs. if you drive you will pay $15. I have taken the tour and with the right tour guide it can be informational and entertaining, but I still don’t think it’s work the difference in cost."
Amazing work by Mother Nature ,"So many amazing sites to see. It is an easy drive. Each trail is marked so that you know which it is and the difficulty level. Some of the hikes are very easy, others are more challenging.  With the heat, definitely be aware of your limitations before attempting the harder hikes."
Easy trip from Vegas,"Wife and I were so pleasantly surprised how nice this place was, we stopped at all overlooks and made the 13 mile drive last about 3 hours. Even though the visitors center is closed for Covid it was well worth the visit. If one does not stop and observe the plant, terrain and wildlife it is a missed opportunity. There is plenty of wildlife if you take the time to look for it. Dale and Naomi Crow"
Definitely worth a visit while in Vegas,"Get your butt off the strip for a few hours and visit this national park. It’s beautiful, and there are plenty of places to stop to take photos as well as a variety of hikes. There are bathrooms in the park (no running water) and at dusk the park is quiet and relaxing. We went two days back to back, first in the late afternoon and waited for the sun to set, and the next morning again and it’s a pretty different experience. It’s a very quick ride from the Las Vegas strip. GPS can take you there but keep in mind that you won’t have reception in the park so don’t plan on taking a lyft or Uber."
Great hiking in Red Rocks,"Red Rock Canyon:   If you are not interested in our  weekend hiking adventures then just skip my next three posts #9-11. We rented a car and spent Friday morning hiking and driving Red Rock Canyon. We’d driven it many years ago but had not hiked. It is a 13 mile one-way road so if you want to hike you must do the hikes in order or you will need to complete the driving loop and start over again. All visitor centers were closed - sometimes a store is open in the parks but we did not stop at this one. We were out of Vegas about 7:45ish after picking up our car and passing the 'Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area’ at 8:15. In 10 minutes we’d parked at Calico Hills to begin our first hike. The temps were not too bad yet — we loved the dry air being from a gulf coast state. We enjoyed the #1 hike. Beautiful views and not too hard….. to a point. There was a steep section near the beginning of the trail but nothing we could not handle. We’ve just returned from extensive hiking in 3 NP this August at high elevations. Loved the formations we walked past and the views. We stopped for a bit to watch some rock climbers — braver than us!  We got to the end of the trail to find a ‘wire basket’ of rocks marking the rest of the loop. It had taken only about 30 minutes to this point even with watching the rock climbers. The rest of the trail required rock scrambling and I told my husband I was not ‘going there'. I am afraid of ledges without railings and did not want to wear out the seat of my pants ‘scooting’ like I did last year in Utah!  He said he’d go on forward and I could back track - fine by me!  I enjoyed going down the steep section of trail on the return and got back to the trailhead about 10 minutes before him — he told me I had made the right choice for me!By 9:15 we were back on the scenic drive to our next hike destination. We stopped at several overlooks and took our time as I videoed and photographed the amazing scenery. We arrived at our next trailhead, the Lost Creek loop at 9:40 ready to stretch our legs. It is also the trailhead for the loop hike Willow Springs. There are a few markers here and there but sometimes it was very confusing which rock to climb! This trail begins flat and then turns into ‘rock climbing’ — we had forgotten our walking poles at the condo and really wished we had them on this trail. — there were several sets of ‘stairs of rocks’ without railings that would have been nice to have something to hold on to — especially coming down!  My husband offered his hand so I took it coming down as a mental thing - no way would he have stopped me from falling if I’d tripped. The walk was ‘moderate’ in my book and it was a fun trail. We have no idea where the ‘loop’ part was so we just came back the way we went…..at least we knew that part of the trail!  We had met some locals at the end of the trail and it was all dried up and rocky. They said the snow melt would fill up that section of the creek. It really was ‘lost’.  Beautiful views and as I mentioned, a fun trail.We next stopped at the Petroglyphs Wall trail — only about 0.1 mile to a mountain side with petroglyphs and information signs. It was interesting but nothing one has to see unless this is an interest of yours — you can see petroglyphs on a few other trails. The road to this walk turns off the main scenic drive and is a rocky, dirt road…..nothing our rental was in danger of getting harmed by driving on it - just a heads up. We were only here about 12 minutes — as we just walked in and out — took a few pics of the petroglyphs and did not tarry. By this time it was heating up as it was 10:30.  The only other trail I was interested in was a ‘boardwalk’ so it would be easy enough. At 11:00 we arrived at Red Springs Boardwalk. It was a nice 1/2 mile boardwalk in pretty scenery. I did not actually see the ‘spring’ but there was quite a bit of greenery around so there was evidence of a water source. The information signs along the way were interesting and explained a lot about the types of rocks we were seeing. If you have mobility issues this is a nice flat walkway.We headed back as we had only water and snacks and we were getting hungry — we arrived back in LV about 12:30."
Nature,"Beautiful place for hiking,biking or just plain enjoying the view. Best time to go October when the weather is nice."
A nice present,"It is by coming to visit this magnificent site that my husband gave me a nice gift, he proposed to me in marriage, so I will remember this beautiful canyon for the rest of my life."
Must See!,"The Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area is a beautiful park offering scenic views and amazing hiking trails! My boyfriend and I hiked Calico Hills, Petroglyph Wall, and Ice Box Canyon. Ice Box Canyon was the longest hike we did and probably my favorite hike. On this hike you will be rock scrambling most of the way and when you are deeper into the canyon there are no trail markers - or at least we didn't see any.  At the end of the trail, there is a waterfall some parts of the year and if you're brave you can climb up and get a closer look. We saw some wildlife including quail, squirrel, and lizards. Next time we visit LV we will be visiting Red Rock Canyon again to hike some more trails! I would recommend starting early in the morning when the park opens. Also the visitor center is currently closed but you do have access to restrooms, water fountain, and they have part of the gift shop open outside. Happy Hiking!"
"Needed more time here, lol",Great park offering a variety of hikes. We only had time for 1 hike but able to stop at a few scenic views. It was extremely windy (gusts of 40+mph) the day we visited. We chose the climb Calico Tanks. Trailheads were pretty easy to follow. We were able to get out to the top of this trail and sit out look out at Vegas. Trail took a couple hours to complete but well worth the effort.
Scenic Drive,Nice scenic drive on well paved roads. Numerous hiking trails and viewing areas. Visitor center is nice with restrooms and also has biking fix stations.
Couple hours in a canyon,"Nice place to visit during Las Vegas trip.You can drive and see the nature, everything set up very nice (hiking is available too)"
Beautiful scenery,We took the 13 mile scenic drive which had an entrance fee of $15.  The 1st stop was the most scenic but after that it was underwhelming.  It's still something to do when in the Vegas area and you want to get away from the casinos. I would recommend it for 1st timers to the area....that is if you have never been to the Grand Canyon or the mountains in Colorado.
info center a lot to see and do spring and fall I think would be best. nice for whole family.,info center was helpful a lot to see and do spring and fall I think would be best. as it was little hot out the day we went 108 nice for whole family.
Pleasant Surprise,"While in Vegas, make some time to check out Red Rock.  Wear comfortable shoes in case you want to hike a little.  There are many parking areas with different trails.   We did not see any wildlife the day we went, but was told that was unusual.  We were also impacted by a Smokey haze from the wild fires on the West Coast.  Gorgeous sites wherever you look!"
Absolutely Beautiful ,Had an amazing drive through the scenic route. Gorgeous and awe inspiring! A must do site seeing venture when in Vegas.
Nature 20 minutes from The Strip,"A beautiful scenic drive just outside the city.  There are multiple hiking trails from 2-10 miles, so you can experience nature by day and city by night.  Definitely worth a few hours of your time."
COOL PLACE TO VISIT AND NOT FAR FROM DOWNTOWN VEGAS,"15.00 per car. Drive through loop, with many stops to get out and take pictures. Even saw a road runner."
Beautiful Short Trip from The Strip,"If you want to see some of the area surrounding Las Vegas, but don't have a lot of time, this is the perfect place.  It offers a beautiful glimpse of the desert landscape surrounding the city.  There are many places to hike during cooler weather.  In the extreme heat of summer, there are opportunities to pull over for photos .  The one-way loop road is relaxed and enjoyable."
Take the time to visit.,"Twenty minutes outside of Las Vegas is this great place. This was an amazing drive. As you progress around the loop, the colors and rock formations change before you. Plan on stopping and visiting. One of the highlights of the trip in about 3 hours of time."
National Treasure,"A sight that has to be seen to be believed....unless you live in a handful of Western States that have some of the similar landscapes - Utah,Arizona,etc. A ""must see"" on your list if you enjoy the outdoors and visit the greater Las Vegas area!"
Beautiful Red Canyon,"There are a lot of places and parks that you could visit,Las Vegas offers more than Casinos also The Beautiful Red Canyon"
Drive thru the park.,It was 115 degrees so we just did a drive thru this beautiful canyon.  It was late afternoon and offered some breathtaking views.
Gorgeous views,Since I was visiting Las Vegas for a few days we went for a ride to this beautiful canyon. Though we didn't stop and do any of the hikes because it was getting late we still had a great time.
Great weekend hike destination,"For a local this a treat. Stays cool due to mountian shades. Easy hikes for retired folks with limited elevation changes. Due to lack of international travel, there is plenty of parking. No tourists."
Red Rock ,Absolutely gorgeous. Different views as you drive along. Stooped and took several photos. Highly recommend.
"Beautiful outdoor experience, as always. ","We always love a drive through the Canyon when we visit! You can bike, walk or just drive through slowly and take in the views. Plenty of room for parking at areas for picture taking."
nice scenic very close to las vegas,nice and  scenic very close to las vegas has the national park feel though not as big. i imagine in not extreme heat would be lovely to hike.
Great place to hike,"We go here every year. Years ago when we turned 65 we bought the Natinal Park Pass what a great way for seniors to see great National Parks. Easy, medium, hard trails, you chose.We always go in January or Februay weather perfect."
Well worth the drive!,"Whilst I love Vegas, it's also a real shame not to get out and experience the beauty of the desert.  And Red Rock has this in spades!  If you've never been, then I highly recommend you to rent a car, and self-drive out to and around here.  The Red Rock Resort/Casino is also a lovely faciity for lunch to break your trip.  And don't forget your camera.  Hope you enjoy!"
Drive around Red Rock Canyon,"My husband and I drove the 13 miles around Red Rock Canyon in August of 2020.  This area was not crowded.  It is a beautiful area with lots of red rocks.  It is about 30 minutes away from the Las Vegas Strip.  It takes about one hour to drive around and stop and enjoy the rocks.  If you decide to hike, it will take longer.  This area is a nice encounter with nature."
Red Rock,Red Rock canyon is very nice. It is easily seen by car which is especially important when the temperature is 115 degrees. It has several trails for hiking on a cooler day. It is very near Las Vegas which makes it a very convenient day trip.
Well worth the visit while in Las Vegas,This is a must see if you've never been.  Loved driving through and we did hike a trail while we were there.  Amazing sites!!
Beautiful,Just a short drive from Vegas and worth the trip.  It was too hot to hike but we walked a little down a few paths and got some great pictures.   Take water and wear cool clothes and tennis shoes.
Beautiful and nicely done!,Beautiful land with a nice driving loop.  The best way to see it is on an Electric bike!  The colors are wonderful.  It’s very clean and well maintained.
Beautiful scenery at Red Rocks,"A definite must if in the Las Vegas area.  Scoot  City is a fun way to tour the park. Riding the three wheeled  scooters to see the park is a blast, and moving keeps you cooler even though it is hot outside."
Amazing right next to Vegas!,This is a great short trip right on the out skirts of Vegas.  The scenery is beautiful and the drive is not bad at all.
So beautiful! ,"I love the landscape of the Red Rock Canyon area. After you pay the admission ($15 per vehicle), you start along a scenic loop drive. The cover charge us 100% worth it, in my opinion. There are multiple pull off with bathrooms and hiking trails at each one. The hikes are well displayed with length and elevation. Definitely bring lots of water and wear appropriate clothing, as there is not a whole lot of shade."
Beautiful scenery that will take your breath away!,This is a great drive with plenty of parking most days.  The scenery is amazing and you will enjoy it both driving and stopping along the way.
Go!  It's amazing!,Here you will be treated like a valued guest and the hiking is phenominal!!!!  You won't regret this trip!!!
Nice way,This is remind of me Grand Canyon of type valley. One of the best of the best. Me and my family enjoyed a lot with lots of pictures.
Beautiful!!,"Lovely 13 mile drive through the park. Well marked trail heads, identified on a great map you receive upon entering park. $15 per car for day pass. In brochure, trails identified for level of difficulty based on terrain, miles, and duration.  Very helpful.  If hiking is your passion this is the place.  If your new at it there is a trail for you here."
Lovely side trip from Vegas!,"If you can get here at sunrise or sunset, the views are stunning! Be sure to make a stop at the Visitors'  Center for cute gifts! There is some rock climbing available here...we didn't have enough time to look into it, but it seemed very popular!"
Great Day trip,You must take in this site when visiting Vegas. It's a great break from the hustle of the strip. Rent a car and go.
Beautiful rock formations,The striations and colors of the rocks were amazing!  Such beauty in a very tranquil place.  When we went there were not many people which made the view even better.
Peaceful Adventure,This is by far one of the most amazing places I have ever been. The views cannot be outdone and the quiet ride through there was a relaxing time.
Breathtaking Views,Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area was breathtaking. The scenic loop was beautiful. We took a picnic lunch with us and stopped to enjoy the scenery while we ate lunch. It did not disappoint.
Red Rock is a MUST SEE!!!,"If you go to Vegas, it is a must see! $15.00 to enter the park and do the scenic loop - and well worth it! Get out and climb on the big red rocks. Do it for the insta!"
"Quick, beautiful trip!",We recently used Las Vegas as our flyin/flyout hub for our Southwest vacation and ended up driving to Red Rock scenic loop.  This did not disappoint!  Perfect for small children and great views!  Great hiking options too!
Awesome,We went in the end of July to see Red Rock Canyon. It was so beautiful. It is Hot in July. Bring lots of water. But highly recommend
So beautiful,We had so much fun looking at the beautiful sights!! Would recommend everyone to see it! Just 25 minutes away from Vegas an well worth the short trip!!
Breathtakingly beautiful.,"It costs $15 to drive in here and the scenery is gorgeous. There are numerous hiking trails as well. Several parking places are spread around to take in more scenery, take pictures or hike. It was thoroughly enjoyable. Highly recommended."
Outdoor adventures just outside the city,"We had a free morning while staying in Vegas on vacation and decided to visit Red Rock Canyon instead of more casinos.  Wow, bang for your buck and well worth the 30 minute drive from the strip.  If you love the outdoors and are active there are endless hiking opportunities or you can stay in your car and take the 13 mile scenic one way loop through the park.  We chose to stop at the Calico Hills trail head and hike into the signature Red Rock formations directly across from the lot.  You can make this an easy hike or you can scramble across massive rock faces, theres' something for everyone.  We did a little of both and very quickly saw that if you're prepared, you could easily spend all day at this one trail.  Being on a time budget, we hiked no more than a mile into the formations and took it easy.  After the hike, we leisurely drove the scenic loop and saw signage for another half dozen trail heads that after researching found that they all lead to many other trails.   Also found out that there are outstanding rock climbing and cycling opportunities as well as serious mountain hikes.  If I was a Vegas resident, Red Rock Canyon would be on my schedule on a weekly basis for the hiking and cycling.  Thoroughly enjoyed our visit."
Second trip now with kids,My husband and I enjoyed this place so we took the kids this time. There’s a $15 entrance fee but the kids loved hiking around the first point and taking pictures. It’s a nice day outside the strip. Wear tennis shoes and bring water.
Hiking the Red Rock Canyon,When we went it was too hot to hike (109) so we just took the road and enjoyed the view driving. Spectacular views every turn!
The sheer spectacle never disappoints ,"When I use to live here years ago I would love coming out here for an afternoon and hiking around. Got my first chance to come back in 25 years. A lot has been added like guard rails and bathrooms in certain areas but the majestic view of this area has remained the same for more years than I could imagine. We noticed both Vespa and Jeep tours going through so if you are flying into Vegas you can get a guided tour if you desire but with that you won’t get to hit the trails that are all over. Great spot to visit, can’t say enough about it."
A Cool (er) View,"Beautiful small mountains with a loop tour, both easy & challenging hikes, and loads & loads of gorgeous red rock piles! Saw lots of people out there & the scenery if fine!"
Worthwhile if you new to Las Vegas or a hiker.,"Free entrance with National Park Pass or $10 per vehicle.  Caution:  the visitor's center is currently closed due to COV-19 protocol.  There are restrooms and pop machine for use.  The loop is 15 miles with some parking for scenic views.  If you're new to LV, it's a worthwhile attraction.  There are ample hiking trails for those interested (not me though), to spend extended time out there.  The red rock formations you will see shortly after beginning the loop are the most scenic rocks on the loop.  Traffic is one way which makes for a peaceful ride through the park."
This trip is for older people,"We went there to see it to get away from Covid 19.  It was only a hour away from Vegas which is shocking, never knew this.  It is just mountains of rocks over and over in the desert.  I kind of got bored and I am 70 so anyone younger would definitely get bored no for children.  They do have a lot of out houses along the drive."
A must see!!!,My wife and I visited this National Park aside from the fact that it was 112 degrees the sights from the car were breathtaking.
Must Visit the Canyon ,This is one of the most beautiful places we have ever visited.  It was worth every penny for the drive through the canyon.  Views are spectacular!
Beautiful,There are plenty of trails here to enjoy the scenery.  We went in July and it was pretty warm. Would highly recommend renting a car and getting out there.
 Beautiful views,This was our second visit to Red Rock Canyon. This time my wife and I did Ice Box Canyon. There are actually a few places with shade along the way. I believe it is 2.5 miles each way. Highly recommend.
Las Vegas Trip,This place is beautiful! My husband and I are not able to do all the hiking so we drove the scenic loop and got out and looked around at the signs and things and it is just beautiful and so worth the trip. Not far from Vegas at all.
Beautiful Nature,"Beautiful landscape, fun drive. Lots of places to take pictures and explore. If you like nature it’s definitely a place to visit"
Amazing scenery,This was our first visit to the park and it was beautiful! Hiking wasn’t on our agenda due to the heat but there was plenty of things to see and explore close to the routes.
"So much to see, can spend the whole day",I’m I rented a car to see the national parks around Las Vegas. Red Rock Canyon has so much to see and the trail system is convenient. Just follow the road and it will lead you to little parking stations in every part of the park. Signs explain the difficulties of the trails so we just stuck to the easy ones. Mother Nature is truly breath taking.
Best Scenic Drive!!!,This scenic drive is totally worth it. There are 360 degree panoramic views through every twist and turn and you never have to leave the comfort of your vehicle if you choose not to. There are easily accessible trails but rocks can be a little treacherous so wear proper hiking shoes with traction.
Day of Hiking,"So glad Red Rock Park is open! (Visitor Center is closed) Great hike and sights  - while we were there for a picnic we saw a snake, squirrel and lizard. Nice breeze."
Great day trip close to Vegas,"Red Rock Canyon is well worth visiting. Choose a cool and/or overcast day and you will enjoy yourself a lot more. The Pine Creek Loop trail is nice and quite interesting, and the Calico Hills are spectactular.We went back the next day. If you go twice, the price of admission equals the annual pass. Something to consider."
Absolutely breathtaking,"The canyon was part of a trip to Vegas.mive never been to the states before so didn’t know what to expect. The canyon wasn’t far out of the city, perhaps 40 minutes or so but once there, it was hard to imagine how close Red Rock was to the city.The scenery, the colours, the sheer beauty of the canyon was superb. I was part of an organised tour and would have loved to have stayed longer and explored. Not to be missed."
Beautiful Landscape and Fun Hikes,"I am by no means a serious hiker, but the trails in Red Rock were fun. They rate them into three categories and give you some details about elevation change, distance and terrain so you can make an educated decision. The landscape is beautiful and interesting. Some trails are better marked than others. Make sure you have water and good shoes if you decide to hike. Otherwise, there are some good vista points for pictures. Overall, this made for a very nice detour from other Vegas attractions. $15 per car or free with America the Beautiful Pass ($80 for annual pass)"
Great hike!,"Great hike and a good drive. Do not bike ride in the heat, not good your health. Scenic drive was awesome and not far from the strip in Vegas."
Beautiful,"We love to drive through Red Rock Canyon.  Quick tip - There is a free section at a turn off to the right, maybe 1/2 mile before the main entrance.  This area is usually less crowded, it has good parking areas and a lot of incredible views on the hiking paths.  The hiking paths can also be as hard or easy as you want it to be.  OH, and it is super cool watching all the rock climbers reach the tops!"
1st trip to red rock now I want a pass.,My friend and I are avid hikers.  Even during a pandemic we do 4-5 miles or more in LA.  We did the willow spring loop and ice box canyon. We will totally come back.  It was beautiful for a $15 pass.
Red Rock,Awesome place to go and visit with friends family and whomever you would like to go with. We took some of our friends there for hiking and they had an amazing time. One of the best things we did here in Las Vegas
Friends,I was here in the summer with my friends from work. It was my first time here and I really enjoyed it. It is a cool place and I recommend it.
"short drive from Las Vegas Strip, worth to take a look","although it's not a national park, yet with the National park pass, you can enter here for free, but the entrance fee itself is not expensive, much cheaper than those national parks, it just take a short drive (about half hour) from Strip to here. There is a one-way scenic drive, with several spots you can stop and take a look to the view, take some pictures, you can also walk some trails if you have time. The petroglyph wall trail is short and easy, but the sign is very small and not easy to find. The visitor center has some exhibits, with outdoor exhibition area, the environment is good, you can also ask for ranger book for your kid, they can get a badge, too.  I suggest spend at least half day there, you can stay longer if you want to hike more trails."
Grand to say the least,"so I’ve gotta say, If you are in Las Vegas and want to do something different than gambling or drinking, rent a car and go to Red Rock Canyon.  It is Only a 30 minute drive off the strip, be sure to stop at all parking areas and get out of the car and explore. Don't forget to take a photo overlooking the Vegas Valley from the highest parking point."
Beautiful hiking and drive,Red rock canyon is a short drive from the Las Vegas strip. It’s also a short distance from great shopping at downtown Summerlin. Perfect for Refueling afterwards. It’s a very popular hiking Destination for locals and tourists and includes a beautiful 13 mile Scenic Loop.  There are plenty of places to stop and park along the roadside for photo ops or just take in the fresh air.
Grand Canyon hiking a lot closer,"Great hiking 40 minutes from the strip. We hiked the Calico Tanks trail. Markers are easy to follow. Hike is moderate, took us about an hour each way. Views at the end are amazing."
This is ALWAYS a trip when in Vegas,This year parts of the roadway was different than when I took the trip about 5yrs ago. Bigger more elaborate souvenir shop!!I always purchase things to bring home to family and friends!
Great day trip from Vegas!,"I love Vegas as much as the next person but sometimes you need a break from the strip, tourists, and flashing lights! This is so close and is the best day trip from Vegas if you want to get a little hiking in while you're in the desert."
A must see and break from the strip,"Beautiful walking trails, spectacular scenery and all a very close drive to the strip.  Really a great experience for a day's get away."
Is very scenic,Love the loop around the park. Made a few stops and took some short hikes to check out the beautiful surroundings. Very short ride from the Las Vegas Strip.
Great escape from Vegas,"Wife & I visited Red Rock Canyon in mid-March 2020. 5 1/2hrs length of visit.  Looking to do some Hiking.  Arrived on Saturday morning around 10am.  Sunny low 50's. Breezy/Windy up in elevation. (*Suggestion - purchase the Annual National Parks Pass $80 - saves on park entrance fees - esp if visiting alot of Nat parks/Nat rec areas).  Visitor center has good history info and great little gift shop w/quality items (some gift shops can be ""way too tacky"" with tourism items).  Trails:  Grab a Trail Map as you come into Park. The road is only a ""ONE WAY"" traffic.   Note: the trails closer to road will see more foot traffic as they have easy access.  We hiked two remote trails.  I highly recommend the ""KEYSTONE THRUST"" trail, its 1.2miles in to the end.  Great Views at end of trail.  Warning: The elevation goes up 370ft - its a good heart pumping exercise - Bring water - its a high desert environment - same is true for alot of the trails that have elevation.  See many people not prepared with water, not a good idea as it leads to headaches/upset stomachs.  Also, be cautious of uneven terrain.  Our next trail was the LaMadre Spring trail - its an old canyon road with loose rocks.  A moderate difficulty - uphill elevation 400ft - 3.5miles in & out.  Nothing too spectacular trail though but great views...the ""springs"" at the end of trail are not as impressive as one is lead to believe. Picnic area:  We did spend time to have lunch at a picnic table area, About a dozen tables.  A few families using them.  We did find that 1 out of 3 restrooms (vault toilet) were available to use others locked. Bring Hand sanitizer/wipes.  Road traffic:  Just wanted to mention that vehicle traffic gets heavy through out the day.  Speed limits range from 15 to 30mph (posted)...expect people to pass along the left as slower traffic is viewing the scenery.  The one way road allows plenty of passing.  They do have staff to assist with directing people if parking areas are ""overflowed""...They do allow parking on the road.Hiking note:  Some trails are difficult to average person.  Recommend that wearing adequate footwear for uneven terrain.  We have hiking boots and carry gear/supplies for Hiking.  My wife and I are experienced hikers.  I did notice people wearing ""flip flops"" and High heels ""dress shoes"" - yes, an older lady wearing 3inch heels on a hiking trail.  Crazy to see here ankles twisting walking over rocks, etc....she was leaning on her male counterpart."
Calm!,Beautiful place! Nice place to stay and admire total please of nature . You need to walk and climb some rocks
Red Rock Canyon,"I have lived in Las Vegas for years.  Red Rock is a get-away within minutes of the metro area.  The variation of colors, the high desert beauty is magnificent.  There is a state park in the canyon."
BEAUTIFUL:),"Took a drive around the scenic loop and it was beautiful.  Not crowded during our trip (probably due to the cornoavirus shutdowns).  We also had beautiful, crisp weather.  Summer would be brutal! Must see if in the Vegas area.  Beautiful views."
Senior citizens can enjoy too!,"Not far from the Vegas strip is the Red Rock Canyon Conservation area. We seniors, late 60’s, drove the scenic loop and admired the colorful rock formations. We did not go prepared to hike a trail; but we thoroughly enjoyed the scenery and got some good photographs."
Great,"I ran Red Rock Canyon Marathon.Amazing place,A great opportunity to  know the loop and beyond.Wonderful place from sunrise to sunset throughout the day"
Red Rock Canyon,"An amazing short hop from the Las Vegas Strip . For all nature loves , bikers and hikers . Beautiful view of the red rocks , short and long trail. Mountain climbing and more"
Amazing views and awesome history to preserve,"The area is well worth the $15 car admission. We spent 6 hours there and could have spent another day or two. We didn't even get to most of the advanced hikes, but still got to see some amazing things, including a great light at the end of the tunnel seeing the view of Las Vegas from the end of the Calico Tanks trail. We will definitely be back the next time we're in Las Vegas. Its great to see this area being kept around for generations to come hopefully."
Get-away week,"Red Rock Canyon’s red sandstone peaks, valleys, boulders, and desert flora is gorgeous! Just a half hour drive from the facade of Las Vegas is this beautiful quite city escape to explore; whether you choose to drive the 13 mile loop, to hike a lot or a little, to enjoy a picnic, or to simply find a rock to lean back on and rest and refresh your mind and body."
Beautiful,"Great park, full of gorgeous scenery.  We did the Calico Hills hike, starting from the Calico 1 parking lot, and ending about halfway between Calico 2 and the Sandstone Quarry lots.  Did a small scramble up some rocks for fun -- would be lots of fun to climb if you have the time.  Was there with young kids, was great for them."
Land of the Sand Giants,These majestic structures makes one humble and in awe at once. The desert by night is a totally different environment Good trekking venue with multiple Instagram moments opportunity.
Excellent Well Marked Tails,This Conservation Area has really benefited from significant visitor traffic.  Most people come for a scenic drive or a very short hike but there are many well marks and spectacular trails that can be hike peacefully.  That said try to avoid peak periods as the roadway can get quite busy.
Great Family Outing,The loop is very well maintained and easy to navigate.  We saw several motorcycles which would be really fun to drive on this road.  The road is one way so people can pass if you want to go slower than others.  The visitor center is really nice stop on the way in I didn't see a way to stop on the way out.
A Gem Just Outside of Vegas,"Pack a picnic lunch, throw on your hiking shoes, and grab a camera - less than an hour drive from downtown Vegas this Conservation Area is a gem.  Take along your National Parks pass and avoid the entrance fee.  Best to go during the week to avoid crowds, there are plenty of hiking trails of varying degrees of difficulty, plenty of photo opportunities, and some wonderful places to explore.  The short hike to the rock walls with Native American Petroglyphs are definitely worth seeing.  Get a map at the park entrance and be sure to stop at the Visitor Center and see the history of the place (and all of the desert tortoises that live there).  Take along snacks and drinks - there are no concession stands in the park."
Day hikes are delightful,"This is a beautiful natural area. It is an easy drive from Las Vegas- no tour arrangements are needed for day hiking. Or, if you have a 4x4 you can drive a mile or so further up the drive. Only one disappointing comment- there are good signs and info markers until you go past the paved road. Then you are on your own to find the sights. Bring water. Wear a hat."
beautiful scenery on a stormy Friday,"wanted to get some fresh air on our junket to Vegas.   Looked up this place and off we went.  Frontal weather discouraged longer walks but we stopped at the calico hills and the petroglyph wall for a peek.  Definitely worth the 30 min drive from downtown and $15 vehicle charge, which allows you to drive the 13-mile loop at your leisure.  More than adequate facilities at multiple stops, picnic areas and well marked trails.  Will be back in better weather."
Beautiful rock formations and nice hikes,Close to Las Vegas and very nice trails for some easy hikes. Calico Tanks trail ends with a nice overlook of Vegas.
Hiking at Red Rock,We had a great hike at Red Rock Canyon.  You can climb the rocks and see rock arches and other amazing features.  It was an incredible hike.  There is lots more to explore either on your own or with a guide.
Good hikes ,"If you want to hike someplace close from Vegas, I recommend this park. Only 30 min west of the Strip. Decent hikes with scenic views. However, I did Not see the wildlife I was hoping to, as advertised in the park brochure/trail guide. Found neither big horn sheep nor the springs at La Madre Springs. And the petroglyphs may have been neat/worth it if you hadn't seen any before. I wish I would have used my time to hike Pine Creek Canyon instead."
Red Rock Canyon,The pickup and drop off on the strip was easy and convenient.  The tour guide was informative about the Las Vegas area and the Red Rock Canyon.  The canyon is beautiful.  Our tour also included lunch at Howard Hughes ranch which was a great tour that included a lot of trivia about the area.   History buffs and nature lovers will enjoy this tour very much.
Spectacular!,A beautiful natural site with a great loop road with spectacular views for those who don't care to get out and take a hike. A really nice respite from the craziness of the strip
Beautiful area,We did this hike on our last trip to Las Vegas which was 2019. The area is so pretty and has some easy hiking areas and then some challenging areas as well. We did a lot of rock scrambling which we really enjoyed!
This is a must-do and easy from Las Vegas esp. if you don't have time to go to Grand Canyon,his is a must-do and easy from Las Vegas esp. if you don't have time to go to Grand Canyon. Easy loop drive and stop-off places to take pictures and take a longer look.
Peaceful ,Definitely a place to visit. Better to go early mornings to avoid crowd so you can feel the stillness of the earth while appreciate the history. It's magical to see it.
Wonderful day trip!,This is the perfect places to take in the Nevada topography. You can escape the overstimulation of the strip and recuperate with some wonderful hikes or drive the 13 mile road  to take in the sights. Bring along a picnic lunch.
Red Rock Review,A great day trip of the Grand Canyon for the whole family. Please remember to wear comfortable shoes and clothing. You must bring your camara. Countless beautiful photo opportunities and if you are lucky you may spot an Elk or Mule Deer.
Just beautiful! ,"We took an Uber over from the strip. From the Visitor Centre, we were able to hike the Calico I & II trails. Amazing colors & rock formations. The gate & visitors center have WiFi for booking the Uber home. Having a car to drive the loop will be a must the next time we visit!"
Cool!,"Visited this area first day in Las Vegas and needing a day trip. Place was very well run, with one way traffic all round and ample parking at scenic points. Free to explore all the areas at your own comfort level. Beautiful!"
"There IS red and then there is RED ,","Seeing is believing. The layers of different colors are truly amazing. The years between each layer, even more amazing. The color red is from East to West. The layers upon layers, all the people who have seen these rocks before me or you. Now there are trails and lots of them, yes bathrooms at the tourists stops. If you have to go you have to go. They are there. As soon as you enter go to the gift shop, you do not get another chance unless you go through the entrance gate again. Yes there was a line, but ours went fast we had a membership card to all the National parks. Well worth it....."
Best Vegas Trip Ever,"I've been going to Vegas since 2004 and have always had a great time. My last trip we rented a car and drove to Red Rock National Conservation Area. Let me tell you that this was my favorite trip to Vegas ever. There is a whole world outside of the Vegas strip that you don't even think about. There is a bit of freeway driving to get out of the city, but soon your a cruising the highways out in the middle of the desert with nothing but blue skies and cactus all around you. We rented a convertible and it made the trip even better. You could spend several days at Red Rock and not see everything."
Red Rock Canyon is a great excursion for the whole family,My husband and I took our son and daughter in law and grandkids aged 5 and 7 to Red Rock Canyon. We all so enjoyed the experience. The grandkids loved being junior rangers and finding the hidden animals in the visitor's center. We all enjoyed the scenery on the drive and also hiking and taking great photos.
A Las Vegas Treasure the Casinos Don’t Want You to Know About!,Numerous trails of caring difficulty to suit anyone. A must do while in Las Vegas.  Plenty of water and sunscreen at all times!
Beautiful Nature So Close to the City,"Just a short drive from Vegas strip, this is a stunning spot with beauty all around, and lots of trails for hikes."
My Go To Place to Hike in Las Vegas,"This is a must for anyone who likes to hike, rock climb or just explore the cool rock formations. There are different tour options available as well, although I haven’t personally done any of them.There are many different hiking trails, differing from easy to difficult as well as just places to stop and take pictures, so it’s easy to take anyone here. The terrain and scenery differs as well, so depending where you hike in the park it feels like you are in a completely different area. The scenic drive itself is beautiful too and the whole place is a photo opportunity. It’s best to go visit in the cooler months or early mornings before temps get too hot. Always come here when I am in town and bring others to as well!"
Nice outdoors afternoon,"The scenery of Red Rock Canyon was beautiful.  There were unlimited opportunities to take wonderful pictures.  The driving/trail map was well marked as were the parking spots.  We took a picture of the length of the trails on the sign at the first stop.  This was helpful to have to determine which trails we wanted to walk.  We spent most of the day driving, walking the shorter trails, and visiting the visitors center.  Even if you didn't hike the trails, there are many sites to see from the road and parking spots. We were there in March and the weather was beautiful, but I can see it would quickly get hot in the summer."
This is a must see when traveling to Nevada,"First visit out here and trust me you will not regret the time spent as the views are incredible.  It was so cool to watch, the sky change colors as the day progressed.  This is a great excuse to take a break from the casinos"
Amazing views and hiking/rock climbing available,"This was a great surprise. I went to just drive through thinking I would see some good views, but I was surprised to find out you could climb around on the rocks and keep getting higher and higher. I spent three hours climbing around on rocks, mostly because a 12 year old kept getting higher than me somehow....Amazing time, and I didn't even know until after about all the other hiking trails on the loop!"
AMAZING Views,I lived in the LAS Vegas are and I have to say that this is an amazing place to visit.  The views are absolutely stunning and the hiking is awesome!  It is just a short ride from the Vegas strip and well worth it!  Explore outside of the strip!
Beautiful place,Easy drive from Vegas.  Nice road to drive around the canyon.  If you go make sure to check out the town of blue diamond that is nearby.  Cute quaint little town.
Beautiful!!,"Red Rock Canyon is a great escape for all, locals and tourists alike. It is a beautiful area where you can enjoy the surrounding mountains of Las Vegas. Lots of hiking trails are available. Things to consider. Go to the Visitors' Center first. It is worth stopping by. Once you come out from the park's scenic loop, you have to re-enter if you skipped it hoping to catch it later. There is the narmal national park fee that is charged. Bring water if you plan on spending time to walk some of the paths. Bring a jacket even if it is a warm day in the valley. The elevation and the shade will make it a bit chilly. Be considerate of the park and do not litter. Enjoy yourselves and the beautiful scenery."
A great getaway from the madness of the Strip,We rented a car to visit this area just outside Vegas.  We found the scenic beauty of this area awe inspiring.  So different from our home in Ohio.  Definitely worth the time.
Peaceful Break from Vegas,Red Rock is a short 20 minute drive from the strip -- small admission price for the circular drive through the park. The first view of the Red Rock section is stunning while the drive allows for several parking areas where hikes range from 20 minutes to several hours and degrees of difficulty. Worth the drive -- there are tours offered from Vegas as well.
Majestic ,Red Rock is one of the most beautiful places I have visited in recent years. I would recommend getting there when they open as there was a huge line of cars when I arrived and it was slow moving. Most of the parking areas were full too as people were hiking the trails. There was a medical emergency on the road off the scenic drive so I was unable to hike the trail I wanted to so I went over to Ice Box Canyon to hike. The first half was hike and the second half was bouldering. I didn’t make it to the end of the trail as I have an injury and the boulders were suppose to get bigger plus there was a steep climb right at the end. But it didn’t really matter as you were surrounded by such a gorgeous environment. I could have spent all day there.
Stunning,"If you are a serious or a novice climber this is the area for you, within a quick drive out of town puts you in an incredible canyon filled with all outdoor sports, try it on a full moon"
Red Rock or Mount Charleston,Great drive for a day to experience the mountains and twisty roads up to 8500 ft elevation.  Dress warm as there was at least a 15 degree C difference between the Las Vegas valley and the mountain ranges.  Worth the drive.  Very scenic!
Escape from the Escape ,"I like to call Red Rock Canyon NP one of Vegas’s best kept secrets. It’s a playground for hikers and rock climbers. Surprisingly, only a short drive outside of Las Vegas and a lot of locals either haven’t been here or don’t even know it exists. It’s best to visit in the cooler months (October-April) or before it gets hot in the summer. One can spend hours hiking and climbing the rocks here. I always enjoy climbing to the top of the rocks near the entrance and looking out at the skyline in the distance. At times, looking at some of the rocks can get trippy and look like faces or animals. Red Rock Canyon NP is never disappointing."
Beautiful high desert environment,"Visited here with an e-bike tour from Las Vegas (see my review), and loved it. The park covers 200,000 acres managed by BLM, and staffed largely by volunteers. Geologically significant, it’s very popular with rock climbers. The main road is one way and can be traveled by car, motorcycle, bike or other vehicles. It contains many hiking trails, springs, and high desert flora and fauna. Great 1/2 day excursion from Las Vegas."
I like this area,Beautiful views and simple for hiking. Interesting visitor center. Easy drive from Las Vegas. I am very like Spring time (not hot and some flowers). Usual we hiking not in fee area (before entry to park).
A serene environment just a short ride from the strip,Great place to enjoy nature. Get a breathe of fresh air and natural sounds. Outstanding walking trails.
So pretty!,I broke my ankle so no getting out but loved driving through the canyon.  It was very pretty.  We saw lots of hikers and people rock climbing.  The visitor center was very nice with lots of information.
Scenic desert area with beautiful rocks,This place is such a joy to visit. Close to the famous Strip but oh so different and beautiful. The history is very interesting and the fauna has so many uses for medicinal purposes for the native Americans. Peaceful and relaxing.
Beautiful Scenery!,In the area for a baseball game and decided to take the short drive to this park...what a good choice.Beautiful sights!!You can drive the 13 mile loop or stop and hike at the many stops along the way.There is a minimal charge of $15 per vehicle.You will get some awesome camera shots.Worth the short drive.
Always Beautiful and Amazing,"Rent a car and drive to Red Rock, you won't be disappointed. Wear sensible shoes as you'll want to hike a little to see its beauty.  First parking area has the best hiking IMO."
Don't Skip the Scenic Loop,Frequent pull off parking.  Amazing views everywhere.  Just be ready for the wind and cooler temperatures.
Las Vegas area gem,You’d never know this place was a few minutes from the strip. It’s so beautiful and cooler temps. The drive through is a 13 mile loop. So much to look at even on a chilly day. But the hiking is my favorite. Easy to moderate which ever trail you choose.
Beautiful!,Beautiful hiking. Beautiful view.  Great for couples or families to just get out take in the beautiful Nevada scenery. You can either drive around or stop and hike some of the trails.
Tranquility in Nature,"If you want to experience the beauty of the desert, Red Rack Canyon is the place to go.  Try and go during the cooler months. It's a great spot for hiking or rock climbing. You can also bicycle ride the 13 mile loop thru the canyon. Caveat - be in good shape for that bike ride.   Pack a lunch and bring plenty of water."
Great views!,Not far from the strip. Worth the short drive. Even if you don't like to hike driving through the park is enjoyable
One of the Wonders of Nevada,A don’t miss place to visit when you come to Las Vegas!  Natural resource 15 minutes from the strip.  Beautiful vistas and lots of places to hike.
"Second time here, just as amazing as the first",I recommend including a trip that will let you be there when the sun sets.  The beauty of the mountains changes dramatically as the setting sun hits the mountain faces.
A must do experience!,"Red Rock Canyon is one of Las Vegas's (And Nevada's) greatest treasures. As a lifelong resident of the Vegas valley, I can't tell you how many times I've hiked the canyons, from childhood all the way to adulthood. It's beauty and peacefulness the absolute picture of the great south west. You can charter helicopters to fly you over it, you can hike it, you can ride a bike on a 13 mile road that goes way into it. You can rent a horse and go riding in it. There is rock climbing. There are waterfalls if you go far enough. I highly recommend visiting Red Rock at least once while you are in Las Vegas. You won't regret it."
Great Hike,"My wife and I had a great day, walking through the different trails within the park. The information center and the parks introduction video, is a must see to set the foundation of what you will be visiting. Wear some comfortable shoes!"
Unbelievable sights of natural beauty.  Red Rock Canyon,We were picked up on time by the tour guide Adam Klasfeld from Grand Canyon tours.  The vehicle was spacious.  The tour guide was well informed and offered many historical facts and details of the animals that roam the area at night. A memorable experience and I highly recommend it.
Getaway,This a very cool place just outside of Vegas. We stopped at the welcome center just inside the gate after you pay. You need to this first because once you pass it you can't go back. It gave us lots of information.There are all levels of hiking trails so everyone can enjoy the sights.
"Not to be missed, if you are in Las Vegas!",The one-way 13-mile scenic drive is magnificent and well kept. The Visitor Center is very informative. Parking lots and picnic areas are scattered along the way.
Beautiful,We rented a car one day and drove out here from the Strip. It was beautiful and a perfect length of a drive. There weren’t a ton of Red Rocks but they and the almost moon crater-like topography was stunning. There were lots of hikes and places of interest to stop at along the way. We’ve been going to Las Vegas for 40 years and have never done this drive and are sure glad we finally did!
Nice diversion from the Strip,"Beautiful drives and hikes in this scenic desert landscape.  A nice chance to commune with nature after the sensory overload of Vegas. But alas, very crowded here too on the day we were here."
Well worth a few short hikes,"This was an easy drive from Vegas and the loop drive was full of pull over spots for amazing views. We took a short hike, but there are many choices at this well organized park."
Good view,Very very nice view . Good place to hike .Close to the city of Las Vegas. Al it if restaurants close by. Good area to visit
Great place away from the casinos and the strip,"Have been here more than once.  If you have a national parks pass, it's included.  Fair amount of parking.  Bathrooms added since our last visit.  Watch out for pedestrians and bike/scooter riders!  One of the best things to do in Las Vegas in the daytime."
one way,"Major road through the park is one way.  Once you're on it, you're committed to the whole drive.Wear sturdy shoes and bring some water."
Side Trip to Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area from Las Vegas,Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area from Las Vegas is a quick and easy 45 minute. Going around the park is free unless you want to visit their Visitor's Center where you pay their entrance fee. There are a lot key points to stop to take photos or to do some short hiking. Highly recommended if you are visitor of Las Vegas.
Must see while you're in the area,"Took my parents on this one. Unplanned trip, we took a wrong turn when thinking of where to dine. My father really enjoyed this trip. We all did but you can literally take in and enjoy all the scenery from your car. The formations and colors are unbelievable. Just a warning, at the end of the day, the sun goes down ""QUICK""!!!! Bamm, sun went down and we were in the dark. So we plan on going back again though a lot earlier in the day. My mother never wants to picnic but next time she wants to picnic here. Go figure. We easily spent over 90 minutes and still could have stayed much longer mesmerized by just natural beauty."
Beautiful hiking and drive,"This is worth the trip if you are renting a car.  You can drive the loop and some small walks, or do a more serious hike if that is your jamb."
Nat Geo picturesque,"I came ‘this close’ to booking a tour here with one of the companies.  We had gone with Desert Tours to the Grand Canyon, and had a great time on that tour.  Looking at the descriptions of the Red Rock Canyon tours, though, I saw that they only allowed 30 minutes ‘on our own’.  So, I rented a car for $60 and took my family out to the park.It was a 40 minute drive from our hotel on the Strip, a very easy trip.  The fee for the day is $20 per car.  We packed a picnic lunch, and sat in splendor at a site at a midway point on the Scenic Drive.  We had lunch after going on the Calico Tank hike, which took about 2 hours, with my 7, 9, and 12-year-old boys.  This hike was a little strenuous for the younger boys, but they managed to just about keep up.After lunch we drove a little further along the Scenic Drive to another site where we went on two shorter, easier hikes.  The photos I took with just my iPhone are stunning.  They look worthy of National Geographic.  I can only imagine what an experienced photographer with serious equipment could produce.If we had taken the tour, it would have been about $480 for my family, depending on the tip to the guide.  Renting the car for the day, paying admission, and packing a picnic lunch cost a total of $100.  The best thing, though, is that we had hours and hours to hike and weren’t on anybody else’s schedule.  It was such a great day that we did the same thing two days later, but went on hikes that were adjacent to the Park.Our trip was in late February, when the daytime highs were in the upper 60’s, just perfect for hiking."
Great place to visit just outside Vegas,Went here for a 1/2 day visit.  Did a few nice hikes.  Really beautiful.  Please note that you can use your America the Beautiful National Park Pass here.  I didn't know that and it cost $15.  Oh well.
Worth Visiting and offers many activities,Red Rock Canyon offers all sorts of activities for all ages; from a  scenic drive to  hiking. I would particularly recommend parking at both the White Rock and Willow Springs areas and do some of all the hikes.
Red Rock Canyon (Calico Racing half-marathon),"This state park is located about a 30 minute drive from Las Vegas, and has fabulous views throughout.    This can be explored on your own, or with one of the various tour groups (such as Pink Jeep).    Calico Racing organizes a marathon, half-marathon and 5 km road race, and this is a very-well organized event for runners of all ages, as long as you are in shape to manage the gradients along the scenic route.   Highly recommended!"
Must see,The views are amazing! They have tours for off roading available but just to see the views no tour is needed. It's an easy drive and you don't even have to get out of the car to see some great views. They have easy walking trails and some for more experienced. We walked some trails with the kids ages 5 - 15  they all had a blast
ARRIVE EARLY! ,"Beautiful! Worth a 1/2 day or full day visit. Plenty of hikes for all levels of fitness. GET THERE EARLY!! The line of cars to enter the park was very long, unless you arrive by 9 am. You may even need to arrive earlier at other times of the year. (We visited on a Saturday in February.) The parking lots within the park fill up too, another reason to arrive early. Remember to dress in layers. The weather varies depending on where you are in the park. For example, Ice Box Canyon is cooler than other trails. Nice Visitor Center with vending machines and bathrooms. Several places within the park with picnic tables."
A day outside,"Fantastic area to go visit with lots to see and do. Hiking, rock climbing, bike riding and much more. $15 per vehicle is not bad for a day of fun. There are designated trails or you could explore on your own.  The gates close at 5 so go early and enjoy the day. We packed our lunch and ate at 1 of the picnic tables in the park.  Plenty to do but dress appropriately with boots, light jacket and bring water.  Check out the visitor center and maybe you will get lucky and see the turtles."
Always Fun,Been here hiking many times over the years and always a great day.  Hike around with the dogs on leash and makes for fun.  Beautiful mountains.
Red Rock Canyon with D-Tours. 5 star!,"Visited here today with D-Tours. Lucky enough to just be me and the driver, Darren,.The trip was amazing and Darren was very informative and really helped me enjoy the scenery even more.Highly recommend. Definitely worth a visit and lovely to be out of the city for a while."
Amazing,"I loved the Red Rock Canon, the access is very quiet and easy, for many things to see and visit, and I really recommend it highly"
Stunning scenery half an hour from Vegas,We visited Red Rock Canyon to run a marathon along the Scenic Drive road - you may prefer to experience it from the comfort of a car! The scenery is truly awe inspiring and a wonderful change from Vegas
"REDROCKMANIA,","Beautiful scenery and nice weather, Great place to visit and getaway from the strip. Good place to bring family or friends out there to clam the rocks and do some hiking. it is a 18 miles trail if yo decide to do bike riding. Its a challenge but its worth it. There also a visitor center that you can learn the history of the native Indians. Worth your trip. a must see."
Free and close to Vegas,I've been to Vegas many times but hadn't got to the Red Rocks yet.  What a wonderful visit.  The rocks are beautiful and offer many a chance to climb or just selfie you heart out.  Lots to see all for free
Nice hiking close to Vegas,"It's green and the weather is lovely this time of year. I enjoyed spending a couple hours hiking. The geological formations are very impressive, and it was not nearly as crowded as the National parks I visited in Utah in November."
Amazing geology and good visitor center,"Visited early Sunday morning and watched the film in the visitor center before driving around the 13 mile loop. Stopped at a few of the parking lots to check out the views, but did not have time to hike to the petroglyphs. Used the Senior Pass for National Parks for free entrance."
Red Rock Rules!,"GREAT scenic drive! Of course there's plenty more to do here, There's a great visitors center with a nice gift shop, and a REALLY good movie, definitely  worth watching., But since  I travel with my Mom, who doesn't hike much at all anymore,  we came to enjoy the scenic drive mostly, and pulling off at all the viewpoints. Getting some UNREAL pictures.  It was well worth the time to get out here.   It was AWESOME!It was CRAZY windy and cold when we were here in early February, something like 38 with 30-40 mph gusts..But still we had a blast and I would love to come back and do some serious hiking. Looks like an awesome place to hike.Red Rock is AMAZING! and as close as it is to Vegas its accessible to most anyone. Red Rock Canyon and Valley of Fire State park add a REALLY SPECTACULAR  natural option for your Vegas visit.   Don't miss either one."
Great drive. Doesn’t take a long time ,"Great drive in Mojave desert. Beautiful views, great visitors center. Beautiful drive that is easy to do."
"Hiking at Red Rock Canyon, Nevada","An easy 35 to 45 minute drive from Las Vegas.Lots of hiking trails; and best time to visit is the Winter/early Spring months.By June; it gets up above 90 deg. F.In late MArch/April, there are flowers in bloom.The rock formations are amazing and there are lots of areas for photography and pictures for your scarpbook.Hikers will have a field day here.Temperatures can be 10 to 20 degrees cooler than in Las Vegas- especially if the wind blows through a canyon.Love the Visitor Center for maps, guides, and souvenier T-shirts/caps"
Vegas Playground!,"Located just a few miles to the west of Las Vegas, Red Rock Canyon offers stunning rock formations and a myriad of hiking opportunities."
Great ride- beautiful views,"Took ride with friends had a great Time--stopped at Worlds Famous Bar-- fun place--Biker bar, nice people"
Its worth the drive!,3.5 hour tour with Pink Jeep Tours was fabulous. The 13 mile one way driving tour with stops along the way to take pictures was lots of fun.
Beautiful area close to Vegas,Red Rock Canyon is beautiful through the entire drive.  Make sure to stop and walk the trails and also the climbers.
Great views,We hired a Harley and went to red rock  fantastic views.  Do need to pay to go round. There are stop points for viewing. Worth a visit.
Beautiful Drive,We were in Las Vegas on business and took a drive through the park. Definitely glad we did. Lots of hiking or just drive through.
Great attraction of the strip!,Red Rock Canyon is an amazing outdoor area to visit when in Las Vegas. There are short or strenuous hikes. You can even just drive through and still be exposed to amazing views. If you have a National Parks Pass you don't have to pay admission which is $15.
Better than expected,"We did not have enough time to do any hiking.  The drive featured great views and numerous photo opportunities.  The hiking and climbing opportunities appeared to be spectacular, but the drive alone is well worth it."
Great Escape!,"This is only 20-30 minutes from downtown or The Strip. It's a great getaway from the noise and crowds. There are lots of trails to take, and even if the parking lots at the trailheads look crowded, once you're on the trail you get some alone time. Everyone that I did encounter on a trail was very friendly. Everyone was just enjoying the day. There were quite a few bicycles in the park as well, and it looked really fun. I would like to do that next time!Some tips....go to the visitors center when you enter the park. By doing the one-way loop you will not be able to come back to it without re-entering the park. Same goes for trails, etc. If you pass something by, you can't go back without leaving the park and coming back in, which might not sound so bad, except....Go early! I got there about an hour after they opened and there were two lines of cars trying to get in. It wasn't too bad of a wait, but a lot of cars. Then after I left the park and went further south for a bit and passed by again on my way back to Vegas around noon....there were TONS of cars trying to get in! They were backed out onto the highway and lined up for at least a mile. If I had headed down and met up with that...I might not have gone into the park. It was really horrendous. Besides the traffic getting in, I imagined all of those people trying to park at trailheads, etc. So GO EARLY.Or, another option is to head north instead to Valley of Fire. I've been there three times and there are more options for travelling through, lots of trails walking through the red rocks, a visitors center, etc. So, comparable scenery and hiking and not nearly as crowded, plus a nice drive north.Either way, I highly recommend a day of ""nature therapy"" when visiting Las Vegas, no matter where you choose to go."
Amazingly beautiful ,"None of the pictures does this place justice. I am so happy we left the strip and drove out to Red Rock Canyon! It was the highlight of our Las Vegas trio. Bring water, a snack and proper clothing."
A must see on your Las Vegas Vacation!,"We took a day to drive out and explore Red Rock Canyon. It’s about a 30 minute drive from the Las Vegas strip and totally worth visiting! The visitor center has several viewpoints for photos and a lot of interactive activities for kids. We drove the loop and stopped at most all of the points along the way. Each one was a different landscape. So glad we went, it’s a beauty you would not expect in Las Vegas."
Great Relaxing Drive or Hiking Spot,"Spend a full day or just an hour or two.  We had a rental car and did the quick 20 minute drive to Red Rock Canyon.  After having hiked at Valley of Fire National Park and Death Valley the previous days we didn't do any hiking here as we were flying out later in the day.  We did stop at each pull out and do a little exploring in some areas.  The views were great and we really enjoyed our time. We arrived just after 9:00am on a Sunday in February and spent a little under 2 hours in the park.  The weather was perfect and it was not busy.  However, on our way out there was a long line of cars waiting to get into the park.  I would definatly recommend going earlier in the day."
Nice drive,"We went two times, since the first time we went, it was cloudy and cold. We hiked Pine canyon almost to the end of the loop hike.  Very colorful.."
Great place to hike!,Went there to go hiking.  Very beautiful!  Large range of hiking trails from short to long and easy to difficult. Highly recommend.
Great hiking spot,"This is our second time visiting Red Rock. It’s about a 20 minute drive from the strip and $15 to park. There are multiple trails to visit but we did the first one we came to with large red rocks with cool patterns. The kids had a great time exploring, admiring the natural beauty of the formations. Great picture spots and lots of cracks and crevices to check out. I’d say it’s a must visit in Vegas away from the smoke and hustle and bustle of the strip."
Amazing,We were lucky to be there when they had a horse and burro from BLM.  The views were nice. Parking was plentiful.
Day of rest from the strip ,We rented a car for the day and drove over to Red Rock. Took about 40 from Flamingo and was 15.00 per car to enter. It's a winding 13 mile drive around the Red Rocks with several trail heads to explore from. The entry rocks at Calico are stunning and awesome to explore. You can watch others climbing and repelling along the rocks. Just a nice day to spend away from the hustle and bustle of the strip.
Get outside of the strip!,"We have been to Vegas several times before but had never visited Red Rocks and were excited to visit on this trip.  We were glad we did!  It is so much closer to the strip than we realized but is such a different (and beautiful) environment.  The visitor center seemed very nice but most of the exhibits were outside and it was colder than we were expecting so we didn't get to see as much of the exhibits as we liked.  We enjoyed the drive but were surprised when it snowed in a few places - don't be like us, realize that the weather in the dessert can be much colder than you expected!  We stopped several times throughout the drive and enjoyed seeing the petroglyphs.  We are from the East coast and enjoyed seeing a very different natural environment."
Fun Time,Take some time away from Vegas and see Red Rock Canyon only took about 30 minutes to get there. It cost 15 dollars a car and just beautiful.  Take the circle around and make stops at certain view locations. If you want to take a walk have fun.
Stunning,This conservation area is located just minutes away from downtown Vegas. There’s hiking and climbing and great panoramic views. It’s well worth a visit.
Wow,Located approximately 30 miles North of the Vegas Strip but an entirely different world. There is a fee to enter but well worth it. The varying hues of color of the landscape is amazing. There are numerous opportunities to pull off the road to hike into an area to explore. We saw rock climbers in a few locations. Plan to take at least 90-120 minutes at minimum for the drive through the area. A picnic lunch would be an even nicer way to enjoy this desert beauty.
Amazing views,"This was a quick and easy ride out of Las Vegas to get to with some very nice areas to ride through along the way.  The views were amazing.  They had multiple stop offs throughout the scenic loop that allowed you to park and get closer to nature.  We did see some deer along the route and the burros were at the very front of the park as we were leaving.  If you are an outdoorsy person who loves to hike and enjoy nature, this is the ideal location and time of year to do so.  The weather was perfect since was a little cool.   Worth the visit!"
Such a sight to see!!!,"Went when sun was there for first 5 minutes, but them clouded and rained and even hailed. But...still a  site to see! As you take this easy 13 mile drive,  every turn gives you a new view of various natural colors throughout the vast land and rock mountains. Many areas to stop and take pictures. Its not far from the strip and worth the trip"
Beautiful area,When in Vegas this is a must see area. 20 minutes and you are in a quiet wilderness. We walked the trail to Icebox Canyon. Very pretty.
We always go here when we visit our son in Las Vegas.  The red rocks never disappoint.,We take the drive from Henderson when visiting family even though we've been here several times.  It's worth the time to witness the red rocks and geological formations that we don't often see if you live on the East Coast.  The gift shop is great and the drive is well worth the time. One of the area's best attractions.
Okay for the “Drive by” naturalist,Beautiful place to drive through and do some light hiking. It’s very close to Vegas so a good place to see if don’t have more than a few hours. We were a bit disappointed that the “red rocks” (although beautiful) were pretty much in just one area of the park.
Colourful ,Only 20 minutes out of Los Vegas Strip this scenic drive is away from the hustle and bustle of LV. It’s currently $15 for a car to traverse the 13 mile drive. The intense red rock is the first part of the drive you see and can clamber over. If you haven’t got time there is an overlook about a mile down the road that is free and gives a panoramic view of the whole basin.
Break Away from Las vegas and Enjoy Nature,This is a great break from the hustle and bustle of Las vegas. You don't have to be a hiker to enjoy this as you can drive your car through the canyon and enjoy the wonderful scenery.
Wonderful Hiking in rather cold weather.,"1st Time to Red Rock, the rain deter me from taking a hike in one of the many trails within Red Rock Canyon Conservation Area. This is my 2nd time and determine to do at least 1 solo hike. Took the TurtleHead trail and oh man I have underestimated the difficulty for my own physical condition. Over still a wonderful 3 plus hour hike in less than 10 deg weather conditions. It's a great place to visit and take a simple hike."
A nice escape from downtown Las Vegas,My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our guide trip of the area. We have traveled extensively throughout the southwest and while it is not an alternative to Sedona or Arches National Park the guides are very informative. This trip is more tailored towards learning about the ancient sinaguan people who once called it home. The scenery is nice but the area is best suited to people with an interest in ancient cultures.
Miracle Miles,"Not shopping on the Las Vegas Strip...this is only 30 minutes of of Vegas but feels like another world.  Gorgeous views of red rocks, mountains and canyons from the scenic loop and the various turnouts.  Some very good hiking options, though most are in/out, vice loop options.  The popular Calico Tanks is fun and scenic, especially at the end. But everyone else thinks so too, so go early or have lots of company.  Our favorite was the White Rock 6.2 mile loop.  The 2-3 miles in the La Madre Wilderness on the back side of White Rock were stunning."
A natural desert oasis just minutes from the city!,"This place is so cool! My wife and I took the short 20 minute drive from the strip in our rental convertible on our most recent trip to Vegas! There is so much to do, from miles and miles of hiking trails, to rock climbing, to bicycle tours, red rock has it all! Driving the scenic loop with the top down on the convertible was absolutely breathtaking! It was a nice change of pace from the hustle and bustle of the strip! My wife isn’t very outdoorsy, so we chose to just take some pictures within close range of the car at most of the stops. We did however, hike one of the short, easy trails. We both really enjoyed the experience and agreed we could see ourselves coming back to do some of the longer, more difficult trails on our next trip. She enjoyed Red Rock more than Valley of Fire because the trails are well marked and the dirt/gravel trails are easier to navigate compared to the very sandy terrain at valley of fire."
Gorgeous!,"Awe inspiring, raw beauty.  We took the Red Rock Scooter Tour (see review) and LOVED it!  Be aware distances in the desert are deceiving so plan hikes carefully or take a guide.  Several public restrooms along 13 mile loop."
Terrific place and drive,"If you are in Nevada, this is a must see place.Rent a car or drive, the loop scenic drive is really awesome with so many stopovers to just get down and see."
Beautiful Place!,"Drove a supercar through the canyon and it was amazing to go there...wish i could visit this place every week,  so many hiking trails to do and so much beauty, will come back on next visit."
Beautiful spot to hike for a couple of hours or a full day,"I might be in the minority looking for hiking in Vegas, but this is a beautiful place to hike if you want to get away from the noise of the strip.  I hiked in the fall and it was warm but not too hot.  There are gorgeous views and many paths to choose from.  You can spend a couple of hours or a full day here.  Make sure to bring plenty of water and sunscreen.  And pack your own lunch if you are coming for the day."
Great half day trip,"1. Wear closed toe shoes. Rocks, dirt, plants with thorns.2. check the weather before you go! It was cool in Vegas (low 60’s) and snowing at RRC! Watched tourists freezing in shorts, tank tops and flip flops?!3. Stop at the visitor center BEFORE you drive scenic loop (you exit park when done with drive). 4. Bring water to drink, sunglasses and wear sunscreen. Highly recommend!"
Great outdoor getaway!,"What a nice break from the Strip!  Quick drive, $15 gate fee and a full day of outdoor fun. The 13 mile drive around the park had plenty of low key sights where we stopped to take it all in and let the kids scramble around on the rocks. There are a wide variety of day hikes for any fitness level and plenty to see for those that just want a view other than a casino. No food available that we saw but plenty of clean restrooms. One of our favorite adventures during our trip!!"
Worth goin if you are in Vegas for a short time,"If you are in Vegas and don't have too much time to go to the Grand Canyon , it is a must . If not , I still recommend it , amazing scenery and nice walk tracks."
Red Rock Canyon,"Jack our guide was very informative and made the trip thoroughly enjoyable. He was knowledgeable and informative.Totally worth the tour,"
Great day trip!!!,"Nice change from downtown Vegas.  Beautiful red rock, rock climbers.  Another MUST SEE!  Photog tip: Wide Angle lens needed!  Oh, in mid-February, the Tortoises are not out and about.  There are Tortoise crossing signs - I want to go when they are out."
Lovely way to spend the day,"A must if you go to Vegas to get away from it all. Only 30 minutes away from the main strip by car.  You could uber or Lyft there, but there will be no service to call for a ride back. Better off renting a car for the day.  15$US to enter the park, Several hikes ranging from short easy walks to longer more difficult hikes. We saw some cute little lizards on our trails. Only down side, some of the more popular hikes have limited parking. We did waste 15 minutes trying to park at our first choice in hikes.  Even if you dont want to hike, you can drive the 45 minute scenic loop, stop a couple times for pictures, and still enjoy the surroundings.  Hikes are well marked at the entrance of each paths, but could use a bit better signage in some parts. (One of the volunteers said they are working on them, I believe she said as of Jan 2020 they are done up to trail #9).  Highly recommend!"
Amazing views and hikes!!,We enjoyed our day at Red Rock.  We hiked several trails with friends and had a fabulous time.  The views are astounding.
Fossil Hunting,"Highly recommend the Fossil Canyon Loop Trail for a fairly gentle 3.7 - 4 mile hike (our phones didn’t agree) through a canyon chock full of rock walls covered with fossilized coral and all of the critters caught in it when time ran out.  We also saw a jack rabbit, lizards, chipmunks and a baby rattlesnake.  Come early, bring water.  There are a few areas where you need to go slow and climb up some steps, but nothing too difficult.  Parking area is off the main road.  No public restrooms."
Simply Beautiful,"Red Rock Canyon was the first place I visited after moving to Las Vegas 40 years ago & it's still just as beautiful today as back then. In the morning when the rising sun shines on it it's mesmerising & as the sun sets behind it the shadows are lovely. I highly recommend leaving the crowds, traffic & noise behind for a few hours and enjoying the clean air & natural beauty available just a few minutes away from the Strip"
AMAZING PHOTOGRAPHY,"Red Rock Canyon Scenic Loop is absolutely worth it. If you are a photography lover, then either sunrise or sunset is the best time to go.   If you are fortunate, you may see some wildlife! It will cost you $15 - without a National Park Pass - to get in; but, you have exit and entry rights for the whole day."
Peaceful and Relaxing!,"As it got later in the day, my wife and I headed to this site. We opted just to drive the main road, since it was getting close to closing. The drive was absolutely breathtaking! The mountains, valleys and various shades we encountered was a relaxing way to end a stressful day. Just remember to adhere to the posted speed signs...loads of tight turns and wild animals crossing the toad."
Amazing ..,We didn’t have time to go to the Grand Canyon but to see the Red Rock Canyons was well worth it. A bunch of friends came to Las Vegas and wanted to do something in the limited time we had and boy were we amazed at the natural beauty which has been preserved. Couldn’t get enough of it and the scenery surrounding it. To see the sunsetting from the highest peak was awesome. Would love to come back someday with my family and spend a little more time they're.
Sight seeing,Really interesting and unique place to see to get off the strip. Make sure u take walking shoes bc there is a lot of that if you choose to see the sights.
Lovely scenery!,Beautiful and peaceful.  A great day to visit and take the scenic drive.  It was good to get away from the hustle and bustle of the strip.
Great Day Trip!,Adam was very knowledgeable about the area and provided a great tour. The views and scenery were breathtaking. Lunch at the ranch was a peaceful way to wind down. We even had time to hike some of the trails. Highly recommend this excursion!
Must See!!!,"Fantastic place to visit!  Beautiful and quiet. View is amazing!! Only a few minutes from the strip, maybe 30."
Drive on a nice day,"I wanted to take a drive and see some of the local attractions as we had just moved here, it was a beautiful day so I drove to Red Rock Canyon. It was very picturesque and there was minimal traffic so I was able to stop at all the parking areas. I did not have time to take any of the hikes but plan on going back to do so."
Red Rock Canyon,We had a rental car and drove to Red Rock Canyon from Las Vegas. It took about 45 minutes due to traffic. It is a very pretty trip. You can drive about 13 miles around the canyon after paying to get in. The scenery is very pretty.
Breathtaking,"Great trip ! We visited the Hoover dam on our way to the canyon, very interesting place, loved even the trip by bus through the dessert , we hoy yo know the Joshua trees!The great canyon is absolutely breathtaking! It makes you feel so small and humble! The views are astonishing!Truly recommend !! Worth spending the day going there!"
Great getaway,Want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the strip then this is a great spot!We rented a car for the day and stopped here for a hike and was not disappointed. Probably my fav part of our Vegas trip!
Be one with Nature,"Rented a car for a day and drove out to visit the red rock. Have been here a number of times but it had been a few years so we decide to visit again. I highly recommend doing this while you are in Vegas. Its a great time and is really nice to get away from the strip and gambling for a day. The visitors center is great and very informative. Once in the drive area love parking in one of the designated parking lots, getting out and walking around. It truly is breath taking and beautiful. Will come again soon."
A Must do!,I’m not an outdoorsy person. But it’s my first time to Vegas and I have never seen a canyon before so I wanted to check it out. We rented a car for the day and drove out there to the park. Paid the $15 and went to the visitor center. Walked around got some water and then headed out for the first stop. Calico Hills is beautiful and absolutely worth the money. I’m here one more day and I’m heading back tomorrow. Those trails are way better than anything on the strip
Absolutely wonderful!,We were pleasantly surprised with Red Rock Canyon. It was only about 40 minutes from Las Vegas! It was easy to find and well worth the effort. They provide you with a map that showed us  places we could drive and where we could get out and walk! It was so nice to see the rock formations up close and to walk on trails and see cactus. Bathrooms are plentiful throughout the route. There is a gift shop and park rangers were there to answer questions! Loved it!
Beautiful,"Beautiful  scenery, weather, hiking, nature, etc. Just go enjoy it and you will walk away feeling energized."
Calm and peaceful - just minutes from The Strip in Vegas,This National Conservation area is beautiful and peaceful and a short trip from the crowd and buzz of the strip.The Calico Tanks trail is beautiful and well marked. At the end you are rewarded with a unique view of the Las Vegas Strip. There are many areas to pull off the road and take pictures and watch rock climbers.Perfect activity for one and all.
Evidence of Our Creator,"Beauty can be found, even in the dry and aridness of the rocky desert. Colors are impressive and there is more wildlife here than you might expect."
Took some first timers,Always amazing! Love the drive and the scenery! On top of it all the hikes! The beauty and uniqueness of this area never fails me! Love spotting all the flowers people tend to walk right by! If you plan on a all day experience never go alone and always have a specific trail mapped out and bring supplies/meds! It is easy to get trapped in a valley where your not really sure which way to go! And it gets cold! Stay at a level you can enjoy the area!
Scenic 13 mile drive was BEAUTIFUL!,Definitely a sight to be seen. The views were stunning! $15 dollars per car and definitely worth it! Pictures don't do it justice.
A wonderful place to see nature.,"What a great place to go.  You drive through the park but they have multiple areas to pull off for either hiking or photo's.  It gets crowded on the weekend but you drive at your own pace.  There are points where you can get out, look at the scenery and hear absolutely nothing.  It's amazing. Great place for single, married or families."
Great place to spend some time off the strip,You can spend as much time here as you want.If you only drive the scenic route (still very pretty) you can be done in about 15 min.Or you can walk/hike as many trails as you like and spend all day.
Great Place to Visit,"Quite a different experience from the Strip. Thirteen mile scenic drive with stopping points along the way. Large selection of things to do, something for everyone. Short hikes, Visitor Center, and longer excursions."
Beautiful,"Beautiful scenic drive through the canyon, with many stopping points for photos and small hikes. Loved it."
Beautiful Area,These rocks are unusual and fun to visit. You can scramble around the rocks and take awesome photos.
So much more than the Vegas Strip,Went on a day trip with my wife. It was her first time. WOW the beauty of the land and nature! The drive in the canon was so peaceful. You will appreciate what life is about.
Amazing scenery right outside of VEGAS.,"Red Rock Conservation Area is a stunningly beautiful area located just outside Las Vegas,NV. There is hiking, climbing, amazing desert scenery and trails. If you can pull yourself away from the casinos for a few hours, you can see something you won’t forget."
Beautiful and usually relaxing.,"We live only a few miles from the park and have a senior pass, so it is easy for us to visit and take our visitors there.It is beautiful and quiet (except when school kids are there!). They did an upgrade to the hands-on learning area outside and my grandkids really enjoyed it. They have some great, informative displays inside and a beautiful view from a window that shows the whole park out of the cold or heat. There is also a very nice gift shop.The 13 mile, one way loop road is nice and has many stops to view formations.The drive around through the park gives us a chance to visit with our family/friends while taking in some great views. There is a picnic area outside the park (between the entrance and exit gates. Not in the park, so can go the for sunrise or sunset.During the spring, you may catch a glimpse of a desert tortoise. Have not seen any wild burros or horses in the park in the 20 years I've been here, but further out the 159 going towards Blue Diamond you can see burros pretty regularly."
Spectacular Views!,"Only 30 minutes from the glitz and glamour of the Vegas Strip, lies this serene and scenic area.  The stunning red rock formations will take your breathe away.  Supposedly there are wild horses and burros that roam the area, but we didn't see any while we were there.  The scenic drive is a must-do, but the wait is very long on weekends.  Highly recommend going during the week to avoid sitting in traffic to get into the park."
Great for hiking,"I love Red Rock, it is 30 minutes away from the busy las vegas strip. Great getaway for some hiking, driving around or even some quiet time."
Calico Tanks Trail at Red Rock Conservation Area,"My sister, daughter and I hiked the Calico Tanks trail on Friday.  It’s a little over 1 mile each way and the terrain is considered moderate.  Gravel/sand paths with rocks that you had to scramble up. Scenery was great and we met people of all ages and abilities on the trail. The very end of the trail was the most challenging but the reward was sweeping views of the Vegas valley."
Red Rock,This attraction is in a park with an entrance fee.  It is so worth the cost as it can be an all day outing or just the 13 mile one way drive.  Many hiking trails to explore and beautiful scenery to take pictures of.  If you plan on walking anywhere in the park be safe and where proper shoes.
Amazing!  Absolutely gorgeous.,"I've been to Vegas countless time, but never been to the Red Rock Canyon area. It's a must-see location, just 30 minutes away from The Strip. Rent a car and spend the day!"
Who would have thought the desert is beautiful,This place was the highlight of our weekend trip to Vegas. I never would have imagined how pretty the desert can be. im from TN and this was my first trip out west. We are Going to Vegas again this summer. Its so much more than a place to party. But be sure to Party some ;)
Beautiful drive,This natural wonder is not far from Las Vegas and is well worth the drive.  The rock formations are very pretty.
Beautiful scenery ,Well worth the drive out from Las Vegas. A lovely scenic drive to get away from the hustle and bustle of the strip. There’s a variety of viewpoints to pull over and lots of trails too if you’d prefer to explore a bit more.
Beautiful hikes,"We went in February. It was a bit windy, but very nice and a lot of fun hiking with our kids. There are a bunch of different trails with varying difficulty and length. I would recommend for older kids and teenagers."
Awesome experience,Pam did an awesome job of touring us.  She makes you feel like the tour is special for you.  Pam is very knowledgeable about th3 area and the history and the plants and water and went a. I’ve and beyond to make a time at Red Rock enjoyable.
Worth the while to take the 30 minute drive...Natural Beauty,The drive was a short 30 minutes it was easy to navigate to the park. Once there you will pay $15  to drive the 13 mile loop but what a drive the rock formations all around you are colorful and the landscape is stunningly beautiful. There are chip monks everywhere. The trails are pretty well maintained and there is every level of hiking from easy to is that even possible. The colors alone is worth the trip. I would highly recommend it...Happy Travels!!!
gods beauty,this place is very pretty   go  out of the light s of the city  and there are the mountains. it cost 15 dollars per car and its a 13 mile loop. you can stop at  the end and see the petrogilghs on the canyuon wall. very pretty
Day trio,"Beautiful  place to go.  The drive through it is awesome! If you want to get out and hike, we would recommend going in the fall or spring when it is cooler."
Wanted to go for a hike while in Vegas,There are a lot of different trails you can hike throughout red rock.  I wish I had more time I would have gone on more hikes in different areas.  Bring water and maybe even a lunch and hangout for a while.
Beautiful natural area,Definitely worth the trip to see this area. The colors are awesome. Have also toured several years ago by motorcycle. Took a tour this time which was good as weather was cold and windy.
Amazing!!,Short trip from Las Vegas. If you’re in the area it’s really a must see. Enjoy the 13 mile Scenic drive. Many stops to get out of the car and really enjoy the park.
Red Rock Canyon - WOW!,"We rented a car while in Las Vegas and drove to Red Rock Canyon. It is a short drive and definitely worth it! So pretty! People were hiking, we just looked around and took pictures. It was amazing!"
Really worth it,"A beautiful, unique area close to LV.  A perfect biking spot - 13 mile smooth paved road.   Nice visitor center.  Really stunning geography"
Amazing views,This 13 mile drive thru this federally protected area was a high lite of our short Vegas trip. The one way road thru the area provides a relaxed ride and several pull offs to be able to take pictures. If you want to hike or rock climb there are many places to do that also. The area is a quick drive from Vegas and takes 45 minutes for a causal ride thru the preserve..
Make the trip,"We went a few years ago,  Very beautiful place to see. Take your time andGo through the park slowly. Another one of nature’s natural beautiful sights.A very quick trip from the strip and WORTH MAKING THE TRIP."
beautiful,"beautiful drive and hiking areas close to Las Vegas, great for getting away from the gambling and lights for a few hours"
Great location near to the city...,"Well worth the drive out west, and the $15 entrance fee for vehicles, $10 for m/cycles and $5 for pushbikes (steep ride p in places), this is a one-way loop to see the canyon with lots of lookout points and wide road with perfect surface.  Tours also available I believe.There are also several toilet blocks (big hole in ground variety with a raised seat so pungent in the summer no doubt, no running water but hand sanitiser provided).  We didn't stop at Visitor Center [sic] but it looked impressive and I believe the entry fee to the Conservation Area included entrance to the Center. Take a camera and go around sunset/sunrise for best lighting and some great panoramic scenes and views of the city from afar...Be prepared for lengthy queues to get in though, even at end of January we queued for 20mins or so mid-morning."
Nature at its best,"Even though we chose a very windy and cold day, the place is really nature at its best. The geology is spectacular and the ease of winding your way around the scenic drive makes it a better experience. Make sure you stop by the visitor center to catch the movie and get a good idea of what to do from staff on hand."
Nice break from the caos of the strip,"We were lucky enough to meet up with an old friend who wanted to show us something different. We went to red rock canyon with him and spent a lovely few hours wandering around different parts of the canyon. It really was a lovely way to get close to nature and away from the madness of the strip. I thoroughly recommend getting out there when in America's playground, just to help you keep perspective"
Spectacular Place ,We came for the scenic drive but adventures out to the mountains.  Plan a whole day here and bring lots of water!  This was the highlight of our trip.
Loved it!,"Red Rock is amazing!! We had a great time exploring and hiking throughout the park. Just driving through doesn’t do it justice, you should really get out and explore. We had a great time in the first turn out going through the red rock formations."
Great day trip,So close to Vegas!  Beautiful 13 mile driving loop through the Red Rocks.  Lots of stops along the way to take pictures and take in the scenery.  Also great for people who like to hike.  This is a hidden gem for sure!  And only $13/car to enter.
Majestic!,Definitely a must see if you are in Las Vegas. The hikes are very nice. My favorite hikes are the Calico Basin and Calico Tanks. The 13.1 scenic loop is very peaceful.
Fun & staggeringly beautiful ,"After a week in Sedona we arrived at Red Rocks.  The landscape and rocks are quite different and beautiful to see in contrast.  There is a very easy and pleasant scenic drive with viewing points to stop at and restrooms.  The park service did an incredible job building this road.  It’s very smooth and although a one-way, is the width of a two lane allowing for passing if needed.   Yes, there are quite a few tourists who will stop on the road for a picture.  We saw an entire family get out of their car, walk a bit & take pictures & then sit in the middle of the road for more pictures!  The animals are smarter than some of the people.  Their are numerous hiking trails for all skill levels."
Wonderful ,"Had a great day taking in the views, it’s a calming & majestic place & was a welcome break away from the bright lights & mayhem of the strip. We hired a car fromOur hotel lobby & took our time exploring, it was much cheaper than paying for a guided tour."
Awesome Red Rock,awesome drive through park. Rock climbing is great so I have heard. Very pretty nice center for history of area.
Great views of the canyon,We went on a charter bus that was 5 hours long.  Tour guide was very informative.  The lunch at the Red Rock Casino was not very good
I've been back here so many times to scramble.. so beautiful,"I love this place and have been here many times. It's one of the highlights of vegas, we love climbing up the rocks at Calico Hills, we don't climb with gear but we love a good scramble. The views from the top of Vegas and Red Rocks are amazing and it's a great workout. Bring some water and an orange and have a great time. For anyone in decent-good shape it takes under an hour to get to the top!"
Beautiful get away from the strip,This is well worth the drive to do some hiking.  There are all levels of ability.  We loved it there.  There is a nature center as well that is pleasant to stroll around if you don't want to climb any of the trails.
"Beautiful landscape, great hikes","Take lots of water with you, it is a desert after all! The hikes here are stunning, the sun-rises and sun-sets will stun anyone and the landscape blows the mind. It looks like another planet."
Rewarding visit ... Enjoyed the December climate too.,"Wished we had planned to have spent more time but toured the area and making the nominal but key stops as recommended by the park rep at the visitor center before embarking on our drive around the area.  What beautiful, picturesque views and walks. Am glad they keep the overall area pristine.  Strong recommendation to enjoy the area best at sunrise and sunset!"
Awesome Place!,Rented a car for the trip so that I could final make it out the Red Rock! Simply Beautiful! 13 mile scenic drive was breathtaking and had a great flow of pace to enjoy the Mountains. You must visit on your next trip!
The other side of Vegas,"The Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area is about located about 15 miles off the Las Vegas Strip. It is well worth a trip, to see the other side of Vegas. Entrance is $15 per car. There is a one-way scenic loop drive, 13 miles long, with parking areas allow access to many of the area trails. A visitor center is at the start of the loop road. Red Rock has large red rock formations and is popular for hiking and rock climbing. This is the desert, so be mindful of temperatures, time of day, and carry water."
Red Rock Canyou,I you have a car Red Rock Canyon is not far from the strip and is a must see location cost is around $15 for a car and is a great scenic drive. You can stop along the route is the car parks to take photos  well worth the trip
Beautiful National Park!,A short ride from the neon and glitz of the Las Vegas strip to the awesome natural wonderland of Red Rock Canyon!
Beautiful place to visit while in Las Vegas. Great place to spend time for us locals,We have been to Red Rick several times in our two years living in Henderson. We have a National Park Pass so it’s free to get in. This week we hiked Calico Tanks trail. It was rated moderate and my husband and I who are in our late 60’s had no problem but we are very active people. The 2.5 mile trail has many places that require boulder climbing. There is a descent elevation change so you feel like you are exercising. The trail is not a loop. Ends at a beautiful viewpoint looking out over the entire Las Vegas Valley. On the way you pass by two “natural tanks “ both which had water this time of year. Plenty of shade. Trail well marked and there were many other hikers even tho it was a Friday morning. The Canyon has a 13 mile scenic drive for those who choose not to hike. The scenic drive has several overlook stopping areas. One way driving so you have plenty of time to see while driving. Red Rock Canyon has a beautiful Visitor Center with gift shop and Rangers to answer all your questions. There are hikes for all levels of difficulty and even rock climbing areas. Don’t miss this beautiful park while visiting Nevada.
"If you haven’t been to Red Rock Canyon in a while, go back.","We always enjoy nature trips, and hadn’t been to Red Rock for a few years, so took a tour. They’ve done so much to make this a delightful visit. The visitor center has lovely sights. The scenic loop offers great photo ops. Worth a repeat visit"
Take the time to hike and enjoy,It's great to take the time away from the busy strip of Las Vegas and enjoy the beauty of Red Rock.  You can pick up a map from the visitor center to help guide you through the area.  We took several of the different hikes.  Each one has it's own unique beauty.  Our favorites were Ice Box and exploring the Calico hills.  Take water bottles and pack snacks if you're going to be out for the day.  Make sure you have enough time to see the sunset over the hills.  It's a beautiful sight.
Magnificent Views,"So many photo ops from this park.  I don't do rock climbing, but it's just fascinating to watch people do it."
Pretty,The view is awesome the rocks are so pretty. While we were there we did not see any animals but the scenery was nice. It was a little cool far as the weather.
Beautiful,"A beautiful drive or hike.  Have been on numerous hikes thru here, in numerous canyons - absolutely stunning!"
Quick weekend away,We took a quick weekend trip to Vegas & found Red Rock Canyon. There were tons of trails & the scenery was beautiful!
Stunning Colors,"This is such a great spot for anyone who enjoys seeing the natural wonders of this world. It's a short 30 minutes drive from Vegas, making it an easy thing to add to your bucket list when you visit the city. You could hike the trails and venture into the less seen areas of Red Rock; or you can stay close to the road, getting out at each parking area to explore the easier ""trails"" with children, large groups, and those who aren't avid hikers. The colors of the landscape are breathtaking and the drive is calming and inspiring."
Beautiful Colors near Vegas,We were looking for some picturesque hikes and Red Rock Canyon was recommended to us.  The park offers many hikes of different degrees of difficulty.  I would recommend you arrive early as parking is at a premium.  The colors are striking matched against blue skies.
Great experience (permanently on my list to do in Vegas),"The should be a required stop for visitors in Vegas.  It's only about 30 minutes by car from the strip and puts you in an entirely different mindset.    They charge you $15 per vehicle and that gives you access to the visitors center, 13 mile loop drive and many stops and trails along the way.   You can spend a few hours or the entire day.   Be sure to dress for the weather and bring plenty of water and hiking shoes.   The folks in the visitors center are also very helpful and can give you insight on the different trails etc."
