Must see in Kanazawa,"Some might say that most Japanese garden look alike, go and tell it to then man who has seen Kenroku-en"
An absolute must if its a nice day,"Beautifully laid-out, superbly maintained, spotlessly neat & clean. Fab photo opportunities abounded. Lots of people but with a modicum of patience, a gap for your Shot appeared.Vast majority were very aware of others Photo intentions, since they had ambitions along similar lines themselves. It really showed.Delightful spot for a leisurely stroll in the sunshine."
Beautiful garden near the castle,The garden is located up a hill from across the 21st Century Museum. It is pretty big and has a beautiful pond that's worth viewing. You can get a better view during late March through mid April when the sakuras are in bloom. The autumn leaves are also something worth checking out.
Most beautiful place I’ve ever been.,"My title says it all, most beautiful place I’ve ever been, was lucky to go with work on a recent trip to Japan. Already planning a trip back over with family and taking in Kanazawa to show them the Gardens."
So so garden,I preferred the Suizenji Jojuen garden in Kumamoto. But it was a grey day which probably impacted on the views.
Just what the reports say.....was fantastic.,"Was a 2nd visit, as our 1st time they had the pond empty (yearly maintenance - pick your visit's timing). This time it was a perfect sunny day, cool and clear skies. Fantastic all-round gardens from ponds at the top to walking down the hill thru the trees etc."
Most well pruned garden,I was quite impressed with this place. Very cohesive and pretty greens everywhere. I can just picture how stunning this place is when it's cherry blossom season.
A Highlight of Our Trip to Japan,"We visited the garden three times and loved every minute of it. There's so much care, thought, and detail put into the garden it shows. It makes for a relaxing day. We visited the garden in early March, and can't imagine how it continues to glow throughout the seasons. We highly recommend visiting, and the ticket we purchased allowed for multiple visits over a two-day period - well worth it! Thanks to everyone who helps take care of this beautiful oasis!"
One xday walking tour of Tokyo highlights,"Rocky of Rocky Enterprises gave us a fascinating one day tour of Tokyo with many insights into the Japanese culure and food. We were at the beginning of our visit to Japan an d Rocky was very diligent and helpful in setting up all opur travel tickets, reserved seats etc, which we could not have done withiout him. Very friendly, amusing and conscientious, thank you Rocky."
Kenrokuen Gardens at the very start of spring,The gardens are across the street from the castle grounds. There are a number of meandering path you can take.  The way each tree is shaped and supported is very interesting. I am sure they would be beautiful in spring (March-May) timeframe. Combine your visit with the castle and save on your admission.
Just superb.,"My third visit, and each time I am struck anew by the beauty of this garden. It thoroughly deserves its place in the top three landscape gardens in Japan. In early March only the plum blossoms provide colour, but even in winter drabness there is still beauty in the forms and the interplay of plants, stone and water. It is a garden to stroll around and to enjoy from all angles."
One of The Best Garden!,One of The Best Garden in Japan. It's a must visit place in kanazawa. Huge garden and very beautiful in every corner.
Top tourist site in Kanazawa,"We visited in Spring but were too early for cherry blossoms. We arrived in the evening a couple of hours before closing time and had to pay 320 yen entry fees.  The last time we came here was to view the autumn scenery. This is one of the top 3 Japanese gardens in Japan and our trip this spring was to visit all three gardens.  We did see plum blossoms though.  Personally, although the garden was beautiful, I find it overrated ."
Wow,The best (if not one of the best) garden. Doesn’t matter what weather it is always a beautiful place. When we visited it was raining but still manage to get some nice photos
Beautiful all seasons garden,We had been disappointed when walking through the usually beautiful Japanese gardens when we have done so in winter- understandably. However this garden is stunningly beautiful in winter. We loved wandering through the shady tree areas with the thick moss bases and then out to the many water features. There were even some cherry blossoms flowering in February. The space is peaceful and the peace is respected by all those wandering through it. Definitely worth a visit when in Kanazawa. And just down from the castle.
Wonderful garden,Beautiful green garden. We also tried the tea ceremoni in the tea House which was interesting. Would visit the garden again.
Night time opening,"We were fortunate that during our visit to Kanazawa the garden was open for its winter night time viewing, complimentary to enter, and while you are restricted to a certain path, it’s  magical to wander around with the tress and water features all lite up. It opens at 5.30pm, go early as it’s easier to take photos and capture the lighting effect"
Beautiful Tranquil Walk,"Walked over from Kanazawa Castle Park, and paid a small fee to enter this garden. Great location for photography as we saw tourists and even locals dressed in kimono here (we saw kimono rental shops just outside the garden). Despite the small crowd, it was a beautiful garden to walk around and appreciate the tranquillity of the Japanese gardens."
Definately worth a visit,A very well kept Japanese garden that anyone that comes to Kanazawa should visit. Walk around and discover all the details.
Beautiful Japanese Style Garden,"Despite the rain, we still enjoyed our visit to Kenrokuen, one of Japan's top 3 garden. We visited in the winter but was still able to enjoy the garden. Just strolling through the garden itself gives me a sense of calmness."
Charming Year beginning,"It's the most Charming  and Tuning New Year beginning.  Harmonious Accordance  of Nature, Art and  Historical Expedience!"
Beautiful traditional Japanese Garden,"20 minutes on the bus from Kanazawa station. Entrance immediately opposite castle entrance. Entrance fee 320 yen for adults and  you can buy a combo ticket to enter the exhibition inside the castle opposite. Gardens are beautiful and peaceful including large water features. This was a winter visit but in spring the gardens must look stunning when in blossom. Souvenir shop, restrooms and cafes all inside gardens. There is also a top Michelin starred restaurant within the grounds of the garden...Gyokusen-Tei  in a stunning setting. Gardens a must  see part of any Kanazawa visit."
Beauty and Harmony,"I’m not a “garden person” and don’t go to such places as they usually bore the living daylights out of me.  By default we ended up here as another attraction we were intending on seeing was closed.  WOW.  It is truly beautiful.  You will appreciate this garden, no matter how you feel about such things.  It’s beautifully crafted and tended.  Highly recommended...just wished I could have seen in the spring!"
Lovely in winter,Kanazawa is known for its beautiful gardens. Kenrokuen along with the castle park satisfies the aesthetic taste completely. It’s beautiful in winter. I also visited the illumination display at  night - truly lovely.
Recommend going when snowing or in Spring,"Don't let my score dissuade you from visiting, as we were there in winter and there was no snow, just lots of tourists.  You could see the beauty was under there, waiting to be viewed in the Spring.  I'd still recommend seeing it."
Beautiful once again,"I was here in November for the start of the autumn foliage season and it was lovely. The last time I was here was summertime and it was packed...this time it was busy, but a lot quieter than the summer. I was able to find peaceful spots to sit and admire the view...it really was lovely. The staff were working hard as usual trimming moss, wrapping treee trunks in rope etc. I had a lovely time and would recommend it to anyone as a must see. It's really cheap to get in too!"
Stunning,Absolutely stunning garden very well kept and clean. Beautiful little bridges everywhere. Highly recommend
Must do,"if you see one garden in Japan, see this one, esp out of Cherry Blossom season, as this is different; architectural not just nice gardens."
Nice dressed in the autumn colours,The gardens were being prepared for the winter but the autumn colours were just beautiful. The walk throu the garden is a treat for your soul.
Beautiful Garden,Even though the weather was against us (wind and rain) we really enjoyed these gardens. So much to see and so many really special places with plenty of photo opportunities.A must see when in Kanazawa.
"Superb gardens, well worth visiting","Even in November, it was worth seeing: wonderful colours, even though the light was poor during our visit. Eating facilities just outside the park, and adjacent to Kanazawa castle."
Stunning even in the rain. ,"This is truly one of Japan's best gardens. It was a rainy day during our visit, but the beautiful garden still was a pleasure to wander around. I hope to come back in other seasons."
Best Japanese garden,One of the most visited Japanese garden ponds and tea drinking pavillion. Entrance fee ¥300. Well trimmed trees and very calm during early hours before the tourist arrived. It was beside the Kanazawa Castle and using the bridge from the castle to reach the garden main entrance. Don’t forget to visit the famous stone lantern which stands above the pond. Worth visit and the entrance fee is reasonable for such an excellent garden.
"Lovely, peaceful garden ","Visited here during the new year period. It was very beautiful and peaceful (even in the rain). I imagine it would be stunning during the spring and autumn seasons, however even in the winter it was still lovely. I believe normally you pay an entrance fee, however the day we visited, admission was free."
Beautiful in the day and at night too,"We went twice- during the day we covered the place walking through the gardens and visited again for night illuminations. Absolutely delightful and fascinating. Must visit if in Kansai area. It is best to combine with a visit to the castle which is adjacent. There are plenty of buses to Kanazawa station area, hence best to stay in the station area and visit the gardens as there are not many things to do after closing time of gardens and not many food options in the area in the evenings."
Pick your season,"I think our visit to Kenrokuen was ill-timed: it was too cold for anything to be in bloom but not cold enough to be covered in snow. That said, the park is still a beautiful space to explore and take in the city and I took dozens of photos. Just dress warmly if it's December, the wind is chilly!"
Must do in Kanazawa,"I've been to the great parks of the world and this is one of the top. Well managed and kept, a must see!"
Winter magic,"Magic to see everywhere - despite the horrid wind and cold. In better weather this would be perfect, good food to be enjoyed."
Lovely garden,A beautiful garden that is not to be missed. It is classified as one of Japan's 3 most beautiful landscape gardens.We spend 2 hrs and wished we could spend more time due to the cold wet weather due to winter.It was about 8 degrees when we werue there. We sought refuge in one of the restaurants and had hot lunch. Restaurants accept cash only.The lunch was good and we were served hot tea in the cold weather. There were 4 to 5 restaurants at the entrance of the garden and within the premises. Umbrellas were also sold in the shops due to the wet weather.A place not to be missed when in Kanazawa.
Beautiful,"The Kenrokuen is a lovely place to just walk around and enjoy nature. I reckon if you were a writer in need of inspiration, you could sit in one of its peaceful areas and get some inspiration! It's so beautiful - no wonder it was one of the three most beautiful Japanese gardens!Tip: wear walking shoes. There are some uneven terrain in there so keep that in mind. I did find some areas to be wheelchair-friendly."
Lovely grounds ,This place is pretty and tranquil more than grand and magnificent but in a good wayLoved the castle and garden areas Give yourself 3 hours to stroll through the grounds to absorb the atmosphere
Lovely gardens,Nice place to stroll around - beautiful landscape - serene & calm - pity it is winter so not much colours but still can imagine how beautiful it will be in full bloom
A magnificent work of art,"We visited the garden both during the daytime and the evening illumination. It's such a wonderful place! Pictures don't do it justice. The beautiful old pines and all the care one can see in their preservation, combined with the autumn colors of the other trees, the water streams and the bridges surrounding you create a unique experience. The evening illumination felt  just like a festival, there was this happy and excited vibe, little stalls selling cakes and tea."
Great Edo garden scenery ,Old style Edo garden scenery is very unique and beautiful in every season. You can enjoy it all day.
Autumn leaves visit 2019,"Absolutely astounding views of various quantities, forms and colours of abundantly bright red, yellow and gold leaves throughout this vast park. The only problem - in my view at least - is that the park and its remarkable layout and design is so popular that this alone attracts too many visitors per day for everyone to get a real chance of glimpsing any of its gems rather than the thousands of other guests milling around. Back home we have an old expression saying that ‘you cannot see the forrest for trees...’ which comes to mind here.PS. The city of Kanazawa itself (as well as its castle) is definitely also worth a visit or more..."
Beautiful garden even in the rain,Our second visit to this garden and always a joy to visit. Lovely walk around the garden with easy walk to Kanazawa Castle across the bridge. A must-see when in Kanazawa.
Well-kept and lovely Jap Garden,It was a nice place for a lovely walk in the early winter and to see the autumn foliage. Regular admission was waived for senior citizens above the age of 65 years old with documentary proof. We enjoyed a leisurely stroll and seeing the ancient pines and lovely leaves.
One of the most beautiful garden I have ever been to,"It is definitely one of the most beautiful gardens in Japan. It is just calming and relaxing to walk around the garden. The best thing is that if you visit in November, you get to enter the garden at night to look at the night view which is absolutely stunning. Say no more! This is an absolute place to go to when you are in Kanazawa!"
A most beautiful garden!,We took a local bus to the gardens and walked around it at our own pace. The Autumn colours were magnificent. I can only imagine the beauty in Spring time. The garden is very well managed and well sign posted. The artistic way in which old trees are supported is a work of art!The gardens also house artists at work.This garden should be a must see for all tourists visiting Japan.
"Yup, one of the top gardens in Japan.","Over 40 years ago, I dragged my husband to this garden and loved it. When my son wanted to go the contemporary art museum (which was awesome), we walked through Kenrokuen Garden and loved the aesthetic care that gardeners were constructing around the most vulnerable trees. It is a classical garden and free and so well curated."
Well worth the time required,"Kenrokuen Gardens are magnificent in autumn! Interestingly, on November 1 the gardeners begin protecting the plants from heavy winter snows to come. For trees a tall pole is erected alongside the tree’s bole, and ropes are tied from it to individual branches. In the case of azalea bushes and hedges, woven ropes are tied around the perimeter to keep the branches from collapsing. The surface of the ground is completely covered in  a number of species of mosses and liverworts. One discovers that a fountain that spurts a single jet of water is fed by gravity from a small lake situated gigher on the hill such that the jet of water shoots up to the water level of its mother lake. Autumn colors are a harmonious riot, and there’s a happy surprise around every curve."
Gorgeous fall colors,The park can easily be seen in 1-2 hours.   It’s a pleasant stroll and the colors in November were so lovely.
Great scenic at night,Worthwhile to visit after 6pm. The lights up in the park give a very nice scenic of the entire park and it's free.
Beautiful in the autumn,"We were lucky to have visited during that’s short period where the leaves are turning and the gardens are reds, golds and copper. Beautiful gardens beautifully kept and well worth a visit"
Worth a look ,These gardens were part of our organised tour. They are well worth a visit and would be even more sensational in spring or summer.Allow yourself several hours to enjoy this attraction.
Beautiful place,Nice and beautiful garden. Unfortunately it was drizzling a little so the lighting for pictures were not so nice. Some trees were red while some were alredy bare.
A Must,"This garden is simply a small paradise. What a fantastic place, full of peace And gorgeous sites, wherever one looks.  If visiting Kanazawa this a garden is an obligation. One peace of advise is take your time because one can take hours visiting this this awesome paradise."
A beautiful garden,"A beautiful garden for a leisurely stroll.  Look for the Gankou Bashi, a line of 11 stones that appears to be wild geese in flight. As the stones are shaped like tortoise shells, it is also called the Tortoise Shell Bridge.  Note that crossing the bridge is prohibited. We ended our visit with matcha and Japanese sweets in the Shigure-tei tea house."
Simply stunning.  Your garden will never look like this!,"If you want to see stunning gardens, Japan is the place to go.  All of them are incredible and Kenrokuen Garden is no exception.  Just understand that YOUR garden won't ever measure up against them.Just make sure to take lots memory cards for your camera and take lots of images of The Serenity you will capture.  Stunning.  Simply stunning."
wonderful gardens,If you do not like gardens go to these gardens and you will be amazed  by the beauty and skill of the gardeners. Wherever you looked or visted there was beauty.
Amazing ,This has to one of the nicest gardens with everything on a massive scale . The gardeners were putting up the ropes on the pine branches to help when the snow arrived. Highly recommend this place
A must visit in Kanazawa,"Just about a short 10 minute bus ride from the train station is the beautiful Kenrokuen Gardens. Great place for a walk, with a lot of scenic spots for photos. We went in late October and autumn has not arrived yet.  The Saisonkaku Villa within the gardens was closed on Wed, so we missed it. It seems quite a few high end restaurants are also closed on Weds. We spent about 2-3 hours enjoying the gardens."
Spend an hour or a day,"Depending on how much you like to walk around beautiful park-like areas, you could walk around these Gardens in an hour and be pleased with that time. Or you could spend a leisurely day there. You could walk across and share the day at Kanazawa Castle."
Be prepared to walk,"We went exploring the garden by following the garden guide. We saw the turrets , store House and Ishikawamon gate of Kanazawa castle. Walking further we came to the Hisagoike pond , midoritaki waterfall and the Kasumigaike pond. We took lovely photos of the fountain and Kotojitoro lantern reflected on the pond.  The highlight of the park is the unique Karasakinomatsu pine with ropes tied to its branches. Nice Hanamibashi bridge to look out for. The trees and plants in the park is well maintained and nice to look at - the plum grove, the pine trees.  There are many rest areas where one can sit to rest the aching legs or visit the Shiguretei tea house. Look out for the rest area shaped like a boat. Was a really nice walk in the cool day , amidst all the greens."
Mind blowing,"The gardens are right in the heart of the city with the equally impressive castle right next door.You can spend hours strolling through the beautiful gardens with traditional Japanese buildings, lakes and displays of plants, trees etcSimply stunning Highly recommended"
Beautiful gardens worth visiting ,"We had heard these gardens were worthy of a trip and although we had quite limited time we are so pleased we went - beautiful, peaceful and a perfect time as not too many crowds and the autumn colour added and extra splendour."
Don't Miss This One,Visited here with our tour group from Australia and thoroughly enjoyed this beautifully prepared and landscaped garden park.  Like most Japanese attractions you have to pa to enter but it is worth it.  Take your time to stroll through the gardens and ponds and enjoy the beautifully manicured trees and shrubs.
Beautiful,A very beautiful garden located in Kanazawa. A perfect place to stroll around and take great pictures.
Beauty and tranquility ,An absolute gem! These gardens are immaculately maintained by a team of gardeners with incredible skill and dedication. Each area draws you in and thrills with its beauty. We were totally amazed by the efforts to preserve the ancient trees throughout these gardens. Don’t miss this beautiful garden treasure.
Beautiful gardens,We visited Kanazawa specifically to visit Kenrokuen Garden and the adjoining Kanazawa Castle. Neither disappointed. The gardens are one of the larger styled ones and is best appreciated with a quite stroll to take in the diversity of design and the beautiful colours that can be on display depending on when you visit. We were fortunate to see the autumn foliage in its glory.
Absolutely amazing in autumn!!,"If you have the JR Rail Pass (I used the Japan-wide one), you can board the JR bus for free at the bus terminal at Kanazawa Station to reach here. The bus stops at the Ishikawa Gate of the Kanazawa Castle Park; just cross the road and walk up the bit of slope to reach the entrance to Kenrokuen. Because the garden is very famous, I recommend heading in early in the morning, otherwise you’ll be greeted with long queues at admission, or even queues for taking pictures with the autumn colours! It’s really not that hard to see why so many people visit the garden though, the place is stunningly beautiful, and even more so with bright autumn colours!! If you have limited time, make a beeline for the water bodies in the garden; they make some of the most scenic spots for photography. Kanazawa is also famous for its edible gold leaf soft-serve, which you can get here as well outside the admission gate, but it is pricier compared to the other shops selling them back at Kanazawa Station, bear that in mind! I visited on 24th November 2018, which was when Kanazawa was reported to be at peak for autumn colours; putting it here so that you can gauge and plan your visit. Enjoy the sights at one of Japan’s Big Three!! It is worth it."
Stunning,Absolutely stunning garden. A must visit when in Kanazawa. Came to Kanazawa specifically to see this garden and it did not disappoint. So glad we made the trip here for it.
Serene,"Elegantly designed as only the Japanese can. Like a previous reviewer, we were on the heels of the typhoon and it turned into a rainy day so we cut our visit short. Would have enjoyed more time to stroll. A must see in Kanazawa."
Kenroken Gardens were worth the visit even in the rain,"While we struck bad weather due to Typhoon Hagibas during our stay we still managed to see much of the gardens, I would highly recommend the gardens"
Beautiful garden,Well worth a visit but give yourself at least 90 minutes to walk around at a leisurely pace and take in the beautiful gardens and water features.
"Without A Doubt, A Top Three Garden in Japan!","Extraordinary 26-acre garden three centuries in the making, planned and maintained by the most powerful Daimyo clan in Japan.Must be seen because words will fail.  If viewed in the rain, even better ... the atmosphere is powerful and unbelievable."
Beautiful Gardens,"These are superb gardens. The attention to detail, the lanterns, bridges, tea rooms, lakes, conifers, plum trees all make it a very enjoyable visit. Despite the crowds it's easy  to get away from people in the less visited parts. They myst look simply stunning when autumn is fully ensconsed."
HBH experience typical Japanese Garden,"A beautiful Japanese Garden [Park] Lots of water courses and lake/pond, large fish. The famous Kotojitoro Lantern, a must for the 'selfie' lovers. We could have done with far more time here [part of a tour]. Lots of hidden areas to explore. Downside was the hundreds of other tourists all admiring and photographing just like us, it was very crowded. Still worth the visit. Far more typical of a Japanese garden than some of the manicured gardens which don't allow people in."
We prefer the garden for sakura rather than for momiji,"We visited the garden again on our koyo trip after enjoying it in cherry blossom season.  We didn’t spend nearly as much time wandering around as we did in spring and the garden was not nearly as crowded as it was in April.There were some bits of color here and there on the maples, but it was not at peak when we visited.  If it had been peak, this would probably be a very different review!  The trees reflecting in the pond did make for good photo ops.  They were compromised though, by the fact that the boat house was under cover for restoration.  With a little work, we could manage to shoot the pond and avoid the tarpaulins.  The most interesting thing and the big gift of the day were the snow cords and wrappings of the trees to protect them from the winter snow.  These winter maypoles made for terrific photos and the many trees wrapped this way gave us lots to photograph. We ate at the same food stall near the entrance.  We thoroughly enjoyed our lunch of ramen while sipping Ramune in the out of doors.Entrance was free as we visited on a holiday.  When you visit, be sure to ask at the ticket booth about senior discounts."
Lovely gardens but a little bit busy,"We must have arrived at a busy time because the gardens were very full but they were lovely, well-kept, and peaceful. There are plenty of places to buy ice creams and drinks to stroll around with."
Beautiful garden,Gorgeous garden to walk around. Beautifully maintained and looked after. Wonderful views over Kanazawa. Wonderful trees and water features. Lots of paths and lush corners. Well worth a visit
Beautiful formal gardens,Heavy on the tourist train but you can see why. Lovely formal gardens. Hard to skip this if you are in Kanazawa.
Didn’t live up to expectations ,When a place is described everywhere as one of the top three gardens in Japan you expect a “wow”Well don’t The gardens are certainly beautiful-  it we’ve seen nicer in both Kyoto and Tokyo
Love love love this magnificent place,"Strolling through this area was one of the highlights of our 12-day trip to Japan. I felt like we stepped into a time tunnel, entering old Japanese paintings in real-life time. I was in awe with every turn. If you’re in the area, do not miss this!"
We got Engaged!,Came to Japan for 6 weeks and this is the garden I fell in love with. You can spend hours walking through here. I would suggest you do it earlier or later in the day to avoid all the tourists. I scoped the place out during the day and found the bridge I wanted to use but there was people everywhere. Convinced my girlfriend to come back for a photo in the bridge and popped the question. She said yes!
Fantastic garden that you need to attend if in the area,This was a lovely place to visit. It costs ¥310/320 to get in and you simply walk around until your heart's content. If you like photography then you definitely need to come. So many photo ops!
Beautiful park,Probably 1 of top 5 must see places in Kanazawa.- very relaxing and poetic. To visit together with Castle park (to the north) probably around 3 h required.
"Beautifully maintained, peaceful despite the large number of visitors","We had a bit of a whistlestop visit as were short on time, but could easily spend longer enjoying the very scenic gardens.As with most Japanese gardens, the care that goes into maintaining it is easy to see, and the size of the gardens does mean that you can get some space from the large number of visitors to the gardens"
Beautifully maintained gardens,The gardens offer a nice alternative to the hustle and bustle of busy Osaka.  I would recommend coming here during autumn where there’s a change in the leave colors.
Amazing gardens!,Lovely garden to spend a couple hours wandering through. It's no wonder it's considered one of Japan's top 3. Beautiful and peaceful!
So very beautiful,"It is worth the entry fee. I have so many photographs of the amazing place. I would recommend to anyone visiting, if you have the time then you must visit."
One of the greatest gardens in the world.,"We have visited this garden over a 25 year period at all seasons of the year, including in the snow in midwinter. It is entrancing. One of the greatest experiences any garden lover can have. Vaux le voyage."
Amazing gardens,Very nice garden to visit. One of the top 3 landscapegardens. Visited it for 2 hours and saw every part.
Come earlier before the crowds,Nice place but come earlier before the crowds. Stay longer and enjoy the silence and the nature. You may bring some food for a small picnic. Enjoy!
Stunning Garden.,"We had an early morning tour of this stunning Garden in Kanazawa, its one of the most beautiful gardens in Japan. It was developed over more than 200years ago WOW! starting in 1620, the garden contains around 900 trees and 200 plant species.It was so quiet and peaceful just wondering around taking in what this garden has to offer, just exquisite."
Beautiful gardens ,"Beautiful Japanese gardens to walk around, well worth a visit. Easy to get to by tourist bus and just across from Kanazawa Castle."
Beautiful and tranquil,"Near the castle so a convenient hop-buy a combo ticket for both to save ¥100.  Take your time and relax in the lovely gardens, trees and water features."
Just fabulous,Went at end of day. Beautifully calm atmosphere.  I am now writing the rest just so I hit the dumb 100 character limit to submit
Gorgeous gem in the middle of Kanazawa ,Lovely manicured park with a rich history.  Definitely try to find a guide as there is so much more to this garden then simply visual beauty.
Glorious garden,"A very pleasant walk around a beautifully manicured garden. So many little pockets to visit.Close to Kanazawa station - if you are genki (of good health and vitality), you do not need to catch the loop bus.Next door to the very impressive Kanazawa Gate.Surrounded by many great local restaurants."
Beautiful gardens,A stroll around these gardens is a lovely way to spend a relaxing hour or so in Kanazawa. Beautifully designed and immaculately looked after. Would like to visit in blossom season or autumn to experience then.
One of Japan’s loveliest ,"Spend a few hours meandering in this beautiful garden.  It’s a favorite spot for local wedding photos.  There are many entrances and one is served by the circle route bus, making it accessible from any part of the city."
Pretty Garden with lots of species of trees & cherry blossoms ,Easy access and walking distance from Tokyo Kanazawa Hotel. Huge park but there’s a central spot where cherry blossoms are aggregated! In different shades of pink! Target to spend about 2 hours and move on to Castle next door of you have time or proceed to Samurai House on the way back to hotel.
Walking Path Garden,3.5* Kenrokuen GardensAcross from Kanazawa CastleDozens of walking paths through the lovely gardensTranquil ponds and bridgesTeahouse and restaurant on premises
Beautiful Garden,This is a must see if you visit Kanazawa.The gardens are not very large so if you don’t want to spend more than 30 - 40 minutes that’s okay but the more you look the more you see the amazing details.
Visit to Kenrokuen Gardens,Took the bullet train from Tokyo to visit these gardens. Two older ladies visiting from New Zealand. We did not have to pay for entry as we senior citizens. What a magnificent few hours we had strolling through these gardens.  The trees are magnificent.  We met several people out in traditional costumes which made our visit.  I was impressed with the way trees were preserved with cane props.
Loved It,"What a fabulous place to wander around. A lot of very old trees, various ponds, a tea house and gift shop. Lots to see. A delightful way to spend an afternoon."
The garden is extraordinary. The castle OK,We went to the garden on a September afternoon and the heat was a factor... could spend hours in a better weather.
Good value ,"Lots and lots to see here! predominantly trees, streams, bridges, ponds, moss and teahouses. Most of the trees have been shaped by humans we saw one being worked on by seven gardeners at once two in a boat. wide easy paths some steps plenty of places for refreshments.  Look out for the museum of traditional arts and crafts which is in the gardens and has excellent quality crafts on display and very high quality goods in a shop."
A beautiful garden on a very hit day,We spent 90 minutes marvelling at the Garden and looking for shade. It’s a beautiful garden with a mix of water features and Japanese trees magnificently manicured.  Well worth the visit.
Certainly didn’t disappoint ,Visiting the garden is probably one of the main reasons you came to Kanazawa and it won’t disappoint. It’s delightful to wander around so thoughtfully designed and meticulously maintained. Very relaxing!
Beautiful garden,One of the most beautiful gardens I have ever seen. A nice and zen place to see and relax. For only 310 Yen it’s a bargain.
Beautiful garden ,We went there around 4:30 pm just enough time to purchase ticket before they close. The garden is lush green and beautiful. We took loop bus from Kanazawa station it is very easy to get there and comeback without get lost... lol.
Twelve hours in Kanazawa included this beautiful Japanese Garden.,"Arriving at Kanazawa Port on our 14 day Maasdam voyage encircling Japan, we first visited Shirakawago($200). Returning to the port at 4:30 PM, we took the free shuttle 6 km to the new bus terminal, then taxi($14) 3 km south to the Contemporary Art Museum.  After a quick tour of the circular glass structure filled with rectangular exhibit spaces, back to the taxi($9) for 2 km north to the Kenroku-en Garden.  With seniors free, we strolled 200 m up the hilltop to the large lake and walked the 1 km perimeter; a blend of mossy old trees, sculpture, and curving walkways, with perfect opportunity for photos of an Edo castle garden with over 200 years of improvements.  Another taxi($13) took us back to the amazing architecture of the bus terminal front, where we boarded the shuttle to return to the ship.It was a full and expensive day but well worth our visit."
Serene beauty,"Though it was almost unbearably hot when we visited (in August), it was hard to tear ourselves away from this place. There is tranquility everywhere, at least until the crowds arrive (go early, if you can). The sky and trees reflected in the pond, the lanterns and pagodas, and there's even a waterfall. Take your time, soak it in, and leave feeling refreshed."
Wonderful place to visit,This is a wonderful place to spend a morning or afternoon.  The gardens are really beautiful.  We had tea in the tea house - only go if your knees are ok as you kneel to drink it - an interesting experience!
Not impressed,It's a very big garden so we didn't have the time to see it all. We've seen gardens we've liked better like the one in Nikko. It all seems to narrow down to the stone lantern and the tree.
Need lots of time,"Our guide rushed us and it spoiled the experience,  Very large garden with lots to see next to the castle"
"Tranquil and idyllic, perfect for an afternoon stroll","Justifiably one of the top three landscape gardens in Japan with a truly serene and tranquil vibe. A June visit may not be the best without the magnificent cherry blossoms in spring nor the fiery spectacular autumn leaves, but you get compensated with lots of hydrangeas, azaleas and irises"
Absolutely beautiful!,"We visited the garden early August and it was a wonderful visit, worth the trip to Kanazawa. Our teenagers loved it too. It was very green and must be even more impressive with the spring flowers or autumn leaves but this visit was wonderful really. We spent 2 hours there."
Beautiful garden ,"Kenrokuen is, beside Kourakuen and Kairakuen, one of three well known gardens in Japan. What you imagine about a traditional Japanese garden is present. If you get up early in the morning, the entrance is free, and you can enjoy a fresh air. But you have to leave before 6:45 AM."
Nice garden,Nice Japanese garden but lots of people. It was very hot day and not much shade. Not the best I have seen. We only stayed for twenty minutes on our walk through to the Higashi Chaka District.
The star attraction in Kanazawa,One of the top three public gardens in Japan. A must-see in Kanazawa. Senior citizens (over 65) get in free - take id.
Pristine gardens,"Beautiful, well appointed gardens next to the castle. Japan says this is one of three perfect gardens in the county and it is well wort the travel."
"Nice but too many people, a bit overrated ","This garden surely is nice...however, the hords of people kind of wreck the serenity and there is always a tourist to photobomb every possibly nice shot...we much preferred the castle park which was really quiet at around 4pm. It is nice but if you miss it, you’ll live. There are many other nice gardens in Japan!"
Tranquil beauty,"Enjoyed a lovely Sunday afternoon wandering through the garden. We saw visitors in traditional clothing, families, couples, all enjoying the beauty. The foliage, ponds/streams and layout were one of the best we have seen in Japan"
Amazing,"Vast, beautiful gardens. Worth having a guide or written explanations of the meaning behind the statues, ponds and even the pathways.   Unfortunately it was intensely hot so we were stopped from really exploring, but well worth coming when the blossoms are out and it’s cooler The Castle has so much history (plus a very welcome air conditioned room with WiFi)Very recommended"
Beautiful park!,Beautiful park! It's easily accessible on the loop buses and it's free on the JR bus if you have the JR rail pass. There are several entrances to the park. We selected the bus stop that offered access to the park and also to Kanazawa castle across the street.
Beautiful garden,"One of the must see gardens in Japan. Stunning garden with beautiful lake, magnificent tress and moss gardens. Attention to detail is humbling, from removing every stray blade of grass and individual needles from trees, to the rope supports to stop the branches breaking from the weight of snow, all by a dedicated team of perfectionists."
Appreciating a Japanese Garden,"When we think of a garden, it must be colorful with plenty of flowers to look at. Not so the Japanese and Chinese. Gardens are create with peace and tranquility in mind. There must be the elements of water, rocks and empty spaces. Designs are such that one feel at peace as you walk through the garden and reflect on yourself. Kenrokuen is one such garden and reckon to be one of the top in Japan. Well maintained, one could simply just wander around and get lost in the many different portion of the garden and yet would not be anxious to want to find your way out. Kenrokuen has my vote as a place to go to to free your mind and reflect on your life. I would totally recommend that anyone visiting Kenrokuen must bear this in mind and understand the philosophy and design elements of the garden when visiting this site"
Beautiful and stunning!,This place is unique. Every step gives you another perspective. But to really understand we recommend a KGGN guide. This garden is different than others.
Gorgeous Gardens ,Simply stunning and well worth the visit the attention to detail is incredible and we would highly recommended a visit. Everything is maintained by hand not a lawnmower in sight..
Its a must-see,Ignore the negative reviews this is a divine garden. A real highlight. Beautiful layout and immaculately maintained. Every turn in the path has a pleasant surprise. We aren’t garden people and we loved it.
"Fantastic, magical and certainly worthwhile.","This walk was everything I hoped it to be. Super relaxing experience and my first experience in a Japanese garden. Small streams everywhere, ancient trees and beautiful shrines are to be found everywhere. No matter the location in the park there is a picturesque photo to be made."
Pine trees on crutches 🤔,"I agree, this is a nice place. Very Japanese serenity. There are a lot of very beautiful trees; however I was a bit disappointed to see that nearly all pine trees needed support not to fall over. It seems a bit like keeping someone on life support forever? Beautiful they were, the old pine trees 🌲We had a nice time, but the garden was not what we expected being the no1 attraction in Kanazawa?"
Wonderful garden,"We went in the late afternoon on an overcast day. The light in the garden was beautiful, and it wasn't very crowded. I loved wandering the paths here. The scenery and the stone lanterns are wonderful. This is one place I would like to return to--I'd like to see it in all 4 seasons!"
Beautiful garden,It is one of the best representatives of Japanese garden.  It is very well taken care of and just beautiful and picturesque.  Admission is 500 yen/adult.  The garden closes at 5 pm.
Fantastic as a day trip if you’re short on time,I can’t add to the thousands of other reviews because they’ve covered everything. Kenrokuen is easy to access as well so you don’t have to worry about getting to it. I came on a day trip in winter and in late spring overnight a couple years later. I can say that this is a fabulous place to visit any time of the year even if you don’t have a lot of time as long as it isn’t raining. Might as well go over to the tea district and do some shopping after your visit.
Beautiful gardens that live up to the reputation,"These gardens come with the reputation of being among the best three in Japan. You see why as soon as you enter.Attention to detail is abundant, although moments of tranquility are hard to come by when busy. It is a truly special place and good value when bought with a combo ticket for the adjacent castle, although the gardens there are free to enter and arguably a little more enjoyable than the castle itself, which is a recreation of the original and bereft of artefacts beyond info about how they rebuilt the castle"
Very nice garden,"Worth a visit. A nice big garden full of different types of trees, flowers, very nice Japanese style landscaping.Many different areas to visit. Also a Japanese house that is worth a visit inside the garden area. You need to pay a small fee, but worth it.A few fountain areas as well. Can spend a good 2 hours there."
Beautiful gardens,"I absolutely loved these gardens, it's beautiful. We spent a few hours wandering around between here and also visiting nearby Kanazawa castle. It was so peaceful, calm and scenic. Really lovely!"
Such a relaxing taste of Japanese Gardens,We spent a couple hours meandering along the winding paths of this garden. Every turn and bend in the path yielded a new charming view and perspective. If you have the time retrace your steps along the same paths (bit in the opposite direction) to make sure you don't miss anything. We'll worth the price of admission.
Very good Japanese garden,A very good Japanese garden that is easily accessible by the Kanazawa Loop (tourist) bus.   A must see attraction.
Don’t visit in rainy day!,"Yes, it was totally our lack of planning. This must be a great garden. Just not a great place in rainy (even light rain) day. Not many covers in the garden. Other gardens in Kyoto were smaller but this was large garden. It must be magnificent in fine day."
Gorgeous Garden,"Beautiful garden with lush green trees all around. There are a lot of different water bodies too. One can walk around for hours and enjoy this park. There are benches where you can sit but you cannot sit on the green grass. Walking thrugh The Plum Groove was my favorite part of the garden. Like most of the gardens in Japan, this is also well maintained and is visited by a number of people both locals and tourists."
Worth the trip,"This was one of the main reasons we stopped in Kanazawa, and so I was a bit nervous that it wouldn't live up to the hype. We visited in May, after the blossoms, before many flowers were out, except for the irises. It was lovely, nonetheless, and well worth the visit. I hate to think how busy it gets in blossom season, or in autumn or high season. In mid-May it was quite busy, but very manageable and pleasant."
"Fantastic Lakes, Flowers and Trees","We were lucky enough to be visiting Kanazawa at the time of Festival Weekend. We thought we would allow about an hour here but but the gardens were so beautiful and so much to see and to photograph that we stayed for more than four hours. Granted, we had perfect weather, not sure what it would be like in the rain!If you like flowers, trees, butterflies and photography this venue is a must."
Awe-inspiring,"If you only do one thing in Kanazawa, visit Kenrokuen Garden. I got up early & got a taxi to be at the garden when it opens at 7am (tourist loop bus doesn't run that early). Going at opening time was completely worth the effort! That first half hour when the garden is almost empty is magical, absolutely awe-inspiring. I visited from 7am-10am on a cold, grey day and found that the garden was busy and noisy, including large tour groups, from 9am onwards. I stayed for three hours but you certainly don't need that long - I'd say one hour minimum.I'd come back to Kanawaza just to go to Kenrokuen again."
This was the number one reason we came to Kanazawa,"I read this garden was rated the third most beautiful gardens in Japan.  That is really saying something since there are so many gorgeous gardens at temples.  This is right across the street from the castle.  It was absolutely gorgeous, so much bigger than I imagined.  So much to see. Because of the surroundings we saw a wedding photographer taking pictures of a couple in many locations around the garden.  There are waterfalls, Wysteria trees, many varieties of plum trees and every turn is a feast for your eyes.  I took many pictures.  There is a shrine that is the origin of the name Kanazawa for the gold.  If you see it, look up there is a great painting on the ceiling.  I would highly recommend that when in Kanazawa, you must delight your senses at Kenroukuen Garden."
Stunning Garden Park,"I spent a wonderful couple of hours just wabderingvthis spellbinding garden in Kanazawa. I knew it was considered to be world class and I expected to be impressed, but it still blew me away.It's not just that its stunning, its theatmosohere of peace abdcserenity it has. It's big enough that everyone is not on top of each other but small enough and intimate enough to enable most visitors to walk pretty much every path.The Kasumagike Pond, the highest in the park, is a gem with its famous pine at one end tmand turtle- shell shaped island in the middle. The rainbow bridge affords a great view.The smaller Hisagoike Pond is beautiful too, much more shaded and hidden.Another spot I i really loved was the Meijikinen Monument. The real joy is to just wander, relax, take it all in contemplate."
Really Beautiful; worth a visit!!!,"The visit of this garden was included in our Japan-Trip. I would probably not visit the garden by myself. I would have missed a very beautiful garden, it’s really nice and gives you a tons of fotomotivs. The garden is crowded but because its big enough you still found your peaceful places. I‘m glad i didn’t miss it!!"
Not a very big park tho lot of up and down. They have a Tea house they serve green or matcha with traditional sweets,Walking from Kanazawa Station to Omi cho Market the into the Castle and thru to the park   It was cool and quiet.
Stunning Vista,"Renowned as one of the best gardens in Japan, it certainly lived up to it's reputation. Several large lakes surrounded by beautiful gardens, statues, bridges, waterfalls and fountains. Several tea houses allow time to just sit and take in the beauty. A place not to be missed."
Sensational,Really lived up to its reputation as one of the three best gardens in Japan. If your in Kanazawa it is a must visit.
Just gorgeous.,"I've never written a review for a garden or park before, but this is worth the trouble. Just amazing and beautiful. So much detail and care evident around every corner.  Worth planning a trip to Kanazawa for a visit to this garden alone."
Beautiful,"Fantastic huge garden with the lake, tea house and all the beautiful sculpted trees. The only downside is that it gets very busy"
"Very fine, large garden","Followed advice to get there early. The design of the garden on undulating land provides popular fine views and parts which are quieter and more peaceful, with shaded avenues and mossy banks. Many manicured trees and shrubs creating a classic experience. Naturally enough, the plum grove in bloom was a hot spot for visitors in late March. Kanazawa was colder than Tokyo or Kyoto, with a light snowfall overnight, so we caught plum or peach blossom we missed elsewhere, but most cherry was yet to come out."
Beautiful  gardens ,Beautiful gardens  that are very enjoyable to  walk around. We got there early  to avoid the tour buses and guides.
Don't miss this garden!,"This garden is one of the top gardens in Japan, so don't miss it!  We were there during cherry blossom bloom and it was amazing.  There were a lot of people there but it was still a great experience to stroll through the garden."
All the buzz is true about this garden,This gardens reputation as one of Japans best is true. The waste garden is beautiful with lots of great scenery. I visited in late May and I spent a few hours here without even realizing it. Just walking slowly around looking at the landscape in the garden and sitting down on a bench and just relax. There s also food options just outside the park and many of Kanazawas museums is within walking distance. Great place to just take it easy and have a relaxing dayIts also directly connected to the castle ground so its very easy to combine the two which I also recommend.
Relaxing stroll,"Really varied gardens, plants, trees, ponds, statutes. Plenty of places to stop for drinks/toilets etc. Go in the morning before it gets too busy."
Japan Holiday 2019,One of the best maintained gardens. We were lucky to be there in May as it was not to crowded. We could walk around at leisure and stop for a photo with really no one in our way. A truly beautiful garden as the photo's will show. A must see garden.
Just Perfect,"Anticipated this garden would be one of the highlights of our trip, and it certainly was.  Easy to get to using the Loop Bus, enjoyed a nice cup of tea in the tea house.  Kenrokeun Garden is a credit to Japan and is well worth a visit."
Lovely garden but very crowded in Spring/Summer,"One of the best garden to visit in Japan. Everything that you expect from a Japanese garden. However, it was very crowded in May. Had to shuffle behind queues of people. There was little peace and tranquillity. Just have to imagine what it might be like without the crowds."
"So beautiful and well kept, but go early ...",Check the opening hour and go as early as possible. Crowds start to stream in soon after the whole garden is filled with people. Lovely and well kept..see photos
Beautiful gardens,"It was so beautiful, we could have had a picnic here and enjoyed the lovely foliage! I reckon it would even be more beautiful in spring. Worth visiting when in Kanazawa!There is an entrance fee of ¥400~. This is accessible via a city loop bus."
Very nice Japanese Garden,"A beautiful, well maintained garden with huge old trees, nice bridges, several ponds and monuments. It is worth visiting, even during a rainy day!"
Beautiful Gardens,"The gardens are stunning, incredibly well maintained and with a huge variety of species.  We thoroughly enjoyed walking around the different areas.  Can understand why it is deemed to be in the top three in Japan."
Lovely place ,We had a nice walk through the garden even if it was a rainy day we enjoyed the beautiful landscape with ponds and waterfalls very relaxing. Lovely place.
Gorgeous,The most beautiful gardens we’ve visited in Japan. They’re pretty extensive too so you should definitely allow for a couple of hours there. There are a couple of cafe/restaurants as well as stands to get a drink or ice cream.
Unbelievably beautiful,"A high point for a visit to the city. Beautiful and captivating. Even with crowds, you can find some solitude."
Really beautiful,Fantastic gardens- one of the best in Japan. Worth a visit. Use the map to navigate - it is not so big you will get lost but you may miss stuff without reference to the map. The tea house was closed when we were there but there is a small one near at the lower pond.
an immense garden,"One of the most famous gardens in Japan, but we were not as impressed as we thought we would be. Firstly, it is an enormous garden so big in scope that it was hard to take in. Secondly, it was so hot and crowded that you could not appreciate what should have been a serene experience."
"Japan""s Beauty",This garden is one of the most beautiful gardens in Japan. You can see small bridges with a running canal throughout the garden. Flowers all around and you can see the city from the garden.
Lovely Gardens,We stopped by early morning on a hot day in May before the crowds had arrived.The gardens are beautifully kept and the reflections in some of the lakes are great. The park isn't that big and easy to get around in probably an hour.There is an admission fee charged for access to the gardens but well worth it.
Happy Koi,"This was a beautiful and financially accessible garden. We went at opening which was quiet and serene. The Koi wagged their tails like puppies and seemed so happy. For me, that was the most delightful. Many areas to explore. Fewer flowers that I expected."
Stunning beauty,"We had expectations for this garden from previous reviews but we were nonetheless blown away by its sheer beauty. It is a large but manageable size to walk around and you really do want to walk around the whole thing. The attention to detail is stunning and its beauty is evident without being showy. There are relatively few flowers except for beautiful rows of irises along a stream and a few other flowers but the beauty arises from the combination of trees, sculpted bushes, lovely miss covered areas, rocks, and bridges across several streams. Go early in the morning well before the groups arrive with their shrieking tour leaders desperately trying to herd their group."
Truly beautiful,"Kenrokuen garden is one of the 3 best gardens in Japan. It is my favorite place in Kanazawa. The garden is quite big and relatively dense. It doesn't have huge wide-open spaces which make the character of Okayama's Korakuen. Instead it is packed with variety of very interesting trees, meandering brooks, little pavilions. It also has the oldest fountain in Japan. The garden is popular with visitors, but it doesn't feel overcrowded since you can usually find some less-used path to enjoy a bit of solitude.In the far end of the garden you will find the Seisonkaku Villa and The Prefectural Museum for Traditional Products and Crafts. Neither of them is a must-see, and they require a separate entry fee, but since you are already here - come in. The villa has several rooms on two levels, nightingale floorboards and a little garden at the back, which you can only admire from the porch. The crafts museum has some beautiful products for sale, so it might be of particular interest if you want to bring home a little piece of Japan. Some items are quite expensive, but there are plenty of little things which are very affordable.Don't forget to leave some time to wander through the nearby castle grounds and to see the Ishikawa Gate.If you need to eat - there is a little cafe / coffee shop outside of the garden, very close to the northernmost point / entry gate (near the Ishikawa Gate). It is in the street forming the north-eastern edge of the garden, maybe 60-70 meters from the gate. They have very decent food, nice deserts, friendly service and reasonable prices. I think the sign is just 'COFFEE'."
A Must-See in Kanazawa ,"We had read many good reviews about Kenrokuen Garden, which’s supposed to combine all six attributes of a perfect garden.  Taking the opportunity that we were in Kanazawa, we came here.  Many people took pictures in front of the two-legged stone lantern, which was a well-known spot in this garden.  Overall, the garden’s highly recommended and a must see."
Beauty of a garden,"Truly a beauty of a garden. Given the large area of the gardens, it's not as crowded. But there are several entrances and exit, so you need to watch which entrance you're going in from. There's also a tea house to sip tea, eat mochi and just watch people."
Garden Walkabout,Our first stop to the botanical garden with flora and fauna. Beechwood  trees and assortment of trees line the garden with a pond in the middle of it all. A must stop for those who enjoy small Forest. Souvenir  shops offering a selection of green tea in a variety of flavour. Ice-cream parlour is also available.
Excellent garden but very busy,"We enjoyed this garden but be prepared for crowds. Definitely one of the better gardens in Japan. The cost is low and if you are a senior, it is free."
Magical walk through the gardens,Did the garden walk today after touring the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art and the Suzuki Museum yesterday (both of which were excellent).  It is truly a magical walk through gorgeous woods with majestic trees and lovely ponds.  A perfect relaxing stroll for our last day in Kanazawa.
Beautiful,"Kenrokuen is recognized as one of the three great gardens of the style known as Kaiyushiki (a circuit stroll style garden that features a path around a pond) in Japan. Other two are Korakuen in Okayama city and Kairakuen in Mito city in Ibaragi. Kenrokuen is known for its cherry blossoms, plum trees and autumn foliage. And not to be missed is the beautiful peaceful snowy day panorama of the garden. It was a free admission day when we were there. Strolling the huge garden, you can appreciate how meticulously plants are cared for. The garden is not flat. It has high points and low points. Although there were many visitors, our experience was surprisingly quiet and calming. A Japanese beauty not to be missed."
Very Crowded - Side paths are better,"I took the bus to Kenrokuen Garden and got turned around off the bus - walked around for 15 minutes before I crossed the street, walked up the steep to one of the entrances.  Given all the tourists in town today, I wasn’t surprised that there were no English-speaking guides available at the information center but it was a shame. The map provided at admission is very useful.  There were many tour groups so I veered off to the side paths because they were less crowded; turns out this was the right thing to do – I guess tour groups stick to the wider, well-trodden route!  This garden is famous because it contains the six different sublime qualities to which a garden can aspire:  spaciousness & seclusion; artifice & antiquity; watercourses & panoramas.  I had printed some info about these qualities and how they’re put into practice at Kenrouken which helped me understand the objectives and accomplishments.  And to realize that not everything in these gardens has to hit you in the face or be super huge or showy.  While there were people all around, there were plenty of meandering paths so I could have a path to myself for a minute or two. The Sei son Kaku villa inside the park was very interesting - possibly the highlight of my visit to the park.  Walking along the less travelled paths of the garden, I was interested to see how the branches of the large, older trees are propped up with very thick, strong & official looking wooden posts.  I got to a point where there was an exit and I was ready to leave."
A beautiful garden of the highest quality.,"We were in Kanazawa for 3 days and visited Kenrokuen twice, for the different light. It is a stunningly beautiful garden, sculptured and planned to the highest details. Every few steps there are beautiful photo opportunities. We were here in mid-May when the Azaleas, magnolia and Wisteria are in full bloom. Cherry blossom season must be spectacular but so must the crowds! We found the quietest time was lunch time, too early or late and you will get the large tour groups. Go when people are elsewhere eating! The light at midday is also at its best."
Beautiful and peaceful ,Really nice relaxing walk through the gardens. Coming to Kanazawa is worth it for this and the castle alone.
Japanese Gardening As I'd Imagined It,"This is an astounding garden, full of detail and exceptional arboriculture. The use of moss rather than grass provides a soft and interesting texture and the ways carefully constructed views open up in sequence is wonderful"
Different and interesting ...,"Not sure how or why, but we gained free entry: it may have been because it was a Sunday, or maybe because it was blossom season, but the gardens were packed with locals, which was nice to see, but maybe detracted somewhat from the peace and serenity ...Given we were here for blossom season (early April), most of the trees, plants and flowers were devoid of greenery and bloom.  As such, the gardens weren’t in their prime, but nonetheless we enjoyed traipsing through the different areas, which are beautifully and fastidiously maintained.There’s a bit of uphill gradient in certain areas, and some bridges to cross, but neither are essential to appreciate part, if not all, of the gardens.Worth a visit, especially given it’s adjacent to Kanazawa Castle and it’s lovely park."
Morning,Spectacular expansive traditional Japanese garden in Kanazawa.  Created in the Edo Period by a local Samurai leader.
Is this the garden of six attributes or more five already?,"Kenroku-en means in Japanese ""Garden of six attributes of a perfect landscape"" . These attributes were listed in the Li Gefei`s book  ""The Chronicles of the famous Luoyang gardens"". The Chinese poet listed them: spaciousness, seclusion, artifice, antiquity, waterways, and panoramas. Rare Park has three-four, Kenrokuen has all six. Or rather, had. Problem with seclusion. The Park was opened to the public in 1874 and attendance is only increasing. A place where you find yourself in solitude is hard to find. So there are only five attributes for us tourists. Maybe only workers of  garden can have 6th attribute after the closure of the garden for the night. It is pointless to describe the beauty of the Park. Everything we see in Kenrokuen is created by human hands, even if it seems to us that it is a creation of nature. This ""natural"" beauty was created more than two centuries with a break for the fire, after which everything had to start anew. Kenroku-en was developed from the 1620s to the 1840s by the Maeda clan. To look at everything that was done for two centuries it takes 2 hours and 310 yen. For children only 100."
 Beautiful gardens,After visiting the castle we wandered through these lovely gardens with its tranquil ponds and some of the most spectacular specimens of trees we have ever seen on our journeys.  You could happily spend a couple of hours meandering though these gardens.
Enchanting,"A terrific, beautiful garden for strolling around. Typical Japanese with a lot of different views created and contemplative spaces. Go in the morning as early as possible as it gets busy. The cherry blossoms were out when we were there, so there were a few couples in traditional dress having pre wedding photos taken. It all added to the joy of the place"
Enjoyable garden but quite crowded,"I visited this garden during a recent trip in Kanazawa. The garden is quite large but despite it's size,it was filled with people on the day I visited. There are numerous water features, and a large lake that is very pretty. A few cherry blossoms were left, although they were definitely past their peak. Despite all the people, the garden projects a tranquil atmosphere. A tea house and other snack stands provide food if you are hungry. This garden is one of the top gardens in Japan and definitely worth a visit if you are in Kanazawa.There are multiple entrances with admission fee kiosks."
Must visit if you're in Kanazawa,"After arriving from Tokyo by train, and then checking in to the ANA Crowne Plaza Kanazawa (which is conveniently located next to the train station) we headed out to visit Kenrokuen Garden.  The weather, at least in early April when we were in Kanazawa, was constantly changing.  We were lucky that we had clear skies with cool temps while we were touring the garden.  Later that afternoon, it started to rain.  And later that night, it started to snow.  The next day, it snowed, and was sunny, and then rained, all in the same day, so be ready for frequent changes in weather!  I've posted many pictures since I think the pictures will say more than I can say with words.  We highly recommend this beautiful garden!"
Very beautiful and professionally maintained garden,"An excellent garden, very well maintained and many beautiful trees and flowers. It is worthwhile to visit. Different views and good spots to take romantic pictures."
Monty don,"Monty Don visited this garden and observed the gardeners remove grass from the moss. I saw the same thing. It’s a large beautiful park with typically Japanese landscapes. Apparently it’s lit up at night too. It’s a gorgeous place to visit and in april the  street leading up to the entrances are lined with cherry trees. It’s a wonderful spectacle to behold. It’s worth several visits but unfortunately my tour only gave us time to visit once during the day. If you like gardening and gardens, this is a must"
Perfection!,"This is one of the most beautiful gardens in whole Japan.  We bought a combine ticket, with an included visit to the castle.  It was wonderful to see the cherry blossoms!  Our visit was perfect, this garden has it all!"
Kenrokuen Garden,"Wonderful garden situated across from the Kanazawa Castle Park.  Visually stunning and has many different areas.  Very interesting in how they still use traditional style supports for the trees during the winter months.  If you enjoy gardens, I would highly recommend."
Wonderful ,One of my favorite gardens I have ever visited. Several beautiful ponds with colorful Koi. Plum trees. Shrines. It's absolutely beautiful. Don't miss this!
Worth a visit,We were in Kanazawa for 2 days and would recommend the gardens. It was a lovely bright spring day so everything looked great. We had tea in the kenrouken gardens which was inexpensive and highly recommend.
Outstanding,"One of the highlights of our trip to Japan.  Beautiful in blossom season, but I suspect impressive at any time."
Beautiful ,"Beautiful and large park. Save 1.5 hours or more to really enjoy.  Lots to see from statues, to water park to a wonderful fountain that is naturally powered."
Beautiful Japanese Garden ,"Kenrokuen literally means ""Garden of Six Sublimities"" - spaciousness, seclusion, artificiality, antiquity, abundant water and broad views. These special attributes made the Garden a perfect one. There are two main ponds in the garden. Cherry blossoms are must see here in spring time. The iconic pine tree protections will however be erected only in winter seasons. I missed it as it's the wrong timing. There are many walking trails and the pedestrian walkway just outside the Katsurazaka Gate was already very eye catching and picturesque."
Lovely but crowded,"The gardens were lovely, but very crowded. The gravel paths, which made walking a bit tricky at times, were winding with inclines, constantly giving different views. What spoilt the experience for us was a local guide bellowing into a microphone as she conducted her group around. There was a restaurant inside, doing a roaring trade in ice-creams and several restaurants and shops just outside the gardens. Across the road, over a bridge,  was the castle where we strolled around the grounds."
Absolutely beautiful garden,"Must see location when in Kanazawa, especially during the Cherry Blossom season. The gardens were absolutely beautiful and well kept."
Most beautiful garden in Japan,"We visited many gorgeous gardens during our honeymoon in Japan, but Kenrokuen, specially in spring with cherry blossoms at full bloom, was the most beautiful."
A feast for the eyes ,"Beautiful garden of well-maintained trees, pathways, bridges and moss gardens. A few cherry blossoms were still in flower , magnolias and azalias added colour. Well worth a visit."
A masterful creation,"More than 200 years in the making, this masterful garden has its ‘roots' (pun intended) back in the 17th century. The design and presentation is a work of artistic beauty and ranked among the best in all of Japan. Until 1871, it was a private, Maeda family owned paradise and part of the Kanazawa Castle garden. Today the 11+ hectare site attracts crowds from all over the world. The gorgeous displays make it) a photographer's dream. Plan on a visit of 1-3 hours."
Appreciate it as an ancient garden,"This strolling garden was built over THREE centuries! Take care to admire the very old, beautiful trees that often have poles/twine/wires to support their sprawling branches. We went around 9:30am and it was already quite busy. This garden is more about the form of the landscape and it how it interacts with streams, ponds, water features, mossy areas, flowering trees and shrubs. The garden seems to include every shade of green! I enjoyed photographing its small details."
Best garden we visited in Japan,"It has plenty of hype, but it is well earned. Everything looks perfect in this historic Maeda family garden."
Spring visit to Kenrokuen garden,"Lovely gardens with lake, bridges, statues, cherry blossoms and moss. Busy in spring. We stopped by the lake to share dango mochi and green tea. Many photographic opportunities"
Beautiful,"libes up to its fame as one of the best japanese style gardens in the country. Amazing landscaping, small bridgea crossing beautiful streams, all plants trimmed to perfection and combined in the best possible way."
Beautiful,"Lovely typical Japanese garden, quite large. Was lucky enough to be there for the cherry blossoms...amazing!"
Not sure what the hype is about,"We heard this was top 3 garden in Japan, but were a bit disappointed. It's overrun with tour groups and is a ""strolling"" garden so certainly pretty but lacks some of that detail that I like in a Japanese garden. Clearly a preference thing and worth going to, but don't expect any tranquility."
Fantastic garden,"One can really feel the love of nature that goes into maintaining the old trees in this garden. Very well maintained facility with many footpaths, ponds and types of trees.Do not miss it if visiting Kanazawa!"
Pretty traditional garden with large ground,"Enjoyed full cherry blossom there.  Very pretty.  Large ground with few undulation.  Easily accessible by tourist loop bus.  Heard that even better to view autumn leaves.  Together with the adjacent Kanazawa Castle, it is worth spending half a day there."
Lovely walks through a beautiful wooded area,"Due to rain, our walk through this beautiful wooded garden was shorter than planned. There were a lot of people but it still seemed very serene and peaceful. There are excellent walking paths through the woods, lots of places to stop and sit and lovely water features. Very enjoyable!"
Amazing garden,"This was the place we really wanted to see in Japan. And it is truly amazing, even some of the cherry trees were in blossom! We spent 4 hours there and coupled it with a visit to Kanazawa Castle, which is opposite.It is easy to wander around, there are plenty of places to sit and relax, or take refreshments. Do visit the house in the grounds, especially if you haven’t seen a traditional property before.We were lucky with the weather and got some great photos, but in the middle of a city, it is a great place to visit and relax."
Beautiful gardens,These gardens are well kept and really beautiful with lakes and waterfalls. They really are worth a visit.
Magical!,"Beautifully landscaped gardens made all the more breathtaking by cherry trees in bloom. It was a highlight of our two-week trip to Japan. Totally impressed, as well, by the small army of workers who were meticulously tending the landscape, going so far as to sweep bits of debris from moss-covered grounds. The park is connected at its northern end to Kanazawa Castle, so overall it's a wonderful half-day of sightseeing. Don't miss if you love gardens or if you just want to connect with some stunning green spaces while in the city."
Stunning gardens,"Amazing gardens. So well maintained and clean.Really interesting oldest fountain inJapan. Go early. The crowds were arriving by the bus load as we were heading out at 9.30am. So many guides with flags and loud speakers!Impressive bridge next to old fountain made from one piece of stone.We just missed the plum trees blossoms, but can imagine it would look spectacular."
Beauiful garden,"Well deserving of it's top 3 ranking, this is a really lovely  garden. Our second time to Kanazawa and this garden is something that I could never tire of, and one of the reasons to visit again. Not too large, it is easy to walk around in an hour, but deserves more time so you can take in the beautiful elements that are everywhere. On a clear day the reflections in the water are fantastic and the different sections of the garden each have their own beauty. We were there a little before peak cherry blossom season as some of the trees were just coming into flower so missed the mass effect, but even without flowers the garden is amazing. We did watch some of the gardeners taking down the winter supports from the pines which was fascinating in itself, and makes you realise just how much work goes into keeping the place looking good."
stunning gardens!,"the gardens are beautiful!! we were there for cherry blossom season and everything was amazing. It was crowded because it was cherry blossom season, but well worth the time we spent there!"
Fascinating For Gardeners,Very crowded in April due to Cherry Blossom but seasonal interest all round. Very interesting to see attention to detail in care of moss lawns and cloud pruned trees. Allow two hours.
Cherry blossom garden,Remember that mid - April is still great for Sakura sights in Kanazawa.  Beautiful garden - see pictures.  Be prepared to walk up if you don’t get driven to the place.  It’s sits on a plateau on top of a small hill where the Kanazawa Castle is.  A must see.
A nice stroll in cherry blossom time,"This garden is quite large and very manicured. Right across the road from the Kanazawa Castle, so you can do both in a couple of hours."
Outstanding garden,We visited on the week end of a public holiday but even with many other visitors present there was a serene quality to the garden. Stunning views and beautifully kept trees and shrubs. The cherry trees were still in blossom though not the plum trees. Pine trees are trained over the water - indeed streams and ponds are an important feature of the garden.
Fabulous,This was the reason I came to Kanazawa and it didn't let me down. A tranquil and beautiful place with a very reasonable entry fee
Beautiful but not ideal for kids,"We went at the wrong time of the year I think as not much was blooming. It was very crowded with many bus tour groups stopping by.It was okay to walk around but everything the kids wanted to walk on or touch, there was a sign saying that it couldn't be entered or touched, so the kids got bored very quickly. There was Japan's oldest water fountain there which was interesting."
This is a must see,"We arrived in Kanazawa and went to Kenrokuen Garden immediatly and are very glad we did. What a quiet, peaceful and beautiful garden. One of the best in Japan."
Best Garden in Japan?,"If you are reading this now you have missed the cherry blossom peak here. This garden though, with or without cherry blossoms, is pure magic.No wonder it is so busy.....you have to spend a few hours just wandering to really get an appreciation of the genius of the design.Go early or very late in the day for the best light."
Beautiful Garden,"We enjoyed walking through this picturesque garden.There were a few water features but unfortunately the sakura were only just starting to flower. A bridal couple were being photographed when we were there, which was lovely to see and photograph (we did get permission). Worth a visit."
Large garden with lots to see - but also large crowds,"The problem with the more famous Japanese gardens is that they were probably not designed to handle the huge crowds that descended on them particularly during cherry blossom season, and Kenrokuen is no exception even with its large size.  I was fortunate to be visiting right after a heavy icy shower and it was also lunch time, so except for a couple of large and noisy tourist groups I had a pretty nice time enjoying the various sights before the large tour groups arrive in the afternoon.  Do study the map to ensure you do not miss out on some of the more easily overlooked sights such as the Gankobashi (Flying Wild Geese) Bridge and the many beautiful pine trees."
A Must Place to View in Spring and Fall,Enjoyed the Spring cherry blossoms during mid-April. The park is large so save about an hour for your visit.
Lovely visit,Beautiful gardens with cherry blossoms . Must see. See both the garden and the grounds of the palace leisurely . We spent 2 Hours of in a hurry an hour to 90 min would do
A must if you are visiting Kanazawa Castle Park,"This is the most beautiful Japanese garden I’ve ever seen. Don’t miss the plum grove, the raised root pine and Statue of Prince Yamato. There’s a tea house on site for you to enjoy a cup of tea while soaking in the atmosphere. Highly recommended if you are visiting Kanazawa."
No 1 in Kanazawa,"This place is worth dropping by and is the best attraction in Kanazawa. The Japanese Garden is beautiful and well spread out.  There are ponds, fountains, waterfalls, cherry & plum trees and many houses or monuments to visit. It took us nearly 1-2 hours to complete the entire garden in a leisurely pace. Also snapped over 50 photos of this wonderful garden. Overall, this place best ranks one of the best gardens in Japan and no. 1 attraction in Kanazawa."
This place never fails to lift you up! ,"I visited this place along side 21st Century museum in winter 2011. Visited in spring April 2019, It is still the same park (of course!) and the same feeling of peace that you experienced as you walk in the park. The place is beautiful both in spring and winter. There were a lot of tourist, still it is the topPlace to visit if you are in kanazawa. The garden is awesome, indeed the top garden in japan."
beautiful,a beautiful relaxing space.  the cherry trees were out and lit up.    clean and lots of quiet places to relax.
Top Attraction in Kanazawa,Kenrokuen is one of Japan’s top three gardens. It’s popular all year round but particularly so during the annual Sakura (cherry blossom) season.
Superb,If you like gardens you'll love this. If you're not interested in gardens you'll love it anyway.It's beautiful and only costs 310 yen to get in so just go!.
Unbelievably beautiful and serene,We visited this beautiful garden as part of a business outing. The pictures speak for themselves. If you are in Kanazawa don’t miss it.
Must see in Kanazawa,"I am a Japanese local , and have seen many Japanese gardens - but this continues to rank in my top 3 , if not favorite During cherry blossom season it does get very very crowded - but overall layout of the gardens is very beautiful and well designed - lord Maeda definitely has good taste !"
So much beauty!,"Even in early spring, this was a lovely place to explore.  I wish I could come back every week to watch the flowers bloom in their seasons."
Beautiful garden,"The garden is really beautiful, especially when trees are in bloom (but then of course it gets quite crowded). There are good views over the town, and on clear days you can see snow capped mountains in the background. The garden is very well maintained, like most places in Japan."
Undulating landscapes full of detail and features,"After a great lunch in Manmaru, we were ready to stroll of the food.  These gardens provided us with a second feast, not only the Sakaru, meandering paths deliver you major features, including ponds, streams and so many different structural trees. If you struggle on your legs make sure you have a strong friend who can push you between main features."
Exquisite and essential Japan,"The Kenroku-en garden of Kanazawa is a National Treasure for very good reason. It combines history, artistry and botanical beauty in a very accessible experience. This historic garden contains all the elements of a perfect Japanese garden. Ancient, well-tended trees and landscapes of both open and secluded views, water in ponds and bubbling streams, and long views all provide perfect structure and “bones” for this garden in any season. This strong structure is then accented by seasonal highlights-cherry and plum blossom, magnolia, azalea, water iris, then the depth of greens in summer and the riot of autumn colours. This is also a people-0watching place-tourists, locals, young couples in traditional dress, having their photos taken to mark their relationship or engagement, schoolgirls or sisters, gracing delicately patterned kimonos, posing under overhanging cherry blossom boughs, elderly locals on their daily walk, cheeky, racing children, and the incredibly skilled gardeners perched on ladders to prune the ancient black pines into the shapes of gods and dancers. There are also some significant buildings, don’t miss the Seisonkaku villa, built by a warlord for his mother, a moving tribute to family love and care, and a fascinating example of traditional architecture. It also houses a fascinating collection of miniatures of extraordinary artistry."
Plum blossom season,"We went to Kanazawa specifically to see this garden. It’s not surprising that this garden is considered one of the best in Japan. It has great views all over, various walks around. The Plum Grove was in blossom and beautiful.The garden has several places where you can get a light meal, drink or light lunch. We got a good vegan soup and snack in a tatami room overlooking the lake. Our fellow diners were two young women in lovely kimonos, which are worn by quite a few in Kanazawa it seemed."
Really beautiful garden,"This is really beautiful garden, probably the most beautiful I've seen in Japan. Easy to get to using the city loop bus. There's a combo ticket for the gardens and Kanazawa castle, that will save you some money if you want to visit both attractions."
Stunning,"If you have seen the monty don programme about Japanese gardens then you come with high expectations.You will not be disappointed as the gardens are breathtaking even on a day when it was cold ,raining and occasionally snowing(and we had come to see the cherry blossom)It’s not the flowers or the blossom it is the layout configuration shaping of trees use of water and rocks in fact everything you would hope to see in a Japanese garden.Just stop and look and wonder"
Lovely gardens,"It was so different from our gardens peaceful, well kept and very clean. Not very busy when we went which was great."
Out of this world,Stunning gardens that make you feel as though you've been transported into a studio Ghibli film. Beautifully kept landscapes that have inspired my husband and I with our own garden plans. It was the perfect place for us to visit after the busy city of Tokyo!
Beautiful gardens ,Stunning manicured gardens. Would recommend wandering around and taking photos. Really beautiful.Cherry blossoms in spring; beautiful lake. This is meant to be one of Japan’s most beautiful gardens so it is well worth having a look
A lovely Japanese garden,"This was a lovely Japanese garden.  The moss was spectacular, so brilliant green.  (I come from an arid location where we see very little moss.)  Lots of large old trees, ponds, waterfalls, lanterns, etc. that you would expect in a traditional Japanese garden.  The plum tree grove was in bloom and beautiful."
Ok,"I suspect because it is spring, the flora is just getting over the harsh winter. Peach trees in verge of blossoming. We had visited the Shukkeien Gardens at Hiroshima and they were far more spectacular, even though much smaller n no crowds. Though whilst in Kanazawa a visit to Kenrokuen Garden is a must do."
Beautiful garden. Probably the number one attraction in Kanazawa,"You could spend 2-3 hours in this lovely and pretty garden. Just take your time and your camera. Stroll along the garden’s lanes. Enjoy the water system, the lovely ponds, the whole gardening. It is a must visit place."
Beautiful traditional Japanese gardens,What a lovely way to spend the afternoon! Beautiful gardens representative of traditional Japanese garden close to the Kanazawa castle.
Beautiful,This garden is beautifully kept. We spent a happy 2 hours wondering. I can believe it's one of the top 3 gardens in Japan.
Magnificent garden for strolling,We visited in the garden on a Tuesday in early spring and there were plenty of other visitors.  The garden is meticulously maintained and every vista is beautiful.  The camellias and plum blossoms were flowering which added spots of colour to the vivid green of the moss and greys of the stone lanterns.
With tour,Amazing  lives up to its reputation as one of the Best Japanese gardens  it’s mind boggling beautiful and not surprising that is was on of Monty Dons highlights
Must do gardens,"The gardens are absolutely fabulous. With a lake in the middle, the gardens stretch mostly to one side of the property. We were fortunate enough to see cherry and plum trees blooming - see pictures. The garden is rated to be in the top three in Japan - deservedly so.Somehow I cannot add pics? But do take it for granted, the gardens are must-do, especially now in spring."
Beautiful japanese garden,Visit kenrokuen garden during our transit from kanazawa to tokyo after visiting shirakawago. only takes 15 minutes from the kanazawa station. We dont have to pay anything  for transportation because it covers by our JR pass. We spend one hour there. It was a nice japanese garden. Would be better during spring when all flowers dan cherry blossom bloom.Don't miss it during your visit to kanazawa
Stunning gardens,"These are beautiful gardens to wander around, I imagine any time of the year. Very peaceful setting. Beautiful and easy to get around. Lovely to see the plum blossom, but must be stunning in cherry blossom time."
Pretty and cozy,"If you love plum and cherry blossoms, this is a great place! Lots of ponds, koi fish, and trees to see right next to a famous castle. They serve food and drinks on site."
Trees are starting to blossom!,"Trees are beginning to blossom! Exciting. We came to Japan in search of cherry blossoms. Several cherry trees in bloom in Tokyo. Now in Kanazawa we were fooled, what appeared to be cherry blossoms were plum trees. Still, it was a gorgeous display of plum blossoms.Beautiful Japanese gardens. A must see attraction in Kanazawa. The lake with the tortoise shaped island as well as the pine trees was worth the price of admission."
Well maintained garden ,A scenic garden well maintained. Easy to get around in a day. Especially nice when the cherry blossoms are out. Lovely landscaped ponds.
"Beautiful garden, quite different ",Convenient to travel to garden ifvtaking the day pass on the tourist loop buses. Beautiful and quiet garden with some interesting triangular structure. Paths are gentle for walking but do not encourage anyone to push pram. My pram nearly ko in me.
A wonderful garden. A must visit in Kanazawa,"This garden is very pretty. It was a shame that it was cold and rainy on the day we went. We especially enjoyed the view of the lake and the plum tree garden. I can imagine this being very photogenic on a sunny day. It's right next to the castle, so we visited both attractions in one go. It was a bit too much walking for my mom."
Beautiful garden ,A well-maintained garden. Entrance fee is ¥310 per pax. Easily reached via the Kanazawa Loop Buses. Managed to see some flowers during this transition period between winter and spring. It has a beautiful lake which is worth visiting. Kenrokuen is also very near Kanazawa Castle. Can visit if there is spare time.
Awesome Site,Can't say enough about this gem of a park in the middle of Kanazawa.  One could easily spend an entire day exploring the many sites and experiences that this place has to offer.  One impressive feature is the old trees that need to be supported by large poles so their branches don't break.  That was a thing of beauty to see.Greatly enjoyed our time there.
Outstanding garden,"We waited for a sunny day to visit the gardens, in early spring. Spent at least 2 hours exploring the whole gardens and loved all of it. Even though there were only a few plum blossom trees out, the gardens were still outstanding. It was definitely worth being there in the sun, as we went back again later in the day (the tickets are all-day) and it certainly wasn't as good. Beautifully tended, really extensive. We will seriously consider another trip to Japan to see the gardens in autumn colours, or with the azaleas out."
Nice,Nice park. Probably better when it doesn't rain. Still beautiful. Take your time as we had to rush through the park due too closing time. Not the best timing. I would take 2hours to fully enjoy the park.
Garden walk,Was drizzling on day of visit. Enjoyed the walk in the garden despite the wet weather. Would be a great place to visit in Spring when flowers blossom.
Truly one of the most spectacular gardens in Japan,"An implicit respect for nature and preservation permeates Japanese culture and nowhere is this more clearly demonstrated than Kenrokuen Gardens, where a meticulous staff masterfully maintains multitudinous flora.  But more than just a pile of trees, bushes and ponds, the careful design and layout of the landscape is supposed to exemplify the six attributes of a perfect Chinese garden (according to their brochure): spaciousness, artifice, seclusion, watercourses/open water areas, antiquity, and panorama.These qualities superbly represent Kenrokuen, and spending a few peaceful hours ambling the many pathways yields a serenity that can only matched by floating above a mountaintop lake.  From variety of trees to the tranquil ponds and streams to the ancient stonework to the oldest fountain in Japan, one can soak up nature and admire the effort that goes into preserving this centuries-old, previously royal garden.Being there in April meant more crowds than usual for us (Sakura season), but the koi seemed to like more people being around and the outskirts of the paths, such as the quiet corner where Basho has a shrine, were much less trafficked.  We also chose April to see the cherry blossoms blooming, which did not disappoint.There are a few different places to eat within the property (the soba food stall wasn't crowded and was quite tasty), and several stalls sell beer and water as well.  A drink does go well with appreciating nature, and this traditional Japanese garden is an amazing place to do so, and to find your own zen."
A disappointed trip,I came to see a white Kenrokuen Garden but was sorely disappointed. We did see some plum blooming though.
“LANDSCAPED GARDENS” “PRUNED PRISTINE GARDENS” “TRADITIONAL JAPANESE”,"Outside Kanazawa Castle, these magnificent gardens attract visitors near and far to experience the serene, peaceful, zen ambience and the tranquil, calm waters with lots of quiet time amongst the pine trees and cherry blossoms.Located at Kanazawa, this region is famous for its gold leaf industry, which can be sampled as gold-decorated ice-cream. It is now a regional commercial centre and transportation hub for Ishikawa Prefecture. There are multiple outlets, selling gold-themed items, cosmetics and desserts. Choose ice-cream with gold sprinkles, gold (See my HAKUICHI review) sheets or gold tinsel garlands.Besides the lacquer and gold-mix-lacquer-work, the plum and cherry blossoms are also a major attraction here. There are some engineering feats, designs and techniques in the garden, such as the natural water fountain without any pressure system, or the bamboo supports which form the backbone for juvenile and senile trees. Many famous pictures show snow on the supporting ropes and bamboo, which illuminated at night appear as Christmas tree props. There is an earthy tone throughout the park, emphasizing the wonders and powers of nature interspersed with the gentle, soft colors and texture of the flora.Walk to Kasumigaike Pond and see the karasaki pine tree with its horizontal branch propped up by sticks. There are many bridges and footpaths traversing ponds and streams. The kotoji lantern at the lake is another photogenic site. The 6 Confucian virtues and elements; seclusion, antiquity, spaciousness, human ingenuity, water and scenic views are embodied in the design, character and layout of this traditional Japanese garden. Our group visited on a sunny morning, then continued our journey to snowy SHIRAKAWAGO (see my review) in the afternoon!"
A charming couple of hours,"We went for a stroll in the gardens at a time of year when nature, even carefully nurtured nature such as you find in the gardens, is not at its best. The snow has just left and spring hadn’t sprung, but the gardens were nevertheless a very pleasant interlude. The villa in the grounds is well worth a visit, too, although an extra pair of socks would be useful if you are visiting in winter as you have to take your shoes off and underfloor heating is not a feature!"
Beautiful garden even in winter,Lovely way to spend a few hours wandering around this lovely japanese garden adjacent to Kanazawa castle.Lots of different pathways to explore with maps scattered through out.
Find a spot and be at peace,"Surround yourself with tall trees, perhaps find a spot next to one of the ponds, bring a book, and enjoy the surroundings. Its not the largest garden but its still very pretty."
A perfect garden even without the blossoms,"Visiting a garden in winter can seem like the wrong time to visit and I have no doubt the spring here is beautiful but I don’t believe it is any less magicalThe grounds are impeccable, beautiful and serine The paths throughout provide unique and enchanting views at every turn. We can across a wee cafe with coffee, small lunches and warm Saki. A photo of it is below. Well worth a stop. We spent two hours here and you couple easily spend more. A must see in Kanazawa"
Beautiful even in (snowless) winter,"after spending almost 2 hours in this garden in a snowless morning in winter, the questions I had in my mind was ""how much more beautiful can it be in other seasons! given it's already so stunning beautiful in winter without snow."" My absolute respect to all the gardeners and their painstaking effort to maintain it."
Beautiful garden,"This garden is beautiful and can be enjoyed year round. We stayed only for a little while since the weather was not very nice, however we enjoyed our visit."
Lovely spacious garden,"This is a beautiful garden (even in winter) - take your time to look at the various areas, ponds and the views to the surrounding areas.  Peaceful and lovely"
Best Garden in any season,"I’ve visited all 3 of the great gardens and this has to be the best and is great in any season. But the real prize on this occasion was that after our visit, it started to snow, so of course we went back. The next day, when we arrived it was snowing a blizzard. In the snow the garden is magical. Everyone was stunned by its beauty and its transformation. Words cannot describe it - just go and see it."
One of the highlights of our Japan tour!,"We got to this ""strolling style"" landscape garden, typical of the Edo period, at about 9.30 and it was still relatively quiet and peaceful.Originally the outer garden of Kanazawa Castle situated across the river, this is one of the most famous gardens in Japan full of the most beautiful trees, lakes, waterfalls and fountains.The grounds are immaculately groomed with workers sweeping the streams and the paths and picking weeds from the lawns.A really wonderful place to visit."
"Stunning, peaceful garden in the middle of the city.","We visited Kenrokuen Garden in the middle of winter.  I was expecting a bleak and drab experience as the day was grey and nothing was blooming.  However, this garden is meticulously maintained and you can't help but have a little feeling of zen as you wander round.  I would love to come back in spring or summer however I think it would be insanely busy so it was nice to wander around without too many people."
A delightful few hours in Kanazawa Kenrokuen Garden (It would be even more delightful with less selfie-driven tourists!),"We visited Kenrokuen Garden in November when the autumn foliage was partially on display. Some of the reds and oranges were spectacular! It's a nice way to while away a morning or afternoon and is definitely one of Kanazawa's highlights.Pay at the kiosk at the entry to the park (There's no turn-style, so it's sort of on the honor system) and make your way around. (Go on-line for a good suggested tour of the garden). It makes for a nice stroll, looking at the ponds, lanterns, tea-house, statues, fountains, panoramic views, small waterfalls, etc. Kenrokuen is beautifully manicured and maintained. The day we we went, it was very busy with tourists and tour groups, lots of people hogging the scenery taking selfies and group shots, which spoils it slightly.  Afterwards, we visited the nearby tourist shops and castle."
Beautiful gardens,"We loved our morning in these hand manicured gardens, yes hand manicured! As we walked around we witnessed dozens of gardeners hand plucking weeds from the moss beds, raking leaves carefully away from a path.  We learned that when you approach the ponds full of Koi if you clap your hands the fish will come to you.We visited the gardens first then the castle, tickets can be purchased together.Truely a delightful place to visit."
Beautiful garden with lots to see--even in winter!,"Beautiful garden with lots to see--even in winter! Interesting how they protect everthing from the heavy winter snows. A nice, quiet relaxing place, even with a lot of tourists around. The place is huge. A wonderful Japanese-style (remove your shoes) cafe that really doesn't look like much from the outside, but once you're inside--wonderful. A limited menu, but not at all expensive, in my opinion--1200 Yen for lunch (around $12 US). A nice way to spend some after visiting Kanazawa Castle or Higashi Chaya district or both, as I did!"
Very inspiring garden,"The beautiful garden lives up to its name, even in winter. There was ice in many places, there were few visitors, and you could stroll for hours. Don't miss the Kasumigaike Pond. Every visitor stops here to take photographs."
Beautiful garden,"Came here after visiting the castle. It is beautiful even in the winter and the map and paths are very clear and easy to follow so you can easily find your way around and not miss anything. There are a few small shops in the garden for snacks and drinks and also two beautiful tea houses overlooking the two largest ponds, although only one was open when we visited. You can buy a ticket which includes entry to the castle and this garden for 500¥.Highly recommend including a visit here if you are planning a visit to Kanazawa."
The No.2 Garden in Japan,"Stunning Japanese Garden. The entrance looks not impressive but the garden layout, trees, bridges, water features etc were just stunning. I just wonder how the No. 1 Garden will be like. A huge garden can take you more than 1 hour to walk around. This garden is just beside the Kanazawa Castle. Many eateries nearby too."
Beautiful winter ,"Visiting in end Dec 2018, giving a different view of it. Quite cold due to the wind breeze.  Very nice winter ambiance. Ground was quite wet and little slippery in some spots."
Perfect spot for a lovely stroll,"Typically there is a charge to enter the gardens but if you go on a public holiday, it’s free! We visited Kanazawa in the winter (late dec/early jan) and the gardens is definitely a winner for a leisurely stroll. There’s plenty of little spots to see and the place looks pretty awesome in the winter time with snow covered trees (those which were not bamboo covered) and running streams.The park has a host of locations to stop for a photo or perhaps ask an importantly question to that someone special. The park can get quite icy in locations so make sure you watch your step, that and remember to take an umbrella everywhere you go in Kanazawa winter.Remember to try the gold leaf ice cream that you can get from places in and outside the park, it’ll usually cost you about $Y650."
Stunning,"Even on a miserable wet winter's day, this garden is stunning. If you do nothing else in Kanazawa visit this garden. Would love to visit in other seasons."
A very nice garden to visit!,It’s a beautiful garden with different trees and landscapes.  The kisaten cafe is recommended to visit too!  Myself and my partner stayed there for the morning and peace in mind!
Beautiful japanese garden,The garden is well maintained. It was winter so not much flower around but i was told it was beautiful during cherry blossom time. I hope to come back again during the cherry blossom.
Well worth the visit!,"The Kenrokuen Garden is beautiful and impressive.  Totally worth a stroll.  There are vendors near the entrance where you can purchase ice cream, beverages, and Souvenirs (even antique ceramics)."
wonderful park!!,"I didn't think I was going to get excited about a Japanese garden, but I absolutely loved this place. We walked through a few times, wandered all over, had ice cream, and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's really interesting to see the different types of trees, how they're supported, and everything else. Loved it!!"
