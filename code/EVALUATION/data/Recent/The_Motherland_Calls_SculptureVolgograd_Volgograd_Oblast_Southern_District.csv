Good but...,SHE’S NOT WEARING A BRA It was very nice if you did not look at her upper body (which was naked) I went there and it was hot but ice cream was not cheap around there.
Huge Statue,Overwhelming statue that looks over the city. It really is hard to miss. I even saw it from the train on the way in. Part of an impressive tribute to WW2.
Very Impressed even it has been under maintenance,"Requiring a bit of walking and steps up the hill where the sculpture is located.The ""Motherland Calls"" was under refurbishment when I visited earlier today. Yet, its still impressive, if not magnificent!Definitely a mistake in Stalingrad!"
Monumental sculpture,Situated in top of the hill dominating the city this is a sight to behold. Under restoration at the time of our visit but sympathetically clad in mesh scaffolding so view was not significantly obstructed
Must visit place,For me it's a prime location to visit in volgograd. Very beautiful sculpture. Very well maintained and we can see volgograd city from this place.
Absolutely must-see,"Stunning, huge and moving! Absolutely essential if in this part of the world. Free, very accessible and a suitable monument to commemorate those killed in the bloodiest battle in ?history."
There’s more to this place than a giant statur,"If you’ve come to Volgograd then of course you are coming here. She is an impressive sight to behold. However beneath this monument lies the final resting place of 35,000 people. Don’t walk on the grass in respect for the dead.Worth visiting/ 10"
Huge Statue,Very impressive. I believe it is the largest statue of a woman in the world. Can be seen from all around the city
Must to visit,"This gigantic monument was build more than 50 years ago but still takes your breath away with size, quality and is extremely impressive. Definitely the main sculpture in the city and is famous worldwide due to Stalingrad battle. Very touching place, full with glory and sadness..."
motherland,"The tip of her sword is 83 meters high. You'll see her as you approach the city, she stands above everything else. A must see sight in the city."
Incredible,The best I've seen among monuments. All the complex is really unbelievable. There is nothing that can be compared with this perfection. Totally recommended to visit.
A visit during the world cup 2018,A very good place to visit in Volgograd! The view is really amazing in the nature! Very recommend...
Mother Russia at her fiercest,"Must visit if you are in Russia.  The city of Stalingrad now called volgograd has seen the bloodiest battle in the history of mankind . It's a colossal statue on the banks of the Volga river urging the sons of Russia to rise and fight! She is an angry woman. Use the metro tram to get down at mamayev kurgan station.  There are 200 steps commemorating 200 days of the battle.  There are lot of other statues like the grieving mother ,the soldiers statues depicting the horrors of war . There is an eternal flame monument . Pay your respects to those who have fallen. Don't forget to visit the small church next to the statue. Stand beneath the statue gaze on to the Volga and get transported back in time where the German bombers were bombing on the red army soldiers crossing the river by boat."
Must Visit. Sobering. Stunning.,"This absolutely huge, defiant, female hill-top statue is a must-visit in Volgograd. Absolutely sums up the Russian defiance to the Nazis. There are the graves of famous combatants lining the route up the hill; at the base of the path is the tomb of the unknown soldier, memorials and The Eternal Flame. Furthermore, the views across the city and its decaying Soviet mega-factories, new World Cup stadium and the Volga river are awesome."
Her beauty stand,Volgograd has a very important history so as she the Motherland Calls. She is the highest sculpture I’ve seen in my life an she is remarkably beautiful. One thing you cannot miss if you are visiting the south.
Impressive statue on top of the hill,This huge statue higher than the statue of liberty was built to commemorate the battle of Stalingrad. Be prepared to climb many steps to reach the statue
A Rare Beauty!,"You will be awed by her size once you realize how big she is.  You will be struck by her beauty once you see her up close.  You will gaze upon her with wonder once you take in her message.  It is an extraordinary piece of art, that will move you like Picasso's Guernica."
Motherland’s calling!,"I wanted to see it with my own eyes. If you happen to be in Volgograd, go there before the sunset. So that you walk up the stairs and into the tomb with the eternal fire while it is still daylight and climb the hill to the monument when it is already dark. Levitan’s voice announcing the real information telegrams of the great patriotic war. And Levitan had to record again the  war news from the very  first day, from June, 22, 1941 as they destroyed all the tapes with his voice during the Great Patriotic War. And if it is possible please have a guide to tell you the details of this 200-days battle for the city and heroic acts and miracles of other citydefenders. Strongly recommended to see."
You must see this,We travelled from Moskau for one day to see this monument and it is wonderful! Its worth to go there and visit this historically important place. Absolutely magnificent and special.
Motherland statue and eternal flame,"Great visit to tis area including eternal flame and statue, beautifu church near statue as well, many other smaller statues paying tribute to heors of the battle of Stalingrad.  Must visit."
Simply breathtaking ,"Wonderful monument to the fallen very humbling, these Russians sure can do a monument, simply a must on your trip"
Most Impressive War Memorial ,I have been interested in the Battle of Stalingrad for quite a while and I had the opportunity visit with Sputnik Tours - Stalingrad Battlefield Tours. Visiting Motherland Calls was a part of our 3 day tour. I have been to many war memorials all around the world and this one is by far the most extensive and impressive.
Wow...Spectaculare...must see,"Totally amazing .....Motherland calls, Mamaev Kurgan, is 85 meters high of a woman who walks through with a raised sword. The statue is considered to represent an image of the motherland, calling upon his sons and daughters to tighten themselves and defend against the enemy. When the monument was built in 1967, it was the tallest statue in the world, today the highest statue of Europe measuring 85 meters from the top of the sword down to the sack. The cavern is about 2 meters and is full of concrete wells with 16 meters depth. The statue is about 52 meters and the sword is 33 meters. There were about 2,500 tons of iron and 5,500 tons of concrete in the work.The monument weighs over 8,000 tons, the sword itself weighs 14 tons.They had a lot of trouble with the sword, it was difficult to keep your hand holding this weight, the sword, but it also took a lot of wind and swung so much that the hand was about to tear off. They replaced the stainless titanium-plated steel for ordinary lighter steel in 1972. It is a great architectural achievement to solve this.Was renewed last year for 2 billion rubles, 28,811,773 dollarsThis is a must see......"
STALINGRAD WAR MEMORIAL,"The biggest cement statue in the world, Mamayev Hil (Mother Russia) is tall 82 mtRight walking up from the downtown barely two keys north.Staring on religious silent the human sacrifice into the Mamaya War Memorial, changing guards every hours"
Mighty Statue,Mighty Statue remembering the tragic moments of II world war and the patriottism of russians in defending their motherland ...Very touching statue and place.....
Must See,On the highest point of the city sits this tribute to the million or more who lost their lives in the battle. The statue and area around it are breathtaking and somber reminders of the past. Don’t miss it.
Majestic sculpture,"Towering over the town and a must visit attraction, we were not disappointed by what we saw. While there are other monuments and the eternal flame to see around the monument, there are limited facilities for food and rest in the vicinity. One should come by train as that gives the best views and is also most comfortable"
The hill with special vibes and this amazing statue,"This is the MUST GO, if you are staying in Volgograd. Take your time and walk to this sculpture from the main road. On your way is a hall of glory, where is nice to see the guard, when they are changing, I think that it is every hour, but I am not sure."
Stunning View .. and historic,You cant but help feel the energy as you walk in and around the park with the  Mother Africa statue ... and monument to fallen soldiers ... a definite tick job on the bucket list .....
Just the perfect palce,"Let me just say that this place is perfect. I visited it 3 or 4 times. Yes, because you should see how the statue looks in different day timings. I took a lot of amazing shots of the statue with my camera. You may do many things beside seeing the statue, of course you will pass by some other statues while going up there, but the most amazing thins is the green field around it. You can go there for a walk around the trees and stay for a while to enjoy a good weather. I stayed there to watch the sunset, seeing all the light reflections on the statue. I was lucky I went there on a cloudy day, so my photos looks just perfect. At night it looks wonderful too. Guess what?! This statue is tall enough and located in a very special place, that is why you can see it from everywhere in the city, while you are in the bus, driving your car, coming to the city by train, or taking a walk in a very far field. I was able to see it from a hill behind Volgograd University."
Impressive,Wish no war in world again.Impressive place that completely show the reality of Stalingrad Battle in WWII.one of my best and wonderful experiences that will never be forgotten and i still impressed.
Beautiful statue,Amazing statue that is a true reflection of the Russian battles against the Nazis during WW2. See the guard change and then see the very emotional eternal flame before reaching the statue itself.
Mamaev Kurgan,"Amazing place to visit, giving you a sense of awe and thanks to all those that sacrificed. The size of the motherland is calling sculpture doesn't do the soldiers feat of victory justice"
Stunning,"Stunning and mesmerising. For me, the monument of all. The Statue of Liberty, Corcovado, pale into insignificance compared to this. For the best reasons too.Superb and humbling."
Spectacular,"The highlight of Volgograd. Poignant, stunning, unforgettable.One doesn't realise how big she is until you've walked to the top, passing numerous sculptures and monuments on the way."
Impressive!!!!,This was a very impressive and historic monument.  I met some Russian students who spoke about this place with honor and pride and a huge sense of patriotism.  It represents a place where many people dies during the WWII.  A must see in a very small town!
Touching,"The Battle of Stalingrad has always fascinated me, and visiting Mamayev Kurgan was an opportunity that I would not pass up. I'll definitely come back with the kids when they are old enough to understand."
Volgograd FIFA World Cup 2018,Me and my friends visited this mountainous Really very nice place to visit it’s one of the popular place in Volgograd please don’t miss I am specially recommended
Great place,There's a lot of amazing sculptures to see here and it's all free. You can also see the eternal flame.
Great stop in Volgograd,The tram stops at the base of the park.  From there you walk through various statues and the flame on the way to where the Motherland Calls is.  The statue was much larger than I was expecting and was the highlight of my trip to Volgograd.  Most of the way there is via stairs but there is also a zig zag path near the top where you can take great photos.  The walk wasn't to bad since there were numerous stops on the way.  Try to plan your stop based on the light of the day.
Astonishing statue,The walk up to the statue is very nice and you can’t really grasp the magnitude until you come a bit closer. It is really huge and powerful and most definitely a must see when in Volgograd.
I think she is screaming,"Such an incredible statue, it is the symbol of this city in so many ways. She is calling the nation to defend its self against German aggression - but I think she is also screaming for the nation to come now! And screaming in anguish for the lost of life and property. Around 1.8 million people died in the Battle for Stalingrad and the statue was put up in the late 1950s when there had be 15 years of reflection on what the battle meant to Russia.What sacrifice, what pain, what anguish...what a people!"
awesome,the tallest stautue in the world. it felt goot to stand at its base and gaze over the volgograd area and the river
The Motherland Call ,"Great place and a very high monument, impressive architectural sculpture. I recommend anyone who will visit Volgograd city to go there. It is a must to be watched. There are many other monuments there also and small souvenirs shops and small markets for soft drinks and ice cream. Inside there is the eternal flame which is an important landmark to be visited as well. Entery is for free and for all ages."
Very massive,If you visit Volgograd you must visit the statue. You will not be dissapointed. Take your time and soak it all in. This is what russia is.
Must see if visiting Volgograd,This statue is situated on a hill where about 35.000 soldiers were killed during the battle of Stalingrad.  It is huge and all the surroundings are beautiful.  There is a beautiful church nearby worth visiting.  You will see this statue almost from everywhere in the city so you really can not miss it.  It is a prox 10min taxi drive from the centre of town.
Gigantic,"A must see in Volgograd. Such a huge statue, the biggest of a woman. The walk up to the monument is great. It is reachable from the center by bus or streetcar but we walked which is doable.The view from the monument is also impressive. One can really see how huge the land is."
A must see in Volgograd,"This is it, the single most memorable image of Volgograd. The hike up is long, but it's absolutely worth it. Once at the top, you're treated to a stunning view of the city and the Volga River."
Stunning,"A monument that you can see from practically anywhere in the city. At 82m high it is truly impressive and it’s amusing that one of the design criteria was that it had to be taller than the Statue of Liberty. From this summit it’s easy to see why it was so strategicly important during the Battle of Stalingrad and why there are 34,000 buried beneath the base. Definitely a must see"
World Cup 2018,WOW ... what a statue its ...MASSIVE...Very impressive and a very good tribute to the fallen ...Again Its Huge
Amazing huge structure.,"The work of sculptor Yevgeny Vuchetich and engineer Nikolai Nikitin is an 85 meter figure of a woman stepping forward with a raised sword. The statue is an allegorical image of the Motherland, which calls on its sons and daughters to repulse the enemy and continue their further offensive. It is massive and has a huge impact on first sighting. The place is very important as it is here that the Nazis were beaten by the Russians. An absolutely must visit."
It is perfect because...,"The lady is done percetly even when you look at her from distance of2 meters from all the sides inspite of her huge size. As if she is alive and her dress is absolutely real. Who made this masterpiece? Gods? No, Soviet sculpter Vuchetich and his team. The most amazing who was his consultant. It was a man who went under death in Stalingrad for many days, that man invented a hoover which sucked up hundreds of thousands enemy lives. And as you know the enemy was the strongest and braviest army in the world for that moment and didn't hear word ""to lose"". Now you can understand why the sculpture and the whole memorial are so great because it was cteated by people who knew what Stalingrad is !!!"
Heroic!,Must-visit place in Volgograd and even Russia. The museum and the statue and the memorials all recall us about the bloodliest and most heroic resistance in modern history!
THE GRAND,The whole monument is absolutely STUNNING... It is THE art piece to see if you are travelling to the Russian Federation. The goose bumps will cover your skin when you see her glory and power.
The must-see sight in Volgograd. Hugely impressive,Although it can be viewed from a distance it really is worth getting close up to see the immensity of this statue.
Awe inspiring,"If you wish to understand the sacrifice the Soviet people made in World War 2, visit Mamaev Kurgan; it is highly moving, a fitting tribute to the victory over fascism. Volgograd is the true heart of Russia, in my humble opinion- do visit, but show appropriate respect."
Must visit ,It’s overwhelmingly impressive and you have to check out the whole memorial complex where the names of soldiers killed during the battles of Stalingrad are listed. Too many to count
Another place I waited my life to visit,"Majestic, somber and amazing! Mamayev Kurgan a great symbol of solidarity and resolution of a country to defeat an invading force. A great tribute to the fallen and their families and loved ones.My visit was a highlight in my life, the place is accesible by public transport, either bus or tram, entrance is free. There are people selling red flowers at the entrance for offerings, I bought one. The change of guard of honor is also majestic. The last one is at 17:00 hrs with the removal of the guard for the night."
This a Must See.,"We visited Volgograd specifically to see the Panorama Museum, and the memorial complex which includes The Motherland Calls. There are many amazing things to see in the world, but she is high on the list!  We had perfect weather the day that we went. I was moved by the entire complex, dedicated to the victory of the Battle of Stalingrad. It is best to start from the street, near the Volga river, and climb up through the memorial. The entire complex is a fitting tribute to the historic battle, and evokes many feelings on the way up to Mamayev Hill. The whole area is dominated by the 256 foot statue of The Motherland. She is beautiful, and riveting, and strong.  The day that we were there, ""climbers"" were visible among her skirts on the back side.  The guide informed us that these were specialists checking her for damage.  Next year, after the World Cup, she will be covered with scaffolding for repairs. See her while you can! She is worth it!"
Excellent views,"It should be the first visit to this city. If you  go before the sunset, better. You can get it by taxi, less than 200 rubles, or by ""tranvía"", cheaper and with local taste."
Amazing memorial park,"One of the best memorial parks I have ever been to. The sculptures, monuments, etc are well done and reverent."
Amazing piece of art!,"Bombastic show of Russian patriotism. For us foreign travellers, it's a nice spot to spend a day. The place is very easy to reach from city centre by underground tram."
Huge and impressive.,"The Mamajev mother-sculpture stands on one of the last strong holds of the Stalingrad-fight. It's a part of a complex, including the eternal flame and the grave of general Georgy Zhukov, who explicit wanted to be burried here, together with the thousands of brave soldiers, lost here. Very interesting place."
The mother of all statues,"Great at night, she looks so different from the various angles and you really get a sense of the vastness of Russia when you are humbled at her feet."
Breathtaking,"Just go there and the emotions you get there (if you know the history) are simply explainable...My wife was crying there. Some friends said you should visit at night, when there are not so many tourists."
No words needed.,"Go there as soon as possible! The statue and the area is magnificent and mind blowing. You will never see something like this again. Just be aware that they are planning a huge reconstruction and the statue will soon be covered up. When, it uncertain, so update yourself on Instagram to check out the latest post so you wont go there and its all covered up."
Great place to see,Great place to see for anyone. But nowhere signs for the tourists for places to get food and drinks and restroom areas. Road to Mamaev Hill needed a lots of repairs.
The main attraction in town,"This gigantic statue is off to the north of centre and is easily reached by tramway. The visitor would ascend several hundred steps through tree lined pathways and ponds, with some sombre music and occasion sounds of gun fire, to eventually come to the eternal flame and ascend the circular ramp to the foot of the statue. There are visitors throughout the day but early morning would provide the best light. There are souvenir stalls around, Stalin museum to the right hand side of the statue and a cafe. Changing of the guards hourly at the eternal flame until the last one at around 18.50."
Monumental scale to fit the scope of why the statue exists,"Like other reviewers it is surprising how much time you take.  Easy cab ride to top or better yet a short metro from downtown to get there but then 300 steps.  If you do the cab to top then do walk down at least as there is alot more to see on the steps up.  You can't walk right to it, it is taped off about 10 meters back."
The scale of this monument is phenomenal,"I never thought I would spend four hours at a war memorial, or take so many photographs. From the foot of the first short flight of steps the statue looks tiny. 200 steps higher, she looks large... but it is only when you stand at her feet that you realise her full height.The access path crosses both a tramline and a main railway line which are invisible from the top. The new (unfinished) football stadium looks small from the top of the hill.But this place is not just about size. The many monumental statues on the way up.  The mirror pool with its two fifty metre (my guess) walls one to the left (with a lengthy inscription) and one facing you which caused me to reflect (as well as admire the reflections)  on the futility of the death and destruction embodied in the two 'cliffs' covered in bas relief scenes of battle and death we had just walked between (as well as admire the reflections). The circular memorial 'chapel' with an eternal flame to the unknown soldier (flanked all day by two soldiers) and the names of thousands of dead fighters inscribed on  vast mosaic panels - connecting the monuments to the actual men).What a powerful experience.PS. I was surprised that there was no guide book in English."
"Beautiful Statue, Beautiful Park.Must See.","We arrived here by under ground team and the stop is right opposite,which is handy. Excellent park with some beautiful statues, history and atmosphere. It's a free place to walk around, which is great, allow a coup!e of hours to walk round and the highlight for us was the eternal flame, beautiful.We went twice to be honest because we enjoyed it that much. Very clean, very safe and a must see on a visit to the lovely city of Volgograd.Nicky and Spencer ,Birmingham ,UK"
Must-see place.,"It is the tallest statue in Europe and the tallest statue of a woman in the world, not including pedestals. Absolutely amazing place!"
Big Mama,"I am not a big friend of Soviet styled monuments but I have to say here I really enjoyed. I visited there after the Finnish actor Ville Haapasalo had recommended it. Oh My God It is Big! It can be bought some Stalingrad souvenirs in the kiosk nearby but not the poster of Josef Stalin, unfortunately."
Must see ,This statue overlooking the city of Volgograd is overwhelming and impressive. Nice walk towards it and between the green. All visitors should see and remember the horror of war.
An amazingly impressive sculpture,"Visible from the whole city, feels ""in motion"", represents appropriately the constant reminder of the scale of the Stalingrad sacrifice"
If you the history buff its must place to visit.,"Always was fascinated, World war II history especially.    Stalingrad was one of the turning points of this war.  About 2 million people died in Stalingrad.  Mamaev Kurgan(hill)  was very important place to capture for both sides and many solders died her.  May be a Hundred thousand!!   On one hill!  You can spent here hours walking, there is little museum, you can hire guide,  or just spent time along try to see military pices, monuments, graves, look toward river Volga and imagine famous sniper Zaitsev with his friends laying in ambush waiting for Nazi officers to appear."
Must See,Having been many times. This is a must see place in Волгоград. Will provide many strong images of the war experience.
Incredibly impressive,This is an epic statue on top of a hill with a sweeping view over Volgograd. Its size is staggering. This is a must-visit attraction.
The most incredible thing I've ever seen,"The Motherland calls is the last of the monuments you find on Mamaev Kurgan. Everything I had read about it was not enough to prepare me for its size, its grandness, its unbelievable expression. When it was built, back in '67, it was the largest statue in the world. Today it's the third, right behind the Statue of Liberty in NY, only two meters shorter... It is MAGNIFICENT. Like I said, the most incredible thing I've seen. Of course, I'm sure if you're in Volgograd you will not miss this amazing memorial. I still get tears in my eyes when I think about it."
Epic!! Incredible!!!,One of the most incredible monuments ever seen!!! It is definitely worth the trip to this historical city. Highly recommend!!!
Must see the Hero Hall,"If your in the area then you have got to come and see this. This immense statue in commemoration of the battle of Stalingrad is very impressive, but even more fascinating is the Hero Hall next to it with its eternal flame. The changing of the guards is something worth watching in here and you cannot help but to feel solemn when in this building with the eerie music playing."
The Most Incredible Thing I've Ever Seen,"I've been a lot of places around the world, and by far, this is the most incredible thing I've ever seen. No matter how many pictures you see, nothing prepares you for the size of this statue. It will make your jaw drop. It a must-see for Volgograd. It's in a good location, probably about forty-five minute walk from downtown. When you're on the hill, and you think about how many Russian people died in the Battle of Stalingrad, and you see that statue, it's an experience that few things can match."
Spectacular,The centrepiece of the WWII memorial to the fallen at Stalingrad. Quite simply awesome.  I note that this statue will form the backdrop to the new football stadium being built for the 2020 world cup.  Assuming Russia play at the stadium during the games then suspect that this statue will certainly increase patriotic endeavour whilst at the same time intimidating the opposition.
Biggest sculpture of a human in the world!,"Very beautiful and touching sculpture, the whole walk up to it is very well done and stunning! Great to learn about the history and russian culture."
Short spectaculair visit,Short spectaculair visit but not wel lighted area.. so best to visit during daytime. Also outside and windy so decent coat is desirable at wintertime
Mamaev Kurgan so called in Russian,It's a good place to see the history and pride of Russians of their victory in war against Germany.Don't forgot to bring a jacket when you go up there.
Volga region tour,"The Statue is remarkable.  The parkway, grave of the unknowns, and the view from the parkway was awesome."
Impressive Motherland Statute,"The size, scale and history regarding this statute and the hill on which the statute resides is fascinating. We had an English speaking guide who told us about the strategic location of the hill during the battle of Stalingrad, the mass grave that the statute is on and we were able to witness the changing of the guard. Do watch your step - the ground is uneven, the stairs are not all the same and it is quite a long walk."
The surprise you never knew of.,"If your in the area this is one you can not miss. This overlooks the city and stands out on the city skyline. Arrive in the early morning and enjoy the walk, lots of steps. Best if you know a bit of Russian. Upon completion this WAS the largest statue in the world, about twice the size of the Statue of Liberty.  Research online to get an overview."
Great monument for World War II,It is a great monument that was construsted after the II World War on a place where the Hitler's army got a first hard figth and loose it. It is a hardest pleace for every Post-Soviet Man.
Impressive Russian Memorial,"Not only the height of this statue, also the remarkable stories of the fight which took place at Stalingrad during the second world war impresses your imagination. If you visit this site I advise to use a guide who is able to explain you all the details."
It is tremendous,"It is worth seeing in any case!We become full of pride for our country and heroism of our people.Bring your children there, they should know the history"
Also see her at night!,Darkness comes around 9pm in the summer and it was good to see her under lights.  My day visit was when the pond had been emptied for maintenance.
Nice Learning Place,"It is because my sister  graduation, My Sister Bring me to here, Here really is a good place, and see all view Volgograd. On Here, I learn a lot of History for Volgograd ."
You have to,"Just go and look, how can you miss it? It is build in a circular so you see everything. It is hard to walk and very steep steps, older or trouble walking...just take it slow."
Amazing Once In a Lifetime,"I have written over 180 reviews and believe in the power of feedback. I hope you find my review helpful.For anyone ever interested in WW2 history, this is a must-do. The sculpture sits on Mamayev Kurgan hill along with dozens of other monuments plus the eternal flame. By far, an incredible experience. You may even get to see the changing of the guards at the eternal flame. Inspiring. 2 million casualties in 5 months makes this a sacred site. I was honored to have visited it.January is too cold. Better pick a warmer month."
"I loved it here, it can be very cold on the top",Amazing place. The statue is impressive when you see it up close. It used to be possible to climb up there but I don't think it was the case when I was here last November (2015). The gardens around it are wonderful for a relaxing walk. Close to one of the memorial sites there are no buildings in between you and the fields around so it can be very cold up there but coming back down it's just fine (I did find it strange while climbing up that I felt quite hot and Russians seemed cold but then I understood why x-) ).
KURGAN IS THE #1 PLACE TO GO IN VOLGOGRAD,This hill changed hands so many time in the Battle of Stalingrad that even historians still debate the number of times. Even when the Germans captured 90% of the city- Russians still fought on the slopes here for months. It is an amazing view and also an incredibly solemn experience.
Compulsive viewing but a sombre slice of history,"The ""Motherland Calls"" statue, also known as the Mamayev Monument, commemorates the Battle of Stalingrad, one of the bloodiest battles of WW2. Leading up to the statue  there are 200 steps which symbolise the 200 days of battle. It's a good idea to wear comfortable walking shoes and to be reasonably physically fit if you want to climb to the top! If you prefer, you can get a shuttle bus which takes you around the back of the park and deposits you at the top so you can walk down. The view from the top is panoramic. If one knows the history, the  three-dimensional figures of soldiers which are carved into the rockface make for sombre viewing. We were lucky enough to witness the changing of the guard in the Hall of Remembrance. We learned much about the history from our tour guide and would recommend that the best way of looking at this monument is on an organised tour as they take you there by bus and give you the option of either walking up or walking down! Our tour was organised by the staff of our Vodohod river cruise."
Outstanding Monument.,"The statue of Mother Russia is the world's tallest free standing statue. It's so majestic, yet so tranquil."
The top sight in town,Everyone going to Volgograd absolutely has to visit this monument. If you don't you will have missed out. The Great War is a huge part of this city's and even this country's identity and Mamaev Kurgan is probably the most important and well known monument to the war Int the whole of Russia.
Amazing,"Absolutely do not miss this moving, jaw dropping site. You can walk from the centre of town but it's a bit of a schlep and the pavements aren't always foot friendly. The tram cost 20 roubles a ride and is a bargain. - stops right outside. The site is free to access although for a fee you can hire a guide. This may appeal of you don't know the history of this hill and the Great Patriotic War, although if you don't then I doubt you'd be here.... There are souvenir stands dotted about but no guide books in English and no English spoken, so be prepared. If you are fortunate you can see the guards change in the hall of remembrance which is very impressive. All in all, this will not disappoint."
has to be done,"quite impressive. not located in the center, easier to access by car than by walk, though offering an unique view."
Magnificent and massive,Centre piece to Volgograd. Jaw dropping in size even when you are far away. Great pictures to be taken especially at twilight with a summer evening sky. Mother Russia does look stunning on that hill. Not bad view from top with views of city and river.
Stunning!!!!!!,"Mind blowing, jaw-dropping. It dominates the horizon and I personally couldn't stop looking at it. To me it is beautiful...and huge (274ft). We visited here three times; the first day was cloudy so we returned the following evening for sunset/night shots and then the following day for photos in the sun....I took a lot of photos. If you visit here no doubt you will too."
Left speechless,"When I came to Volgograd I thought that statue stands alone on the hill. I was quite surprised to see that there is a whole memorial site on the hill. You have this very special feeling while walking through the memorial site. It is difficult to describe it, but it is very emotional.. It is really worth seeing. And the statue itself is the most impressive statue I've ever seen in my life."
Very impressive,"We could park in front of the park where the statue is located. We went all the way up, a twenty minute walk. Lots of things to see in the park."
"Stunning, dominating, overwhelming","Although it is the statue itself that is world-famous, it is part of a huge and well-designed memorial. Spend a couple of hours there, wonder around, see the changing of the guards, and try to see if you can actually take in the enormity of what it all stands for."
"Iconic statue of the woman, representing the Homeland !!","The main and the most significative part of the Mamayev Kurgan or Hill, in my opinion, is for sure this colossal sculpture of the mother - woman, who calls her compatriots to come and join in the decisive great battle for Stalingrad in autumn 1943.As I was standing there and looking at that masterpiece of engineering skill, I realized that nothing else in this memorial place, near the mighty river Volga, would have presented better one prowess of one great people, than this 91 meters high figure.It is a really characteristic posture with a sword raised high in the right hand and the left hand extended in a calling gesture.Also great combination of one conception of the sculptor Yevgeny Vuchetich and structural engineer Nikolai Nikitin."
"Many thoughts had gone thru my mind, while I was there.","As soon as you make you first step - you start to feel something.There is some invisible power there. You sea the statue and you feel how it gets bigger and bigger with every step you make. But you dont feel the statue as a sculpture or monument. That is in the air what you feel. It is not a stone or a concrete. It is history and people, it is pain and relief, it is life and death. You will know it and you will feel it."
Want You!,"In America, there was Yankee 'Want You!' poster which one guy points his finger to the front. In Russia, there was the same kind of poster which one woman in red dress. It's written 'Rodina Matzi Zavyot!' - 'Motherland calls you!'. During 2nd World War, this poster was the most popular one in Russia (USSR). From Eternal Flame to this statue, gently sloped road makes easy for everybody to approach. Volgograd was Stalingrad. Stalin style architectures and buildings are in this city."
nice one to see,its awsome sculpture made in ussr very nice to see but be aware from racist and skinheads all peoples are very nice good cultured  nice one one advice if these is football match in city dont go there otherwise all is excellent
Important history of the second world war,"Very impressive statue on the high ground, mother Russia calling for battle to save the motherland. Russia and Volgograd remembers its history; the struggle and the sacrifices of the people of Stalingrad and the red army."
glory,"This monument is hard to be reviewed. You must visit and see, have to learn about the battles that were fought, the loses and sufferings,  to understand and appreciate it."
Impressive version of the Motherland,"A huge monument! 87 meters tall and you can see her from many locations in Volgograd. The Motherland sculptures are located several places in the old Sovjet, celebrating the people that participated in the ""Great Patriotic War"". This one is my favourite. There is also some quite impressive sculptures near the statue, and especially those carved into the tunnel walls, just below the statue itself. A museum is also in this area, with some memories, military equipment and a full scale ""Mil Mi-24 Hind"" helicopter. You have to pay a small fee into this museum, but it´s well worth it!"
Simply great,The best sculpture I've ever seen in my life. The strenght of the 'call' is so strong that blows you away. Perfect. Just the sculpture is worth to buy a plane ticket to see her.
Awe Inspiring,What a wonderful tribute to the people of Russia who suffered so much during the Great Patriotic War.
AMAZING,"It's a MUST!You cannot be in Volgograd without seeing this immense statue, It's soooo deeply impressive and touching...It's an open air memorial site and can be visited for free, but better with a guide who explains the meaning of all the scenereies"
See it before it falls over,"This sculpture is huge. I had wanted to see it ever since I became aware of its existence and had the good fortune to have the opportunity. Not disappointed. Apparently held upright only by its own weight, I suspect the day will come when I will read about the inevitability of gravity in the newspapers - so glad I have seen it while it is still vertical."
Visitor,Awe inspiring to visit. Absolutely astonishing the effort that must have been put in to building this
Poignant yet spectacular,"The statue and the memorial complex leading to it is probably the number 1 reason to visit Volgograd. The entire area is kept clean and well maintained with pride, and is a sobering experience until you get to the foot of the statue and realise just how big it is. Watch the changing of the guard whilst you are there, and if you can, observe the statue at night"
Amazing momument and parc. Very impressive,Feel the history. I didn't expect Volgograd was Staligrad. The second world war history is beyond words. The Russians still honor the soldiers in a beautiful way.
Beautiful walk up to the Statue,Definitely worth walking up the steps to go see the motherland calls sculpture.  The views from the top are amazing.  On a clear day you get to see 360 degree views of Volgograd.
The biggest statue to the biggest battle!,"This statue is the worlds biggest, and is ontop of mamaev kurgan hill. This is the biggest monument here after the battle of stalingrad. You can easaly walk up here thru all the Others monuments and there is no entrance fee. On top you can have the best view over the city of Volgograd."
