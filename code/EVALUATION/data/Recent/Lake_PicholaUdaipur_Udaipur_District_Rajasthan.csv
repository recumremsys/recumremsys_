Udaipur - The city of Lakes .. Must visit place in Rajasthan,"This visit was done in Oct'2019 . This was a 2 day visit to Udaipur from New Delhi . I was accompanied by my kid and wife . If you are staying in Delhi you can reach Udaipur with one night travel by Indian Railways . Important ::This is a small tourist destination in Rajasthan -India .. The city sleeps soon after sunset ..Hence you need plan your travel accordingly so that you can finish most of your itinerary by afternoonWe reached Udaipur early morning I got a complimentary stay and food .. Thanks to one of my office friends .. and we were booked for Hotel Udaigarh.  It is budget friendly and on the bank of Lake Pichola … The Best part of this Hotel is this is a converted Haveli ( Earlier King's Mansion) and you will really fill the difference . We got our check in done well advance of time .  We had breakfast and went out to explore the city . One important tip - If you are staying in this property , please do not reserve any cab or Auto for Local sightseeing . Evertything is in walkable distance.The 1st place to visit is Jagdish Temple - It comes within 50 metre from the Property . After a short visit to the temple you should proceed to City Palace . Purchase your ticket  Hire a guide for a significant visit . The tour to city palace will take you at least 2 hours to complete . Once you are done with city Palace , take a lunch break and then proceed for Boating at Lake Pichola ...Amazing  view of the city from middle of the lake Please reach out for any assistance"
Beautiful,"The lake has a great sunset view in the evening. It is a paradise for the photographers and you can see all of them there. Though, lake can be visited from many sides. There are restaurants available near the lake sides offering food and beverage. Other facilities like boat rides etc are also available."
Placid & pleasant,"We enjoyed the morning boat ride on the picturesque lake, as it was calm and quiet. Lake Pichola is an artificial lake, flanked by islands, palaces, temples, mansions, ghats and restaurants. We cruised by the City Palace which looks enormous & appealing. We continued and passed by Jag Niwas, home to Lake Palace which is now converted into a heritage hotel, and then Jag Mandir, home to the famous Lake Garden Palace. Aside from just sightseeing, it was interesting to see people doing their daily chores along the edge of the lake, such as washing clothes, cleaning and bathing."
Day or Night......... Beautiful,This beautiful lake has many moods and colours. It is best appreciated from a boat on the water so you can see the Palaces and unusual buildings all around the lake.
Best place to change your mood,This place is best in terms of view and calmness. And best place to do adventurous things. This place is very much photogenic. Whatever you click it looks different every time you click.
Beautiful especially sunset time.,Very scenic. It's little more for evening trip bout worth it.Stop at I am JalMahal and garden around that was beautiful.
It's a lake,"Lake Pichola is a lake with a number of posh hotels built around it.  Access to our hotel was by boat which was a pleasant trip with nice views.  Boat trips are always a good way to see an area from a different perspective but, all said and done, a lake is a lake."
Group visit,Extremely windy when we were here.Large queue for the boat.Life jackets suppliedThis is a manmade lake with a hotel in the centre.The sail took you round part of the Lake where there are large hotels and near the lake hotel.Quite choppy and a few got wet.We got off at a…
Sunset Cruise Highlight,"When you are in Udaipur you will be doing a cruise of the lake - it goes without saying.  But make sure it's a sunset cruise - truly glorious.  We hadn't booked, just wandered down to the boat jetty and asked - told to wait and see if there were any spots available and we lucked…"
Very cozy lake,"Take a tour at sundown, best of private and simply enjoy the serenity and tranquility an the view on all the old and new luxury buildings. A really pleasant way to see the sun set."
Very tranquil spot,"A beautiful place particularly at sunset when all looks so serene and peaceful. The views of the sunset are from the rooftop restaurant, The Swan of Hotel Udaigarh and others from one of the ghats."
Pichola.....,"The palaces in the lake Pichola are very beautiful. The boat ride costs varies on how u want to see the palaces, if you take costlier ones that much near you will be allowed."
Beautiful,Nice lake in udaipur. We enjoyed walking around the lake and watch the beautiful sunsets. There was options to do boat trips but we didn't.
Really nice experience ,"A must visit if you are in town. It's would be better if you rent a personal boat. Because it would be nice if there will be you and your family or friends. You can see all spots like Taj Hotel, Udai Villas and all movie shooting places. It's important that you go there early in…"
Nice,We visited here n did boating it costs 300 per head.nicevlake.Jalmahal was built inside the lake.city Mahal also beside of the lake.
Udaipur is the “Venice of India.”,Stroll by the lake shore in Udaipur or take a tuk tuk around the lake... you won’t be disappointed. Sunsets over the lake are stunning. 
Great photos at this spot,"Lake Pichola  is a beautiful spot to get a good view around the lake of the hills and landscape.  Yes,  it’s quite touristy with boats and photo stalls, it looked busy, but you can just pass by here at the right time of day and take some excellent photos. If you can ignore the…"
Wow,Jetty ride was awesome from leela to shore. Water is OK with lots of ducks. Breeze from lake makes you fresh and soothe you
Best views during any times of the day,"The lake looks equally beautiful from any ghats and during any time of the day. However according to be the views from western ghat will be the best as you can see city palace, lake palace, jagmandir palace all in a glance. Do not miss sunset over lake pichola."
Recommend time to go ; Evening ,Evening time is good to watch sunset.. and take a walk.. also you can go for boating... there are two gates for entry 
Pichola,Smooth quiet and therefore beautiful this lake is and it holds the breath of this city ❤️ Best time is the evening time when sun is about to go down (sunset)
Beautiful Experience!,"Boat Ride is a “must-do” As you take a ride on the lake, you will see beautiful palaces and hotels boasting Royal Rajasthani architecture against the backdrop of hills surrounding the city. We took a private ride organised by our hotel (trident); we enjoyed the sunset. It was a…"
Filthy at it's best,"What a let down ! Filthy surroundings, bad roads, no public toilet in & around, old boats. This lake is best visited at night when you can't see all this around you & the distant lights on the fort, hotels, etc make the ride just about average. Very disappointed."
Beautiful artificial lake,"Situated in Udaipur city, this is an artificial fresh water lake. The lakes around Udaipur were primarily created by building dams to meet the drinking water and irrigation needs of the city and its neighborhood. Best time to visit October - January. Enjoy the boat ride and…"
Beautiful lake ,Visited pichola lake and we did boat ride there view of palace and lake palace was great beautiful sun set over all great experience.
Udaipur visit,"We recently stayed at Udaipur for a family wedding. We initially stayed in the hilltop palace hotel , organised by our travel agent globetrotter holidays .  We witnessed the best sunset over lake fateh sagar on our first night. Also attended a great guided tour of  city palace,…"
Beautiful lake,Beautiful lake with some excellent views of the city. We experienced a memorable boat ride in the lake.
"If you aren’t staying on the lake at one of the hotels, be sure to take a boat ride on the lake",The story of the man made lakes in Udaipur is crazy. Lake Pichola was apparently dug by hand in the 13th century so all dug by hand. There is now an amazing network of lakes that all feed into one another and are fed by the monsoonal rains. This is a city with no water problems we were told.We stayed in a hotel on the lake and so aught a private boat to and from the hotel across the lake every day which was a real treat.  M
Definitely India’s Venice ,"Lovely area to watch the sunset. Don’t get sucked into a paying extra for a sunset cruise as it docks before sunset, which can be viewed from the shore. Cruise is worth it though."
Excellent,"Very good hotel... amazing view of the lake... staff there are very nice, when checking out they kept our luggage whole day safely... will surely recommend the hotel but will not recommend the spa.. the lady took appointment but did not keep her word... she kept me waitinf for 2 hours which was a waste of time and never showed up... the rest amazing"
Lake pichola at udaipur,Lake pichola right next to the beautiful palace. Took a boat ride sunset time. Reminded us of Venice. Beautiful place. Stopped by the hotel for a coffee. Very neat. Amazing time we had
beautiful,One of the most beautiful lake. One should do the boat ride when you are in Udaipur. It is visible mostly from all the iconic places of Udaipur. Located in the heart of City. Must do boating from lake palace so thay they will take you to jagmandir too. You can see Taj hotel situated in the middle of the lake.
Beautiful!,If you are visiting City palace then you will see this lake on the way. It surrounds the palace and the views are nice during the night time.
Great Views,The boat ride on the lake was a perfect addition to our tour of Udaipur.  Stopping on the island and relaxing with a cup of tea was ideal.  I can't imagine visiting Udaipur and not going on a boat tour of the lake.
What a place to get Udaipur pics!,"Lake Pichola is beautiful from the shore and after the September monsoon the water level is high. The water is 95ft above the level of the Sukadihya garden and it provides the water pressure for the fountains. You can get a boat from both ends of the Palace. To the North end near the Dharohar folk dance theatre the ferry just does a trip around the lake for 25 mins. If you go from South end near Shriv temple, then the ferry goes around the lake but you can get off at the Jagmandir Hotel on the island and have a walk around the gardens. Then go back on the next ferry. Ferries leave from 10.00 on the hour, and you should sit on the RHS to get the best view. Tickets cost Rs500 before 14.00 and Rs800 after that. Worth doing!"
Trip Around the Lake,We went for a boat trip around the lake from our hotel. Lovely short trip of about an hour including a stop at the island palace in the middle of the lake. Very good and worthwhile.
Worth for the sunset,"One of the beautiful lake which you can visit for watching the Sunset while boating, makes more pretty with its surrounding. Don't forget to go for boating, a beautiful experience."
Re-Live Octopussy,"The previous evening we had dinner at O'Zen restaurant which played the movie Octopussy while we ate.  The following morning, we bought the garden palace ticket for 30 rupee ( foreigner cost).  After walking around the grounds a bit, we encountered the boat house selling tickets for a charge of 500 rp.  The boat stopped at Jagmandir island which was used in filming the movie.  Also got the water side view of Bond's hotel.  Enjoyed the trip with one exception.  The boat left the island with us still ashore.  Although not a major set back as we were able to get a ride on another boat to the boat house.  The boat trip helps bring the movie to life.  Well worth the fees."
Trip,"Situated near city palace, having jag mandir in its center. Boating is the main centre of attraction."
Part of a Wendy Wu tour.,An excellent cruise with a stopover on the island for refreshments. The boat staff were very helpful and we really enjoyed the experience.
Lovely spot but .. ,"We went on a sunset cruise that retuned to the dock before the actual sunset. The captain drove the boat very slowly to kill time. We never got faster than a put put. The views are beautiful though, with the water and the mountains, and a great departure from the hustle & bustle everywhere else in India. Worth doing, but be sure you time it correctly!"
Absolutely beautiful ,Most of the places around are facing Lake Pichola and it’s a gorgeous view altogether. Cruising along the lake would also be gorgeous and the sun set over the lake is a view you should catch at least once on your trip. Lake Pichola is one of the most beautiful tourist attractions in the city.
Ok,If you go at sunrise or sunset from a good position then it is worthy to be here to see the view.Well the lake is very dirty when u see it from near.
Lake pichola,"Limpid and large, Lake Pichola reflects the cool grey-blue mountains on its rippling mirror-like surface. Located in the heart of the city, Pichola Lake is the oldest and one of the largest lakes of Udaipur. Pichola Lake is enveloped by lofty Palaces, temples, bathing ghats and elevated hills on all its sides. At the time of sunset, a boat ride in this lake is sufficient to enthrall anyone. This lake is, indeed, amongst the top beautiful places in India."
The Romantic Lake of Udaipur,This Lake is at the back side of the City PalaceThis lake is famous for many reasons.Taj Lake Palace is on this lake only and other is the spot which is called Jag Mandir which was built by the Maharaja for his wifes. You can easily access to their from Didh Talai and they have got boat service in every 1 hr.
The best one can get.,"During my Udaipur visit with my family recently, I must say that lake pichola is one of the best sightseeing option."
Beautiful,This is what Udaipur is all about. The lake is central to everything and is so beautiful. Make sure to get accommodation close or at least eat on on of the many rooftop cafe's around the lake. Sunrise and Sunset are well worth it. Such a beautiful and relaxing place
Beautiful ,"All scenic and amazingly beautiful lake... best part, the lake is still v clean n does not smell... do go for the ferry ride."
Nice picturesque Lake,"Nearer to City palace, you can spend good time with family and friendsYou can go boating with speed boating as well as group boating, best is your can go walking in the evening with family and friends"
Awesome,"We visited Agra,Jaipur,Udaipur,Delhi with my family (wife and 2 kids) in Christmas 2019 holidays and so visited this attraction during our stay in Udaipur.Lake Pichola is so clean and the boat ride is very memorable though it was expensive.Boat rides are hourly based and last ride is at 5pm."
Sunset Boat Ride at Lake Pichola,". After a tiring but interesting tour of the City Palace which obviously is a must visit as well, I headed out with my family for a relaxing boat time on Lake Pichola. We opted for the Sunset Boat ride having heard about the mesmerizing views when dusk falls though it is heavier on pocket. After purchasing our tickets and wearing life jackets which by the way is mandatory, we set off around half past 5 for the ride.It’s all about soaking in the moment and the beautiful sights. City Palace being the starting point, it was a different experience watching the palace stand majestically amidst the water and becomes even more charming when the lights turn on in the night.Jag Mandir is a pit stop for the boat ride. One can get down to spend time at this palace built on an island and is also known as the ‘Lake Garden’ palace. Most of the space is converted into a hotel but the visitors get a chance to enjoy the garden area which is well managed as well as experience the palace band ceremony. Not to forget the beautiful views again from this Island.Some of the other Palace’s were converted over as heritage hotels such as Taj while there are also other brands like the Leela hotels which have setup a beautiful island property for people to stay in.Other famous spots that one can come across on the ride are the ghats. Gangaur Ghat near the Bagore Ki Haveli was clearly a winner.But what we were mostly looking forward too was the sunset which did not work out. The Sun took its own time to set and perhaps we should have taken the last boat which could have given us that perfect ending to a beautiful day but by the time our ride came to an end, it was still bright, and so were the clouds that kept hiding the sun from us as well.Nevertheless, the entire experience was just wonderful. Take out your camera’s and you will end up capturing some splendid moments"
Paisa Wasool - Boat Ride - MusT to VisiT,"One boat ride will give you a lot of scenic beauty. We opted for a group boat ride. The only point to remember is - be first in queue or wait for the next ride to get the best seat. The boat covers many historic points and fully worth to the price paid. The only thing I did not like was the ""Maggi @ Rs 50"" lol.  Take a lot of pics and keep a close eye on the kids.Many of us don't take the life jacket seriously, I think we all should wear it to keep us safe. And last thing, after this ride, you can visit ropeway experience available other side of the boating. We paid Rs 50 for the entire Auto. Happy travelling."
Luxury boat ride...,"We went to Lake Pichola one afternoon, scenic lake, possibly one of the most beautiful lakes in India, visible from City Palace, a must visit if you are in Udaipur. We weren't fortunate enough to stay at the Taj situated in the middle of the lake so did probably the next best thing, we took a 30 minute boat ride, there were options for a boat with 30 passengers and another one with 10 passengers, second boat being more expensive but totally worth it. Gave us opportunity to take dozens of pictures and also enjoy the scenery.There is also an option to take a boat from City Palace to lake pichola, which takes passengers to Jag Mandir another island in the middle of the lake and there is a expensive restaurant there if one wishes to enjoy food, we didn't take that option.We took a 5-10 minute rikshaw ride from City Palace to Lake Pichola, there are photographers with traditional wares on the lake, we decided to get my daughters dressed up and took some pictures, good idea to get it done before the boat ride as the pictures were ready by the time we got back from the boat ride."
beautiful,"it was a beautiful experiene , its quite a strech , boating camel riding and scenic beauty are quite amazing"
A heritage Boat Ride.,"Lake Pichola is an artificial lake that sits right in the middle of Udaipur city which was built in the year 1362 AD. It is named after the nearby village Picholi, Lake Pichola is one of the most famous tourist attractions in Udaipur. Flanked by islands, palaces, temples, mansions, ghats and restaurants, Lake Pichola offers something for everyone. The enchanting views of sunrise and sunset from the lake amazing. One of the most famous attractions in the lake surroundings is Lake Palace that sits right in the middle of the lake, constructed on the Jag island. Mohan Mandir, built by Jagat Singh between the period 1628-1652 and Jag Mandir are other islands that are worth a visit. City Palace is another famous tourist attraction in the lake surroundings.A trip to Lake Pichola is incomplete without a boat ride in the serene lake. This time it was my turn to go for boating. There are four islands in the lake, they are Jag Niwas Island, Jag Mandir Island, Mohan Mandir Island, and Arsi Vilas Island. It wasn't possible for us to go to them, a boat ride was perfect to have a look at those islands. Our boat ride started from one of the many ghats with an amazing view of City Palace.Boat ride in Lake Pichola is a must-do activity to enjoy the beauty and charm of the lake. It would be more interesting if you go for a boat ride in the evening."
Beautiful view of udaipur,"Lake pichola is famous lake in udaipur city.This lake is near to city musuem.Here we can have the nice view of Taj Hotel,Jag Mohan palace etc.Jag Mohan palace is inside the lake and one needs to go on  boat to visit Jag Mohan palace.One need to pay 500rs per head for the boating"
Lake Pichola ,It’s a huge lake with clean blue water. Most of the old Haveli and luxury hotels are situated on the banks of this lake.
Lake Pichola,Lake Pichola is a beautiful lake in Udaipur. It is pristine in nature and one must visit this if visiting Udaipur.
Impressive Man Made Lake in Udaipur,"Lake Pichola is one of few lakes in Udaipur, and one of the most popular.  With the city built around the lake the views of the town from the lake are beautiful, especially in the evening.  Many bridges cross the lake giving you a very different view from the bridge.  You can…"
Nice,Very nice place to hangout the most beautiful lake whenever you visit Rajasthan must visit this lake love the place. 
Lovely boat ride,"We went on the boat tour of Lake Pichola and then visited Jagmandir palace. Totally serene and scenic trip, worth the time. WE had our guide  with us who was able to give the detailed history of the Lake and water availability. Worth going at least once on the Boat trip."
Lake pichola boat ride,"Lake pichola, the artificial lake is having few islands in which you have taken lake palace, jag mandir etc. To visit jag mandir you have to take the boat ride from the museum entrance at rameshwar that. Till 2pm it's 500rs per person and afterwards it's 800rs.You may hire a…"
Beautiful lake,"Clean (ish) water, expansive lake system, SO many restaurants at Ayers edge level, wonderful. Only get a hotel on the water, the views and tourist access are amazing!"
Scenic view.,It's beautiful view in evening. Sit and relax. Some people visit in morning and meditate here. Club this point with Karni mata Mandir ropeway.
Really nice lake,"The lake is like a soul of the whole city,without it Udaipur would be just another Rajasthani place. Great to spend some Time around, to visit ghats, as well as for a short boat trip"
A very big lake,This is the biggest lake in Udaipur of the 7 lakes. We had a boat ride for about 45 minutes going around .
Lake Pichola - Beautiful and Serene,"True to its title, the City of Lakes - Udaipur is surrounded by a number of lakes attracting its visitors with its blue waters and scenic views. One such artificial lake is there in the middle of Udaipur city named Lake Pichola, built in the year of 1362 AD.The mesmerizing views of sunrise and sunset from the lake is something that should not be missed .Flanked by islands, palaces, temples, mansions, ghats and restaurants, Lake Pichola offers something for everyone.

Nice views day and night,"Lake Pichola is an artificial lake in the heart of the tourist district of Udaipur and one of the city's star attractions. There's several Islands in the lake, one of which is the Jag Mandir, another major attraction of the city. In my personal opinion, the lake is best viewed from afar both day and night. The latter because the buildings on the island are beautifully lit up. Up close, the water is not exactly dirty, but it's not pristine either as sewage and rubbish is dumped straight into the water.The lake is undeniably photogenic, so it’s worth seeing this when in Udaipur."
LAKE OF SERENITY AND PROSPERITY.,"Must see when in Udaipur.You can take boat ride here which is best experience with loved ones.you can see lake palaces,taj hotel,oberai  udaivilas hotel,leela hotel from here by magnifying binoculers."
Cruise on the lake,A breath of fresh air to go this boat ride to the jal mahal from the palace... either in the morning or in the evening. Good boats  with life jackets make this ride safe n secure.The boats ferry to and fro between the 2 points hence easy to get across without stress.
Amazing experience ,1.5 to 2 hours tour. Amazing experience to roam around in beautiful lake in boat ride with amazing scenery all around and view of city palace .You can buy tickets for boat ride from city palace counter or there is a separate counter near boat ride entrance. 500 rs in morning and 800 rs in evening. No much difference. In the morning also you will enjoy.
Opportunity to see beautiful buildings from lake,"Our one-hour boat ride gave us an opportunity to view some very beautiful buildings from the water. The oppulent life style represented by these palaces, homes and hotels contrasts starkly with the poverty of many people we saw iin the other parts of the city."
School holidays,"Great ride on boats in clean water, minimal boats, lake not overfilled with tourists. Great walk way on the east side giving views of the sunset in the west, over the Airolli mountain range and smaller adjacent lake"
Sunset boat ride,"My family and I took a sunset ride across Lake Pichola and loved how peaceful and relaxing the experience was. The ride offers some amazing views of the City Palace and the Taj Lake Palace. It stops off at Jag Mandir, giving you 15 - 20 minutes to walk around the island before continuing on and dropping you off at the jetty where you boarded. The entire experience lasts about an hour and is worth checking out."
Beautiful,Pichola is the most famous and beautiful lake in Udaipur. Do opt for boating here to get some amazing views of the palaces and hotels around.
Please keep lake clean,"Humble request to all tourist visiting lake , don't throw garbage here and there.My request to city development authority to install more dustbins at Gangour ghat.We Indians behave like foolish people,by destroying these lakes,we will ruin livelihood of our local people."
Gorgeous,We were lucky to be in Udaipur when there was plenty of water in Lake Pichola. Seeing all the beautiful monuments  and buildings from the middle of the Lake is a wonderful experience. 
Sunset boat ride @ Lake Pichola,"The evening views of the palace and lake is amazing. Was worth the additional money spent on the ride, as you are able to appreciate the lit up palace and cool breeze. Unlike other water bodies in india, this is a clean lake."
Pichola Lake is by far the best lake Udaipur,The beauty of the lake in dawn is classic. There are some hotels inside the island of the lake. Also inside the lake there is a Mandir in an island.
Must visit ,Please ask for Pritam as your guide. You will get history and more! You can soak in history and beautiful local vibes

Nice view of palace,The 1h boat ride allows you to have a good view of the palace and the visit to the nearby island is very nice. However don’t expect to see to much of the surrounding landscape as it is all shrouded in heavy smog.
Boat ride,"500 rupees where you basically have to figure out what you’re seeing, since the boat man gives no information. It’s only a one hour ride because you stop at a hotel in the lake, where I presume they want you to eat at (since it is mostly a restaurant). Wouldn’t suggest it,…"

short boat ride,"took short boat ride across to palace, and see the garden was very nice. would have been nice if government kept up on the fountains and fence railings, as much of it is decayed as it all needs update painting also."
Great Lake trip,We took a water taxi across the lake and enjoyed the trip. We visited the island and had a walk. The view of the City Palace was very good.
Boat ride,It's awesome and famous lake in Udaipur with Taj palace/jagmandir in between . The boat ride is costly but worth. We went for evening boat ride and it was sensational. Make sure to take the boat ride from city palace to get down at jagmandir and enjoy the evening

Beautiful,It's worth visiting here . We took a boat ride here which is a little expensive . I felt like I am in heaven . Enjoyed a lot here .
Boat to Tag Mandir to watch the sunset,"We bought our boat ride tickets within the City Palace walls, we opted for the afternoon which was 800 INR each, but this meant we could visit Tag Mandir island.  We sat at the front, the boat held about 16 people, it took us down the side of the City Palace, past Bagore ki…"
Peaceful oasis,"Udaipur is truly an Oasis among the fast pace and chaos of India. Waterfront restaurants, cafes in the little streets with a rooftop terrace views, and a little escape from the hustle and bustle."
Expensive but nice,They charge 500 rs but it is worth.You can visit Jagmandir palace which is otherwise not accessible.
Beautiful lake,A boat ride on the river and a memorable meal at one of the restaurants around the lake should be a must in Udaipur trip.
Nice lake,"Lake pichola is very nice and very big artificial lake, and center of the lake there is taj lake palace hotel that's looks very nice in night, boating is also available in lake."
Mesmerizing Sunset!,Lake Pichola is a serene place with many boat ride services available. It is best to go there in the evenings and view the most mesmerizing Sunset. The magnificent view of the city palace on one side and the Taj Lake Palace on the other makes it a historical grandeur.
Serene,Must take a boat ride through the lake. You can see the peripheries of the city. It’s a great place.
Lake Pichola,Magical lake that makes Udaipur what it is. Amazing buildings surround the lake and if you have the dollar you can visit one of the lux hotels located on the islands. You can do the boat tour from City Palace. Better during sunset.

Worth every penny,"A place of scenic beauty. I strongly recommend the sunset Cruise. However, it's advisable to take the cruise from Lal ghat instead of the City Palace. It's half the price and longer in duration. "
Beautiful city views,"Lake Pichola is the oldest and one of the largest lakes in this area. It is incredibly picturesque with the Aravalli mountains all around. You can take a tour by boat and seeing Udaipur from the lake is very special. The lake went dry back in 2006 so don’t take it for granted! It is shallow, average depth of only 14 feet."
Very nice scenery.,The scenery here is pretty and amazing. Very clean lake. Lots of tourists visit this place. Great experience.
Can we keep it clean,Sad to see people thrown garbage in to such a beautiful lake.hotel owners must help city administration and various citizen groups must come forward to make the lake clean.
Weather and haze dependent this could be quite nice`,"It's a lake tour - a slow putter around the perimeter of the developed area of the lake.The scenery is pretty - though as others have pointed out much is in disrepair.It offers a vantage point you don't get from elsewhere, I suppose.  We stopped on a small island that hosts weddings - I don't know the name - where we had a cold drink and hung out for a bit.While we went at sunset the skies were so hazy that there was no 'sunset' to enjoy."
Most colorful evening,"There are two lakes offering boat rides to tourists. One is at fatehsagar lake and other at lake pichola. Lake pichola boat ride can be taken from three places. 1) From city palace 2) Lal Ghat and 3) Dudh Talai.  The charges for taking a boat ride from City palce are Rs.400 to 500 per head if the boat ride is taken before 2 pm and it is in the range of 800 rupees if taken in the evening session because you get to see sunset. You also get to visit Jagmandir if you take the boat from City palace. Jagmandir is a small island in the middle of the lake housing a temple,  a park and a restaurant.  Although i did not take the boat from city palace, that is what i was told. It is a total 45 min/ 1 hour boat ride. I was not too keen on visiting Jagmandir and therefore i took the sunset ride from Lal ghat and paid Rs. 300 per head for a 45 min ride.  I am told that a sunset ride is also available from dudh talai at the same rate.  However since Lal Ghat was closer,  we took the ride from there.  A word of caution now.  While uber and ola cabs are available in the city,  for going to lal ghat,  the ola/uber fellows will drop you near one masjid wherefrom you will have to take a 3 seater auto as ola/uber are not allowed beyond that point. You have to travel atleast a kilometer by auto to reach Lal ghat.  They charge 100 rupees each way for the auto. You need to reach atleast 45 minutes before the sunset time to get a seat on the boat.  It is an ordinary boat where you sit by the edge. I strongly recommend the sunset ride as you get to see the  colour of the sky changing to different shades. It is an awe inspiring photo opportunity. Here are some of the snaps."
The lake...,"To be fair, it's a lake.  It would be a bit better if it had less rubbish floating in it. It does have nice scenery around it, but most of it needs some repair. The sunsets are gorgeous though, worth sitting on the quiet ghats to enjoy this, particularly if you're a couple..."
Beautiful ,If you are a007 fan you will recognise this lake and if not you will enjoy the beauty. Both sides are lovely for walking and it is well recommended to take the boat trip at sunset. 
Best seen from a boat ride.,Lake is impressive if full of rubbish on the banks - this in India after all. We went to the island and saw the sunset.  Very nice.
Part of any visit to Udaipur,Largest of the 7 lakes in Udaipur.  We can see the lake from many businesses around the lake including the Jagats Niwa Hotel dining area.
Beautiful Lake,Located in the heart of the Udaipur city. Lake Pichola is huge and very beautiful. There are a few platforms built at the shores for tourists to witness the beauty of the lake
Beautiful!!,"Lake pichola is beautiful and the views are amazing, want to return for a longer vacation with my family"
South African couple traveling through India ,"Lake Pichola , a man made lake , a wondrous site , 2 stunning palace like hotels in the water , lots of boats , ferrying people on boat rides and also from the hotels in the water , the City palace is on the lake shore , a beautiful sight. My best is watching the sunset over the…"
Romantic ,Romantic place with full of beautiful palaces and places  Man made lake in the middle of Rajasthan   3 miles by 2 miles.  
Good lake ,"Udaipur is known for city of lakes.. Most of the tourists spots near by lake.... But every where so much garbage, cowdung ."
Sunset cruise on Pichola Lake,"For 600 Rupees you can take a 40 minute sunset cruise on the beautiful Pichola Lake. The short cruise goes past all the landmarks (The Palace, the Royal residences, the small islands) and past some of the fancy lake side hotels. See the attached photos and judge for yourself. "
Beautiful Place,Lake Pichola is really very beautiful. You can enjoy Boat Ride there. Photos in Rajasthani dress is also available and one can enjoy that.But more effort is required to clean it.
Amazing,This is the best place to visit. in the evening or night it is very beautiful. best place to go with family
Nothing like waking up looking at lake P,I love staying here the sounds of temple bells echoing in the valley between the hills over the lake is a beautiful thing I like to stay at hanuman ghat so that I see the sunrises & then don’t get the afternoon heat in my room ... plenty of bars restaurants & vantage points for sunset!!
"Great Views, Good boat ride","Don't miss out on a boat ride on the lake. Prices vary as per timings. Water could have been cleaner. If you catch a boat from the back of the palace, they would stop at Jagmandir for sometime in between the boat ride. The other operator does not. You will find lots of cafe's and hotels advertising lake view around."
Relaxing view of Udaipur,Take a boat from the foot of the palace to Jagmandir Island. Here there is an ornamental garden with a pavilion cafe and peaceful views back to Udaipur city. You can stay a while on the island and relax over a drink whilst soaking up the view before taking another boat back.
Ok to visit,"This place is awesome if you are hindu and go there for religious ceremonies. Otherwise just another lake. From some parts you can see the city palace, which is nice otherwise not the most beautiful part of the city."
Dirty Pond,"It's a pond...a drain at most places. Thanks to Taj, it keeps it's surrounding clean, so there is some sense of flowing water, otherwise at most places, it's stagnant water, filled with debris, garbage...drain. The Fateh Sagar lake is comparetevly clean, with uncluttered surrounding. Try the Ambrai restaurant at the lakeside in the evening."
Nice place to visit,Its a major attraction in Udaipur.We did sunset boat ride to jag mandir and it costed Rs 800 per person.It was a great experience!!
Boating and Photography place,We visited with FamilyThere are boats and Rajsthani Dressup photo walas service there It is top attraction of Udaipur. Compared to Fateh Sagar lake this one is small. Have boating which costs 300 per head boat of 6 ppl  / 150 per head for boat of 20 ppl They show you all palaces from lake Good time pass place
Nice place but not good as fateh sagar lake,This lake has verity of activities near to it and also a coolest place to hangout. You may find boat ride and visit jag mandir which is situated inside this lake. You may collect all of the tickets from city palace only.
Review,"The lake is very beautiful especially in the evening with its palace in the centre of the lake and Jag niwas which is, I think, now taken over by Taj... make sure you take a boating trip to see these close.."
Top attraction of Udaipur!!,Wow! This is mesmerizing! This is the main attraction if udaipur and old city of udaipur was build around this.. the views from any ghat are great ..We had a boat ride from the city palace in the mornring time..it was very nice!! Do not miss this!!
One of the best place to hangout in Udaipur,One of the best place to hangout in Udaipur.. beautiful palaces and historic buildings around.  Best spots for photography. Sunset is best time to visit.
Beautiful lake,The view of the lake can be enjoyed at night either by staying in the hotel on the lake or by having a dinner at ambrai restaurant which offers a variety of food. Click few pics and enjoy the weather.
Pleasant change from walking arund monuments,Lake Pichola is small lake in Udaipur. The lake is shallow and can dry up in drought. Fortunately it was just after monsoon so the lake was at its largest. One shore is bounded by the City Place complex and the other by mountains. There are a couple of spectacular palace/hotels…
Boat ride on the lake,The lake is really nice with it's views of the city and the expensive hotel in the middle. At the most ride they take you to the public garden in the lake. I liked the experience. Should do it if you like boat rides and love the take great photos of the city. Just check before…
Perfect Sunset,Lake Pichola sunset view near City Palace or Doodh Talai is perfect.you can click amazing pictures from here.
Lake boat ride,"Not up to expectations . It was a 30 min boat ride and on a comparatively small lake. The speed of the trip was one step faster than stationary so not much of the lake covered, moving painfully slowly and stopping. I could have swum faster. I expected we would see all sides of…"
Gives you chill,"Doesn't matter whether you are at ambrai ghat, gangaur ghat or at doodh talai. The entire day stress just wipe away in seconds with the sound of waves and the scenario which is so beautiful. "
Leisure,Calm peace and serene. Very clean lake. Boat ride is enjoyable anytime of the day but evening is the best time. Must do
Nice place,Lake pichola is very Nice and clean clear water. Evening view is.very nice. Best place for boating. Excellent
Boat Ride,Took a boat ride which took us around the lake while viewing the palaces and the hotels spread around it.
Traversing Lake Pichhola ,There’s an of royalty  when you traverse through Lake Pichhola. A boat ride on the waters of Pichhola takes you through Gangaur ghat and Jag Mandir Palace. Watching the grandeur of the city palace from the lake is an experience in itself. 
A ‘Must-do’ In Udaipur,"Udaipur is all about water. Built around five man-made lakes, water is the focus of the city.  It would be a shame to visit the city without going out on the water.   It was a very calm day when I went out for a boat ride on Lake Pichola but I still put on the life vest offered.…"
Beautiful lake,I stayed at the Oberoi Udaivilas for my birthday with my sister and they organised a personal boat road for us on the lake. The views were beautiful and would definitely recommend. 
Not too bad,"The boat ride takes you past city Palace and over to an island which has a stunning hotel on it. There is a cafe and toilets to use. The views of the city Palace are good, but I wasn't wowed in the slightest by the trip. Costs 530 rupees."
Sleeping in Udaipur from Seattle.,This picturesque hotel overlooking the Pichola Lake is an amazing place to stay. The view of the lake and adjacent hotels are definitely mesmerizing. A good palatial property built-into a hotel and made of mostly marble finishing was amazing to be stating whilst my 2 days trip…
Beautiful lake with wonderful palace,"Best time to view is in the evening. The best view is from the city palace- Udaipur. Take a boat ride from City Palace -Udaipur. After a boat ride go to Taj lake palace hotel in the Pichola lake and can have dinner, if it is in your bucket list. Even if the whole trip with…"
Evening boat ride,We did a 45 minute boat ride at dusk with an Intrepid tour. The building were stunning when lit up in the evening. Able to see many of the islands up close. 
Beautiful views from here,"Beautiful views from here, very serene. It was overflowing due to the awesome rains. Great scenic beauty"
Enjoyed boat ride with kids!,"Boating in Lake Pichola is a pleasurable experience. With a stop at Jagmandir its a complete package. Only thing is the additional charges in the afternoon (even if its well before sunset), makes it a bit heavy on the pocket."
Visited as was staying at Leela Hotel,Nice lake.. The cool breeze when you ride a boat here during rains is amazing..There are different jetties for different hotels.. Took the boat for Leela Palace from the corresponding jetty
Beautiful lake,Stayed in taj lake palace hotelOnly way to reach there is by boat and the Lake is view is breathtaking The sunset view in the evening is worth itNever seen a more cleaner lake in the world and the sights of the palaces aroundIt specially in the night are awesome and worth watching
Pristine,"It's beautiful and the boat ride is even better.  It drops you to Jagmandir Island Palace and you must take some time out there and just soak the view, sip tea and get peace.  I was in Udaipur for three days before proceeding to Jodhpur and I got this really helpful driver.  It was just a chance since I booked Uber from the airport.  Mohammed Yunus (+917727865445) honest and good guy.  In case he is available when you are there or you call him earlier and book him."
Lake full of islands,This lovely lake was brimming with water on this visit. In 2004 when I had gone there was fields and pastures on the lake bed!Lake palace hotel and jal mandir are both on islands in the middle of the lake. It has some of the best hotels of the world on it and around it.
Beautiful,Best time to visit this lake is around 4-5 . It will give you a chance to enjoy the sunset enjoying the boat ride. The atmosphere during the evening is very calm and scenic .
"1001 Night in my memories! This is a place, I will never forget!","I have been there with two friends during anIndia-sightseeing-trip for only two nights, but in my mind it was one of the most importend experiance during that trip. It is that atmosphere, you only have a few times in your life. An evening sitting in that pittoresk garden, having an old Whiskey and listening that some hundred of birds around you...."
A boat ride ,"A beautiful lake, that looks prettier during the rains. Do cruise it to see the gorgeous hotels and palaces that fringe the lake. Stop over at Jagmandir  for a quick break"
Disappointing.,Its a bit dirty. It looks good only from the Oberoi's. Otherwise its not much to write home about. Yet it seems to be a famous tourist point with the Lake Palace and the Leela also on the same lake
Favourite Udaipur,Our favorite day of our short visit. We had boat on lake and the colors of the skies and the scenery just blew our mind. After we had dinner so romantic by the water. Lots of people there but so big it doesn't feel crowded.
Serene and amazing!!,The lake pichola offers amazing view during evening time. You can do boating here or can visit Jagmandir.
Beautiful,"It is one of the many lakes in Udaipur. Beautiful, Clean & huge. Nice place to hangout in the evenings."
Udaipur vacation,"Great hotel, great food, great accommodation (very clean) and friendly staff. I would definitely recommend this hotel!!"
Around and on,The lake was pretty empty when I first arrived so it more resembled a stagnant pond. It's nice to have the view and coolness from the water. There are plenty of good places to eat and drink around the lake
Beautiful lake,The lake is very big. You can enjoy the lake with the boat ride. You have to spend rs500 each for the boat ride depending upon the time.
Good views esp during monsoon,"We just sat by the side of the lake on the promenade and did not indulge in the commercial activities. We enjoyed the views and got some real good shots at sunset. For those who wish, can enjoy camel ride, horse ride, horse chariot ride, boating etc"
A Beautiful Lake,Lake Pichola along with the City Palace in Udaipur city makes the visit to Udaipur excellent. Pichola Lake is behind the City Palace with a vast expanse and panoramic view. Inside the lake is Hotel Jagniwas in white color. You can enjoy boating in the lake but expenses are high…
Serene and beautiful!!!,this lake is an iconic one in udaipur....city palace on one side and hotels/restros on other side....with taj hotel right in between of the lake...a must visit..
Nice view of history with lake ,Best places to visit in monsoon and see Aravalli hills in shadow of clouds with lake  pichola around with some hotels and old city houses making awesome environment to stay forever in the city
Mesmerizing,Wonderful place to spend time. It gives you so much calmness and peace. Boating is slightly costly but fun and enchanting.
Lovely,Beautiful lake at udaipur. Can take a ride and go to jalmahal and visit it. Amazing place to visit. The view are very beautiful from here
Beautiful Lake,Nice place to spend a afternoon... Go for a ride to the Island.. have a cup of coffee...   Great ambience and memorable.  nature's beauty at its best
Lake Pichola,Beautiful lake and good boat ride you will enjoy the boat rides a must visit place but you come bro Jaipur.Charges 150 per person for boat ride.
It  was very  good  boating  near  palace lots  of foreigners  were  there  they  took  near  sunset  point  and  allowe,"Very  nice  spot  to enjoy ,we were  seeing  the  view  from boat  they  gave  life  saver  jacket,  we enjoyed  sunset  view  from  boat  lots  of birds  were  flying  home  in the  dust  time"
Nice place,Good place to visit as it has very nice seating arrangement and also very clean and nicely maintained.
Not Overly Impressive,"This was an interesting boat trip, saw the sunset and the lights come on across the city. Other than that i didn't feel that the trip was overly exceptional. Probably if you are in Udaipur it may be something that needs to be experienced. Certainly not an expensive tour to take."
Loved the sunset boat ride on Lake Pichola,I’m not one for boat rides but don’t miss taking the sunset boat ride on the lake. The views are stunning. The sunset was absolutely beautiful.
Boating at Lake Pichola,"This is the one activity we enjoyed the most. It's abosultely gorgeous, and without doing this your Udaipur visit is incomplete.   Go for the boat ride that starts from the city palace complex. The boats are better, and the duration is more, so the trip is more relaxed. The boat…"
always Inviting,"Lake Pichola is Like Lady Princess of Lake , Invites in a way people go and sit for Hours with their Loved ones . Must go ,Boating is fun when you go Jagmandir Island along too. Best to go in Evening only"
Beautiful Lake,We had boat ride of about 1 hr here in perfect sunset time. and we found it amazing. The lake is huge and had best views of City palace. in the late evening when City palace gloss with light series its refection in lake water makes the scene mesmerising. In my opinion boat ride…
"Sunset boat ride, must try!",We went for sunset boat ride at Lake Pichola. It was nice and relaxing. The boat also stopped at Jagmandir Palace where we had time to walk around.
Stunning man made lake ever seen ,"Visited thrice here. I always choose my stay nearby this lake. With all the transport connectivity, awesome restaurants and wonderful views of hills around this lake, there's no reason to stay anywhere else. You can enjoy calming sunset and sunrise at this lake. Must try boat ride of the lake as well."
Lake pichola,This is one of the best place to visit .Must try a boat ride which will take you through the jagmandir palace and resturant situation just innthe middle of lake pichola lake.YBoat ride price is Rs 450 per person for the return trip
Mindblowing! The best lake in Udaipur,I loved the ghat areas and the lake looks stunning in the night with the city lights and the hotels near the lake are luxurious and there are many lakeside cafes and restaurants where you can sit and enjoy the lake views. I would recommend you to go during winters as the water is level is better and the lake is more clean.
Picturesque Pichola...!,"It's like the Heart of the city...all the major city landmarks are in the periphery of lake Pichola. The heritage structures and cosmopolitan culture meets in Old city area surrounding Lake Pichola and gives an amazing insight on how to balance tradition with modernity.To say that it's a must visit location in Udaipur is like stating the obvious! While anytime during friendly cool weather will be fine for boating, a visit during sunset hours will be the best for romantic pick...!Note: Boating is available from two points but the one which is taken from City palace counter takes you to Jagmandir island palace where you can spend quality Romantic time although with higher rates!"
Majestic Lake of the City of Lakes,"Despite the poor rainfall in recent years, the lake has decent amount of water. One can only wonder how the lake looks when it is full. As is true of any natural water body, there is a cool breeze near the lake, even on sweltering afternoons. A good place to hang out with family or even solo."
Awesome views,There are many lovely places to chill around the lake. We were there in June when it's less full. I am sure it's even more lovely after the monsoon.
Excellent Place,"Udaipur is a city of Lake. Please visit here in early evening. There are several boat rides 30 seat , 10 seat and 4 seat. These boat provides tour around hotle lake palace."
Lake pichola,We were very disappointed because water level was very low but it was very very big lake. Boating price was also very high.
View,Good view nice place to visit . Beautiful place . You see a beautiful lake and can sit on the bank areas can boat .
Heart of the City of Lakes,"It's a very beautiful lake, worth visiting twice. Once just before sunset to see the beautiful lake and palaces in and around it. And once at night to see the brightly lit palaces and it's reflections on the lake.  It's an absolute wonder and slightly difficult to believe that…"
"Amazingly beautiful , must visit",This place is our worldly beautiful and must visit. Don’t miss this place. Prefer going on a non peak day when it will be less crowded else you won’t be able to take good pictures. Also do make sure do boat ride. That’s good. 
Beautiful | Boat 🚣🏻‍♀️ trip is worth it ,The boat trip takes about an hour  It was raining heavy so I decided to pass on it  It’s worth doing though  I will keep my ticket until next time 
Good evening spent at the lake.,Must visit. Try visiting off days or non peak days (like wk days) and u will enjoy as it will be less crowded. A must visit for a perfect evening spending.
WOW experience,It was extremely most enjoyably Boat ride i had in this place. Loved the place and the landscape. Love to visit again next year with family. 
Best environment,Lake pichola is a great place to walk and boating around lake.Lot of people visit every day here to enjoy peace and quiet time
Refreshing Experience. ,"Beautiful and Refreshing experience. The lake and the water is quite clean and beautiful. We spent the evening in a boat in the lake. The guide explained the history of the lake, the place, the Kingdom of the Udaipur Kings etc. What a history. Truly amazing. We really enjoyed the Lake and the Trip"
Boat ride at Lake Pichola,"Its good to choose boating at the time of sun set. It seems that Lake Pichola is being maintained properly. Boating price is higher. They take you to 1 medium round of around 20 mins of boating. No guidance of the Palace or history of other monuments situated in the lake, while boating. There's more potential if the authority takes further interest."
In the midst of it all!,"There is no way to miss Lake Pichola if you’re in Udaipur. You see it from the City Palace, from the Ambrai Ghat from Udaivilas. You get the point?The lake host the famous Jag Mandir island Palace in the middle and the only way to get there is by a boat/ferry. You can either get the boat from the city centre (if you want to get off at the man fit) or from Doodh Talai (if you don’t need to get off at the JM - JM used to be a Retreat for the Raja Maharajas back in the days to sit back, relax & enjoy some good times!)"
"You cant miss it, if in Udaipur!!","It's kind of in the center of Udaipur, and that itself tell that you cant really give it a miss. Though otherwise as well, its a place which do give you a feel of relaxation while in this beautiful city. Must visit!"
Very congested,The backside of lake is very congested with limited mobility even for a car. And the road houses dozens of hotels and lodges. The front view is very good and has a few water activities.
Lake of sight seeing.,"As we stayed at Trident Udaipur, situated near or I can say almost at lake Pichola so we booked the boat ride through hotel only. But if you wish you can book the boat ride through other sources , available at other side of the lake. At the time of boat ride one can see the heritage building of The City Palace at one of the side of this lake,then 5 star The Lila, The Taj Palace ( in between the lake), the most famous Jagmandir (now a restaurant in lake). The main attraction is....when the sunsets.... thousands of bats fly over the lake to drink water...they fly down from the trees of the hills near the lake."
Must visit,"This is the best place to visit. Go there in evening or night you would love it so much. Also, there is boating too. But sitting on the wall surrounding the lake is great experience. Go there and enjoy with family."
Must visit place,"If you are in Udaipur you will cross this place for sure. It is worth to stop and admire the beauty , it is next is doodh talai place to visit in monsoon as it was quite dried up in May."
Evening coffee,In the evening is best to come here and enjoy the cold coffee and many other kiosk serving different kind of food and camel ride and the breeze from lake is soothing
Best lake to visit in Udaipur ,"Went for a walk alongside the prominade in evening before sunset. The view is beautiful and especially do visit Ambrai Ghat which is on opposite side of Bagori ki haweli. It is a 5 mins walk from there via the foot over bridge. Also, there are great places to eat by lakeside and…"
Boat ride on lake pichola,After a long walk around the city palace in the May heat this was a welcome rest. We enjoyed the boat ride which lasted about an hour and half in total. The boat travels around the floating palace and stops off at a small island for half an hour before returning. There is a cafe…
Enjoy a sunset boat trip on Lake Pichol,Best time to enjoy the views from the lake is at sunset. Sit at the rear of the boat for the best panoramic views.
Sunset Boat Ride.,I highly recommend the sunset boat ride that leaves from Lal Ghat.  Wonderful photo ops and an enjoyable evening on the lake. Go in the fall or winter as the water levels are too low in the spring and pre monsoon season.
Escape the hustle and bustle.,We went on the lake to visit Taj Lake Palace and recommend this way to see the lake if you want to kill two birds with one stone. The boats two and from Taj Lake leave every 20min and don’t go straight to the Palace instead do a round trip showing much more of the lake and of…
Boat ride and Jagmandir  Island,We enjoyed an early evening boat ride around the lake. It is a pleasant way to see the sights around the lake and watch the sun go down.There is a stop off at Jagmandir Island which in my view looks better from a distance than it is in reality (albeit I am sure the hotel there is lovely)Worth a couple of hours of your time; you will enjoy the boat ride.
Beautiful lake to enjoy the eves& morn,"There is a Village named Picholi in the nearby, from where this lake gets its name. It is one of the several contiguous lakes,an artificial  water lake,Boat rides are available.,costs around Rs.500 per person.,the best times are sunset for the ride."
Interesting Boat ride,Experienced the boat ride on Lake Pichola and went past the lake Palace It was an interesting experience with great Views Of The city Palace and the lake Place
Good place,Had been to this lake with my family and had spent some good time near this lake. So definitely recommended.
Gorgeous boat trip on lake,"I really enjoyed the boat trip with one of my sons, lovely cool air and beautiful views. The boat was not overcrowded and everyone had to wear a life jacket. It was a lazy and well paced cruise across the lake and we saw all the sights, going quite close to the Taj Lake Palace hotel."
Nice lake,We took a ride in this lake which cost almost 450 inr each person. That is quite expensive. And other than that Hotel Taj is there is between lake. Other than that there is nothing
Amazing lake in mid of city,Lake Pichola is one of the famous lake in Udaipur. It is located next to city palace. One can park there car freely beside lake road. The lake has boating option which is cost effective as compared to City palace boating in same lake. While boating one can explore entire Pichola lake as boat takes you around the entire lake. There are some snacks and street food available near lake where one can enjoy evening sitting and watching lake.
Sunset trip,"The highlight of a visit to Udaipur has to be the sunset cruise on the lake, lasting about an hour. There are a number of boats doing the trip, but as every passenger must have a seat, they can be very full, so it is better to book in advance.  Life vests also have to be worn during the entire trip."
Family tour,"So much history and so much detailed to to the title and workmanship , from the title to the fences around the gardens."
Beautiful lake,Udaipur is known as city of lakes. And lake pichola is one of them . Spread over long ..the man made lake is worth spending a few hours
Tranquillity,"Want a break from the hustle and bustle then take a boat ride on Lake Pichola, best to arrive early , the boat trip takes in a small island which is very pleasant stop over for about 20 minutes .  On the tour you will see the ""floating"" palace made famous by the James Bond films…"
Only do if you want to fill in time,"We got on a boat, which was full (not a problem) did a bit of a tour around the lake, landed on the island, wandered around bored for 20 minutes, came back to the jetty on time but had to wait until there were enough people on the boat, then went back to shore. However, where…"
Boat ride,It's an artificial fresh water lake. It is famous for its scenic beauty.Boat ride in this lake is a dream comes true. You must try this in the evening during the sunset. It's the best time to do boating. There are three spots in udaipur from where you can take this ride and the…
Must Do Boat Ride,"Boat Ride for 20 minutes was worth to roam the heart of Udaipur, Lake pichola. Idealy paln during the dawn to have good scenic view of Scenic places around. Must visit and club with Ropeway- Karani temple"
Nice lake,"Nice lake but was quite low due to the season I went, mid April. Overall, not so fantastic during the day but it reveals it's beauty during the night. "
Should be visited,The boat ride is worth as one gets the chance to see things around the lake. Better carry a camera that has a zoom lens so you capture lots from surrounding area. Its worth the amount we pay for boat ride. Better if visited in the evening as its pretty hot during summer time. 
Boat ride in Lake Pichola ...,Recommend a boat ride in the evening to see the sun set ... awesome view ... The lake is kept quite clean ...
Loved this visit!,"We were taken over the lake to the island with the gardens, a small museum and a restaurant.  En route we were given a view of Udaipur from the lake, passing the palace on the lake where the James Bond film Octopussy was filmed.  The meal in the restaurant was great, everything…"
Enjoy mesmerizing views,"We had visited the banks of this beautiful lake many times during our trip to Udaipur. Many outstanding landmarks of Udaipur are located on the banks of this lake like the City Palace, many havelis like Bagore Haveli and the famous Taj Palace hotel is located on an island within…"
Beautiful lake but dirty water,"Lake Pichola is definitely beautiful and worth a visit. Boat ride would enhance the experience but the water near the ghats is very dirty and you can see plastic bottles, poly bags, waste material etc. At sunset and evening it looks more beautiful and one can sit on ghats and…"
Lake Pichoda in the City of Lakes,"Lake Pichola is one of the greatest tourist attractions near the City Palace of Udaipur. The ferry system is very well organized. The charges include a tour to the Jag Mandir, another beautiful property not to be missed. Jag mandir is an island and has a restaurant, restrooms in…"
Wonderful break in the day for a cruise on Lake Pichola; plenty of boats to chose from.,A cruise on Lake Pichola is well worth your time.  Plenty of choices for boats to take you on a gentle cruise; some seem to be government owned and others private.  Make sure you understand the cost and where the craft will go and for how long. This is a man made fresh water…
So pretty,This is a man made lake but it still offers a really nice experience.  We stayed at the Leela Palace so a boat picks you up to take you to the hotel.  This is a similar thing for all the lake hotels.  I understand it isn’t very deep and it is not swimmable for tourists although…
Beautiful lake breathtaking views,Me and my partner took a boat ride around the lake on a beautiful summers day and just loved it. So picturesque and some brilliant photo opportunities.
Nice lake !,"Getting through the boating ....v visited lake Pichola and it was a good experience, city palace , lake palace , jagmandir and had a lovely pictorial view of city palace !!"
Great ride,"Beautiful lake with even better surroundings. We took the evening boat ride & really enjoyed the view of the surroundings such as the Taj lake palace, city palace & of course the sunset. Evening time would be the best time to explore the lake. "
Holiday,Gives a beautiful view of the City Palace.....Dirty like other lakes of our country but the municipality is making efforts to clean it which deserves applause........ People now are more thoughtful and most do not litter........Do take a night boat ride to see the beautifully…
Scenic,"One of the major highlights of Udaipur.  One should opt for boating in this lake, there are two types of boats  - Government-operated and palace operated, though the government one is cheaper it will not drop you at jag mandir so opt for palace operated boats which will drop you…"
where is the love,"Too many people in the streets, not fun walking around and shopping because of the insane honking and driving traffic in the narrow streets, I feel sorry for the shop owners. Prices have gone up thanks to high numbers of tourists, everything else has gone down. The lake is so…"
Picture Perfect Lake sers off the heritage buildings on the shore,"We were entertained in style on our own lavishly appointed boat to view the lake, organised by Enchanting Travels of New Delhi. The lake was fabulous nearing sunset and we would recommend to others. Great views of the City Palace, Hotel Pichola, and gardens were breathtaking.…"
Overrated,"Lake pichola is considered to be the best tourist point in Udaipur. However it failed to meet my expectations. The sunset is bang on average. Have seen way better sunsets in Delhi NCR. Also, there's not much to do at Lake pichola except the boat ride which is decent. The prices seem to be bit high considering the quality of the boat ride."
Sunset boating,A luxury boat offers breathtaking view of the sunset .. otherwise it is standard boating conditions.  Can be clubbed together with city palace visit
An oasis in busy Indian city,This artificail lake dated from several centuries ago is delightful. It has two islands which must be visited. It has been known to dry out and we saw some fascinating pictures which showed that.
Very good ,Its great place for relaxation. Boating was main attractions of this place. You should go in evening.
A Must See,"The serene waters of the picturesque Lake Pichola are a treat for the eyes, especially when you are tired having been out on a hot and dusty day in Udaipur. The waters seem to twirl more than anywhere else and there is a sense of peace you get that you could sit and watch the Lake for hours together. It looks equally good both during the day and the night. There is boating too on the Lake, indeed they have different boats to suit different wallets! The Lake has numerous luxury hotels on its shores like the Fateh Prakash Palace where we stayed."
Superb Views and locations,Pichola lake has very good place and superb in evening. Have got good views and best for photography.
Lake Pichola boat tour with teens,"I wanted to love Lake Pichola but I couldn't-  the views were nice but the group boat tour is very short, there is no narration, and it was windy the afternoon we went on it so we were wet after the first 5 minutes. The stop at Jag Madir was pretty good, we had a late lunch at the sit down restaurant with the beautiful views. The serving sizes are enormous so you can order one sandwich or pasta for two people. The island was nice for a short walk. If we go back I will look for a sunset cruise with a guide instead. The region is experiencing a drought so water levels are low in all the lakes."
Nice ambience around,"Well maintained lake with options of boating, several fine dining restaurants in the vicinity to provide lake view dining."
Beautiful Sunset Trip,A fabulous  sunset cruise on the lake is a must if you are staying in Udaipur.  The views are spectacular from the boat especially the palace.
Serene,"It is a scenic fresh water lake made by human beings. Boating is done here. It was quite busy in the evening with elderly people taking a stroll, youngsters on a date and so on. Frankly I loved being here."
Wheelchair Travelers may choose Luxury Boats,"We went for boating at the Govt. authorized point behind the City Palace. The access by car is till the gate of the boating complex. With help from the local staff, we were able to get my Super Senior Grandma to a Luxury Boat in her wheelchair. There's a ramp and a few stairs but these are all doable by wheelchair, if you can get help from 2-3 people. Off-peak timings are obviously better to do this. These boats go around the lake for 15 mins. and do not make a stop at the Jagmandir island. There may be other ride options available, but this one looked most suitable to us given our requirements."
Lake Pichola one of the best city attractions in Udaipur,One should opt for the boat ride on Lake Pichola. Its safe but costly. Specially the boat ride from 3 PM onwards is very expensive but to enjoy the scenic beauty one shouldn't skip the Pichola boat ride. Boat ride starts from 9Am in morning and one can avail ride in hourly basis only.
A Chance to See Where Octopussy Was Filmed,"A pleasant trip of less than hour around Lake Pichola, Udaipur. You get the chance to view from the boat the island where James Bond's Octopussy was filmed. The island on the lake is a posh hotel. Our boat stopped at another island hotel for about 25 minutes on our trip. One major failing on our trip was the lack of a commentary which would have been very useful and should be standard."
Lake with the Palace and hotel. Picturesque and excellent for spending leisurely time.,"A must visit in the afternoon, have a puppet show in the haveli. Can enjoy a smooth boat ride to the Jagdish temple island."
Boat ride in Pichola lake,"Though the view of Pichola lake is mind bogling,  the boats run by UMC are not comfortable. Even the embarkation point is not safe for senior citizens and children."
lovely lake,We stayed on the banks of this lake and the view was breathtaking. It's huge and well maintained. Approach road is good and early mornings can be spent here in peace .
boatride,"water splashing .needed to be shielded. Views of everything ....city palace, lakeview palace, monsoon palace...."
"Udaipur,Venice of the East","Udaipur is poetry made in Stone.The city is a reminder of the glory days of Rajputana.Wherever you go,whatever you touch,you will be transported back to a bygone era."
Serene,"The tourists point at lake is pretty picturesquely, has locals entertaining with music and several shows. Boat rides can be purchased for different categories. Boat takes you for 20 minutes around the lake where you can see palace, temple and hotels situated in lake."
Enjoyable boat ride,"Lovely lake and they organise boat rides around the lake, stopping at the jagmandir island for 15 minutes or so. Relaxing trip and you get taken along the lakeside and can see the house, hotels and ghats that come down to the water's edge. Tip - sit on the right side of the boat, you see more that way. Go around the famous lake palace where octopussy was filmed. You don't land there as it is a hotel for the rich and famous.But an enjoyable trip overall"
Lovely lake,"Big lake with boat trip available for trips around the lake, around the Lake Palace etc. Great views of many buildings and also the mountains."
lake pichola- boat ride,we took a boat near city palace to jagmandir and way back. Lake Pichola is surrounded by old heritage buildings and restaurants. Carry hats or stoles in summer or spring. Best time to visit 4-7 (sunset). Avoid having food from Jagmandir restaurant.
"""Exquisite""","Lake pichola the very peaceful, amazing beautiful, elegant lake to spent some peaceful time.The lake offers you a close look to see the wonders of Udaipur.This place is considered venice of east,it brings you back to the old rajwada era of Udaipur.You can enjoy evening ride with beautiful sunset, lighting, decoration. Romance is in the air at this place.You will definitely regret if u miss dis ride...this boat ride is worth it!!"
Could be cleaner ,Lovely setting but gets clogged up with rubbish.Lots of different boat trips throughout the day that get you close to the islands.
View the lake from a boat,"Make sure you have the traditional boat trip on the lake to experience the city of Udaipur.Romantic it might be if people were not on their mobiles disturbing the tranquility.You have time on Jag Madir island but honestly there is nothing there but a few cafes, however they take longer to prepare the food than time allows.This is the most famous of the lakes around the city and the summer palace on the lake is now aTaj hotel"
A major presence in Udaipur,"This is one of five lakes within or surrounding Udaipur giving this city the title 'Venice of the East'. A boat trip on the lake is well worth it but be careful about the many rip-off ticket sellers. There are better deals if you go to other lakes. As always, do some research."
"Relaxing Boat Trip, but long Queues","We went for a boat trip on Lake Pichola after visiting the Palace.  Unfortunately this was towards lunctime and there were very long queues for the trip, with no where to sit. It was just as well that there was a little stall selling cool drinks to stave off the heat of the midday.  Once on the boat we had a very relaxing and cooling trip on the lake.  The trip takes in some very attractive views of the buildings around and on the lake, including some impressive views of the palace fortifications."
Breathtaking artificial lake,"Though it's an artificial lake, it's so huge that you wouldn't be able to come to terms with this fact. It's spread over a huge area & gives  a peculiar serenity to the city."
Find a rooftop and enjoy the view!,"Lake Pichola is such a welcome respite after the chaos of India! You can take a quick boat ride on the lake, but I suggest finding a nice rooftop with a view to relax and eat lunch or dinner. You can’t miss the lake when you are in Udaipur"
Beautiful,A great way to see the lake is from a boat. The scenes from the water are fabulous and you can see and stop at Jagmandir Island.Well worth a visit
Beautifull,Must visit for a grate relaxing place .. Very good view one should definitely visit this and sit down with a cup of tea/coffee..
Gem of Udaipur,"Lake Pichola..a soothing place where u can spend a quality time with you and your loved ones for hours. Prefebly visit on evening..u can enjoy setting down the sun into folded misty Aravali hill is worthy moment.many attractions like City Palace, Jagdish temple, Gulab Bag are at…"
Beautiful lake and the jewel of Udaipur,"To me the Udaipur gets its beauty from its water bodies. The Lake Pichola is a wonderful example of that. The majority of the renowned city's architecture is built on its bank like the City Palace, Jagmandir, Taj Lake palace etc. The amazing part is that the beauty of the lake…"
Peaceful,I liked the Lake Pichola and especially boat ride with electric boat ! The weather was nice no waves on the lake its not too large and imagining how imaginative people who lived here for centurys were ! Beautiful palaces and gardens on small islands on the lake are like in…
Insanely beautiful!,"What a beautiful lake especially when experienced from Ambrai ghat or gangaur ghat, lot of pigeons make the place more serene, go in the evening time or early morning, you will find lot of tourist and locals playing guitar and singing here, great place for pictures too. "
Half price daytime  400 rupees doubled for sunset,"Skip the Sunset and do an early trip to catch locals washing and laundering. The sunsets are not that good as its quite polluted . It's well worth the trip otherwise. Don't miss the huge garden area to the right , as you get off the boat you walk into the smaller area"
Lovely lake with islands,Built by Udai Singh who wanted lakes around his City of Udaipur. There are two lakes with Pichola being the more famous making because of the summer palace built on an island now a hotel that has itself become world famous. There lots of boats offering trips round the lake.
Great views of the sights,"A boat trip is not only a relaxing way to see this lake but it allows you to see the Palace, the Taj Lake Palace and the Palace of Pleasure.  If you want uninterrupted photo opportunities then opt for a private boat, worth the extra for the hassle free alternative."
So much beauty!,We are continuously impressed by the scenic views of this lake from multiple different angles. It’s beaity comes with the body size of the water and the wildlife it brings to the area. This lake is one of the cleaner city lakes I have seen in India however I believe it would…
Venice of the east!,This is the most famous lake in Udaipur. You must take a boat ride here and witness the splendid sunsets! 
Boat ride from lal ghat,Beautiful lake. Great views from the boat tour we went on. We took the tour from the lal ghat boating point. This is a lot cheaper than the one advertised for the city palace. 400r each for a sunset ride but otherwise 300r. They also allow you to hire private boats. Lots of people on the boat- Indian and westerners. Boat ride was 40 mins and took us around the lake to see the hotels and city palace. Good view of the sunset and boat turned to facilitate everyone getting a shot of the sunset. It can get quite windy in the evening so better to bring something long sleeved.
Awsome experience,One of the most important tourist attractions this place is covering a very large area.So recommended for all visitors.
Lovely ,Fantastic! We enjoyed the short boat ride on the lake with great views of the palace and Udaipur. Relaxing.
Beautiful day at lake pitchola,Beautiful cool day in udaipur. Traveller's have a choice of tickets one is the more expensive city palace one. This ticket you have to walk quite a distance inside city palace to purchase. I chose the government boats paid 200 rupees and shared the bigger boat covered and with life jackets. It was safe and also very nice to have company. We had 20 min ride that was taken slowly and we had enough time and good views of the palaces and hotels like taj and oberoi that have pristine exclusive views and entrances of their own on the lake. Take pictures with Rajasthan turbans and listen to the sweet sounds of the sarangi players. Lots of snacks and Desi good. An enjoyable day.
Lovely!,"A pleasant sunset at Lake Pichola is just a bliss. Take a govt boat ride which starts from 100 to 250 INR per person. The entire 360-degree views of this lake consist of City Palace, Lake Palace, Gangoor Ghat, etc.This ride is worth it <3"
Boatride is lovely,The boatride on Lake Pichola s great and offers you wonderful views on the city. Do not be tempted or misled to buy a ticket to visit the island with ex-palace hotel and gardens. They are respectively not interesting at all and very dull. But afain: the boatride is great.
Actually quite boring.,Being disabled this is not so easy. Steep steps to reach boats and absolutely no help from the boatmen getting on and off the slightly moving vessel. It might be the most beautiful lake in Udaipur but it does not compare to others in many other countries. Other than a brief look…
the main lake,most of the sightseeing places are located in and around lake pichola as also all the major 5/7 star hotels. good place for a walk and photoshoot.
The most beautiful lake in Udaipur,"I stayed in Hotel Udaigarh which allows its guests a full 360° degree view of the lake. The lake is huge in size, is right in the middle of the city with all major tourist attractions around it. City Palace & Museum, Bagore ki Haveli (known for Rajasthani folk dance), Jagmandir…"
Lake Pichola,"Attractive lake with an island that has a restaurant on it and another that has a very expensive hotel, which you can't visit unless you are a guest. The views of the lake from the many rooftop cafes is lovely and we also took a boat ride around the lake during the day. It was…"
