Seen of jaipur,"The fort on the top of jaipur from there u can see arial view of jaipur from one palce can ride of solo scooter , sunset and surising points places local"
Not as impressive as Amber Fort,"The Nahargarh Fort is not as impressive as Amber Fort and there isn't much to see. The drive up to Nahargarh Fort is nice and the view of Jaipur from the Fort is the only good thing about it. There are some ticketed attractions within the Fort, that seemed to me to be a bit amateurish. We spent around 30 minutes at the Fort, took some pictures and headed back down to Jaipur.â€¦"
Can be skipped,I am not sure if this a UNESCO Heritage as it doesn't deserve to be one. There is nothing worth seeing here as compared to Amber or Jaigarh Forts.Its just a place where a King had kept his 9 Queens in different parts of a Building. One can visit here if you have extra time..Also please avoid the so called 'Sheesh Mahal' for which you need to pay extra.Its just a waste of moneyâ€¦
The fort,Its is on the top of the mountain nearby the pink city .. the only thing to visit last in pink city. .. from there u can see the whole world below
Rang De Basanti Fort,"It is really worth the time. Really amazing view of the beautiful pink city from the top. It's good to visit the place with friends or family. I have personally always liked sunsets from a beach, however, sunset from the fort took my breath away. Would definitely recommend everyone to mark Nahargarh Fort as a to-do in their upcoming trip to beautiful Jaipur.â€¦"
Worth a visit,If you have not had your fill of forts then this is yet another one to visit. It is one of the three forts in Jaipur. Appears to have undergone some maintenance and visitors are apparently increasing as it was previously neglected. Going up is an adventure as the road winds upâ€¦
"Not too impressive, would skip this unless you have extra time","The Nahargarh fort was not half as impressive as the Amber Palace or the Agra Fort. Its a 20min drive (by car) up the mountain further than Amber Palace, on windy narrow roads and once you get there it seems completely commercialized (wax museum?) and not well maintained.â€¦"
superb,Here is the place you must visit when you are in Jaipur.  Wax museum is really interesting. Though the restaurant there is a let you down completely.
Lovely,Nahargarh fort is one of the great place it was such a beautiful fort it was .nahargarh fort is very huge fort nice beautiful and i loved it
Beautiful fort in Jaipur,"Beautiful fort in the pink city of Jaipur.  Great views from the Fort of the city and the walls.  Looks like the Great Wall of China, built on same type scale.  A must see in Jaipur."
Now you need Ticket,When I first started to go to Nahargarh it was free for all. We were in college and this place was our regular evening walk spot. There were few small eateries but now when I went it had changed so much. There are some super expensive restaurants and some not so expensive ones. But yes its not economical. And now you need a ticket to visit this place. Nahargarh has  the famous Rang De Basanti Beer dive spot. But also has one of the most mesmerising views of City of Jaipur. Must go place
Historical retreat,"Beautiful view of the city from the fort. Historic place built with amazing architecture by  the Maharaj fondly known as the Nahargarh fort. The entry fee to the fort for Indian citizen is INR 50 .  Great place for family hangout with ample of historical information.One would be advised to avoid the wax museum as it is very costly and you cannot take photograph from your mobile phone too, u need to hire a photographer inside who will charge you 300-400 for 8 to 15 photographs, its ticket price is INR 500 that includes entry to wax museum and sheesh mahal. Also in Sheesh Mahal they give wrong information to tourists that itz the only one in the world having a mirror floor. Lot of monkeys are there in the fort but they do not harm the tourists.A visit to the fort is highly recommended to those who love historical places."
Another historical slice! ,Old ramparts having faced many wars & seen many hands changing. Place overrun with monkeys though. ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚
Very long forte,Good forte for the journey there was very long area for walking good quality of the forte ancient memory
Great view. ,"Great fort, nice view of jaipur! Beautiful architecture with small rooms, labyrinth type. Definitely worth visiting."
Best for the view of Jaipur,Ideally you can sit and enjoy some tea and snacks at RTDC restaurant and enjoy the view of walled city of Jaipur. At night it's more beautiful to watch.
Nice fort,You can spend two hours here to see this fort. You will have an idea how a fort looks like. you can have your lunch in the RTDC restaurant which offers excellent food and you will get an excellent view of Jaipur from this hilltop Restaurant.
Keep wondering why we went there ,"It's a loosely developed tourist destination where the tourism board is not sure what to do of place. First of all, its at a high point of the city, so be very careful on choosing the driver. Once you pass the entrance, the points of interest are scattered around. Some roboticâ€¦"
"Don't visit, save an hour and spent it on Amber fort",Just visit Amber fort and you are done. No other fort can satisfy you if you spent a good time at Amber fort.
"A Must see when in the Pink City, Breattaking Views all over.","Was there in End of December. This Nov-Feb is ideal period to visit this place. Went their quite early , to beat the rush..This is most advisable as by afternoon you may feel scared , as lots and lots of vistors throng this place. You just get into awe of the place , as theseâ€¦"
Great historical monument but disgusting wax museum and house if mirrors,The ride up to the fort is very picturesque. The grand feeling ends right there when one gets in the line to buy the entry tickets where a Rajasthan police cop very rudely chases away the companions of the people in the line.Going in one encounters the wax museum and house of glass . THIS IS A PRIVATE ENTERPRISE and is a total RIP OFF. The guy there behaves as if he owns the fort. The wax museum is substandard and not at par with what you would be expecting and the house of glass is another let down.AVOID THESE TWO and carry on with the tour of the fort.How can the government allow this business enterprise which is masquerading as a part of the history of the great monument
Worth visiting too see sunset,Gives a terrific view of Jaipur city. A visit around sunset time is definitely worth it. Takes about 1 hour to see the place and watch the sunset from sunset pointThe auto guys pester you to visit the house of wax inside the fort complex as they get a good commission but we skipped itThe view from the top makes the trip much worth the long drive
Amazing and picturesque view,The highest hill in the area and best time to visit is during sunrise or sunset. You will be having the best view of the city and nature. Wax Museum and seeshplace are worth worth watching.
Visit,For indian nationality adult ticket is 100 rs per person.5 years old kids are free.and students id get have discount for entry tickets.
The view outside more memorable,The fort is ideally located on top for a beautiful view of the jaipur city... especially with the sunset as the backdrop. The inside of the fort built for the many queens are quite good but no match for the views outside from the top of the nahargarh fort. worth the visit. not to miss.
Best example of Public Private partnership,Wax museum & Hall of mirrors are must visit. Strict rules of conduct help maintain the place well. Must visit.
Jaipur visit ,"Wax museum , sheesh mahal good attractions .If you visiting with children  pls make sure  keep there school college ID cards for concessional tickets ."
Amazing Fort vd beautiful Sheeshmahal,Had a great experience visiting Nahargarh fort.Visited Wax museum and Sheehmahal there which adds to the beauty of Fort.Must visit.
Famous attraction of Pink City.,"Famous Attraction of Jaipur, built by Maharaja Jaisingh II. Basically this fort was the residence of 9 queens of King, separate same portion was made for each queen having. It also served as defence property for the rulers. Breath taking view of jaipur city can also be witnessed from there. There you find one wax museum  and sheesh mahal as famous attraction of there. In wax museum you can watch wax statues near to life  . Sheesh mahal is really mesmerizing Attraction of the property made up of glass work, 24 caratgold plated paintings.. not to miss."
Entertaining and Mesmerizing,"Nahargarh Fort is located a little outside the Jaipur city. Within the fort there are different attractions. Let me warn you it can be quite a walk with steep staircases. My mother is a senior citizen and has issues with walking long distances; however she did not face that much difficulty. Ask your car driver to drop you at the car park. That is very close to the gate, reduces the walk. Inside the fort, there is a wax museum and sheesh mahal (must see). The ticket is on the expensive side however if your budget permits, don't miss the Sheesh Mahal. It is very beautiful and the do listen to its audio carefully. It is very interesting. The wax museum is fun. You are not allowed to click pictures inside. However, you can request for a photographer. Soft copies of the photos are provided at an extra cost.There are some artists displaying their skills like pottery, traditional folk music and a magician. These are just to pass your time till your turn comes to visit the Sheesh Mahal. Limited people are permitted inside at a time. Next, there is a step well, and a water storage tank. Just gives you information on how rain water was harvested in olden days. The views from this fort are breath-taking. Please don't visit the fort on a Sunday, we did that mistake. It was very crowded. Finally, there is Madhavendra Bhawan. We hired a guide and it was helpful to understand the history of the palace, the queens' rooms, toilets, bathing areas, summer residence, winter residence, chimney, how the king entered and none of the queens knew in whose chamber he would spend his time.... was all very interesting. If your budget permits, do hire a guide. We were charged INR 200/-. The tour took us a lot of time because of the crowd and the fact that I had senior citizens with me who walked very slowly. There are steep, narrow staircases to climb inside Madhavendra Bhawan, not too many though. 2 - 3 hours are sufficient here. There are restaurants inside the fort including a fine dining restaurant. I recommend don't eat from here if you are on a budget. Moreover, the taste is not too great either. There is a small eatery outside the fort which is cheaper. Can't comment on the taste as I did not eat.Overall verdict - Must visit!"
Don't let the drive scare you,"Although we didn't visit every high point in Jaipur, I feel confident in saying that the views from Nahargarh Fort are as good as they get.  Definitely worth the crazy drive to get there."
Nice again,"All three forts in Jaipur are adjacent to each other, though you do need to travel a bit to reach them. All 3 of them offer excellent views and are must visits..."
The view is worthwhile during sunset,"Firstly, for those who want to know if you can reach nahargarh fort without taxis/drivers - then yes, it is possible but it is very steep / if you are comfortable driving uphill on a steep road with ditches on side then go for it. I am not comfortable with it and I didnâ€™t do it.â€¦"
Fort is good,The view from fort is good . But avoid buying tickets of wax museum it is about Rs 500 and believe me it is not worth it .
"Fort is good, Avoid wax museum ",Separate tickets for Fort and Wax museum. Buy tickets only for Fort visit.  Privately run Wax museum not worth Rs 500 per person. Instead you would spend more time in Fort.
tiger fort,fort is good.. as compared to other fort in jaipur.. here is wax museum and sheesh mahal is additional you can visit.. 500 rs fees is overpriced but sheesh mahal is worth to watch. sunset and city view is awesome. no quide  requires here. plan to visit here in the evening so that you can enjoy sunset and city view.
"Fort is good ,wax museum fees is too much ","Wax museum have limited place  not  worth for 500 rupees ...Fort and all good to visit ..Can see the view of Jaipur from the fort.really it was remember how the fort made in those days ...city view,jal Mahal view from the  fort can enjoy ..fort inside and top can see and enjoy ...food court availble inside ...."
Tiger fort,This is the place which is srounded by 4 deewar awesome place srounded by beautyfull green hils and and their boundry wall's which is looking so beatyfull jaipur city looking awesome from top of the fort in evening their is some folk dancer  showing their cultural dance so awesome i want came heir again and again i have't words  awesome historical place with awesome rastourerant  also available  here for foode people
Nahargarh fort,You have put a wrong photograph  of Naharagarh fortPleaze insert correct photo.Although Nahargarh  which also known  as Sudarshangarh was used as a stronghold for the protection of Jaipur.During the period of Maharaja Jagat singh Raskappor a Nautch girl who was trying to become queen of Jaipur was imprisoned  here.Later duding the reign of Maharaj Madho singh second the fort was  used as prison house for prisoners.
Marvellous architecture and history,"High architectural value, excellent craving and art work. A must visit place in Jaipur. Best thing is to watch sunset and sunrise from the fort.Food is avialble inside the fort but costly.You need to reserve vehicle to reach the fort"
Nahargarh Fort,"Before Jaipur was made the capital of Rajasthan, the majestic city of Amer stood tall as the capital of the Rajput. ... Nahargarh fort along with Amer Fort and Jaigharh Fort had formed the defense to the then capital. ... The fort now also is home to the Jaipur wax museum and glass palace."
Nahargarh Fort,"- Nice one, situated on a moderate height. - I never drove on hills but it was an easy one and made it with my own car.- It is divided into 3 parts:   - Only palace visit - entry fee 100/-  - Sheeshmahal and Wax Museus - 500/- per person. Children above 3 will also be charged full.- Better to get a guide from inside the palace. I strognly recommend to get one else it would not be a worth trip. Guide will tell you the significance of each room and other areas of the fort.- Wax museusm is worth to pay a visit.Very good learning for children.- Sheeshmehal is also a good one.- Clicks are not allowed inside Sheeshmehal and Wax museum however, you can hire an inhouse photographer and he would charge you as per the pic size you prefer.- There is a food court as well inside the fort. Plan your trip to Jaigarh fort next as it is on the way while returning from Nahargarh.- Overall, it was a nice experience."
Very filmy,This fort is to filmy simple because it's been  shown in so many films... It's on your luck if on the day you visit and the location are open which are been used in shooting else they have mostly conserved it with baracatess..
A Must Visit ..,"Great Location which require lots of walking.. but all an all a must visit place to understand the culture and history of Maharaja's time. Around 15 km from the railway station, easiy accessable through taxis.  Go and enjoy Nahargarg Fort, Sheesh Mahal, Sunset Point and Sunrise Point."
"Best for sunrise, sunset, and architecture.","It is located in the Aravali mountain range you can go there by drive and by public transport too but i will suggest  if you are okay with driving and can manage your drive than you should definitely go there by drive you will experience one of best the view of jaipur from there, the roads the view the sunrise and sunset makes the place so beautiful there are mini shop on the middle of the roads where you can eat and have maggie, chai and other snacks, there is one museum and inside the for you can spend and can get some history experience. There is one baori there where rang de basanti had been shooted, there is tickets for entry in the fort and for parking too. One of the best fort of rajasthan."
The second best of the 3 forts in Jaipur. Don't Miss!!!,The Palaces that were used by the queens of Jaipur are ornate and decorated very well with paintings. There is an added attraction of various artefacts on display that are of modern architects and sculptors in each of these palaces. The Palaces are just a Never Miss since they are very well maintained to this day.
Great views,This hill fort has spectacular view points. The interior is filled with art installations and is very different to other forts.
Just donâ€™t. ,"200 rupees, but at least 800 rupees to come and go, as it is a steep way up, of 11 kilometers. We found the fort poorly kept, and it had weird modern art exposed, which took the beauty of of the place.Wouldnâ€™t recommend it."
Maybe,We were disappointed! It's a lot of money when you add the transport & tickets. You see the fort and around. You need to pay for all the other attractions. Foodcourt is okay - not a lot of tables. We had shakes and there were not good and food&drinks are expensive. Better to go to Amber Fort.
Absolute must-see!,"A location that is an absolute must-see! Get a motorcycle, head there before the sunrise and enjoy the city panoramic view before everyone wakes up. I also had some fresh fruits from a guy who cut them fresh. After, take a beautiful road down to the city."
Not as busy,"Worth going. Cheap to get in. Visited on way to elephantastic. Good photo opportunities as so high up, great views."
Wonderful view of Jaipur city if not for the fog,"I took a day tour with Royal Majestic Tours booked through Viator.com. The guide, Mukesh was excellent and very knowledgeable. After Amber Fort we went to Nahargarh Fort to admire the views of Jaipur city. Unfortunately, it was a foggy day. The fort, however, has an interesting history and is certainly worth visiting."
Interesting Fort,"I enjoyed my visit to the Nahargarh Fort in Jaipur.  This was a large facility and grounds and was easy to get lost since there were 2 separate entrances and exists.  What I enjoyed most about my visit were incredible views of Jaipur city up close which made some amazing shots  As for the rest of the visit, it was just ok.  Nice to walk around and view the structure and its various fort architecture.  However, I wouldn't list this as one of the top attractions to see in Jaipur."
Nice Views of the City,It's located around 15-20mins drive from Jaipur on the hill top. The palace offers nice Views of the Jaipur city. There are few resturants inside from where you can enjoy the views with some very expensive food for the average quality and service. With young children there is moderate walk and climb required.
Fort culture,We had been to this place on 31st Oct 2019. A glimpse of rajasthani fort culture. We hired a guide who explained the architectural beauty. A good place to visit.
Visit at night,There is a road just by side of place and offers great view during evening. Suitable for making timelapse videos of city. Has pond where rangde basanti whs shot.
Jaipur Nahargarh fort,"One can spend from 1 -2 hours walking around. Overall it's kept clean, except the tank and dumping waste in some places require attention. The unwanted/ thorny plants and parthenium plants need to be cut and thrown out. Efforts should be made to make people understand it is not a picnic spot but a historic monument.  Ticket price is Rs 50 per Indian tourist. Composite tickets can be purchased for a few places together to save money."
Interesting fort on a hill,"Picturesque fort complex in the Aravalis surrounding Jaipur. Make sure you book your return transport in advance. Or else, you may choose to leave a bit early to catch an auto from the stand outside the main entrance. The auto drivers generally drop passengers till Jal Mahal."
Visit to the Fort,The visit to the fort was interesting. Theview of Jaipur city from the fort isnice. In the evening the lighting of the fort is worth-seeing. Overall the fort is a nicetourist spot.
A must visit place,"The jaipur trip started with a bang. We visited this fort early in the morning at around 6 am. I am told that panthers are frequently cited near the fort.  On the next day of our visit,  a citing was reported in newspapers. I am told that there are no reports of attack on humans.  Anyway, it is a beautiful and long walk.  Make sure you wear proper footwear. It took us an hour or so to take a round of the fort and reach the place where our car was parked. You get a beautiful view of the city. The entree is free.  You will find lot of young,  college going people a top. Apparently it is a favourite picnic spot for the youngsters. On a sunday morning at 6 am,  we must have found around 10/150 youngsters in a group of 4/5 members each - boys and girls,  both. So the atmosphere is quite lively. You get a view of the city. It's an excellent photo opportunity.It is better to carry water and food as i did not find any restaurant nearby. A must visit place."
Brilliant views but a WARNING to FEMALE tourists,"Firstly, Nahargarh Fort, or â€˜Tiger Fortâ€™ is a brilliant place to visit. Beautiful views of Jaipur and the view at sunset was stunning and I highly recommend visiting here.   However, my trip here was unfortunately ruined by a man trying to look at me on the toilet here; I wentâ€¦"
A Historical Fort!,Nahargarh Fort stands on the edge of the Aravalli Hills overlooking the city; along with Amer and Jaigarh Forts; these formed the defence of Jaipur.  The Fort is named after Nahar Singh whose spirit haunted the Palace and prevented its construction till it was named after him.â€¦
Great fort,The for is built on a hill top that enables the view of the entire city although the fort itself wasnâ€™t that great as have seen much better ones. But this is a good location to be at if ur at Jaipur and shouldnâ€™t give it a miss in ur iternary.  Just ensure you avoid weekends asâ€¦
Great Views from the top,"The fort is located at a height overlooking the entirety of Jaipur city. You will have to get through some twisty roads to reach here. The fort itself is an average attraction on its own, apart from the fabulous views from the top. You can get good camera clicks here. Theâ€¦"
"""GREAT HISTORICAL PLACE""",I visited nahargarh fort one year ago with my Family ..  we enjoyed a lot and one of the best thing was the sunrise and sunset.
Sunrise and Sunset ,You have the most spectacular view of sunrise and sunset from Nahargarh fort. You can also see the vast view of the city from above. 
Beautiful place to visit,Yes this place is worth visiting..  Beautiful.  Don't miss this place.  Worth visiting.  I njoyed visiting this palace
Amazing Place Naharghar Fort,It is a very Amazing place in Jaipur. If you want to go to a historical place. I recommend this place.
 very very bad service homeguard ,On the top security naugarh staff talk very rude they don't have manners how to talk with their tourist
Picnic spot ,"You need atleast 2 hr if you want to explore every corner of the fort. You can see wax museum, sheesh Mahal. Well Maintained. No issue for parking, you can park your vehicle inside. Parking for free. Best time to visit (October -November or March to May)"
Horrible sculptures,Nahargarh fort was restored to great extent but modern art sulptures inside the Queen's room destroyed its natural beauty and old heritage which it displays. I personally couldn't understand the logic of bamboo sticks with broken plates arranged in a haphazard manner on top of ur head. In one room there was huge sulpture which totally hid the marvelous drawings on the walls
Nahargarh Fort,Great place to visit at sunset/ sunrise. The views are spectacular!!The road up there is crazy and will keep you on your toes.
Magical place to be!!,"Nahargarh fort, my personal favourite out of all the forts in Jaipur. There are options ranging from autos to shuttles available from the foot of the hill. The yellow coloured fort in the otherwise pink city is so pleasing to eyes.  It has a special aura, and then there is this feel in its ambience that one cannot experience anywhere else. The never ending walls and ramparts of the fort makes one believe as if this fort shadows over the entire city. Its artistic elements, colourful wall decoratives and baffling structure of hallways and palaces surprised my senses. It is unbelievable that this enthralling and spellbinding structures are a product of our own human race. Madhvendra Bhavan in the fort was worth gazing at, for hours. Privacy was the prime concern while its construction. Separate rooms were dedicated to the nine queens of the palace and the gallery leading to the rooms were designed in such a way that it was not possible to know kingâ€™s visit to a particular queenâ€™s room. Entire city, including the jantar mantra and the city palace is visible from the chief queenâ€™s room. This was instrumental in supervising the upkeep of the subjects. When i looked out of the roomâ€™s window, the houses appeared like crowded match boxes stacked horizontally against each other. Not only aesthetic aspects were kept in mind, but utilitarian concepts dictated the elements like water harvesting and filteration. This is manifested in baolis (step wells) and johads.  There is a fascinating story behind the naming of the fort. Initially it was to be called Sudarshan garh. But it was becoming difficult to construct the fort. Every morning the workers would find the previous dayâ€™s work destroyed. This is when it was discovered that the land was haunted by Nahar Singh Bhomia. No concrete answers exist about his life story. He was believed to be a king but the soul was restless and wandered on Aravallis. The completion of the fort was possible after fulfillment of two conditions. A shrine was constructed in which the spirit could reside and the fort was named Nahargarh Fort.  Other attractions at the fort are Suraj Prakash mahal, chand Prakash mahal, Anand Prakash mahal. The wax museum and Sheesh Mahal are situated near the entrance of fort. The entrance fee (Rupees 350) for each is separate from the fortâ€™s entrance fee. The Sheesh Mahal was designed to honor the Mughal and Rajput architecture. The significance of this glass palace is that it has a glass floor, which is not found in Sheesh Mahal in other parts of Rajasthan. The fort closes at 5.30 PM. This kept me dissatisfied as i wanted to explore more of this fort. Keeping the drive alive in me, i insisted my friends to again visit the fort again during late evening hours. But, the cops at the barricades at the foot of the hill doesnâ€™t allow visitors at odd hours. We were prepared because our seasoned guide suggested us a way out. So if you plan to pay a visit to nahargarh at night, tell the cops that you are going to dine in at the restaurants at the fort. And believe me, it is worth every penny you spend at the restaurant, especially at The Once Upon A Time Restaurant."
GREAT ARCHITECTURE,"Had been to this fort with my family. Though I had been in the month of September 2019 but the sun was very harsh hence it got little difficult to view with so much of heat. The fort is very good built in a huge area. The approach road to the fort is very beautiful and during the monsoon season its a very good route with awesome view of Aravalis. The view of Jaipur city from the top of the fort is really amazing. And I would like to say that if you have been to Jaipur the three forts Amer, Jaigarh and Nahargarh are must see. So don't miss these historic forts."
Fort top of mountain.,Mahajan Jai Singh instituted this fort at Jaipur for defense purpose.at night it look most extravagant when lighted up.in the rainy season you will see greenery here .You can view the old city  from here.
India's great wall of china,"To see the wall of India, experience a good evening temperature, see rang de basanti shot places. Visit nahargarh fort !"
Forest View & Good for Sunset lover's,"This place is good for those who love sunset. Also once you reach on the top you can see overview of Jaipur City..If you love nature you'd love this place. There is few restaurant if you want to eat otherwise RTDC ""à¤ªà¥œà¤¾à¤µ"" is also there."
Awesome!,"The wax museum here was better than the one we saw in Hong Kong...was pleasantly surprised.Great fort, do not miss the step well outside where  one of the movie scenes from  ""Rang De Basanti"" movie was shot!"
Interesting,"As part of the day, it was great. Spectacular views, and we had lunch at the food court. At first sight this doesn't look like a good idea, but we sat under the tree and had some very tasty masala dosas and a bit of peace and quiet. The staff were really friendly. Recommended."
Art exhibit doesn't belong here,"I went to be immersed into old India culture and not see depictions of modern art. There is no connection between the two and in fact, even the nicer art looked appalling and distasteful to an extent that makes you angry.Who in the right mind put all this stuff there? The funny thing was when I asked a guard about certain areas, he said avoid all the rooms. They are really the same except for rubbish they have put inside (pointing to the exhibit of  broken plates dangling). It was a laugh. He recommended the roof which offered a splendid view of the city.The 'art' is an intrusion to the mind and it  repulses you the moment you see it. Wrong place, wrong time, wrong feel."
"Small, quiet but must visit","The fort has a great view of Jaipur city.  If you are lucky, you may be able to spot a peacock or some monkeys on your way up or down.  We were lucky when we visited the fort because there was some kind of an art exhibition and we saw some beautiful work of art there.  There isâ€¦"
Amazing view.,This place is awesome. What a beautiful view of Jaipur city from this place. Great architecture and design.
Amazing view of entire city,A must visit place. During our visit the weather was pleasant which made our visit joyous. Amazing view of entire Jaipur city.
A bird's eye view of Jaipur,A medieval fort built of stone primarily as a retreat for the King's 9 wives with separate apartments for each. The king had a secret corridor for visiting his wives. You get a lovely view of the Jaipur city from the ramparts. There are places where good photographs can be takenâ€¦
Superb view,If you want to have a hawk view of Jaipur city than dont miss this place. If it's a rainy weather than it is picnic spot.
Nice fort.,Maharaja sawai madho Singh is also believed to be the founder of Jaipur. Wax museumSheesh MahalSunset pointThe fort explain old royal life in raja .
Preserved History,An excellent fort to visit and had a great time. Well kept and was there just before the sunset and what an amazing view. what excellent views of the entire city from the top. I am so happy that we actually visited as we were contemplating cancelling this one.
Another gem in Jaipur,"This fort and hill is one more gem to visit in Jaipur .. Jaipur being world famous for it's gems has lot of tourist place gems as well.The fort explains old royal life in Rajasthan, largest canon in world and very scenic view of Jaipur from hill top."
Amazing sculpture park in the preserved history of Jaipur,"Jaipur is the home of many forts and palaces with each having its own historic significance. One such being Madhavendra Palace. Madhavendra Palace is one of the most remarkably preserved member of Nahargarh Fort. Nahargarh Fort stands on the opposite dune from another fort, Amber Fort. The Nahargarh Fort's most majestic attribute remains is entry gate, an amphitheatre and rippling wall on the hill tops.Â Nahargarh fort is believed to be built in the first half of the 18th century and is a part of Madhvendra Palace, which is believed to be built between 19th and 20th century by Sawai Madho Singh. Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh is also believed to be the founder of Jaipur. The palace was commissioned by the Maharaja in a succession of nine undistinguishable cribs for each of his queens and one for himself with triple the width.Now, as the fort features several attractions;Wax MuseumSheesh MahalSunset PointBawdiMadhvendra PalaceNahar Baba TempleÂ The Sculpture Park can be visited by public in Madhvendra Palace. It is the 1st contemporary public sculpture park in India. The palace turned sculpture gallery can easily be said one of the first partnership acts in arts among public and private organisations. The art work is exhibited in the windy rooms of the palace, and is currently on course of exhibiting the art in it's 2nd year. The art displayed in the palace is the work of several artists from different parts of the world."
Better than other forts in Jaipur!,Less crowded than other forts. You can have an awesome view of the city from here. Go before sunset so that you can enjoy the sunset there and have a pleasant and satisfactory evening.
Superb place,"Not much visited by tourist, but i would say it is a must visit. Situated within the city but the road to Nahargad is a long route of 13 kms due to steep climbing. The palace, walking through the interconnected rooms, terrace view and step well are worth enjoying. There is wax museum there which i did not visit. The audio guide (through Captavia tour app) will help to understand the fort and make the experience more enjoying. Remember to download all the audio before going to the fort as there is network problem on the fort.Carry food and water along with you."
A Must View Place while on a visit to Jaipur,"The best part of this place is the complete view of the Glorious jaipur city during the sunset time or night. Apart from that, the authorities have added a great dine in and other activities in the fort for the entertainment of the visitors."
Sunrise/sunset/night here!,For all the lazy people get up and enjoy a romantic sunrise at nahargarh fort! This canâ€™t be missed! And if you canâ€™t get up then enjoy here at the night time where you can see whole JAIPUR lit up from the mountain top! Visit the sunset point. It is so beautiful and surreal that you will be awestruck. Go and give your eyes a treat!
History next to Amber Fort,It was worth the drive for the view or Jaipur. Neat fort...ancient. Would highly recommend a local guide...would tip 200.00 rupee's if they take you all around.
Surreal beauty,"Nahargarh Fort is one of the most beautiful places I could ever see in Jaipur. Its beautiful sunrise point gives you the best view of the city which is worth seeing, the restaurants with lovely folk music & ethnic ambience are even lovelier. A place you could visit to take a break with your loved ones."
good attractive fort for great sunset and for breathtaking views of jaipur,"i went to this fort without any planning in my car and u have to travel quite a distance in a upward direction towards nahargarh just like we used to go from dehradun to mussorie almost for about 5 kms,this fort has a car parking outside fort and entry ticket around 35 for adultâ€¦"
Great place,Although people visit this place in day but if you want to see illuminated jaipur than visit at night.  It is a very romantic place in night.
Absolutely stunning with a great restaurant ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³,Great views I mean stunning views  Lots of history  Pretty mind blowing architecture  Take a bottle of water  Great restaurant with the fort 
Amazing views  from the fort.,"One of the key highlights of Jaipur, go before sunset. Beautiful fort with great history. Views from top are amazing."
My trip really good and excellent,My trip really very good and excellent I was really happy to visit this place. And thanks to for make this plan success full.
Sunset at Nahargarh,"We a family and 4 and my brother's family of 4 visited Nahargarh fort on a Sunday during the sunset last month.There was big crowd near RTDC Padao restaurant & bar, We had great time watching sunset and enjoying a drink. Padao Restaurant and Bar is popular among locals to enjoy the Jaipur city views and the sunsets. Sundays at Nahargarh Fort is always a bad idea given its popularity among locals. Here is a picture from that visit."
"Quite famous, though didnt like it a lot","Beside sunset view and the view of Jaipur city, i didnt really liked this place. Seems to commercial and many of the things are too artistic probably. You need a different mindset to gulp in and enjoy this fort. Though grandness at those times, do definately amaze!!"
Nahargarh Fort Amazing Place,Nahargarh Fort Amazing Place in jaipur really cool place. i listen many time about this place but this time was my first time for visit.
Sunset Point in Jaipur,Amazing place on top of a hill for sunset view of the pinkcity. A must visit place in every tourist's list.
Amazing Fort with a Bird's eye view of Jaipur,"A beautiful fort that has a small step well and palace. The palace building is beautiful and really appreciate how the architecture and the use of materials allows the occupants feel cool in the hot summer day. The rooftop offers a beautiful and awesome view of the Jaipur city, as well as a great spot for photography with it's beautiful dome shape water containers."
Hawk eye,If you want to have full city view of jaipur. This is the best palace on hill with mind blowing food. There is wax museum also. Night view of city is amazing
Good route and different activities ,Itâ€™s a good trek to fort and interacting with local people and specially the musicians playing so good folk songs and instruments are hidden gems
Amazing sunset,"The fort is located on a hill outside Jaipur. Both Amer and Jaigarh forts are also located in the same hills so one can plan a visit to all three forts together. Nahargarh and Jaigarh forts are surrounded by strong walls and form the defense for Amer fort which is mainly for residential purpose. Located on a hill,  one can view the sun setting over the city from its ramparts.  There is a small restaurant managed by tourism department where one can sit over drinks watching the sun set."
Great views of Jaipur,This is a short drive from the Amber fort.  It is smaller but well organised and situated on a headland with great views over Jaipur.  It also has great sunsets apparently although we were there at lunchtime.  The fort gives a good indication of how the Royals of the time lived and was interesting to walk around.  It also has a marvellous step well as well as other tourist attractions such as a wax works and food hall.
Imagination the grand lifestyles of the past,"Easy queue for purchasing tickets. Interested in the grandeur lifestyle of Bharatiya (Indian) kings or architecture, history and traditions? Walk through this fort. The fort was absolutely clean, secured and it is well-organized for tourism. Information and signage inside the fort are helpful. Like all forts/sights, the best way to learn about the fort is to have a knowledgeable tour guide. This fort offers views of the city and its old boundary wall running across the hilly range. This fort has also hosted shooting of many Indian movies. Added attractions such as wax museum are worth one time visit. Do not miss Sheesh (glass) Mahal and other displays. Step well is a very interesting (technical, mechanical, eco-friendly...) spot. A restaurant on roof which seems to be good but not sure about the food."
FINGER LICKING FOOD WITH THE BEST VIEW,It is one of the most mesmerizing place in Jaipur. With the best view of the entire walled city with delicious n lip smacking food experience its  a must try for the tourist there is a lot to see including the wax statue museum n the fort it self.....n remember not to miss the sunset it is magical
Must visit place in jaipur,We went to fort and this is very beautiful and whole old jaipur you can view from the top Recommend early morning sun rise time
Nahargarh Fort,Nahargarh Fort is located in Jaipur. Here many films have been shot and in which Bhool Bhulaiyaa is one of the famous films to be shooted. Nice place and one must visit to have a lifetime experience.
Suped view of the City...,"Come here in the morning or at sunset to get a great view of the city... Very near to Amer fort, not to be missed..."
Maintenance needed,This place and the elevation are the pros of the nahargarh fort but they havent preserved it  well they are places which are very smelly and you cant enter inside them because of bats but on the other hand this has nice city view and you can enjoy sunrise or sunset here.
A breathtaking sunset view at Nahargarh Fort,"A very beautiful view of Jaipur city. panoramic view of the city during sunset. Enjoy Sheesh Mahal, a more modern addition that houses a wax museum and a mirror room."
Sheesh Mahal,"Amer Palace is the mainstay of tourists visiting Jaipur. Nahargarh makes for a nice side trip. Worthy of being converted into a heritage hotel. Kids would enjoy the Sheesh Mahal, a more modern addition that houses a  wax museum and a mirror room."
Best place to enjoy city view of Jaipur,"This place provides the best city view of Jaipur city, must recommend it to everyone who loves the city view."
Sunset point,This fort is also a part of the 3fort circuit of jaipur and is a gud place to have a panoramic view of rhe city during sunset.  Entry closes at 5.30pm.
Fabulous spot in Jaipur,I had been to jaipur and went to Nahargarh fort. The road to the nahargarh fort is full of adventure. Actually it should be declared as the best trekking spot for the locals. The look from the top of Nahargarh fort is on next level. I can't even define the beauty of Nahargarhâ€¦
NAHARGARH FORT,"Nahargarh Fort was built in 1734 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, founder of Jaipur. This magnificient fort offers a breathtaking view of the Pink City. Some scenes in the movies Rang De Basanti, Shuddh Desi Romance and Sonar Kella were shot at this Fort. Jaipur wax museum is onâ€¦"
Great Fort in Jaipur,"This fort is great to visit in Jaipur. From the top of the fort you can see the entire city of Jaipur and it look amazing. The fort is great with the antique things placed in the fort which shows the history of the fort. After you visit the entire fort, then you can taste theâ€¦"
Come here for the city view!!,"Again just like Jaigarh fort, this one is nothing special compared to Amer. However, this fort gives a magnificent view of the city of Jaipur."
M in so love with this place ,It is the one of the best hangout place for the teenager in the jaipur.. here there is a kund where the film rang de basanti shooting has been done.. the view of the city from the nahargarh is sureal.. such a breathtaking view.. when you are fedup with daily chaos need some restâ€¦
My Nahargarh Fort Trail,"If you are a sunset freak and would like to see the whole Jaipur city through your lens, then this spot is highly recommended for you.   If you are looking for a historical walk or for an architectural figure in Jaipur city then I recommend you to visit Nahargarh Fort. This isâ€¦"
"Fantastic city view, Fort visit, eating at Nahargarh Fort Jaipur",When in Jaipur drive upto Nahargarh Fort. Enjoy this old rustic well defended monument of 18/19 centuries. Pay & 3/5 for tickets. Watch the sunset from high points while sitting down with tea snacks or beer. Sight monkeys. Enjoy the breeze. Bask in the sun in winter. Many other places in Fort to see and shop to buy from. Parking and wash rooms available. One in a lifetime visit when in Jaipur. See the Fort lighted up in night that govern the city as a sentinel on guard from danger and intrigue!
Sunset point!!,"Not much to see at nahargarh fort, but don't forget to miss the sunset point as it gives a fantastic view of sunset. Reach atleast an hour before the sunset as the fort get closed before sunset so the tourist who are inside gets the opportunity to take some awesome snap of sunset!!"
Good place for photography,"The best place in Jaipur for photography where you can click sunrise , sunset and whole Jaipur city photos"
Bit commercialised but we cant ignore the fort,The entry fees are decent but inside the charges of wax museum and sheesh Mahal which are opened only few years back are having high charges. To add further to commercialization there are a couple of restaurants opened in Nahargarh fort. The sunset point is good one along with the rooms of the 9 wives which are similar in structure. Takes approx. 1 hour to have a full view of the places inside the fort. The view of Golf course and Jaipur city from Nahargarh is also an excellent one.
Ok ok,Skip it if you want. Not much to see here. Just restaurants and one palace which has now only bug brands name mentioned.
OUR ANCIENT CITY,Naharghar fort in Jaipur is one of the best place to visit for tourists and also provide facility of restaurant at the top of fort.
Must visit sheesh mahal and wax museum,"This place is great. Must visit. We had already seen jaigarh fort so didn't see much fort but the sheesh Mahal here is unlike anything I have ever seen for its sheer beauty. Cameras are not allowed and the photo package is very expensive, I think 10000 rupees"
Adventures and excellent views,"The nahargarh fort is a small fort but the road and the view from here is amazing, you can enjoy bauli (water storage) it's a great architecture, this is the place for photo and view liver from here you can see Jaipur"
Brilliant views ,"Take advantage of the combined ticket which gives you entrance to 8 different sights, one of them being the Nahargarh Fort. You can enjoy the views from different viewpoints and don't miss the hidden passage way in the palace where the Maharaja could visit all his different wives unnoticed by the others."
Best Place to watch Jaipur Diwali,"I have visited the place twice during diwali season. The fort is much smaller compared to the nearby Jaigadh fort or Amer fort but the fort stands out for its amazing architecture and location.It is the best place to enjoy diwali in Jaipur. Entire Jaipur city can be seen from the fort.There is a famous step well near the fort where Rang de Basanti Lose control song was shot, which is also a major tourist attraction."
Another great stop,Another great fort with amazing views and fabulous for photographs.  We visited after the Amber Fort as they are close by. 
Supper Morning Place,If you want to love your morning. Travel to Nahargarh early in the morning. I love to visit Nahargarh every time.
Beautiful,So that is amazing place rimembr for our country history of King  so I wanted to again visit at next few years.
Relatively a newer fort in Jaipur and a period restaurant location,This is relatively a newrer fort overlooking the Jaipur city. The fort is now a location for modern art exhibitions. Some exhibition or the other is always going on. All Jaipur fort had elaborate water storage and purification facilities. This fort  also has a Bawdi andâ€¦
Sunset point and the city view.,The place is really good for the visitors. Entry closes at 5:25 pm but I was allowed on special request.The fort is elegant and presents the architecture of the times when Rajputs ruled the palace. There's a sunset point from where you can have a view of the layout of the Pinkâ€¦
Lovely morning out,"Beautiful building, hosting a sculpture exhibition when we were there, also being lovingly restored. Cheaper and less busy than the Amber Fort, and you can take a lovely walk up/down to/from it from the edge of town. Recommended."
Rang de Basanti,This is the smallest but best fort among the three main forts of Jaipur. Enjoy with yiur freinds at Padav and RDB point
Vacation,So much fun to visit this fort took a bicycle ride up.  Refused to ride down way to fast.  Our guides were wonderful no problem they got us a car to come down.  At the summit we had the and refreshments .  Do not miss
Love the view of the city ,I love the restaurant that is located at nahargarh fort. It gives you a very cozy feeling after a you walk a kilometer to get there. 
good,"there is nothing to see much here except for the big cannons. after the visit of amber fort, its lost its exictement . altouhg you are about the time of sunset, the view for here is pretty amazing and spectacular"
Surprisingly Good,"The view is worth going for if nothing else. The actual inside of the fort is more like a palace but all the rooms are extremely similar. They had an art exhibition on while we were there, which made us stay much longer than we would have normally. Without the exhibition it is a 1 hour visit to see everything inside and out. They are trying to make this a big attraction and have installed a wax museum and lots of eating places so it may become a major attraction as time goes on. It was busy on a weekend and the road to the top is not the greatest!"
royal imperial majestic,"offering awesome views of the city, this fort is located on a hill surrounded by forest, truly adventurous and amazing"
Not much to see,"In comparision to amber fort, there is nothing much to see at the fort except for the worlds biggest cannon. Though when we were leaving about sun set, its beautiful to look around the city from the fort"
good visit,there is nothing much to see in this fort except fort the biggest cannon that reside here. its nearby amber fort. but with large group or family one can enjoy. the view from this palace is though very beautiful
not for the fort but for sunset,"the palace is not much breath taking itself but known the home of the largest cannon built around that century. there is nothing much to see in the palace itself after you have seem amber fort. however, when we were leaving the fort, it about the sun set and view from there is breath taking and there is some serenity about it."
