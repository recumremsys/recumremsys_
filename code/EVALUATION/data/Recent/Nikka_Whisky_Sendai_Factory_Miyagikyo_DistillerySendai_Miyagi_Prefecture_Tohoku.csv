Something different and a wee dram for the cold :),"So after a bus ride we had a nice little visit to the Distillery, very interesting to hear the  history and story of it all.We had a lovely tour guide and which was in English and Japanesse and they gave us a few drams to try at the end.Certainley worth while going to pass an hour or so but wouldn't be in a hurry to return tbhI prefer the Irish to the scotch so sorry :)"
A lovely and calm trip out away from hustle and bustle! Lovely place.,Went here for a trip to get away from the city hustle and bustle. A very calm and peaceful place. When you get off the train at weekends there is a free shuttle service bus waiting for you that takes you to the door. And back again afterwards. So organised!! You pay for the tour and get an English speaking headset provided. You are taken round various parts of the site and it's all very interesting. They have a tasting session and a gift shop which was also brilliant. Warning - you won't get this at the Tokyo airports when you leave and they are too big for hand luggage - more than 100ml allowance so either buy small ones or put it in your case at high risk of breakage. I can tell you I have bought a bottle of Nikka Whisky in the UK since being back so don't worry about it. Great day out. Great experience.
Go if you like whiskey.,"I understand how people are up and down about the factory tour. It's 40+ minutes on the train from Sendai and then if you're not there during the weekend you have another 30-40 minutes walking to get into the hall. I did it on a day where it was probably 33°C and I'd already gone to see Yamadera. The humidity in the area is oppressive, and one of the Japanese tourists told me the area was picked in part for the humidity and how it would help create a great whiskey.Japanese tours can be a little cold. You have to look at things through windows and a lot of what goes on in a distillery is just looking at pipes and tanks. You don't even get to see the Coffey still, though they will point out the building. I've heard that the VIP tour gets to see a barrel being charred, but you have to be a VIP in the minds of Nikka Whiskey, not in your own mind.The best part is after the tour. There's a small bar where you can get short pours of Nikka for very little money. Where else can you even find Taketsuru 12, 17, and 21 and when I went the short pour of 21 was only ¥500! There was even a special edition Taketsuru that was ¥7,000 for a very short pour and I was glad I tried it.I'd recommend finding a non-driving way to get there so you can taste a little of everything. During the tour they tell you there's three types of Yoichi that they blend to make the single malt (it's my understanding that they sort the barrels into different flavor categories) and I had a taste of the Peaty and Salty was worth tasting on its own.Just remember, it might seem long way to go but just going from Osaka to Kyoto is going to take you longer and to me those cities are right next to each other."
How to get there on a weekday with minimal walking,"I thought I would drop this line to anyone thinking of going to the Nikki factory near Sendai.  I found lots of partial information before we went but nothing as specific as I would have liked.  I use a walking stick so some of the options were not open to me (such as the 2.4 kilometre walk from Sakunami station).So, if you want to get there with less walking, on a weekday (e.g., no shuttle bus) here is what to do From Sendai Station, wait at bus stop number ten and take bus number 840 toward Sakunami Onsen.  At the time of writing, the buses went at half past the hour (e.g, 11:30, 12:30 etc.).  The bus trip is long (about an hour) and not that interesting, so you could take something to read.Once on the bus you can read the screen at the front and keep an eye on station names, the Nikka factory stop does have a name and also an English advice message that this is where you get off for the NIkka factory.  This is all good news because otherwise you look like you are getting off in the middle of nowhere.  However there is a sign toward the NIkka factory, I just didn’t see it until I got off the bus.  Follow that sign down the road and you can’t miss it, although even the walk into the factory is quite long for someone with a minor disability.Once you get the to factory they have a list of all the train departure times from Sakunami (that is presuming you aren’t there on a weekend in which case there is the shuttle bus).  Nothing I read online indicated the availability of taxis in the area, however they ARE available once you get there and the lady at the Nikka desk booked a taxi for us, even timing it to arrive at an appropriate time for the end of the tour plus shopping but in plenty of time to get to Sakanumi train station to catch the train back.So that all worked perfectly for us.  I won’t say more about the factory and tour, others have said it all.  It was a nice day out and even more so as it was cherry blossom season and the place is quite beautiful at that time.  Good luck in your whisky adventures."
average visit experience and it takes over one hour to get there,"I only gave three points, because ... it is time consuming to get there and it only interesting for whisky buffs. And even then it is only an average destillery ... Let me explain.Getting there: The destillery can be reached by bus. The bus is starting at JR Sendai station. There is only one bus per hour and the bus takes over one hour itself. From the bus stop it takes another 10-15 minutes walk. There is also a train. But the closest train station (Sakunami) is 2,5km away from the destillery. --> Visiting the destillery really takes half a day.The destillery: The history of Whisky in Japan startet with Suntory and Nikka. Miyagikyo is the second big destillery of Nikka after the main destillery in Yoichi. For that reason alone the destillery is a point of interest for everyone who is interested in japanese whisky.The destillery provides a guided tour that does not require a reservation in advance. Big bonus point. After the tour you can sample 2 whisky free. For any additional dram you have to pay. They have a wide amout of Nikka whisky you can chose from. You can sample 21 year old whisky without the need to buy the whole expensive bottle or you can sample a whisky that you will not find in a bar or a store outside Japan. The price for a dram is really fair. Specially if you consider the prices of whisky in a japanese bar. The tasting is a big selling point to visit the destillery. And you can also by some ""Destillery Edition"" whisky that you only can purchase here at the destillery and nowhere elsse. Big point.And now the reasons why I only give three points:(1) The time to get there and getting back to Sendai. It really takes half a day. The visitor center closes at 4:30pm. So you need to take a bus before 1pm to have enough time for the guided tour (1h) and some tasting (at least 1h) and get back to the bus  stop in time.(2) The first impression of the distillery is not that remarkable. It looks like a factory. This is killing the mood a little bit.(3) The tour is quite ok but it is a standard tour that you can get in every destillery. You do not visit the Malting area and the mash tuns are behind glass.(4) Miyagikyo is the origin of the ""Coffey Malt"" and the ""Coffey Grain"". But the tour does not cover the coffey still itself from that these whisky are coming from. The show  a picture in the advertisement video bu that's it. This, in my opinion, is a big letdown! The Coffey Whisky is (for me) the major thing that seperates Miyagikyo from the rest. -- Even if the coffey still looks like something that belongs into a chemical lab or a oil raffinery. If own both coffey whisky and a really hoped to see there origin."
Nikka fun outside Sendai,We visited the Nikka factory following our visit to the nearby Akio Onsen. Our daughter in law loves whiskey and as a native of Japan has wanted to visit this iconic factory known for its history of bringing Scottish whiskey making to Japan. The area is stunning with nearby waterfalls and woods. The factory is nestled in the green woods and serves up a great history lesson on the process of making fine whiskey. I have done similar tours in Rum factories in Jamaica and they are  fascinating. You can also do a whiskey tasting after the tour as well. It was great fun and super enjoyable if you are in the area and have an hour or so to spare.
Great free tour if your love whisky,Free shuttle buses run to and from the near by train station! Well worth a visit if you're staying in Sendai. The whisky is delicious and the tour has english audio.
Great day out and tasting,"The tour is in Japanese but they will provide a recording in English to follow along. The highlight of the tour of course is the tastings! Shuttle from Sakunami station and 3 generous glasses of high quality Nikka Whisky are provided (along with non alcoholic refreshments) free of charge. I highly recommend the tour. The paid samplers of aged whisky (including the award winning 17yr Takesuru blend) and the gift shop is reasonably priced.Of course, as you'll be tasting alcoholic drinks the best way to travel is by train rather than bringing a sober driver. The JR line is convenient to Kita Sendai and Sendai stations but does not run very often (especially late in evenings or on Sundays or holidays). I do not recommend taking the last tour in the day as there will be a long wait at Sakunami station to return to the city."
Take a tour and enjoy whiskey,"We really enjoyed our visit to the Nikka Distillery.   Getting there was easy.   If you take the train from Sendai, be sure it is fast, direct train.  On the weekends a shuttle bus is waiting to take you to the distillery.  The tours are free and in Japanese.   We followed along in English on our smart phones using the website provided.   At the end of the tour is the tasting, two different whiskers and an apple wine.  Premium whiskey is available for purchase (1/2 shots so you can try a few).    The prices in the shop were reasonable, but we had found bottles of the same whiskey for better prices at a tax free shop in Sendai.   If we were to do this visit again we would try to combine it with a trip to the nearby hot springs."
Nice whiskey distillery ,"It took 45 minute from jr sendai station (sendai station to sakunami station) , at sakunami station they provides free shuttle bus (4min to distillery).Tour is free ( about 45-50min), after tour whiskey test (2type  of whiskey and 1 type of apple wine).There is a shop with many kind of whiskey."
"Mildly interesting, difficult to get to.",This location is NOT geared for foreign tourists (or certainly was not when I went). It's mildly interesting if you are keen on knowing more about the history of Japanese whiskey. The tasting at the end is of course popular!My favourite part was the funny little lanyard they give to the 'designated driver' to make sure they don't get served alcohol.
Nice distillery tour,"Not to easy to get to from Sendai, but a train ride and good walk will be worth it for the whisky fan.Tour is free, only in Japanse, but there is an English spoken device available.There is also a shop with a load of distillery only bottles. Tasting bar is available as well (at a fee), in the tour a couple of drams are included as well.You can take photo's everywhere, but no filming inside the facility."
"Beautiful Setting, Average Tour","Nikka Miyagikyo DistilleryAccess:We drove to the distillery from Utsunomiya after a brief stop in Yamagata.  Parking was easy and access to the main tour building was very convenient.Tour Experience:During our visit, the tour was only offered in Japanese, which was expected based on a quick phone call to distillery staff.  There is no charge for the tour, which is very nice.  If you are someone who frequently visits other distilleries, you might find the tour lacking in detail and in the allowed proximity to the production processes.  One of my favorite whiskies from Nikka is produced using their Coffey still.  Tour members are not allowed to enter the building with the Coffey still, so that was somewhat disappointing.  The giant pot stills are amazing to see in person.  Tour participants finish their experience in the gift shop and tasting room.  Some small samples of Nikka whiskies are offered to each tour participant.  Overall:I would recommend visiting the Miyagikyo distillery, if you are already in the area.  Even though I am an avid whisk(e)y lover, I did not find the experience worthy of making a special trip.  In my personal opinion, the whole tour felt rather detached and cold.  I think Nikka could learn a lot by benchmarking some of the Scottish or American Bourbon distillery tour experiences."
Sightseeing ,"Had a wonderful time there. Was just in time for the distillery tour． There was some whiskey tasting after the tour, but unfortunately couldn't participate."
It's a good experience. ,It help me understand Japanese whisky. But it's not easy to get there. I drove a rent car. It took 45 minutes from the Sendai station.
Best Part Was the Sample Tasting at the end,"I believe going to a whiskey distillery is a good distraction. Alcohol is made pretty much the same way whether you're making beer or whiskey. Our tour was in Japanese (I was with Japanese people btw) so I didn't really learn anything new or interesting that I hadn't seen on a History Channel ""Modern Marvels"" re-run. The best part of the tour was being able to sample 3 different products at the end of the tour and I found a nice, smooth whiskey I liked. However, I couldn't even find that whiskey in Japan, not even in Sendai later on the day."
nice free tour,"To book a tour for English, you have to call or fax. We just dropped in. If there're a big tour, you might not get in the tour.From Sendai JR Station, you take a train, but some trains don't go all the way to JR Sakunami Station, so check the time table for the train before you go. Otherwise, you'll end up waiting for the connecting train for an hour like us. For weekdays, there're free shuttle from JR Sakunami Station to the distillery. You can also take a local bus, but you have to walk about 10min from the bus stop to the distillery. If you want to walk from JR Sakunami Station to the distillery, it'd take 20min.The tour is basically in Japanese only. For English speakers, you need to get a recorded tour and play at each station for English explanation. All displays are Japanese. When we visited on mid-April weekend, as we're the only participants, we're in a private tour.The biggest fun is free tasting at the end. We're provided 2 kinds of whiskies and an apple wine. They also offer tonic to mix with whiskey and cold tea/soda for free. If you want to try high quality whiskies, you can taste for a pay at the bar. At the shop, you can also purchase different kinds of whiskies. Whiskies at Narita Duty-Frees sell only premium Nikka whiskies only (think $500 a bottle). Super Nikka isn't available at Narita Duty-Frees."
Nice tour terrible whiskey,It was interesting to find out in the manufacturing process of the whiskey but the only downside is this whiskey is terrible.I have tasted many variaties of whiskeys but this is not worst I have but it is certainly no where near the best.
Pretty good!,I went here on a day trip by car with my boyfriend. It's really pretty in the autumn and on the way there are some nice spots to stop off. The factory tour is free and not too long. The best part is at the end where you get to sample all the whiskey and wine and perhaps when the non driver is a little tipsy the next stop is the gift shop. They have some really nice things that make great presents. They had some really nice yoghurt covered raisins and other foods as well as big and mini bottles of booze.
"Public transportation is very few, but worth to visit","Free-tasting : 3 kind of whiskyPaid-tasting : unfortunately not available when I visited, so -1 pointFactory limited edition whisky and snacks available @souvenir shop"
Can enjoy the tasting of 17-year-old TSURU just here,Multi-award-winning Nikka Whisky opened its 2nd distillery in the suburb of Sendai in 1969.I joined a free 40-minute Japanese guided tour in the distillery which included a free tasting shot each of 3 brands of Nikka at the end of the tour. It had started at almost 20-minute intervals since 9 o'clock in the morning. I enjoyed tasting of my favorite blended whisky '17-year-old Tsuru' but unfortunately it was sold out and I have sadly read the end of availability is on Aug 31 in 2015.
"Learn about Nikka Whiskey, and get Unlimited Samples","There is no entrance fee to go to the factory, however it is about a 1000 Yen bus ride to get to the factory from Sendai Station. They have tours that depart every hour. Please note that the tour is in Japanese, unless you are lucky enough to get an English speaker. You must do the tour, to get to the sampling area. After the Whiskey tour, you arrive at the gift shop and Whiskey sampling area. You can try different ages of Whiskey, as well as Apple Whiskey (lovely). They also give you a bucket of ice so you can add to your Whiskey as you please.There is no limit to the amount of samples, however if you stay for more than an hour, or get too drunk, they will apologize that they have to kick you out."
