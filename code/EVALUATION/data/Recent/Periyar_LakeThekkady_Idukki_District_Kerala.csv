Right place for Natur lovers,"Here you enjoy boating in the sanctuary Lake.This is a right place for nature lovers.Trekking,in the forest and hotel stay in the sanctuary is available . Budget hotel PERIYAR HOUSE and luxury ARANYA NIVAS is available for booking. Extra luxury ( live like a King) LAKE PALACEis also available."
Eye catching views around,"This  artificial lake in Thekkady is one of the main attractions of the destination. Boating in Periyar is the main activity loved by most tourists visiting the place. The 100 year old lake set in thickly forested Western Ghats won't disappoint nature enthusiasts. There may not be much of wild life spotting but boating in this lake with dense forest all around is an experience worth-it that draws scores of tourists to Thekkady through out the year.Tickets can be booked at the counter of pre booked online through Periyar reserve's website. It is better to book the tickets for your preferred slot beforehand as the tickets get sold out very fast. Best time to experience the boating is early morning. 7.30 am slots are the best as the surroundings are serene during that time and there are chances of spotting some rare species of birds too during that time. If you are visiting Thekkady from Munnar or Alleppey, best is to book it for day 2 of your stay in Thekkady."
Beautiful Thekkady Periyar lake,Nature and wildlife. Very peaceful surroundings and natural tour visiting place. We are very enjoyed.
Serenely beautiful,"For the best chance of seeing wildlife you need to be there in the early morning. Unfortunately, by the time tickets were bought, bus transfer from car park taken and next boats ready to go it was 7.30 and I suspect we had missed the best of the animals coming down to drink. Certainly I had expected to see more wildlife than we did. However, the lake was lovely in the morning light.There are different size boats and ours was one of the larger ones. Tickets give your seat numbers; best to try for upper level and at the side not middle for best views. You must wear the life jackets but they are bulky and not entirely comfortable as well as impeding peoples view between heads. The crew do a good job of making people stay seated which helps with viewing from the inside seats. They also offer to take photos for you through their binoculars and from the best vantage points."
Beautiful setting,We went on an early morning boat trip. Very scenic and peaceful but sadly we were unlucky and did not see any elephants although the boat a little way ahead did!! They are wild animals and it is the luck of the draw!! The seats were initially damp because of early morning condensation but soon dried. A lovely location but it is only luck as to what you may see.
Worst,Dnt visit ever.we wasted 2 hrs..nt a single animal.....just monkey...boat boring.....u can skip thekkary.
MONKEYS MAY LOVE TO SNATCH AND CARRY YOUR CARRY-BAGS WHILE WAITING FOR BOARDING ANNOUNCEMENT,"The Boat-journey was good, could feel the nature and spotted some animals like, Elephant, Deer from a long distance and a variety of birds, particularly Cranes.  The holding area,  for waiting before boarding announcement, has lot of (friendly) monkeys, but it is advised not to…"
Extremely boring,"There is 1 hour ride in Periyar lake through which we can see the animals on lakeside. Nothing to do in boat. Animals, if seen, are also very distant. Binoculars are available on rent but of no use. One should definitely avoid this place in Thekkady."
The real boating experience!,"It is indeed a marvellous opportunity for the wild life lovers. we saw a number of animals (Malabar Squirrel, Asian Elephants, variety of birds and spotted deer etc. But the trip is quite costly for the foreigners. The foreigners have to pay around ten times more than the nate…"
Boating ride,"We went for for boat ride in periyar lake to see the wild animals unfortunately we didn't see what we was expecting..we saw some deers,bulls,pigs,monkeys,and elephants  But its was good experience over all"
Waste of an afternoon,A group of 20 of us took the boat ride for the afternoon on the lake.  We were required to put on very bulky life jackets and I could hardly move or see over the top of the life jacket.   I was sitting in from the rail and could see nothing and you are not allowed to move about…
Don’t expect to see lots of wildlife and take the smaller single story boat.,Tried from UK and while in India to pre-book tickets on the KTDC site- never worked. But this was fortunate as our driver organised them and we got seats on the small 7.30 am boat.  Everyone is given a seat number but still there’s  a lot of jostling to get to the boats. We…
Wide range of options - full or part day.,We took a walk in the early morning that involved crossing an inlet on a dodgy raft (not for everyone - I was a bit intrepid!).  A small group of 6 was led round the lakeside path by a very knowledable local guide who seemed to know everything! and even took fantastic photos for…
A serene place with tree trunks half submerged..scenes of years bygone,"We took a cruise on the lake on a rainy windswept day and managed to sight several bison, deer, egrets and cormorants on well run and life raft equipped passenger ferry boats. Well worth the time and the money. Sitting on the side seats makes photography easier"
Much better than expected,"We went on a boat cruise around the lake. Of course there is the usual jostling to get on board, all a bit pointless given that everyone has assigned seats. The obligatory lifejackets are a bit restrictive. But the cruise itself is good. We saw plenty of wildlife (no tigers of…"
Best and only place for sightseeing in thekkady,"If you are in thekkady , do not miss this place, this is one of the best place in thekkady . You can book this activity directly on place or from your hotel travel desk too. Their is nothing else in thekkady apart from Periyar lake and wildlife centuary. You need 406 hrs to…"
Great experience ,Great place with great view and boat ride is awesome. Boat @7:30 AM will give you chances to see some animal. 
Awful!,The boat tour on Lake Periyar is to be avoided. This is not a gentle trip into the wilderness reserve of Periya Tiger Reserve - instead you are crammed onto a boat with up to 100 other sightseers and your view is more likely to be that of a life jacket worn by the person in…
Saw elephants,"Lovely boat ride, saw elephants by the water edge.   Also ate at the  Lake Palace which was delightful.   "
Morning Boat ride review,"Morning Boat ride review  There are many unbalanced reviews on here, some say there are no animals or it’s a rip-off. This is a nature reserve and seeing animals is all about chance and the weather conditions. If you go into this park expecting to see every animal you imagine…"
Pleasant boat ride,"We went on Jan 18 2020 for boat ride. We had booked 3.30 pm ride online at ktdc-boating.com. The ride was pleasant and serene. We were lucky enough to see few deer, bison and an elephant.   Online tickets costs 500 rupees whereas onsite booking is 255 rupees. KTDC should be…"
Boat ride to see nature,"We visited periyar lake on Dec 31, 2019. we planned to visit early morning as they told that we can see animals mostly in the morning. As we travelled yesterday from this date, we are not able to wake up and couldn’t make our early 7 a.m boating. Finally, we can catch only with…"
Just a boat ride!,The boat ride was pleasant enough although we were fortunate to be sitting on the side of the boat so at least we had a good view of the lake. Those sitting in the centre of the boat would not get the same view.  What little wildlife there was to be seen could only be viewed at…
Amazing ✌️ view ,"Periyar lake is very picturesque and enjoyed alot with family , we enjoyed the ride with watching different types  of birds & animals. Kingfisher is the best one , we recommend every one to enjoy this ride, sharing few pictures"
Great boat and awesome weather,"Took the boat ride for 90 minutes, they follow a path, we went it was hot but while coming back the windchill was pretty bad, better to be covered and ask for upper deck for a better view"
The national park was wonderful!,Well worth a visit just to see this man made lake and the gorgeous vistas and animals! It an early morning start and the weather was perfect.  The only issues was that the rangers would not allow us to get up from our seat during the 1+hr ride..Not sure why.  I suspect they did…
Enjoyed the visit,"We visited Elephant junction with family with one kid (4 years). It was a very nice experience. One can have elephant ride, can take bath with elephant and have some paid show with elephant. We opted only for the elephant ride. They took us inside jungle for 5-10 mins walk.…"
Poor maintenance,"This was the most disappointing part of our Thekkady tour. We were told there are only 5 boat rides per day- at 7.30,9.30,11.30 am,2.30 pm and 5.30 pm. And if we reach the lake by 6.30 am, we may get the 7.30 ride and some animals may be sighted. To reach the lake, private…"
Good place but the boat ride is very touristy,The lake is AWesome and have great views all around. The access to the lake is through private bus run by the govt. and you have to take that to reach there. The bus ride is short ride of 20-30mins and is not bad. The boating Center is really crowded and there are people…
Amazing boat ride ,Nice big lake and good organisers lake tours in a huge boat. Worth the two hours in calm waters and some gorgeous scenes to rem 
Wow feeling ,"Except the access to KTDC boats and the type of safety vest , it was a superb experience . It was very scenic and compares to best in anywhere in the world . KTDC can market it well"
Worst management of boat ticket,"After standing 2 hours in the queue, it was announced that tickets are sold. There is no diplay about no. of ticket available for offline booking etc. Moreover, side business of ticket selling is also prominant. Very poor management and man handling."
Nothing to see,"We booked online for KTDC boat which cost 500rs per pax. When we went to kumily town we discovered as foreigner we have to pay additional 500rs per pax for entrance while locals pay 45rs per pax. We have to queue early in the morning like everyone else to collect our tickets while others simply queue to buy ticket at 255rs. There's really no benefits to buy from KTDC website and pay double. All the passengers were made to wear a heavy bulky life jacket around their neck (see photo). They were also not allowed to stand or walk around, reminds me of school days when classroom of students  must absolutely sit still. Hard to take  photos.We took the boat at 730am as recommended  to be best time to see animals but for the one and half hour trip all we saw was a one feet long lizard. The children on board were bored stiff so the parents tried to cheer them up by excitingly pointing to that lizard. The children started screaming oh I saw it! Hahaha that was so funny, when theres nothing else to see even a small lizard will do the trick.You have to come with absolutely zero expectations to not get disappointed."
Serene and beautiful!,"We went bamboo rafting in periyar lake. It was a great experience. Initially, we were a bit skeptical but after seeing the huge sturdy rafts, we were more than excited to experience rafting in the lake. Our tour comprised of a walk in the jungle to the lake and then rafting. We enjoyed every part of the tour. It was a great weather day as well."
Nature lovers Paradise,The boating in the lake gives all the nature lovers a feeling of 'I want more'. Cool breeze during the boat ride made it more enjoyable. Different species of birds gave a chance to photographers and curiosity to bird watchers.
Vacation,Very difficult to spot any wild life and the boat we were taken in did not allow any movement so it was kind of borring
Avoid it as much as you can,"The river safari is not worth it. Tourist has to buy ticket for bus ride till the ferry point. At ferry point another ticket for ferry ride, the ride is worthless it take toll of time and energy, seats are uncomfortable with torn away life jackets. There is hardly any sightings,…"
Great,A very huge natural lake very nice & well maintained.Wherever your eyes goes its all water & greenery giving a very good feel
Go with less expectations,Go with less expectations    We went to Peryar Tiger Reserve or sanctuary in the morning. Theie official bus will pick you up from picking point. The bus ticket is for Rs 65 per individual. The bus drops you at the boating point. The ticket of the boat is fir Rs 255 per…
Well organised and a good boat but nothing out of the ordinary seen!,My wife and myself are currently holidaying in Thekkady staying at the Greenwood’s Resort (Review to follow) and this afternoon we went on a 90 minute KTDC Ltd Boat Trip on Lake Periyar which is in the Periyar Tiger Reserve and National Park.  This involved being dropped off at…
Timing is everything,We went for the boat trip without any high expectations because we had booked only 1 hour ride due to time constraints. We were informed that wild animals are rarely spotted in the afternoon which was the time we selected to enjoy the boat ride. But good fortune smiled upon us and we were able to spot a company of elephants and a samba deer drinking from the Periyar lake. Complete silence is expected on these boat tours otherwise the din might scare away the thirsty animals coming to banks of the lake.
Thekkady,Great place to visit. Natural and thick Forest. It is a wild life sanctuary and tiger reserve. Gust can have boating which is an unforgettable experience.
Serene and Peaceful but nothing too interesting..,"We took the Cruise in the morning. Although the lake is beautiful, we didnt get to see any animal during the two hours. Was a bit disappointed."
Boat ride ,"It is a beautiful lake  providing a great back drop for an exciting boat ride . As you sail along one can see a variety of animals and birds. The guide points out the name of the birds too.The view of deer, sambar and bisons grazing in the grass is very exciting. I think the best view was the sighting of the elephants."
Chaotic management.,"Forest looks really good but staff members are not well trained or not much serious about there duty. No organisation at all. System of ticketing, entering and exiting is super chaotic. Staff members don't understand and talk Hindi and English, only local language is mode of communication here. At such a famous and touring place it is not acceptable."
Forest never forget,"Excellent service by management,,good accommodation of boat,nature give you a relax in boating view, elephant,bear,wild buffalo,birds mostly seen"
Beautiful place.,Great place to spend quality time. The views are amazing. Very relaxed atmosphere. Nice to see local tourists having fun. Very entertaining.
To Periyar,"Periyar lake is so beautiful I can not define in words. Really god's own country. I have done boating morning time. The wind passes so cold, Specially for those who have kids please take some woollen cloths for kids. Very rarely you can see wild animal like tiger, but it may be possible in morning time."
Average boat ride in Beautiful Periyar Lake ,The lake is very beautiful and surrounded by Periyar Tiger Reserve. However we did not see any animal. Also the Double decker boat of Kerala Forest Department is very old. We were bit worried about the health of the boat (looked very old) mainly because we knew that there was a tragic accident had occurred in Periyar Lake in October 2009 when a similar boat turned swiftly and tilted and sank wherein 45 people had died.Also we did not enjoy the boating. It was budget travel kind of ride with many people in a big boat. The people who did not get window seat did not get proper view. I do not recommend this boat ride as it seems not so safe and also it’s not worth because no animal could be seen in 90 min ride.They can privatise it and arrange cruise boat with food and drinks.
Complete lack of organisation.,"We were told to aim for the 7:30-9:00 am boating trip as this would offer the best chance of seeing animals. We were told to arrive at 6am to buy the ticket as it may get busy. At 6am there were already hundreds of people queuing up to buy park entrance tickets from a single ticket booth. A sign warned you that purchasing a park entry ticket and riding the bus into the park would not guarantee that you would be able to buy a ticket for boating, the tickets for which were sold inside the park.When we eventually reached the front of the queue, we asked if we would likely be able to get a ticket for boating. We were told ‘no’. They had already sold over 360 tickets and the capacity was 350. We went home. The organisation was non existent. People were literally fighting in order to push to the front of queues and get onto buses. Don’t bother."
Awesome place,Best place to visit.very attractive and enjoyable place for families and friends.lot to see. Scenery is stunning and outstanding.
Excellent  lake,"Going by boat in periyar lake was like a dream . The beauty and cleanliness  looked like some European destination. Being born and brought up in india we are used to see garbage on all tourist places.but this was so clean virgin beauty,so soothing to the soul. The transfers were smooth .beware of monkeys at boating point."
Beautiful Area,"We visited the lake and viewed it from several locations and never ceased to be wowed by its beauty and setting. A Bamboo raft ride on it was a bonus, particularly when we sighted some elephants on the hillside."
Periyar Lake (pound beautiful),Periyar Lake is very large and beautiful location in this around area. I like this 👌 pound 👌😍.Thank yoy 😊
Lovely place,"It is worth to visit if you are nature lover, don't expect to spot the wild animals like tiger etc. Though it holds amazing beauty."
Kerela trip,"The boat ride on the lake should be done early morning to get a cool climate and this also increases the chances of you sighting more birds and animals. We managed to see few birds, bison, sambar deer, etc. The trip is ow and relaxing more to enjoy the surrounding nature, bird…"
Beware,Heavily promoted but to see the wildlife we were told that you need to catch the 7.30am boat. We went at 11.30am and didn’t see any animals apart from sighting a few birds on tree tops. The boat cruses at a very slow speed and generally was boring. 
Best place with online booking,For boating only 25 tickets are sold online.   And you have to book a day before in online.  Be there before an hour since your vehicle can not go close to the lake and you have to travel 4 km in the forest department vehicle.  The place is crowded in weekends and in holidays so…
Good experience but not as it is hyped,We went on 6th oct 2019 in early morning slot. First thing is if you are not residing in periyar foundations resort then you have to wake up early.. First stand ib the quee of bus ticket of 20 rs and park ticket for 45/- per adult.. That too early morning around 5.30 am. Then…
Good time for boa timing. ,I went boating with my kid... Good one.... We saw a group of dear and wild buffaloo... We need to wear life jacket compulsory.. 
Not so interesting ride. ,"Binoculars can be hired for 50Rs, without which it's difficult to view animals. Only bison and deers can be seen at a distant. After 30 minutes the ride becomes uninteresting because of same views and animals. I was told March was the best season, since animals come to Lake for…"
Gorgeous lake. ,It is a clean beautiful place with many scenic mountain tops to view. The boat ride was slow enough to be able to appreciate the water. 
Picturesque ,"Did the one and half hour boat ride at 9.30. Very peaceful and relaxing, beautiful scenery, but quite cold.  Saw one wild pig and a few deer, I wouldn’t really expect to see anything else, certainly not a tiger.  If you go early morning-7.00 there is a possibility of seeing…"
Feel the nature,"Best place in Idukki District Kerala,  purely nature reserve forest, properly maintain by the government "
FANTASTIC CRUISE RIDE,"Cruise tour really provides a beautiful and fantastic experience. It is inside the Periyar Tiger Reserve. While you are on the cruise riding through the river you can see elephants, bison, deer, birds and many other animals inside the jungle that surrounds the river.  ONE MUST…"
Great boat trip,"One of the staff in the boat helped us in spotting and identifying animals and birds. We captured  good shots of wildlife including  wild boar, monkeys and birds. Well worth taking the boat ride. Binoculars are useful"
Thekkady,Periyar lake is the part of Thekkady wild life sanctuary- tiger reserve- owned  and manged by both state and central government. only KTDC had permission for boating through the lake  which is the part of mullapperiyar reservoir can enjoy the wildlife nature as well as animals. lot of private tour operators conducting tour to thekkady
Boat trip,Expected to see more wildlife and it’s also hard to get good views of the animals from the boat so not so good
Average,Good boat ride...Excellent support staff...saw few birds and Animals . don't miss this one. The journey to the lake reception area and also the boat was very comfort able. There were lot of monkeys and one should be careful carrying any eatables.
Fabulous,Really  relaxing.   amazing view from the  top. Boating was the best part . it was the new Exeperiance for me and my wife.
Thekkady lake cruise,Cruise by two decked launch for one and half hour on lake adjoining Perriyar Forest. Options for viewing animals on forest embankment are better in first cruise at 07:30 hrs. Inconvenience felt due to nonavailabiliy of online booking.
Place to release your stress from City Life,"It is beautiful Place to visit if interested in Nature and Wild Life . We stayed in Ranger Wood ..an really good place with Pool and beautiful View of Forest from your Balcony and Toilet . You can see Wild Buffalo, Deer and Dogs if your are fortunate from the Hotel Itself . There is a Periyar Boating trip in the lake which will take around Two Hours for which you need to collect the Ticket form the wild life office in the city . It is worth the trip. you can sit by the lake and feel your stress evaporate ,"
"Boating good for overview of landscape and lake, not so much for wildlife","I expected great opportunities for wildlife, as being on water is less disturbing and intrusive than on land and provides a unique perspective. I was disappointed. Jeep safari will provide so much better wildlife opportunities than that of boating in its current offering.Firstly the boats are very large with lots of people on them, all with different objectives, creating noise and movements at all time. The captain did not seem interested in catering for wildlife enthusiasts, so passed rather hastily to keep up with predetermined schedule rather than savor the little wildlife seen.You will likely see lots of cormorants, perched, in the water or in the air. Wild boars are also likely seen. I also saw several sambar deer. The mammals were all on the banks, but still very far from the boat, so not even with a telephoto lens would you get any interesting shots, like you do on a jeep safari. Boating only recommended for landscape views."
Don't Miss this,If you are visiting Kerala for vacation then don't give a second thought to visit this beautiful lake. The quiet and pleasant atmosphere around the lake was soothing and releiving
The cabin by the lake ,While we were doing the boating inside the periyar lake I was reminded of this movie. The lake is huge and super pretty. The wilderness will give you the chills. We saw some animal in the morning boating but no elephants could be spotted. You can smell the forest here and you can enjoy sometime in silence with nature and be one with her.
Kerala trip ,This year less water. Lot of natural flora and fauna  to see. Sometimes you get to see the animals coming to quench their thirst 
Did not met expectations,"Boating at the lake did not justify its purpose. First of all you need to take 65 rs ticket to reach the boating point. Later you discover that another 255 rs per person to be paid for boating. Even if you make your mind to pay and explore the sanctuary via boat in the lake, you…"
Periyar Tiger Reserve,The Boat tour of Periyar Reserve is not much worth it. There  are very less chances of sighting any animal except the Nilgiri Langur. Mainly because of the number of people visiting the place. Forest deparment has 3 boats there which accomodate around 80-100 People in a single…
A wonderful relaxing  boat ride,We had a great time. Although we didn't see much wildlife. The guide onboard   took some amazing pictures for me... thank you.. this is well worth a visit
Lake in the forest,We had very good experience and we could see few animals. Please don't miss this one. The journey to the lake reception area and also the boat was very comfort able. There were lot of monkies and one should be careful carrying any eatables. If you don't have any thing the…
Uncooperative place.,"We travelled from far and went there with senior citizens,small children's and foreigners. Unfortunately there was a strike for the bus that goes in and private bus were not allowed to go in. No ulternate measures were provided on the event of strike. No wheelchair facility.…"
Nice,"It was a nice experience . We saw many animals like elephants wild boar, Birds and all. We recommend others to visit the thekkady main attraction boating"
Good,"Periyar lake, beautiful place for enjoy few hours, not a must visit place, anyone like to see lake and sit infront must vist here , good for u"
Jewel in the Forest ," The endless lake is just nestled between the hills, it’s breathtaking view to see the thick forest and lush green patches. Boating in the lake is an excellent experience where one see different type of birds, bisons, hordes of wild pigs. We could also see a family of Elephants…"
Lovely Lovely lake and boat cruise,"An early morning cruise that starts at 730 in the morning goes for 2 hours is really amazing, if you have a good luck, wild elephants, bisons, wild boars, otters, deer can be seen along the lake. We did not have lady luck smiling on us and could manage to see only otters, bisons…"
Helpful boat staff even to the extent of taking pictures with my camera!,The trip was soothing and the sighting of a few birds and herds of deer and bison made the boating experience worth it while.
Great experience ,"Absolutely amazing destination, quite unusual boat ride I had. The landscape was very green and mesmerising. They kept the place quite clean."
Beautiful lake,Beautiful place and lake displays different shades during rains. Thick surrounding forest with animals. You need to be lucky to see elephants.
One of the most beautiful boating experience,"The boating in Periyar lake was our one of the most beautiful boating experience of life. Though we could see only deer, biosons and wild pigs but the beautiful natural greenery around the lake was mesmerizing."
Beautiful place...,Beautiful place... Amazing scenic ambience ... With serene atmosphere...   Always try to avail the boat trip in Lake Periyar at 7.30 am ...    Enjoy ...
Beautiful lake,"Beautiful lake cum reservoir. You are taken around the reserve in an old fashion boat which is terribly slow. The boats could be much better, faster and noiseless. Overall the lake and reserve is a beautiful experience!!"
Come and see original wildlife ,"In Periyar lake , you can watch a lot of original nature and various wildlife which is fantastic for all tourists , you can rent a boat with a guide who explains you about the area"
Big awesome lake,"Big lake with good boating ride. When you are lucky, you can spot out some animals. Definitely you will see deer & ox. Sometimes you can find boar & elephants too. Kids can enjoy the ride. You can watch some birds that can swim."
A different boating experience !!,This boat ride is the main activity at Thekkady . Vehicles will be allowed inside the main gate only if you have booked rooms in any of the KTDC property . Otherwise KTDC bus is available from the parking area. The boating experience is quite different and if you are lucky you will get a glimpse of wild elephants on the banks of the river. KTDC Lake palace hotel is in an island in the river and we need to go by a boat .
Enjoy the boat ride,A boat ride in Periyar Lake is among the must do things for tourists in Thekkady. The boat house is usually crowded so you can book the tickets online though there is a service charge. The boat ride in the Periyar Lake is a wonderful experience as you get to see birds nesting and if you are lucky (we weren't) you can spot wildlife - elephants mostly that come to the lake in the morning and evening to drink water. Preferably take the early morning or last ride in the evening. Do not carry any eatables as there are lot of monkeys near the boat house.
Best activity @thekkady,"Best activity to see the whole periyar tiger reserve forest, by lucky we have seen some elephants at the time of boating, recommended to every one."
Must visit place in thekkady,Worth to visit periyar lake by boat as it covers the actual jungle area where you might sight wild animals if you are lucky. You have an option of Jeep safari to explore periyar jungle but they only cover the jungle border areas which would be useless. While boating in periyar lake there is at least chance to sight animals especially at morning and afternoon timing as lake is in the middle of the jungle. We were taken by bus to the jungle area for which they charge 65rs.(45rs entry ticket and 20rs for bus) Per person. And for boating they charge 255rs per person for 90 min ride. We saw wild buffalo and some deers who came to drink water in afternoon. Place is really superb to explore. On line ticket booking facility is also available from where you can book your tickets. And if you reach before 45min of selected  time slot you can also get tickets easily over there.
"Best things to do in Thekkady .Pathetic management, avoid it, waste of time.","I tried to visit this place twice. The information center told me to come 1 hr before the boat ride which starts from 7.30am onwards till 5.30pm and each ride is of 1.30 hr. As of now ,there process is first purchase bus ticket from Jungle information centre ,stand in queue for bus for your turn. Go inside the jungle and again stand in queue to buy boat ticket at boating place. Then wait till your turn come to on-board the boat in which along with you almost 100 people will be there jam packed to see animals on the lake shore while doing boat ride. My experience i visited 6.30 AM to buy bus ticket, boarded the bus at 7.00 as was standing in queue, then went inside the jungle in bus till the boating starting point ,waited in queue and tickets were sold out for 7.30 boat ride. Next slot was of 9.30 AM and we have to wait in queue for 2 hr again with infants in queue as well. No facility of water also. Pathetic / worst management, they should sell all tickets at 1 point only, and that is bus boarding point. Better avoid it, not worth the time wasted there. You can better see animals in zoo as no grantee you will see animals in lake."
A slow ride around the lake to see the wildlife.,"We wanted to experience the lake and its wildlife and were advised that a 3:30pm trip would be best.  We arrived at the coach park in Thekkady and bought our ticket then took the short trip on the bus in to the nature reserve.  We joined a large number of people all waiting for the cruise boats.  This was all a bit chaotic but we eventually found our boat and went aboard.  Lifejackets were mandatory and the boats are designed so there cannot be a rush of people from one side to the other which would destabilise the boat so we felt confident that they pay attention to safety.  We took a slow, leisurely trip for an hour and a half around the lake and, although we didn’t see much in the way of wildlife, it was a pleasant afternoon.When we returned to the lakeside we walked in to the hotel in the park and had a beer before taking the bus back out of the park. We both commented that if we came again we would consider staying in one of the two hotels actually inside the reserve."
Peaceful place,The best place to visit in Kerala. The peaceful environment makes it an amazing stay. Highly recommend.
Simply Beautiful,"Bit of a scrum queuing for tickets & getting through the barriers to get down to the boats, but once you're out there on the lake itself it's really good.  Very annoying to have to wear a lifejacket the whole time, but that's the deal.  The scenery is stunning, the colours beautiful, especially when reflected in the still waters. Plenty of birdlife - herons, cormorants, kites, kingfishers etc.  Plenty of wildlife - wild boar, deer, gaur, monkeys. We were  unlucky (apparently) not to also see elephants bathing in the morning. Got so many beautiful photos. The basic trip takes about 90 - 120 minutes."
Better than I thought it would be,"Lovely to see different things from the boat. The crew were eager to point out things of interest. Spotted bison and wild boar, and many types of birds. Bring binoculars!"
Nothing much to expect,"Went for the first trip. Although its a nice scenic tour, if you are expecting to see elephants, you have to be very lucky. We managed to spot a few otters, wild boars and bisons. And of course, a lot many birds. Overall, an uneventful ride"
Must visit place,We have enjoyed boat ride in the lake. It is managed by the govt and it starts with local bus stand from where you will be taken to the national park from govt bus. Entry fee and transportation will be paid in advance and again you have to fill form and make payment at lake side office for boat ride. You have to fill form with all the members details to get tickets. You need to make payment in cash only. They are not accepting any kind of digital payment. Entire journey is memorable. You may enjoy natural scenic beauty along with various birds and wild animal during boat ride.
Lovely lake and Forest,The Periyar lake is nice; we went for a boat ride out in the first morning slot. We saw a lot of birds and bison. We were hoping to see some elephants but we went the entire boat ride without seeing any. Tigers are very few...so the chance of seeing them in miniscule.
Once you should visit , Boating at the lake is one of the must thing  we should do in the vist of Thekkady it is a great experience and you may get a chance to see wild animals and you can book boating tickets online in advance 
Summer season not good visit here ,"Very hot over there in theakkady ,1 day sufficient for theakkady ,winter is very good visit here only one over there Thean lots activities here spending money it's good "
Boat ride,After getting the ticket for the ride one must wait for the transportation from forest department which is usually short compared to waiting time for return journey.They have upper and lower deck.The lower deck is not good as your 50% view will be blocked unless u sit in a…
Terrible experience,"The Hype created for this place is not at all worthy, waiting for Bus in mid of a summer, at a terrible and dirty land should be avoided, long form that was required to be filled for getting a boat ride ticket with a narrow entrance is something that you are not expecting, and…"
Nice one,One of the best boating lake is periyar ..is situated in deep forest. . special mention ..that's the tiger reserve forest
Good Lake,Interesting Place. Must be visited with our family and friends. It not then alone is not at all a bad option. 
Mr Ras,Beautiful  scenic  boat  ride. Worthwhile  a trip. Do  not  carry  any  food   or  eat  in  frount  of  monkeys   as  they  will  snatch  it  away in the  waiting  area  before  boarding  the  boat. Ladies  do  not  stand  alone. Saw   very few  elephants.  Not  much  other …
Thekkady lake,"Very natural. The steamer ride through the lake is unique. One can see the dead stumps of the trees in the lake. One can see the deers coming to the banks of the lake, even sometime elephants can also be seen  The boat ride itself is adventurous."
Wild life is well preserved !! ,"We went for a boat safari at 7:30am. We knew that we had almost no chance to see tigers but we had hopes for seeing some elephants which we didn't see neither. But the tour was nice, we could see many wild buffalos, dears...and we were glad to see that wildlife is really…"
Good experience,"We recently took a common boat ride on the Periyar Lake. It was a very peaceful and serene experience. Since we did it in the morning, we enjoyed a good weather and some wild life sightings and various birds. Overall a very good experience."
General public boat ride,These rides are on double decker boats that run continously along the lake.  We still had most of the time when there was just our boat and we got to see some wildlife although not much due to the time of day.  The guys on the boat were very helpful and one took some great pics using my wife's iPhone and our binoculars (a clever way of getting zoom and I hadn't seen it done before).  It was only a fleeting visit and we felt that a guided walk either morning or evening would have given us a better experience. Unfortunately we didn't have the time.
Beautiful,"Well it is tiger sanctuary but no one talks about tigers here. Most talks are of White stocking bison and deer etc. We have been to many sanctuary but for the first time we did not see a single deer , but we saw lots of bisons, snake birds, kingfisher and some other varieties of birds as well. The land on the periphery of the lake 8s so clean that u get the feeling that the animals are also trying to follow modi swacch abhiyaan. It is worth it but beware of monkey menance near boating charges counter. You can even hire binoculars here."
Wow its Amazing!!!,"Boat ride with family, it an wonderful experience through pariyar wild life sanctuary seen lot of rare birds and animal Wonderful experience.."
Boating @ periyar,"We enjoyed the boating here , different experience we had , lucky we have seen group of elephants .but no tigers . must to see"
Beautiful few hours....,We spent a beautiful few hours up and down the the lale. Get there early as it does get busy. We chose the afternoon slot as we were told that it is a good time to go as its drinking time for a lot of animals. We only had a few days and couldnt do a safari.Recommend ealry morning or last ride of the day. Also get binoculars.
Lake,Beautiful lake surrounded by forest and very very exciting atmosphere. Best place to visit in kerala. If you go early morning you will find many different birds and small animals. Loved and place.
Morning trek and afternoon boat ride,Get the best out of Periyar and do a trek in the morning and a boat ride in the afternoon (if you visit Periyar in the dry season). Then you get to see the forest from within in the morning and get a good chance of spotting elephants by the lake in the afternoon. 
excellent,Periyar (meaning: big river) is the longest river and the river with the largest discharge potential in the Indian state of Kerala.[2][3] It is one of the few perennial rivers in the region and provides drinking water for several major towns.[4] The Periyar is of utmost…
One time visit,This place is for one time visit.  Nothing exciting you will find.  It's just average for boating.  No wild animals will be appeared
Amazing place to watch wildlife,"The Periyar lake is a beautiful place inside the Periyar National Park. You are allowed to enter the park only through safari bus, or through the nature walk trip organised by the forest committee. Dont carry any food items in your hand because the monkeys will take them away…"
Good boat trip shame about the nature walk,"We started our day with the walk. Designed for a group of 4 really (Rps 1400) you still pay this price if less than 4. Good idea, if you have the time, to hang around at ticket office and try to make up a group of 4. You still have to pay about Rps 500 per serson to get access…"
Nice Boat Cruise,We were taken here as part of our Citrus Tour of Kerala. Tickets were purchased in the town of Kumley from an official government ticket office where you also get on a bus (included in the price) to be taken to the park. There is plenty of wildlife to see but it depends on 'the…
Elephants,"We were most fortunate on our recent trip on lake Periyar, not only did we see the 'usual suspects' of birds and deer, we saw 3 groups of elephants ambling along the lake. An absolute highlight. "
Noisy tour on an artificial lake with dead trees inside. Low appeal. ,"On boarding at 7h30, noisy tour on an artificial lake with dead trees inside. A few animals. Low appeal. "
Enjoyable Places,Awesome location with fresh air. Good to Spend time with family. we need luck to see the animals. Find room near boating to avoid bus charges
Disappointing,"We went in the double decker boat with 8 seats across so if you were not near the outside it was difficult to see anything. We took the early morning boat as it was the best chance to see elephants etc, but saw no elephants and not a lot else, but that is always the risk."
Lovely boat trip,We took a lovely calm boat trip down this lake taking in the bird life and a few animals. It was early in the morning and the mist hanging over the surface of the lake made the forest trees coming up look incredibly eerie. Guides were fantastic taking people’s cameras and taking photos through the binoculars for close ups. Really worth a trip.
Pleasant and scenic ,Pleasant place for family visit with young children.  Quiet area with scenic views for fear photography and admiring nature.
Serene scenic views,"Great to have a stroll and enjoy the nature. Must do boating to enjoy the best of it (need bit luck too) to see wild elephants, bisons, tigers and lots of birds."
Beautiful Scenery and Abundant Wildlife,"We took an early morning cruise on Periyar Lake.  First, we were greeted by the numerous monkeys which were trying to steal anything you had in your hands.  When we got on the boat, we lazily cruised along and saw numerous types of birds, lizards, deer, and wild boars.  Besides being relaxing, seeing all of the wildlife was wonderful."
I had seen more beautiful waterways,In order to see animals in the wild we waked up easrly in the morning on our way to the lake. Before going to the boats we waited in some station which was full w ith monkies. Retrospectively it was the most interesting part of the trip. Since sailing on the lake you see very…
Just a few wild deers and buffalos ,"We almost fell asleep on the boat because just saw a few wild deers and buffalos from afar on the boat. As foreigners, we don’t mind to pay a higher entrance fee. But just there is nothing to see. Pretty disappointed. "
Wild life ,"Hi, lots of animals lots bird's we see this place,wonderful place to visit  and they have lots of activities in this jungle booting, tricking, jungle Scot, bamboo rafting and very greenery to see this place I'm strongly recommend this place "
Serene lake with good views! ,Periyar lake provides stunning views of the surrounding forests as you take a boat ride on the lake. One can spot a few animals if you take a boat ride at the right time. Booking process needs to be improved a lot though. Beware of monkeys and do not feed them. 
Amazing lake teaming with wildlife,"Early morning boat safari. Great views from the boat. saw Elephants, Buffalo and numerous birds. A must do activity while in Thekkady."
Nothing special to see,"Lake with almost nothing to tell home about.  Many people, old and noisy boats.  You can essily skip it. "
Boat trip on the lake ,We had booked the boat trip in advance but the crowds were huge and boarding was chaotic and poorly organised.    On boarding we had good seats on the upper deck.  We were required to wear rather antiquated life jackets. Not sure why! None if the staff wore them and I’d have…
Cruising a reservoir,"The Periyar Lake might have been a true lake but nowadays more of a reservoir feeding the hydroelectric powerplants further down.  Still its nice in the morning when the mist leave the threetops. And you might see a few animals gracing and drinking in the shoreline. We saw gaur,…"
WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE,Weather Was Too Good that day. Though We didnt saw much of animals but going for boating in Periyar lake was itself a blissful experience. Everyone visiting Thekkady must visit this place
Magnificent,"We arrived late at our hotel from Munnar to Thekady. Still went in this national Park and got a boat ride ticket (though it was last one). There was a huge rush at Ticket counter. We saw Bison, Kingfisher birds and others."
Nothing exited,Not much water there.you never see a Tiger there if you are lucky may see an elephant.the only thing we saw some juncle Buffalow and otter
What an awful experience!,"You board a crowded bus and then get to line up with hundreds of people all trying to fit through one door.  Once you get on board you are required to wear a smelly over-sized life jacket that looks like it was salvaged from the Titanic.  Then you get to bubble along behind other diesel-powered boats with no apparent pollution control.  We saw a couple of bison, a few birds but no elephant.  The view was nice but there wasn’t anything else positive on this trip.  I notice the reviews from Indians are positive which doesn’t surprise me as this would be considered very unique and special for them.  If you’ve been to North America or Africa, it just doesn’t cut it.  Give it a miss."
Periyar lake boat trip,"It was fun to spot wildlife while on our boat ride. we initially thought it is a small boat ride however this was a boat with large group and they took us around the lake while spotting wildlife. spotted gavi, elephants, bison, birds etc. Be aware about the monkeys in the suurounding ;)"
Touring South India ,"A must see place. Great variety of birds and also larger animals like wild elephants and buffalo along the surrounding land. Very relaxing and serene. Be careful of the monkeys though when you wait to board the boat. The cheeky rascals grab any oportunity to snatch and run off with your food, bottle or other small items.You can hire binoculars from the port too."
Beautiful lake,Took the 3:30pm boat ride for the lake to watch the wildlife around the lake .Manage to see quite lot of wildlife .My family enjoyed the 1.5hour of boat ride .
Excellent,Excellent and beautiful lake... The surrounding is with thick forest and one can experience the wild animal foot marks. Full of peace and tranquility. If you are lucky enough you can see elephants dancing and bathing in the lake...
Mesmerised!,"We took the early morning boat ride available at Periyar National Park and were lucky to have been able to see some elephants, deers, wild boar and a few rare birds."
Munnar 2019,"We had booked the Half day bamboo boating trip.We started out trek at 9:30 am and it took almost 1 hour to reach to the spot.The trek was nice... Completely through the jungle.We saw wild elephants, flying squirrel, and different kinds of birds..We then had our lunch there in the spot then headed out on the bamboo boats for a ride...There we saw wild elephants with there baby too.It was nice and worthy of your time energy and money as well."
Periyar lake,# must visit place # scenic beauty # bison # variety of birds # boat ride with safety jacket # bus to periyar excellent arrangements for bus and boat ride # clean and environment friendly # a restaurant in the lake seen.## very happy to visit.
Wonderful,"Periyar lake is a narrow and long Lake nestled in the Western ghats. It is fed by Periyar river and rain water. The boat trip is wonderful but you have to be lucky to spot animals (except in summer months). Nevertheless the water is clear, surroundings clean and the air is crisp. It is quite windy so please do carry proper clothes during winter months(especially for children and old). Even if you do not spot any animals just enjoy a boat ride on the lake. Worth every penny once you have reached Thekkady."
BOAT RIDE WAS A WASTE,"Went on 11/2hr boat ride today. Starts with bumpy bus ride into national park,then shuffle into 2 decker boats with set seats. Not allowed to stand. Was very boring and nothing much to see. Saw 2 elephants, a handful of wild boar and deer from such a distance, we only could see…"
Very good experience ,Early morning Boat ride in Periyar Lake is a Life time experience . In starting there was fog.We couldn't see far.After 10 minutes the view was clean.We enjoyed the fog.During boat ride we saw the Gupt movie song filmed Location. We saw different kind of birds on woods of…
Just a boat ride no sightings,We had to report by 6.30 am and board the buses from the Forest department which took us inside. It was a smooth drive and so was the Boat ride. Did not excite us much as there were no sightings as they claim.   A day prior to our trip we were also told by our driver as well as…
Must if you are Thekkaddy,Beautiful lake and if you are carrying good zoom camera then you will surely spot some animals and will have good time. worth visiting
Boat Ride Around the Lake,"This was not as eventful as the early morning hike. We did see bison, deer, a wild pig, and a group of elephants. As soon as those elephants heard our boat engine they quickly disappeared into the forest. It is a peaceful way to travel on the lake. Don’t be surprised if you do…"
Boating in the Lake,We had to get up very early in the morning to catch the bus which drops at boating point as private vehicles are not allowed till the boating point. The bus charge is 20 per person irrespective of kids or adults. Where the Entry charge to the boating point is 150 for 3 Adults…
Scenic but do not expect to see animals,"We were booked on then 9.30 boat and our agent assisted with the online booking and the collection so we were spared the long queue for the tickets. Whilst they seem to have a proper queue for the tickets, it was totally chaotic for the boats. No clear instructions or signage…"
Trade misdescription act ,"“Pleasure trip around lake” would be a better description for this outing.   Compared to a river safari trip in Borneo we experienced,this was more like a ferry ride foe 200 people around a man made park.  Cold sunny morning and pretty views.  "
Poor cleanliness,We did see some wildlife but boat trip was let down by fact that mandatory life jackets were black with dirt and made your skin crawl.
Beautiful nature,It's a beautiful nature wild life lake. In situated Thekkady periyar dam view lake via boating. Its wonderful tour programme.
Amazing,"The experience once you are on the boat is fantastic - beautiful landscapes and we saw a decent array of animals - Sambar deer, dhol (Indian wild dogs), bison and wild boar in the distance and finally elephants. There were also some lovely birds - Cormorants, kingfishers and…"
Eye catching scenic beauty of nature,"This is right time to visit this place .we had a boat riding of one hour. a nature beauty should be enjoyed.but be careful about monkeys, any time they may attack unfortunately my one of family members attack with a monkey bite..ofcourse we took anti ARV vaccine immediately..."
Enjoy wildlife from boat...an unique experience.,"I visited Periar Tiger Reserve with my wife on 11th December 2018. I enjoyed the boating in the lake coz you can see the wildlife in their natural habitat. You can see herds of deer, wild buffaloes, elephants, lots of birds etc. For a faster check-in, you can book tickets…"
Overpriced ,"We went for the morning departure,earlier the better. More chances of spotting animals at the water.   Indian adult is only 40 rupees less than a dollar and Foreign Adult is 440 Rupees, 9CAD. That made us not want to go at all!!  Not the price of course the fact that they jack…"
Not worth visiting ,Its like just another boat ride. Nothing much to write. You won't get even a glimpse any wild life here. Seems like fooling tourists.
Good experience,"Clean environment. Well organised.  Did see Sambar, Bison, wild pig and many birds perched on tree stumps on the lake."
Osm place,"This place is just osm, beautiful environment and views. Like Hollywood movie set. What a natural combination it is."
Peaceful with lovely views,We went on one of the boats on the lake and saw a few animals grazing. It was lovely to have the cool breeze for a while.
Seemed a good idea at the time.,"A bit of a non event as the boat was full, including a few unhappy kids who were crying most of the time. It was a sunny day and the lake was pretty but we saw hardly any animals and as we had seen other safaris in other countries this was a bit of a waste of time."
Waste of time... no luck too!,"Our driver drove us here early at 6:30am to get the bus tickets (20rs) and entrance fees (475Rs) for foreigners. We were at the landing at 7:00am. Boat ticket cost another (240Rs). All together for 4 adults I paid 2950 Rs. Pretty expensive as I don’t understand why it is so expensive. Perhaps I will see alot of wild animals and that will be worth it. Boat leaves at 7:30 and meantime more people poured in. I was pretty excited that this is a popular event and was snapping pics of the animals names poster in case I see any. The queue was bad as only one single file is allowed. In the far, we some some dear hoarding on the bank but once we took off we only saw birds, birds and only birds. It came to a point that I was dozing off in the cool air Breeze and the lack of morning coffee was not helping. We tried and so are the others look frantically around for any sings of animal. I think even a squirrel would have excited us but alas no luck and just not available. The Breeze became colder as we were coming back... so wear jacket! We reached back loading Bay at 9am and thought we will get back hotel for our 9:30am breakfast. Alas the bus that we paid for only came one by one in 10-15mins interval. We were sure that there are at least 3-4 buses avail but only 1 same bus kept coming. In the end we took the 9:40 bus and had to stand! So we Waited 40mins for bus! Ridiculously Long! We came back tired, hungry, cold and not satisfied. This important event will be at risk to attract foreigners to come if it operates this way. It is starting to be evident that I don’t see a lot of foreigners tourist here in town."
enjoyable cruise,It was a beautiful day of boat cruise in the periyar lake. Very professionally organised. It is better to take the first trip in the morning (7.30am).
"Beautiful vista, must visit","The Periyar Lake falls within the Tiger Reserve area controlled and maintained by Kerala Tourism & Development Corporation (KTDC). Outside vehicles are not allowed inside the forest area except for those staying in one if the 2 KTDC hotels inside the buffer area. Tourists interested in visiting the Lake and the Tiger Reserve must park their vehicles outside the main gate and then either walk in towards the boat-boarding area or avail their bus facility which starts around 500 mtrs away from the main entrance. Tickets must be purchased for the bus and entry into the forest at the bus terminal. Boat ticket must be purchased at the boarding terminal. In order to avoid queues, one can book all these 3 tickets online. The boat timings are fixed (7:30am, 9:30am, 11:15am, 1:45pm, and 3:30pm IST). If your boat booking is for the first ride of the day and you miss it due to any delay, you lose the money. Better to queue up at least 30 to 45 mins prior. It's a huge and magnificent lake with the forest area surrounding it. Last when we visited in Nov 2018, they said there were approximately 37 tigers.. we didn't see any. In fact we didn't sight any wild animals.. just few birds. Nevertheless, just sit back and enjoy the 1.5 hour boat ride and take in the fresh air and cool breeze and surrounding natural beauty. Try and take the first boat ride to avoid the heat and to get potential for wild animal sightings as they may come near the lake to drink water. The boat boarding area has lots of monkeys waiting eagerly to jump on you if you have any food packet (opened or sealed) in your hands. So keep them in your back packs."
Nice boat ride. Very few animals spotted,"If you really want a boat ride you will enjoy this attraction. If you hope to see wildlife don’t waste your money. We saw a herd of deer in the distance, wild bison so far away they were barely visible, a large lizard and a few birds."
Family visit,Nice lake. Beautiful view the lake is surrounded by green forest on all sides. Really Beautiful scenario.
Beautiful early morning cruise on Periyar Lake,"We saw buffalo and many birds. And monkeys trying to steal food. Beautiful scenery and quite, pleasant boat ride."
Periyar Lake Ride,"We enjoyed a boat ride in the waters of Periyar Lake during our recent visit to Thekkady. The lake and its surroundings in itself are a sight to behold. But we were even more fortunate to see elephants, buffaloes, birds, deers, lizard among others blending in with their natural surroundings. The whole experience can be soothing and enchanting"
Excellent Lake and enjoyable boat ride,Excellent and huge lake inside Periyar Reserve Forest. Boat ride was really enjoyable though do not expect to see lot of wild life otherwise you might be disappointed. Cant comment on the tourism management for tickets to boat ride as we stayed in KTDC hotel which almost guarantees a boat ride.
Worth it but not amazing,"The boat cruise was nice and relaxing but nothing amazing. I preferred the jeep ride. Depending what time of day you go, will determine what you will see. To see the tigers is very rare I am told. We managed to see elephants, lot's of birds and some monkies when we got off the boat. You need to pay to enter and then pay for the bus to take you to the boat plus a camera fee if you wish to take photos. To be honest, no one was monitoring the photo one! Once you get to the boat you need to pay to get on it. We thought we had paid for all at the entrance! They allocate your seats and the boats are really full mainly with locals. I was quite surprised at how few foreigners there were! The silly thing is that the boat goes so slowly. I can understand that they want you to wear life jackets but is this really necessary in the heat going really slow? Then you can't stand so how do you take photos. Understand if this was a fast speed boat or if we were close to dangerous animals but this? I support safety comes first but there is safety and over the top. Most of us ended up just ignoring the staff and stood up to take photos. Make sure you time it right as boats leave at certain times. The lines can be long to get tickets, plus there is a short bus ride to take you to the boat. There were about three or four boats departing at the same time. The cruise is about one and a half hours. Restaurants and coffee shops near by"
Amazing Destination but really poor Tourism Management,"Periyar Lake is outright stunning, both in terms of scenic beauty and the abundance of wildlife. We spotted hordes of Indian Gaurs, Elephants, Dholes and numerous avian species on a 1/1.5 hour boat safari. What is disappointing about the place is though is the system in place for visiting tourists. Atleast 500 or more people had converged to poured in and were accommodated into three or four boats. The boisterous and ill mannered crowd was more of a type that were waiting to enter a fair or a temple rather than embark on a wildlife safari. Throughout the boat ride they made a deafening raucous that took out all enjoyment and peace out of the experience."
beautiful country side,"beautiful countryside with a boat ride in the lake. Apart from that, there is nothing much to see, apart from the monkeys jumping around near the cafe."
The boat trip is worthwhile,"Even if one only sees the brilliant kingfishers and a few deer the experience is a peaceful and enjoyable one. we actually saw a number of other animals including Bison, Sambar deer and Gaurs.The boat diverts from its course for interesting wild-life."
Chance to see some wildlife,"The car park is a short bus journey away from the boat.A charge to enter the park and another to board the boat. Small efficient queues to embark. Three or four boats left at the same time with around thirty people on each. Local guides on each boat pointed out things of interest. Need a reasonable zoom to get decent photos, saw lots of birds but no  elephant due to plentiful water supply elsewhere."
Boat ride,"Beautiful scenery. Beware of monkeys, do not take any etables as they tend to get notorious. While booking a boat ride ask for the upper deck seat for a better view. Animals are not sighted well as boat goes only from the center of the river not close to the land, but great scenic beauty. Must see"
Season time - Effort & luck essential for 7.30 am boat ride,"Effort: Govt.stopped entry of private vehicles to periyar boat centre which is located almost 4 km inside periyar tiger reserve. Current status a new counter opened near thekkady town with huge parking space where we park our vehicles, stand in que grab bus ticket (60 INR/pax to and fro). The bus will pick and drop us in same spot. For 7.30 am boat ride que started at 5.00 am. (it was pooja holidays and thekkady was packed by tourists).7 boats all together 400 pax capacity ready for 7.30 am trip. Ticket price:120/-INR per headDuration : Almost 90 minutesSafety:Provides Life Jacket.Luck: Since it was raining for last 3 days scope to spot animals were scarce but lucky found Bison,Sambar deer and couple of birds. Our boat driver Mr.James mentioned animals were spotted 3 days before.Tips: Book online for effortless tickets."
Enjoyed Bamboo Rafting and Jungle Trek,"We went for half day bamboo rafting activity. It is governed by Govt. forest department and very safe and secured for girls to do too. The activity is 1.5 hrs jungle trek, breakfast at Periyar lake, bamboo rafting for 1 hr in Periyar lake and 1.5 hrs back jungle trek. If you enjoy trek than its fun to experience. This road is so safe that we rarely get to see any animals on the way. Gavi forest beauty is amazing."
Enthusiastic boat crew,"A 90 minute cruise on the lake to spot birds and from a distance, animals on the shore line. The boat crew were eager spotters of wildlife and great at taking pics with your camera - no moving from your allocated seat and everyone , except crew, had to wear a very uncomfortable…"
family trip,"nice relaxing boat ride. lucky enough to see a few wild animals including deer, buffalo and elephants. went on last ride at 15:30 - first and last rides supposedly best ones to spot wildlife"
Enjoyable Boat ride,"We took the evening boat ride .It was very nice experience to observe the deep forest on the banks. Watched many Deer , Bisons & lots of birds. "
Nice but not amazing,Boating at this lake would be a life time experience if someone gets to see wild life. I have not seen anything apart from eagles and cows.
Simply a  boat ride nothing extra,"We did our ride on 16th Oct 2018 at 7.30am, which is the first ride of  the day and one is supposed to see some wild animals but to be honest you have nothing to see . Do it at any time all is same. Just enjoy boating. You can spot only few  birds on trees in the lake. That's…"
Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary and Periyar Lake.,"We boarded our vehicle and headed for Periyar lake.The Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary and National Park are situated in the banks of Periyar lake. The wildlife sanctuary is also famous for its tiger reserve and elephant reserve. The construction of the Mullaperiyar Dam across the Periyar River led to the formation of Periyar Lake.The boat safari through Periyar lake provides amusing boat ride experience. A boat cruise on the Lake is perhaps the best way to watch the wildlife in the reserve.We reached Periyar lake and welcomed by a beautiful lake.We bought the tickets. There was a long queue. We waited more than an hour at their waiting lounge. There were lots of Monkeys in the waiting area. We boarded on the boat. We got the lower deck seats. For every person on the boat, it is mandatory to wear life-jackets. Once all the people wore safety harness the boat started cruising on the calm water of the lake.We were not that optimistic to spot any wildlife. The weather was cold and black clouds were looming on the horizon. However, the boat ride in itself was very a pleasant experience. I noticed many passengers literally sleeping on their seats. After a while, it started raining. Wildlife spotting was out of scope during the rain. However, we were enjoying the boat ride. The lake was beautiful. The rain was making the lake more beautiful. The two great elemental sounds in nature are the sound of rain and the sound of the wind. We were witnessing both of them. Rain increased. Kerala rain was in its full swing. Our boat took a big U-turn and headed back to its source destination.We had to run back to our vehicle in heavy rain. Before getting into the bus I took one last photograph and bid farewell to Periyar lake by giving a promise to come back."
"A ""Must See"" if you are in the area","If you are anyplace close to Periyar, you will be sold short if you don't take a boat ride out onto this stunning lake in the wildlife reserve. The reserve is home to about 50 tigers, a hundred or so elephants and a variety of other beasts and birds. The lake affords views of no end of drinking and grazing areas so there is the possibility of some amazing sightings. Even if you don't see a tiger or an elephant, you will be very unlucky not to spot deer, bison, kingfishers and cormorants."
Not much to see,"As long as you know what to expect, you won't be disappointed...The scenery was beautiful and the water was serene, but we saw very little in the way of wildlife.  We had to sit in assigned seats which also made viewing difficult.  There was no commentary or guidance as to where to look.  Some of the guides took pictures of birds and deer with my cell phone and showed me when they handed it back to me, but very little to see in person."
Nice experience,We went for boating in periyar lake though we didn't find any animals except one elephant and some deers
Best boating facility,If you stay at Aranya Nivas they will arrange for your tickets for the boating here. Else you may have trouble to get a ticket during peak tourist season. Early morning first trip is advised for better wildlife view.
Slow slow boat trip,"Our tour group from NZ went on the boat trip on the lake . We wouldn’t recommend it, the boat is very very slow, very little wildlife to see ( and you are too far away) . The passengers are not free to move around and the life jackets are huge and cumbersome to wear . "
Only Boating,People fond of boating alone can go here. Probability of sighting animals is very less. One can witness dears and bisons alone. Would be boring affair for nearly an hour.
Atrocity officers,We a team of people all are only our own family members stayed in Thekkady to have a family get togather for a couple of days. We planned to have boating at periyar lake.we have been boarded by 2.30 PM  at periyar foundation bus station and reached the boat house by 3.20 PM and…
Boating in between forests ,Nice place to visit wild animals.boating in periyar lake is amazing experience.Getting the ticket is difficult at season time .
eye catching view,periyar lake is one of the must visited place in thekkady. nice and spectacular eye catching view. very big lake.
Beautiful,This is one of the main places of Thekkady and is great. The water body inside the green setting is memorable.
Nice lake Beautiful Nature,"Nice lake with beautiful lake here,  birds with near nets can be seen from here,  90 Minutes Boating here,  you may also purchase T shirts with tiger reserve logo,  fees are 240/- per person for Kerala tourism boat,  for private boats it is 150/- per person's,  but tickets need to book at Perriyar for Tiger reserve u can get only 240/- ₹tickets"
lake between nature,periyar lake in thekkady is one of the most and must visited place amongst tourists. nice scenic view
Beautiful Lake but not much of wildlife!,"One needs to give at least half a day to see this attraction.After buying a special Govt bus ticket from Thekkady, you are taken to the edge of the Periyar lake where you can but a boat ride ticket if you wish additionally. The serene boat ride lasts for about 90 mins and the scenery is beautiful. Unfortunately except for a few deers, we did not see much.It would have been nice if the boat operators gave us a bit of an intro of the lake and the surroundings. There was no information at all."
TREKKING WITH BAMBOO RAFTING,A closeness and a bonding towards nature will emerge within you.. beautiful place and array awesome activities! Prices for the same is hiked up exorbitantly due to lot of interests from tourists
Don’t expect to see too much,"It was a lovely boat ride, peaceful and calm with stunning views but otherwise not much to see. If you have a free couple of hours then it’s worth the visit but not at the detriment to something else. "
Nice one,"totally different experience, we enjoyed the boat ride in periyar lake , we r unlucky to visit animal.Nice experience."
""" Beautiful Periyar ""","One of the most beautiful scenary in Kerala. Our guests are mostly gone to thekkady and reccomend their friends to go there. They are saying that it was one of the beautiful thing that they ever seen in Kerala. If you are going to thekkady, don't miss these places.."
A natural forest having a man made lake.,"It is one of the star attraction of kerala tourism, The lake and forest can be accessed by staying at thekkaddi.

visit to Peryar Lake,"We stayed at Madurai and visited    meenakshi mandir.In the next morning we left from Madurai towards Periyar.                                    first we caught a bus towards Tenny,a small town at Tamilnadu.at the bus stand we did our breakfast and caught a bus for Tekkadi.    …"
"Great place to visit, and Boating in Natural Beauty","Enjoy Boating at Huge Lake with Natural Beauty, Birds, wild Animals seen easilty, Requires around 1 hour plusBuy Boating tickets (two organisations conduct Boating)"
Peaceful and Amazing!,"We had booked the early morning boat ride at the Periyar Lake. The lake is very clean and it was a wonderful experience to see the forest from the boat. We saw a number of birds, deer, bisons and even a herd of elephants (from a distance though). It is good that the reserve does not allow any jeeps inside the jungles, you would probably not spot any tigers here. Overall a great experience!"
There was some wildlife but not that much,"There was some wildlife but not that much (some deer, gaur, monkeys, and lots of birds) ...mostly a pretty boat ride. A lot of people on the boat."
endless lake ..beautifull experience,"more than we expected and delighted in too. Need to discover time to visit this area in any event once in the existence time If you are fortunate, you can see assortment of untamed life animals over yonder"
Beautiful Lake,"Periyar Lake at Thekkady is located inside a sanctuary. It's a beautiful lake. A boat ride is also available. However one should book tickets in advance as there is a long que. Unfornately when I reached at 5pm, the timings were over."
Thilling Experience,"Absolute must visit to the PTR the Periyar Tigre reserve as its called, 925Sq KMs of just dense nature, forest  and a slight drizzle while on a 90 mins cruise, is an experience of life time"
Must visit location ,"Have to find time to visit this location at least  once in the life time If you are lucky, you can see variety of wild life creatures over there"
Nice Lake,"We were five persons. We planned to visit Kerala in the last week of May and first week of June 2018. This time there was early monsoon and it had started to rain from 25th May 2018. So, it was not hot. Outdoor activities like visit to Periyar Lake was comfortable. It was an…"
"Absolutely Stunning, Especially During Monsoon","The vast expanse of Periyar Lake on the fringes of Periyar Tiger Reserves is beautiful sight. One must opt for a boat ride and go deep into the lake to enjoy breathtaking views of greenery, birds, water bodies, Lake Palace Hotel, wildlife (we saw big bunches of horned dears and…"
Lovely to see in full bloom!,We were lucky to see the lake in full bloom. Boating experience was fabulous and spotted a few wildlife as well.
They are behaving us like refuggee ,Limited seats we must stand in a big que for tickets. Transportation is not upto average... They are charging parking fee as compulsory... And its not for parking charge its absolutely for comfort station
Peaceful ride and that’s about it. ,"I saw more wildlife in the unruly bus inhabitants than the lake itself. To make matters worse the boat had a huge contingent who decided to take our seat - thankfully the seats were numbered so we could push back, but suddenly the group decided the best way to ‘enjoy’ their trip…"
Great Lake with lush green surroundings ,Great Lake with lush green surroundings. Have to be careful of the monkeys at the gate they will go for the bags and purses.   For boat ride recommend to book tickets with Right side of the boat at that’s where the shore is and one will be able to see animals and birds
Beautiful forest lake,This is the main attraction in Thekkady. Lake is very big and beautiful. Best thing to do here is boat ride. Last boat is at 4pm.There are different types of animal near to this lake.
Boating ,"It was an different experience, nice greenary,  by luck to see the animals there , we didn't spot any animals ."
Different experience,"We had a early morning boat trip, we r unlucky to see animals , but we had a differnt experience, enjoyed the ride"
Excellent boating experience in early morning,I had a very nice experience with boat ride on early morning in periyar lake.This place is clean and they are mainitaining it properly but the tourists are dumping the garbage here and ther which very much disappointing.They won't allow the vehicles to go inside and we need to…
Very disappointing ,I will say we visited Thekkady to see Periyar tiger reserve with great expectations . It was great disappointment . First of all ticketing online was a bad experience . We booked for 3:30 pm boat ride . They take your to the ferry by non AC bus and than around 45 min boat ride .…
Useless ,"This is just another boat ride with nothing special about it..so don’t go with high hopes,there’s no animal spotting as one would normally expect to see in a national reserve..if you are lucky you might see a few elephants and birds..we saw some dogs and a dead animal ,I don’t…"
really beautiful ,We went for the boating in the peruse lake.   early morning..... So beautiful ....  Nice greenery... We saw very few animals   Rainy season  is not good to see the animals...   But the experience  was great  
Avoid it,"A boat trip on overcrowded boats !  Supposed to be a park with wildlife, you will not see anything from the boat. Really do avoid it !"
Average place ,It's a good place I had visited it and the view is good but not offering a must visit place if you are visiting thekkady you can visit the place please don't go only to see this place 
Breathtakingly Beautiful ,Words are not sufficient one needs to visit Periyar and know why it’s referred as Gods Own Country.. 925 Sq Kms spread area full of endangered flora & Fauna. Monsoon time is totally different its so quaint. 
Trip,Excellent NYC good must visit really smart come must once in life it is best place to stay in Thekkady
At Thekkady must do Activity,"If at Thekkady as it is famous for the forest activities, Boating at Periyar lake is worth visiting. Kids might feel exhausted as it goes very slowly. Getting tickets would be a difficult task as most of the tourist target this activity. Better to get the tickets booked online. "
Awesome lake,This is the best lake I never see like this type of lakes. We have to see the real nature of beauty on there.
Normal experience,"We had boat ride. The expectations were to see some wild life. Could spot some deer , nothing else :=))"
boat safari is the best way to spot wild animals,"This lake is situated at a distance of 3-4kms from the entry point of periyar national park.Only govt. buses are going inside. For that you need park entry ticket and bus ticket,total rs60 per person.Boat booking office is near to the lake and charges rs260 per person for 1.5…"
Nothing much,"We are total 6 people went boating. Only seeing buffalo and monkey at the entrance. If your nature lover then only go, otherwise waste of time . "
The Jungle Book come to life ,"This is one of the best memories from our trip to Kerala.   The lake is pristine and the forest is real. You may or may not see many animals. We saw wild buffalo, boars and deer. But the best part was the feeling of being one with nature.   The forest officers are very serious…"
Nice place to visit and see wild animals at their natural way,"It was my first experience on Thekkady river boat. First of all, visitors need to get the entry ticket and bus ticket from outside the reserve area. Ticket location for entry and bus is near the kumily bypass road. From the ticket office, Periyar Tiger Reserve bus is taking…"
Boat cruise with great views,"The 1 hour lake cruise gives spectacular views of hills, mist, wild animals. Worth a visit. The lake is quite vast but they cruise only a limited area. 3-4 boats are available - 120 seater double decker is what we used."
Just beautiful ,"I just love this Lake, it's so beautiful, you won't see any wild animals though except Bison, Dear and Wild pigs. But the Natural beauty is soooo beautiful."
was boring,"The lake is vast, the boat ride is slow and you do not get to see the tigers, we only got to see a bunch of elephants and deers. everyone on the boat felt that they were driving it very slow and making the ride more boring."
Waste of time,At ticket counter they give ticket but not sure about boat available or not.on 14/03/18 13-21pm at least 500 tourist came back without boating.forest dept. has to upgrade the system.At canteen only bread aamlet  and tea serve.pls keep some snacks with you.
Periyar Lake Cruise,"Despite a rainy day,  there were a lot of tourists. We could not see any animals except deers at a distance.  The Forest Department and KTDC must improve the facilities. The place needs an urgent  facelift and the procedures need be simplified. There was too much staff doing…"
awesome mesmerizing view,"awesome experience, plan to have the first boat or the last boat ride of the day, chances of seeing animals are more. If you are lucky you will be able to see bison, samba deer, wild boar, lots of kingfisher and definitely the awesome view of nature and lake "
Nice boat ride,"The boat ride was superb and well managed. But it's advisable to book advance tickets online. Very easy to access and book tickets. We saw jakals, sambars and wild elephants. "
"My boat ride in Periyar Lake, Thekkady","This is a must visit tourist point at Thekkady.  This is a crowd pulling venue.  It is not that easy to get a chance, particularly during peak periods, just by visiting the place.  The local procedures are to be complied with.  The boat ride is at particular timings - 7.30 am,…"
Awesome place ,"I must admit that I was surprised that we have this kind of place in India as well, the lake is very clean with a very good surrounding habitat.  I would highly recommend to take bamboo rafting, you will experience the surrounding forest as well, while trekking to the spot where…"
Good ride,"Had a good boat ride with family and family friends ..it was from 3:30 to 5 o clock in the evening ..was able to see bison,samba deer, elephants,seals etc ..very good"
Amazing... ,"The tortuous path is mesmerising. We could actually see deers, bisons, elephants and sambars .... The duration of the boat ride is 1.5 h... Better to book online to avoid last minute disappointment. "
Beautiful lake with rich flora and fauna ,Be there to away from hustle and bustle of city. Fully away from mobiles as well. Guide's available and visitor's are permitted to a pee defined limit for trekking 
Incrediblly beautiful boat ride,"Took the 9.30 am boat trip on 25 May. We had booked the boating ticket online. Still you need to go to the bus ticket counter to buy the bus ticket for the bus till the boat jetty. Once at the jetty, we again had to fill in a form to get the actual boat tickets. A little…"
Good boating on the Periyar lake,"After lot of struggle, we were able to manage to get the tickets to ride the last boat i.e. 3:30 PM of the day, but at the end it was not a waste of efforts to get the tickets, we enjoyed the boating, like any government provided service, the professionalism was missing by the…"
Problems in online booking,"We have booked the tickets through online but the status was shown as PENDING even though the money has been debited. When we went there the person at the Bus ticket counter told me that the ticket is not confirmed and I will have to pay for the entry fees apart from the bus charges. After reaching the boat yard ticket counter the person at the ticket counter told me the same reason and asked me to fill up a form and pay for the tickets and told me that the online booking amount will be refunded automatically. But even after one month and repeated mails I am yet to receive the refund, Regarding the trip We saw only bison and  some birds. Too much hype is being created for this boating. Life jacket is really uncomfortable. Don't go with much expectations."
Beautiful lake and surroundings,"When in Kerala, I recommend a visit to Periyar lake.The lake is beautiful and the  surroundings are lovely. I would recommend booking the boat ride well in advance at the Government's website to avoid disappointment. Book the first morning boat ride. It will entail waking up early but it is worth taking this trouble."
It’s so serene ,We went for bamboo rafting here ..it was so peaceful and beautiful . The sound of the forest was amazing .dint go thinking that I would see many animals but went for the peace and quiet of the forest and to hear the songs of birds..it was amazing
A nice setting ,"This man made lake is lovely, you’ll see Bison, elephants and deer and various birds. It’s hit and miss what animals you’ll see, but if you want a relaxing boat ride it’s worth doing and the animals you’ll see are a bonus."
Where to begin...,"After waking up at 5:30 to catch the 7:30 boat, we arrived at the bus stand in good time. Firstly we were not told we had to purchase a ticket before we caught the bus and after queuing up for 15 minutes we were told we had to purchase a ticket which meant being sent to the back of the queue and missing the first set of buses.After finally catching the bus and arriving at Periyar tiger reserve we joined the queue for boat tickets. I use the word “queue” in the loosest sense possible because it was everyone for themselves, people pushing in, shouting and fighting to get a ticket for the boat. The people queuing behaved more like animals than the animals we were going to see! Due to this rabble, we missed the early boat and had to wait 2 hours for the next one which was a huge inconvenience to us. Finally, tired and hungry we got on the 9:30 boat. The trip was an hour and fifteen minutes and all we saw was bison and a sloth bear (which was about 3 miles away). Although we can’t blame the wildlife on our bad trip, everything that preceded this meant it was definitely not worth all the stress and money we paid for it. Do yourself a favour and don’t waste your time on this."
Natural beauty....,"We visited this place only as a visitor and did not halt their for nigh treking or any other adventurous event. So, as a normal visitor, I would like to mention a few things which may be of use to others.  1. For going to National Park or boating in periyar lake, you have to go…"
Book Boat tickets online to avoid queue,The lake was awesome & boat ride is good option to explore. Also check shop at lake. There s KTDC hotel nearby which is also good option to stay & they book tickets for you.
periyar boating,An eco friendly park in kerala with a lake for boating.if you are lucky you could spot some wild animals during your boat journey through periyar lake.Always recommend to book in advance for boat tickets through the official website
Good place for photos,Don't go there for tiger and wild animals elephants are few but place is nice in morning for it's beautiful view
Calm and serene !!,Periyar lake is just beautiful. You can take 2 hours boating which is a treat to your eyes. You can find different birds chirping around. Very very rare chances of seeing any wild life though. But ya worth the visit for the calming effect that lake offers. 
Nice visit of nature,Prior booking is better.. Good boating arrangements.. eco friendly location.. good chance to see wild animals in their habitats. 
Beautiful lake in between forest,This is one of the main attraction in Periyar forest. You can take lake tour through boat. You have to book boat ticket in advance. We enjoyed visiting to this place.
Good boat ride and spotting of wild life ,It is not a good choice to spend day for this lake unless you have love for wild life. Siting is not very easy but the ride is soothing.   The wait for the boat and bus is painful. 
Good ride,"You need to book this online to avoid queues. The boat ride is pretty well organised. The government bus will take you inside the reserved forest. The landscape is very different from what you would have seen. Carry a 500mm glass with your camera, you will find lot of birds in…"
bad experience,"we should have listened to our driver who told us not to visit the lake because it is a touristy thing and is more chaotic then pleasure.  an utterly bad, boring and worthless boattrip which i definitly can definitely will not recommend.   The ticket sales process is so chaotic…"
Lovely place,"You have to take a special park bus from the carpark to enter the national park - this drops you near the boat jetty. Several boats depart at the same time, and the monkeys round the boarding area provide ample interest and entertainment. The views are lovely from the lake and…"
Nice walk,We did the Bamboo Rafting. This included apprx 3 hours of walking. Enjoyed it the most ... fresh and fragrant air !!! The birds give company with their own music during the walk. No Animal sighting though... thankfully the tour operators too did not make false claim about the…
Best place for boat safari,We had a pleasant boat ride saw elephant herd crossing the reservoir only ill feeling us the entire timing could have been increased all bcoz of previous boat mishap which took place at 2009
Amazing,the boat ride through the periyar river was amazing. if you are lucky  you would be able to see wildlife..
A boat trip,"I had an afternoon trip. It can be nice if you sit at the water sides, otherwise you're sitting among many others in a packed boat wearing a life jacket unable to stand. If you're lucky you'll able to see animals. If you  plan to make a forest trip or a safari trip and you're…"
Serene Lake - But boating is not friendly for senior citizens,"We went for a boat ride in ""JalaYatra"" boat. Our hotel periyar house, helped us to get the tickets in the upper deck. The boating experience is really great. Unfortunately, we can't see any wildlife except wild boar.   The boat jetty is not easy to access for senior citizens or…"
Nice place to visit,"Huge lake surrounded by forests on all sides. A must visit for all tourists visiting Thekkady. Had a good time in the boat, saw some of the wild animals like elephants and deers roaming around the lakeside. "
Good trip and a chance to see the wildlife,"We were in low season and there was still quite a lot of queuing to get your ticket for the boat. I was lucky, I got a seat at the side of the boat and could take photos,(seats are numbered on your ticket) a central seat would have not been so good. I took the last tour of the…"
Nice boat ride,"Nice boat ride, however very little animals to be seen. do not expect an experience like an African safari."
Waste of time,Sitting in a ferry with life jackets on with 100 other people looking at nothing !! Waste of time for 2 hours the Indians like it but we have birds and animals to see every day!!
Stunning. Go early. no need to book but get there for 6.30 a.m,Life jackets are a bit big and not necessary. The views are beautiful. You may or may not see wildlife but go and relax anyway.
Beautiful big lake,"There wasn't much water on the reservoir. It was a 1 hour boat ride and I was disappointed since for the cost paid, the boating journey time was very less. We spotted wild fox, elephants, sambhar deers and wild cows. I suggest before you go, please enquire the boating journey…"
Enjoyable boat ride through the National Park,We saw a few animals and birds but were warned not to expect to see the tigers and we didn’t.  The ride is pleasant and the views are good from the top deck of the boats that tour the lake in convoy.
Need patience...,"Visit only..if u have time ... Max u get to see is elephants, bison, deers... 1.5 hours is the trip duration..."
Periyar Lake,i have visited Periyar Lake. but i haven't get tickets to visit via boat.if you are planing to go.book ticket online.over all nice place 
A peaceful and beautiful boat trip.,"A beautiful trip through lovely scenery. The boat takes about 80 people and the crew are very safety conscious insisting that all passengers wear life jackets. Unfortunately, the wildlife on view was pretty limited."
Not so interesting,"This tour, by boat, was included in our overall Southern India Tour, however I would not buy it again.  You do not get close at all to the land so if you did see a tiger, likely not, then you'd never see it from the boat as it was too far away.  Our tour group was seated on the…"
Periyar lake,This is jest for a boating at Periyar lake for 45 Minus . In my life i never ever saw any animals in the bank of the lake 
Nice boat trip but don't expect to see animals,"The boat trip on the lake is a relaxing and safe experience, with beautiful views of the lake and the dead teak trees looking out of the water. But with so many boats (and noisy people on board) cruising the lake the only animals you will see are birds and the occasional deer or…"
Very safe and pleasant boat-trip,"We were very impressed with the level of security, supervision, helpfulness and safety measures. The boat trip was very relaxing and we saw lots of local wild-life including water buffalo, black monkeys and elephants although they are at a distance from the boat. The staff were…"
Sea view,It's a very quite place. I personally didn't like at one point of time I was thinking why the hell I booked the tickets for periyar.
Feel the real nature ,"Beautiful Place with the real beauty of the nature..In the morning we will be fully nourished with the natural fresh air and the chirping sounds of small birds...       Boating through the wild life sanctuary is an other peculiarity of this place..Here we can see the wild animals grazing on the  grasslands.. Also, we can see the nests of birds and cute birds  on the trees which was inside the lake ..."
Busy place and need to book in advance - Expensive for foreigners,"We enjoyed a night time walk with a guides and saw deer and bison but sadly no elephants or tigers.We also went for an early morning walk with a naturalist- who knew his stuff and again we enjoyed.Saw bison, deer, wild boar and lots of birds and butterflies.Hated seeing the boats on the water which were packed with tourists all shouting so no animals will go anywhere near the boats and we were told by our guide that the elephants hate the noise so much that recently an elephant killed a local woman by the lake.Ask the authorities to stop the noise of everybody on the boats as it is NOT GOOD"
Good visiting this,We visited this place in a large group..we were supposed to visit this place early in the morning as we could do boating and as early morning so that we could see the wild life from the boat itself..it is all taken care by the people who take us for boating..
The boat trips are quite a distance from any animal sightings,"Perhaps we had been spoiled by a wonderful boat safari in Nagahole National Park, but this one seemed poor in comparison. We were booked into the upper deck of a smaller boat, which was maintained well. However, the commentary was so muffled, we couldn't hear anything said. The bird life was quite varied and good, but any sightings of elephant and deer seemed to be in areas that were a long way off from the boat - very disappointing. The naturalist guides did help to point things out (however, one of them kept taking my camera off me and shooting lots of videos and taking pictures). I know he mean't well, but I felt I was in control of my camera.The lake itself was very pretty, and I'm sure I would have been more enthusiastic if I hadn't had the much more personal and intimate trip (of only 10 people) before. This trip must have had around 100 people on our ""small"" boat. Its a very commercial operation."
