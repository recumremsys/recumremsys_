Nice to walk around! ,"The capitol grounds are still not open, but it was nice to walk around! Parking was easy and there were many photo spots."
Closed due to COVID,In many cities the the State Capitol building occupies a prominent position in the city.  Such is the case here in Austin.  There are many places around the city where you can catch a glimpse of the distinctive capitol building.   But because there are many buildings taller than the capitol building there are not many unobstructive views of the capitol and trying to get close to the capitol to walk around the building is not possible now due to COVID.   So I give the capitol an average rating.
Capital visit,The capital was beautiful from afar.  Because of the Covid-19 we were not allowed to actually walk the grounds.  We will visit another time.
Reopen the grounds PLEASE,"The whole time I was in town they had the capital on lockdown so I could not enter the grounds. Every time I got close to the fence a undercover officer would come stand near me like I was trying to cause trouble or something. I understand what is going on in this world right now , but do we all have to suffer for others stupidity?"
Very historic and iconic,"Loved walking the grounds and seeing all the statues and reading about the history of Texas. Very fun, love bringing visiting friends here"
A nice surprise,"The Texas State Capitol is a must see if you’re in Austin. The architecture is in incredible, and we really enjoyed learning more about Texas history. It’s free to get in, you just have to go through a metal detector. I would suggest getting there early in order to beat the crowd. Make sure you wear comfy shoes- there’s plenty to see!"
Great time,A wonderful place to visit. Walking the capitol grounds is peaceful and relaxing. Very nice indoor tours when it is open.
One of the Most Beautiful Capitol Buildings,"I have been to dozens of state capitals, but this is one of the best. The building is shiny and an interesting brown color. It is one of the top buildings, but I still don’t think too much of the buildings. I normally stop for 2 pictures and then leave."
Brilliant,Absolutely beautiful buiklding inside and out and a very interesting piece of history. the grounds and statues etc are well worth the time to walk aroud and peruse.  Do not miss this place for a visit.
Lovely walk around the manicured gardens and beautifully maintained building,When we googled the State Capitol we were not quite sure what to expect but decided to make a stop to learn more about the history of Texas. It was worth the visit and would recommend it on a lovely summer day so that you can take a walk around the beautiful gardens and have a look at the different statues that are outside. The building itself is so well maintained and all the furniture is in pristine condition. I was impressed and enjoyed a self guided walk. It looked like there were guided tours as well.
The gorgeous Texas State Capitol,"We wanted to see the Texas State Capitol. However, there was a lot of traffic. Someone told me that there is always traffic.The sun was starting to go down as well.I found a place to get a picture of the Texas State Capitol. It was gorgeous! Wow!A must see!"
Beautiful building and grounds,"Had a very nice walk around the grounds.  Lots of statues, memorials and history to look at. Beautiful grounds, A nice visit."
Fun tour and way to spend a few hours,"When my S/O and I visited Austin, I had to make a stop. We opted to do the self guided tour as the guided tours were pretty packed. A lot of great history and fun architecture to enjoy and the gift shop was a nice stop too.We also enjoyed that as Texans do, there are stars and Texas plastered EVERYWHERE."
Nice Tour,"Very informative tour that we all enjoyed. My only quibble would be the sometimes lack of sensitivity in regards to Texas history. It didn’t take away from the tour as the guide was still really nice, just a bit insensitive to the plight of the Native-Americans during the formation of the state of Texas. It was nice to show the kids the Senate & House chambers. My daughter took away a good bit of info from the tour so that was a huge plus."
Beautiful building - not much to really see,Lovely grounds and lots of memorials and statuary but really - the place operates a few days a years - not much gets done and it is an overwrought classic design. It will take you 5 minutes to “get it”. Waste of tax payers money.
Beautiful!,"This place was so worth visiting.  It's beautful, and the guides are very knowledgeable and helpful.  We had lunch in their cafe - just a sandwich, but kind of cool to eat there.(I DO) remember it from the movie, Best Little Whorehouse in Texas)"
Beakutiful Capitol,"We have been here several times. It is beautiful and the dome is amazing. Well worth the effort in finding a parking place.  If you come in December, they do have a one day concert of tubas of all sizes.  The players are of all ages and they toot out Christmas carols like you have never before heard."
Beautiful capital,"Beautiful Texas capital that represents the 10th largest economy in the world.  If Texas was a country, it’s economy would rank number 10 believe it or not.  The tour takes you to the Senate and House of Representatives, the beautiful new underground annex and showcases the history of Texas from early days, it’s existence as an independent Republic (country in its own right) then as one of the most significant states in the union.  The grounds are beautiful and the capital building itself is gorgeous. It is easily walkable and parking is easy.  Highly recommended. The new underground annex is comfortable yet modern with beautiful wood and richly appointed."
Great Historical Capitol,Our tour was very informative and educational. The guide we had was excellent. He explained the history of the capitol in great detail.
Austin Holiday ,This is an amazing place looks a little like the Washington Capitol building just smaller. Free tours and history behind it is pretty good.
"Well Worth a visit, but Take the Tour",I wanted to learn more about the state of Texas. There is a free guided tour in English every hour on the hour I believe. Takes around 40 minutes to cover the inside of the building and recommend doing this to gain some insight into the history and how the governing system works. Interesting but not fascinating. For more history you should visit the Texas history museum in the grounds
Sorry to say a little disappointed!,"Visited on a Sunday and while it’s an impressive building it needs to provide far more information on its history. As a Brit visiting the state capital there should be more info about the great history of Texas which I don’t think it does. For instance there are monuments in the grounds that reflect the Alamo but very little in the building. Again some info on James Bowie but nowhere near enough. Nowadays visitors want more historic information and presented in difference and interactive formats. There were a lot of family’s visiting but nothing aimed at the children. Again the Alamo and Jim Bowie would have made great interact elements for children and probably sold more in the visitor centre gift shop. Again the visor centre was lacking and needs to be better. Sorry Austin, your a great city and expected more from this."
Impressive sight ,It’s a good way to spend an hour. It’s free to get into the building and they even have their own tours.
A nice hour or so,"If in Austin, an hour should be devoted to the Texas State Capitol at least.  We did the self guided tour - just nice to walk around."
Impressive architecture!,"Beautiful building.  We visit all state capitol buildings, and Austin is beautiful.Our 8 year old needed to use the restroom, so we did go inside.  Very impressive.  There were free tours, but we didn’t take one.Note:  Be ready to go through the metal detectors. My husband had to stay outside since he was carrying a pocket knife."
Impressive,"It is well worth your time to visit the state capitol while you're in Austin. Admission is free, and you can walk around freely or take a guided tour. Learn about how the state government works, sit in the galleries, and see pictures of every governor that has served."
Capital ,"Perfect when weather overcast, rainy or cold. Tours go every hour. Lots of history uncovered. Beautiful building"
Texas Sized Capitol!,The Texas Capitol building was beautiful and huge.  Made of marble inside and out.  Beautiful carved wood on doors and stairs provided a nice balance for all the marble.  Lovely and interesting building.We are now doing Capitol tours in every state possible.  Found a wonderful ornament from this Capitol to add to our collection.
Big,This capitol building is huge.  They have lots of free tours throughout the day so you can learn about the unique features of the building and some of the history and symbolism.  Be sure to check out the visitors center at the edge of campus as well to learn some more.
Interesting insight,"Beautiful building, well maintained and fascinating as a visitor from outside the US.My first visit to a State Capitol building, since a trip to see the sights in Washington."
Tour guide was very knowledgeable ,Beautiful building and very informational tour. Make sure when taking the tour you go inside. There are other tours that meet outside and it can be confusing.
Great experience.,"Started off with a small group tour by Tony, who was incredibly well informed about all aspacts of history,. From there we explored on our own and visited the restaurant for a rest break and then later forlunch, it was very reasonably priced. There is something for everyone here.."
Beautiful Government Building,What a beautiful building. You can feel the history. Great to learn something about the political history of Texas. No wonder these folks are proud of their state!
Beautiful building. ,We briefly stopped at the State Capital as part of a driving tour. We were shown inside and the grounds for about 10-20 minutes. It really was beautiful and it was interesting to hear the history. Pay attention to the entrance door hinges!
Beautiful building,"We did not sign up for a guided tour because we had younger children and was not sure how long they would last.  However, the guided tour was in a lot of the same rooms we were in and I wished we had signed up.  It was VERY interesting and the tour guides were very pleasant.  We enjoyed exploring the capital.  Ate in the cafeteria, which was good food.  A must see if you are in Austin."
Cool to see,You are able to walk in the different rooms and see what the rooms look like. You can walk all around the capital. You have to go through security. and be prepared for people protesting on capital lawn. It is cool to be able to see what happens and the history that has been made.
Free Tour!,Free tours are offered every 15 minutes!  We learned a bunch about Texas history and the architecture of this lovely building in just 30 minutes. There is really not to visit!
Great History Lesson.,First class tour and lots of interesting  history.   The entire complex is worth the time to appreciate the history of Texas as it became a state.
Beautiful State ,The building is the biggest State capital.  It is in wonderful condition.  The tour guide was very knowledgeable and interesting.
Quick History,"This was a fantastic tour by Darcy. She was very knowledgeable, it was free, and the building and artworks were beautiful. The tour lasted about 40 minutes and we left knowing so much more about Texas history."
Loved the Capital Building tour,"We were headed downtown from our hotel outside of the city and our Uber driver asked us if we’d ever been to the Capital Building in Austin before and we said no. He told us that it was really interesting so we decided what the heck and had him drop us off right out front. We happened to walk in just in time to catch a tour that was getting ready to leave. There’s no admission and the walking tour is free so we were happy right from the get go. Our tour guide, Bill, was a nice gentleman who gave us a great tour of the building and filled us with tons of info about the Capital and of Austin and Texas. We couldn’t have been more pleased with the whole experience and would recommend this to anyone visiting Austin."
Worth a visit,"Definitely worth a visit. The building, the ceiling inside etc are incredible. Lovely to just walk around at your own leisure exploring the different rooms on each floor. There are a lot of stairs, but also elevators. Only issue was a huge line for the restroom."
Elegant Capital Building - Friendly stadd,"Elegant building, great security staff that was thorough and friendly.  Gift shop was great.  Pretty big, got lost a couple of times."
Amazing Architecture,We spent a few hours going door to door meeting the staff members in our Senator's and Representative's offices.  Everyone was very friendly and welcoming.  If you have opinions on what is going on with our state government they are willing to listen!
Nice Tour,Went on a tour of the Capitol. Tours are free and leave every 15 or 30 minutes. They said 30 but today it was 15. The tour guide was nice and informative but it was crowded and it was difficult to hear her. We walk several flights of stairs but elevators are available. It was a nice tour of a beautiful building. Must do if your in Austin
Spectacular ~,Don’t miss this landmark during your visit to Austin. This particular state capitol is one of my favorites of all time. The walking tour of the grounds and the architectural detail both inside and out were amazing.
Texas History-Past & Present,Great day for walking around the State Capitol grounds.  Line was too long for the tour but we did make it to the gift shop which was well stocked with anything/every thing Texas!
Look at the details,The Capitol has a beautiful exterior and a more interesting interior.  Spend time looking at the details--from the woodwork to the door hinges.
nice tour,I'm not usually into this sort of thing but they gave a very nice tour of the building along with some history and a bit of discussion about how they run things.  Beautiful marble works.
Interesting historic building,I would suggest going on a Sunday as downtown is so busy rest of the week.If you want to explore rest of the area I recommend travelling here on LRT as parking at capital building is okay but rest of area difficult. Free tour is free and very good.
Very nice tour,A very nice building with a very interesting history. They offer free tours for the public. Very informative tourguides. Worth seeing.
Good stop,Beautiful building.  The pink granite was beautiful. You can tour it yourself to the top floor later. For this trip we only made the first floor.
Informative afternoon at the Capitol ,"In town visiting so we decided to stop by for a tour. Unfortunately we didn’t realize it was the Austin marathon so it was quite busy. We took the tour which I would highly recommend. Our tour group was quite large so at times it was hard to hear the guide, but still worthwhile. The architecture of the building is incredible and there are so many small details if you keep your eyes open for them. A nice free, informative thing to do while in town!"
Family Vacation ,We visited Texas State Capitol on our visit in Austin. We parked our car next to the visitourcenter and went to the place outside the building. It is a enormously building. It lays in the midle of Austin and next to down Town.
Austin 1/2 Marathon,The tour was good. Tour guide Tony was very knowledgeable about the history of Texas. The only regret I have is it is very hard to hear the tour guide due to all the back ground noise. The tour guides need to wear a wireless microphone so everyone can hear the guides
Informative tour,"We went in expecting to just have a look at the entrance hall, but ended up on the 30 minute guided tour which was genuinely interesting, expertly led by our guide (I think she was called Nancy) and gave access to both the chambers inside the building, where all the senators and congressmen and women sit (surprisingly  rarely, I should add!). Definitely worth waiting for a tour and best of all, it's completely free. Maybe not so interesting for younger kids, but definitely recommend for adults with even a vague passing interest in US history."
Very interesting!,"Inside was super. Glad they allowed us to walk around. Very interesting. Good tour. Outside statues interesting. But they should update their civil war statue....""States' Rights"" notation is BS."
Visually stunning.  Historic.,"The place dwarfs our more familiar Capitol in Sacramento, California.  It is an architectural wonder in aged, rose-hued granite.  It sits regally on a slight hilltop at the north end of Congress Ave., with downtown Austin in its vista.  And the statues on the grounds are all of historic interest, including the one commemorating the secession into the Confederacy.  Not something to celebrate in this day and age, but certainly an opportunity for education and reflection."
Lots to see at the Capitol,"Make sure you get in on a group tour because they have great stories that you wouldn't hear if you did the tour yourself.  Of course, there are self-guided tours, as well, but I thoroughly enjoyed our tour guide.  Be prepared to walk and do stairs, that place is big!"
Informative Free Tour!,This is a must see! We loved the tour and hearing all about how the state operates. The historical displays are impressive and you’ll enjoy this quick stop during your Austin vacation.
Enjoyed the capitol’s visitor center more,"I have been to many state capitols across the country and find each one unique in their own way.  To be honest, I was disappointed in Texas’s capitol from the exterior to the interior.  Yes, it’s one of the largest capitols, it is Texas so of course it would be big, but it’s no where near grand.  There were free guided tours.  We enjoyed the nearby visitor’s center which contained interesting facts about the state.  Great gifts in the shop."
Grandest in America,"The pink granite structure is as vibrant today as the day it is opened. Stop and go inside. Explore the chambers, hallways, and grand staircases. Peak inside some of the offices. Be sure to visit the gift shop in the new addition."
Beautiful & Interesting,I didn't think I would enjoy this stop on our tour. I thought it would be just another Capitol building. I was wrong. It is a beautiful and interesting piece of architecture.
A free guided tour in and around the Capitol,"Interesting sights both inside the building and on the grounds surrounding it. Lots of history, including the rich Mexican heritage."
Long weekend in Austin,Texas state capitial is a beautiful building.  We visited on a Saturday so there were no offices open however this did likely allow us to wander more then usual.
Kind of dull,Took the free small group tour and it wasn’t interesting.  Maybe the down mood of the tour guide colored the feel of the tour.  Didn’t see anything very interesting except the inside of the dome.
Second Trip to Capitol Building,This is a tremendous capitol building. Texas does everything big and the capitol is a good example. We recommend the self-guided tour that covers 13 areas within the Capitol or you can sign up for the free 30-45 guided tour.  The Capitol was first constructed in 1853 but burned down in 1881. The dome was completed in 1888.
A little piece of history ,"First time in Austin and you can see this building from all over the city, great to be able to walk around at your leisure and take in some American politics"
Wow,"Just trying to spend some time to visit cities in Texas. Austin is a great entertaining town, obviously bars at night are great get way for adults but needed to something during day, I’m glad I got to go see the Capital, it’s amazing to be allowed to see where the government works."
Ok I guess,There wasn't loads of super interesting action and adventer to be had so I wasn't all that bother. But others in the group really enjoyed it.It was it is.Needs to be visited while in the city
Learning More about History and Government,"As state capitols go, this one offers a lot to visitors. Self-guided tour brochures make it easy to get around and look at exhibits. Free, guided tours are also available. Gives a nice appreciation of how government formed in Texas. Nice gift shop and cafe too."
Excellent tours at the Capital!,"We loved visiting the Texas State Capital and learning about the history of the state,  the legislators,  and the building by our knowledgeable tour guide. Our guide was an older man who was a former professor & works in the building. He gave such a great animated tour and made it very enjoyable."
A must see,Awesome architecture and grounds with a statue mingled in here and there.The capital is pretty close to all areas in Austin. Tours are available. Parking in the street is free on Sunday.
"Amazing Architecture, Fascinating History Lesson","First as you approach the building make sure to stop and appreciate the bronze statues which give a brief look into the history of this state.  Then take the time to view the capitol building from all sides before entering this wonderful piece of architecture.  It is so impressive!  We then took the 30 minute free tour of the building.  The guides are very knowledgeable and offer both a look into the past when Texas became it's own republic and then a look at the current state and it's legislative process.  We were so impressed we decided to visit the building and take the tour twice to get a different perspective from each guide.  During the week you will finish to tour in the newest addition to the building which is housed under ground level. This addition cannot been seen from the street level but there are skylights that give this part an open feel. Well worth about 2/3 hours of exploration.  I loved the idea of their service to the government, their legislative structure and their respect for their history all housed in a stunning building!"
Fun Afternoon at the Capital,"The Capital is really grand - as you might expect in Texas! It's surrounded by a lovely park, where we were able to walk around and soak in some sun. We were also able to find parking close by, which was an unexpected but well-appreciated bonus. The inside is huge, with stories-high ceilings, regal staircases, and lots of history to check out. We really enjoyed going up a few flights of stairs and getting a better look at the ceiling, which is truly something to behold!They say everything is bigger in Texas, and based on this I am pretty sure they're right!"
Toured the Capital building.,"Did a two day visit to Austin and the area. Took a visit over to the state capital building. Very impressive. There is a guided tour but we did our own thing. Very historic. Building architecture most impressive. Even saw the governor in his office doing his business. If you are in Austin for site seeing, this little excursion is well worth your time."
Nice park ,Did not go inside but the park is very nice for a walk. Lots of monuments in the park. Great for a lazy weekend afternoon.
It's Texas!  It's Big!,"Wandering about the grounds is nice; wandering about the inside of the Capitol is even better.  Take time to discern the six flags that flew over Texas, and why one (on the floor of the Rotunda) is significantly larger than the other five.  And spend time in the Senate Chambers and House Chambers, opposite each other on the second floor.  (After all, with the legislature meeting only for two weeks, every other year, someone ought enjoy the atmosphere in those resplendent rooms.  Why not tourists?"
historic building,I love the historic building and this one didn't let me down. I was there MLK weekend it was busy so i didn't get to do as much as I wanted to due to a few rallies at the state capital ground. The inside of the capital building is beautiful. I love the display of the past and present Governors of Texas throughout the building.
A must see!,"Beautiful grounds and inside was amazing! Free tours are offered, guided and self. Everything about this building is fantastic. The stairs, the wood trim, the elevator doors, just fantastic! There is a library as well but it closes at 5. We also saw restrooms by the elevator banks. Great history."
Guess who carved the granite stone,"Amazing building and grounds-we were part of a small group tour and learned more than just going on our own.Hint about the stone carvers-it’s Aberdeen, Scotland!"
Beautiful building and grounds,"Beautiful building, well kept grounds. Can see the Capitol for quite a distance. Martin Luther King rally going on when we visited. Always fun to see ""State Capitols"" when traveling."
Must see!,"The interior is stunning, the ceilings are beautiful! Did a self guided tour, well worth planning a visit!"
History Learned,Beautiful building and surroundings with lots of Texas history. The tour guide was very knowledgeable and answered all the questions.
Beautiful building,"The Texas State Capitol is an impressive red granite structure with a dome that is taller than the US Capitol.  There are free guided tours available, but all the areas on the tour are also open to the public and there are brochures that allow you to do self-guided tours that include areas the tour doesn't cover.  The surrounding grounds are covered with monuments to everything from Confederate soldiers to firemen, Tejanos and the defenders of the Alamo."
"Interesting, but the Confederate monuments are troubling","The Capitol building is striking, but the celebration of the slavery supporting  Confederacy is troubling."
Beautifully situated.,I love that you can see the Capitol all the way down Congress.  You can walk to it easily from South Congress if you are used to walking.  I walked from my hotel and it was about 3 miles. Tours are available and it always means something special to see the heart of a state. Beautiful grounds.
Very nice State Capitol,"We were a bit thrown by the large statue to the Civil War outside which was inscribed with information about the ""North's Aggression"" in the Civil War, but I guess to Texan's, that's history. The capital is big and beautiful and there are lots of interesting photos and facts inside."
Texas State Capitol,"This is always an interesting point to visit on a trip to Austin.  Last weekend there were women there.  The annual Women's March originated on the capital grounds.  Seeing an opportunity to make sales, many Girl Scouts were there as well with wagons filled with cookies."
Impressive Building,You must do this by some tour (I believe there is a free one).  Too much about it that you will miss.
Worthwhile Stop,"The capital building is pretty cool and you can self tour or join a guide for a 30 minute session learning covering the rotunda, house chamber, senate chamber, courts and resource library. Large grounds with multiple monuments from the Civil War through WWII. Street parking on Congress Ave is easy.  Take a walk on 6th Street (4 blocks) and grab a drink and some food."
Lovely walk through the capitol park,What a beautiful campus of historic buildings.  The sun was shining in Austin and this was a great place for a stroll or a family picnic.  The inside of this capitol is something you cannot miss while in Austin.
Seat of the Texas state legislature,"The Capitol Visitor Parking Garage allows 2 hour of parking for free. As you enter the Capitol building there is airport-like security screening. There are free tours available. If you decide to walk about the building on your own the signage is poor, but employees seem very eager to be of assistance. There is dining available and there is also a gift shop."
Interesting and informative,"We took a tour of the capital. We learnt a lot and found the whole tour very interesting. I had never been to Texas before and loved the history, and the innovation in extending the building. December was also a very good time for walking and appreciating all the statues in the capital grounds. The grounds are really very beautiful."
Excellent history lesson,Tour guide animated. Very patient and lively. We learned a lot. Did not know the Republic of Texas sold off land to pay off war debt and a smaller version became the state of Texas
"Architecture, Statuary and a free tour! A great adult date or family w/kids day out.","I have been on the free guided tour several times, but I sometimes just show up to walk around. The grounds are perfect for a walking meditation depending on the day and time. Inside they will scan your stuff, but no big deal right? It's the capitol, you have to expect that. This trip is for families with kids who like that kind of thing, adults of any age and it is actually a pretty cool date in the evening when the school tours are not there. I once saw a UT choir sing on the steps during the holidays. The 30-minute tour is free from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday to Friday, departing every 30 to 45 minutes. Tours run from 9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. on Saturday and noon to 3:30 p.m on Sundays."
Outstanding Tour,"The free organized tour had just started when we arrived, so we quickly joined in.  Tour guide was a young, brunette gal and she was very entertaining!   Loved all the interesting tidbits of information she imparted.   Don’t think we would have enjoyed a self guided tour nearly so much.Highly recommend"
Really fantastic,"Just a beautiful building from the outside, yet more amazing beauty on the inside. From the foyer, to looking at the dome it is a wonderful experience. Also, can visit the Senate and the House as well as view the portraits of all if the Texas governors as well as presidents of the Republic of Texas. Just remarkable."
Beautiful building,The tour is free and very informative- especially for people who are uneducated in Texas history. It took about n40 minutes.
Beautiful building,"This is an amazing building with the lack of character,  craftsmanship detail that you only find in old buildings,  very visitor friendly."
Amazing free tour ,"The entrance is free and they have free tours during the day which are definitely worthy. We had an amazing trip and learned a lot from our guide, I could recommend more!"
Historical Gem,Wow - this place is huge and well taken care of - make sure you walk around the grounds as well and see the monuments.
A Capitol visit,"Beautiful Rotunda and the tour guides are friendly. Free guided tours all day. Check the hours. Parking deck is a short walk from the Capitol building. Very historic,  a gem really."
Great Texas history,We thankfully visited over the Christmas/New Years holidays and the legislature was not in session so we got to enjoy both chambers at a leisurely pace.  The photographs and epic paintings are just amazing.  Highlight is going to the top floor and looking both up at the dome and down at the floor that highlights all of the 'invaders' to Texas.  Wonderful experience and opportunity to educate our children about government.
Well worth spending 1-2 hours of time to explore the Capitol,"Free tours are available and the guides are very knowledgeable.   I very much enjoyed the tour of the Capitol and Texas history.   The Capitol itself isn't all that ornate compared to others I have seen, but you know you are in Texas.   I did learn that the congress is only in session every other year so when they are there is a lot to get done.  Makes you wonder why other states they work year round when Texas covers 2 years of work in 140 days."
Ground yourself in Texan history,"Firstly this building stands out because of the pink granite used which makes this building quite distinct but of course using materials from Texas.  Inside the building is yet more impressing with the huge dome, two legislature rooms and then the underground passages into the extension deliberately built under ground so as not to detract from the might of the main building itself.  We did a tour starting at 9am, parking easily in the nearby garage which is free for first few hours and certainly cheaper than some other garages in South Austin.  Our tour guide as ex middle school teacher pitched the education element just right and through paintings we got to understand the formation of Texas and some of the underlying beliefs which was helpful as the nearby Bob Bullock museum was too much for us to fit in.   Details are everywhere right down to the door hinges.   There is a small shop on site and restaurant.  The shop assistant was low on charm but a special mention for the capitol grill staff who seemed genuinely put out by having to make food for visitors rather than on-site staff.  The food was tasty but given the place was near empty a bit of charm and welcoming instead of ""go off look at the menu and come back"" would have been better."
Everything is bigger in Texas!!,"Wow, what an impressive building.  Dome is taller than the US Capitol.  Even the door hinges are custom made with the Star of Texas.  Take the tour and you'll learn lots of stuff or wander by yourself and simply explore a really cool building."
Lots of history,My visit to the Capitol was pretty cool. The building is big and a fun place to take a good photo. I'd like to spend more time inside if I could.
Changing of the Guard,Visited the state capitol and was lucky enough to see the changing of the guard. Within the historical building it was a pleasure to see so many service men and women proud of their roles and the traditions they embrace.The building itself is magnificent and the access granted to the public is incredible. Some wonderful works of art are exhibited and to see the various debating chambers was a real privilege. A must see when visiting Austin!
Easy visit- quick security check and then you can walk around as you like- beautiful building!,Very nice quick visit- a quick security check and then you can walk around as you wish- amazing rotunda- and you can go up to the higher floors as well. Beautiful building and a great way to spend an hour or so.
Very impressive and very interesting,"A must even if you have little time. Lots of history, recommend you take a tour it’s free if you stop in or with tour company ( shortened version) just to learn some of facts that make it special!"
Beautiful historic experience,"Took a free 40 minute tour of the building inside, and loved hearing the history of the building. The guide was very knowledgeable, and the inside dome was breathtaking!"
Stopped in while in Austin,Took the kids by to walk the grounds and take the tour.  Lots of history and the tour guide was great.  The grounds are expansive and there are a lot of photo opportunities outside.  It was decorated for Christmas for this stopover.  Did not think the kids would have been interested but they actually loved it.parking was free on the weekend in an adjacent parking structure.
Majestic State Capitol,"Visit to Austin is not complete without seeing the Capitol. It is majestic, towering and impressionable. Rich history and quite a professional and insightful guided tour. Make sure to undertake the guided tour. Subsequently, after the tour, take time to stroll around the building. Strive to appreciate the finer details in the decor and on the walls. For parking, we were fortunate to get street parking, however, don't stress go one-two streets in north or south of the Capitol, you will find one. In addition there are public parking in the area as well."
Great short informative tour,Tarah was awesome. Friendly and knowledgeable. We really enjoyed the two hour short tour and would highly recommend Detours as a company. The donuts were awesome too!
Disappointing,The capital looks nicer from the outside then inside It’s pretty boring  was disappointing parking was easy around the capital lots of street parking
Amazing and informative guided tour !,To better understand Small Government that works - start with a tour of the Texas State Capitol. Both houses of the State Government sit only 145 days every two years and get things done ! They write laws and let the Executive branch of the government and the bureaucrats run the state. A beautiful building with many exhibits on the construction and funding of the project also helps understand how Texas can to be and still works now. The tour guide was fantastic in spite of having a large group. Thanks
Tourism,State  Capitol building with an imposing facade. The grounds are full of sculpture by local artist and historical references. The grounds are also full of old trees and provide a great place for families to hang out in good weather
good tour,The tour was very interesting and not too long. It was easy to hear and follow everything she was saying. The tour provided interesting information.
How cool is this place,This place is so cool just learning about the Texas parliament plus just looking at how big this place is to see how much is underground
Nice state capital,A impressive state capital. It was interesting to hear the history of TX from on of the guides. Also to see how they add extra room without changing the capital. Be sure you go to the neww office wing.
Massive Capitol ,"It is on a big green area with lots of state buildings and statues. Lots of shaded area. No close parking, be ready to walk a lot up hills and steps. Inside is pretty for picture, but most of building is just photos of former Governors and such. Nice gift shop."
Must See,"If you travel to Austin, you must visit the Texas State Capitol. The building is beautiful, as are the grounds that surround it. When you go into the lobby, you will see a sign that tells you when the next guided tour begins. It's definitely worth the wait to take the tour, which is free to all visitors. We really enjoyed it."
The white building ,Yes what else could you say it's a big giant white building you can take tours but I'd rather go to the Texas Chili Parlor lol
Family,"Best state Capitol in the nation. Street parking is limited. Several parking garages are within a couple of blocks. Take the tour, it's very informative."
Austin state capital,"We visited the capital building while staying in a conference in Austin. Building is very impressive. It’s open for visiting throughout the day, and you can also walk around at night and see it from outside. Nice place to visit."
Excellent Tour and Display of Texas Racism and White Supremacy Over the Years to today,"The Capitol grounds and building are beautiful. Took a wonderful tour of the Senate and House chambers. The guide was very informative.What wasn't discussed were some of the material presented such as the poster of all the African American elected legislators between 1865 and 1900. Back when Negros were allowed to vote. But legislation, intimidation and terrorism stopped that until the next elected official in 1966. Coincidence? Outside, the most prominent commemoration is a huge status for the Confederacy installed in 1903. Clearly a statement to put Negros in their place. Was shocked it was still there along with the plaque claiming it was in response to Northern attacks and no mention of keeping slavery and discrimination as stated in the Confederate Constitution. Such propaganda! I guess enough Texans still believe it to stay in such a prominent place. There's an African American statue on the other side of the walk which seems like a concession to commemorate their contribution to Texas, but that hardly makes up for a statue that celebrates being able to buy, sell, rape and lynch Negros. Glad I learned this as a visitor to Texas before recommending Texas as a place to locate a new office. Surprised so many technology companies around with such values supported by the Capitol. That said, we really enjoyed learning about Texas history and values. Fascinating."
Congress,A very interesting historical guided tour of this magnificent building well within walking distance of the Hyatt Place hotel.
Interesting Place to spend some time,"I walked around the grounds and enjoyed the trails, access and sculptures displayed throughout the site. I walked around on a Sunday afternoon when the weather was beautiful.  In these conditions it is a popular place for photographers because it offers a great variety of locations where you can find nice backgrounds with enough seclusion to get uncluttered photos. I saw two wedding photo shoots and a couple of portrait shoots as well. The grounds are equally photogenic and there is enough information displayed to learn some Texas history just walking around."
A lovely morning in Austin,"After a nice morning strolling round Austin we visited the Capitol (all free) and had a good look round from senate room right through all very historic and impressive. As we found in Austin everyone was very hospitable and welcoming and this was no different everyone was easy going and nice!Lots of historic pictures, documents and the cupola was astonishing, highly recommended!Be sure to visit the grounds and particularly the monument to African Americans."
Great free tour,We got there around 9:15 on a weekday and wound up getting a personal guided tour from Darcy as no one else showed up then.  She gave us a great tour of the internal parts while we did the self-guided one outside.  Worth it coming in early to get the personal touch.
Downtown Doesn't Decorate and NO REAL XMAS Tree Outside,Downtown is really drab and dirty streets with no Xmas music and no decorations.  Surprisingly bad for a huge state capitol city.  There is also the homeless wandering around and the stench of that weird slow flowing waterway that passes 2 bar/restaurants.  Guess that's what they mean by Keep Austin Weird........
History in the making,"Helpful guides, clear signage and wonderful portraits (David Crockett!) make this a must-do trip for Austin visitors"
Trip through Texas history,Had a few hours to kill so my brother-in-law and walked around the grounds of the state capital yesterday.  We spent some time looking at the various monuments but the one that moved me the most was the one dedicated to the African-American slaves in Texas.   I’m always overwhelmed by how times we’re so different years ago.  We’re not perfect yet but this country and the world are making strides in the right direction.
Excellent visit,This is an awesome building. Entry and the tours are free. If you like history etc then this is fir you.
A Texan who is proud of her state capitol!,"If in Austin, you must visit our state capitol.  Being an Austin resident for 20 yrs and native Texan for 51, I have visited our capitol many times.  In my opinion, it is the prettiest capitol there is, including our nation's capitol.  The pink granite is gorgeous and was mined west of Austin.  The door hinges, floor, ceiling, doors - you name it - they all are beautiful and have a story. Our capitol and Lake Travis are the best parts of Austin, in my opinion!"
A must when in Austin,We enjoy visiting capitol buildings and this was a great one to visit.  Employees were helpful when one had a question. The brochure map can be a bit confusing for the layout tour but it works.
Lovely Historic Structure & Grounds,"Definitely worth experiencing. They also offer a free 30-minute tour (which we didn’t know until after we had self toured). We would have done that, had we been aware. Place was packed, so we were ready to move on..."
Toours areally jam-packed with interesting history!,"When visitors come to town, the State Capitol building is always on our list of must-see places to visit. You can walk your way through browsing and/or join one of the tours. Tour guides are very informative and Texas-proud. Views inside & outside are spectacular. Check out the hours to make sure you have time to pop in and stay for a while."
"""Great History and Tour""",There is a free public tour of this placde the tour guide was very kind.There is also a buffet and giftg shop inside.
Gorgeous building ,Great day to see the capital and what a great building The Christmas tree was all set for the lift this week
Such a historic place,I have been to the Texas State Capitol many times. It is always beautiful and a wonderful place to visit. Even if you’re not from Texas the majesty of it all is breathtaking. I highly recommend anyone that is in Austin or will be visiting Austin to go by and take a look around.
Informative tour!,Great tour of the Texas capitol with lots of Texas information and history. The capitol building is very big and the tour takes about an hour.
I love history,My partner and I did a self guided tour of the capital building. Very nice and of course its huge. I live how we were able to go into the chambers and many of the offices.
Happy Thanksgiving.,"Enjoyed very much, it was raining so could not tour outside, tour was nice, tour guide very knowledgeable. After tour walk around for about an hour.   Would return."
Beautiful building - inside and out,This is a nice free visit that is worth the trip.  It was fun to explore the building from different levels.  It is a nice mix of history and architecture.
Very nice,Visited here for about an hour.  Street parking is available a block away. We just strolled the grounds and saw the building from the outside as we didn’t have time for more. The building is large and visually impressive.  Children had a nice time climbing trees and playing on the grass. Nice place for a visit.
Visiting UT Austin,Our family love the State Capital and we were happy to know that it was open for the public on Sunday for a tour. Y’all should come and visit! It’s very historical!
Orange County traveler,This is a great and free place to visit!  There are tons of open space and the sculptures around the Capitol are interesting to look at.  This is not a busy area.  You should stop by and check it out.
Beautiful Architecture!,"Definitely the most beautiful piece of architectural design Austin has to offer. It really does look like the Capitol in Washington, but slightly taller. Definitely a must do while in Austin."
Beautiful capitol building,"The Texas State Capitol building is an impressive and beautiful building from the outside.  Going inside we were able to see both chambers, though they were empty when we there.  An impressive place to visit."
Going back again!,We spent a little time in the capital on a small group tour.  Going back tomorrow to do the free tour of the capital that starts every half hour!  Beautiful building!
Must visit. They give tours,Another way to use taxpayer's money. The place is fantastic especially if you appreciate Texas history......Don't mess with Texas.
A Place where History Resides,The Texas State Capitol and its grounds provide a rich historical conversation for those interested in learning about Texas.  This is my second time visiting this august building.  The second visit was much better than the first!
Zoom ZOOM!,"So, we popped over to Austin for our anniversary, and decided to rent electric scooters to see the city. It was great. Parked across Lady Bird Lake and walked to the beautiful capital building. Took scooters back and really, really enjoyed the city. This is the way to do it. We had a great time."
Amazing place to visit,Good place to visit when you come to Austin. Every 1 hour they do a inside tour guide for one of the Capitol’s employee.
Learn Some History,"A beautiful building, open to the public with free guided tours.  If a guide is not available, informational brochures are available for a self guided  tour. The guide, Trish, was very impressive with her knowledge and ability to express herself.  She encouraged us to meander through the building after the tour to spend more time in an area of particular interest. At her suggestion, we also walked the short distance to the Visitor Center to watch two informative films."
Fun to visit,The capital is very impressive and expansive when you actually get there. The grounds are huge with towering trees and interesting statues to learn about. Over friendly squirrels everywhere. The rotunda inside is fun to go to the top of and look down. Pretty cool overall.
Gotta See It,So impressive.  Everything is bigger in TX.  The TX Capital is actually 15 feet taller than the nation's capital.  Take the guided tour.  Also take some time to stroll around the grounds outside.  Very peaceful and reflective place!
A site to see for all!,"I took my daughters to see the Capitol in Austin Texas this past week. It was a great experience all around for multiple reasons! It brought us together as a family in our great state of Texas’ Heart! Family first and Foremost! Second, it involves a lot of learning both Historically and for my family as a whole. Back in 1986 the Goddess of Liberty which sits atop the capitol was remastered in pure bronze. I was blessed enough to have a small involvement in the process. My grandparents family business, Dell Ray Bronze, was awarded the job of remastering this awesome piece of History. I was able to watch the entire process from start to finish despite being around my children’s age at the time of the process. I remember it vividly and will never forget it! Go check out some History and take the family to enjoy some true Texas History! You won’t be disappointed!"
The capital is beautiful from the outside.  ,You really only need to view the capital from the outside. We had a free tour.  The inside was not as exciting.
Fantastic Tour Guide,Went on a field trip with my 5th grader and her class. The tour of the visitor center and capital was much too short but our tour guide was fantastic. If you ever get to choose...ask for Georgia!
Beautiful architecture,Open on sundayFree entrance Beautiful architecture Brochure Enter chambers and see the government at work
Cool architecture,"Such cool architecture. We started off doing a tour, but aren't really history buffs so split off on our own. It was fun just to walk around and go through all the rooms on our own. The house of representatives and senate rooms are pretty cool!"
It is a must,It is important in order to know how the local legsilative system works. Beside theis it is buetiful building very well kept and in very nice surroundins
Big,"As they say everything is big in Texas and this applies here.  Hit the visitor center first and get a map, then walk around it and take it all in, then go explore inside, remember if there is no rope or locked door you can go in"
"Very nice historical building, worth the trip.","Great architecture, lots of historical facts to learn, it is a good place to go to if one wants to learn more about Texas.  It could have more info relevant to the different people that are shown through paintings etc, but one can do homework online or in books too, so it is not that difficult.  I did not check if they had guided tours but I am sure it is available, so it is artially my fault / choice if I was lacking some details there.  Would recommend for sure."
Very cool,The Capitol building is a must when visiting Austin. Such great architecture and they have a free tour! It’s only a half hour but very informative. I would go back again because it’s so big I’m sure we didn’t see everything.
Impressive building,"Massive and impressive building. The interior is pretty especially the ceiling.  Go up to see the chamber which is still active. The roof is closed , which was disappointing. Beautiful architecture."
Great time at the TEXAS STATE CAPITOL,Very nice buildings and ample history with good info.Go check it out. Will not be disappointed!Downtown is busy for parking. But there is a lot close by andis very convenient.
Interesting Visit,We had a really interesting visit mainly due to the great guide we had. She was extremely informative and made the tour interesting. Not being American it was good to hear how their local government system works. Well worth the visit and it was free to get in.
USA f1 gp,"Had a day sight seeing was a fantastic city , Capitol Hill was the highlight of the day , reading the history learnt so many things I didn’t know , the buildings are great and the staff are so friendly nothing was too much trouble and had to bring the kids a gift from the shop ."
Great visit,Lovely building in the heart of Austin with some interesting facts and great pictures available. The inside is very impressive. Nice that it’s a free attraction!
Interesting,"Huge historic building, still used. Very impressed with the monumental size and level of cleanliness. Had a great cheap lunch too. Very friendly and helpful staff."
A rosy vision. ,"When visited right before sunset the Capitol takes on a beautiful rosy glow, due apparently to the feldspar content of the granite its built from. The grounds are a lovely walk even if you don’t go in. There are numerous statues including one for the Alamo. It’s a great historical step back in time."
New Orleans to Austin Road trip 2019,"Lots of great Texan history in this amazing building, well worth a trip to see this working building in all its glory."
Worth It!,Great place to tour in Austin. It's a short tour (30 minutes) with a lot of interesting information about Texas. It's free and parking is free as well.
Beautiful architecture and history ,"Had the opportunity to explore on our own a bit and to take the public tour. Tour guide shared some interesting historical facts around the building. Beautiful architecture, art and history."
beautiful building,Tour was OK. Only 30 minutes so easy to fit in. They started about every 15 minutes during busy part of day.
A touch of Washington in Austin,Approaching the Capitol building you can clearly see the resemblance with our Nation's Capitol. Inside there is a large rotunda looking up at the domed ceiling.  Several of the historical figures in Texas history have their statues in the rotunda. I was lucky to get on a tour and was able to get the history of the building and the 2 legislative chambers. One can also roam the hallways on thier own  with audio. At the North end of the Capitol there are underground offices along with a gift shop and a very nice cafeteria. The hallways here are just as amazing as the main building. Stop in to see a bit of Texas History when visiting Austin.
A quick Tour of the Capitol,We literally walked in the east doors and out the west doors. Nice on the inside but not much to really see. The plaques and such on the grounds are far more interesting.
Amazing building,"The Capitol is a great place to visit, whether you can only stay a half hour or a few hours.  We didn't have time for the free tours, but it was amazing standing and looking up at the architecture from the focal point on the main floor."
Great building to visit,Amazing buiding that you can just walk around and look into all of the important spaces.  There is loads of history here and great architecture.  Dont forget to also visit the two level underground extension as well
A must see if you love TEXAS,"This building, with it's history and beauty is a must see if you are from Texas or want to know more about Texas."
Texas in its full glory! ,"This beautiful building represents the ""the bigger the better"" philosophy!! It is pretty inside & outside. We were there around Halloween & got the treat of two tours - one general tour of the rooms & their functions & the other a Halloween tour where murders, fatal accidents & ghost appearances were narrated! Both presenters were very entertaining & knowledgeable!"
Great building with history.,I loved my tour of this place. It has a lot of history with it. It is a great location. The tour was very interesting. The staff was very friendly and helpful.
Impressive ,Thought we would come to see. Great weather made it a great time. We walked around all the grounds and looked at all the statues which were full of history. Inside was also interesting to see all the chambers where everything happens.
Texas history unfolds!,"Wonderfully well preserved and maintained facility. The tour guide was very informative and accommodating (my wife had a broken foot, walking with a cast boot). Even if your not into the building, the history was fascinating!"
Amazing building & history,Visited s as part of the realm Austin tour and thoroughly enjoyed the architecture and history took the building. Made even better with our tour guide Matt from Austin detours.
Must see in Austin,Guided and self-guided tours available.  Lots of Texas history.  More history and artifacts at the Bullock Museum.
"Great place, exceeded expectations ","Was part of a tour group ( sidled my way in!). Really informative and a stunner of a building.I had no expectations going in, but ended up having a great time."
Do the tour its super cool,"We did the 1/2 hour walking tour and it was super interesting,  you get a lot of behind the scenes information that you wouldn't know just from visiting."
Very Spacious ,"The congress was not on session. We did not join the guided tour but the self guided tour helped us a lot. Large staircases, beautiful portraits and helpful staff were wonderful. The garden is large and maintained very well. Great place to learn more about Texas and legislators."
Austin State capital of Texas,"Beautiful!!! We are here for Austin Film Festival. We are authors, writing screenplays. It was extra cold coming from Hawaii. We will bring extra clothes next year."
Nice area,We visited the Capitol while on a mini get away. We could see the building from our hotel. The grounds are very nice.
An amazing building and it’s free!,"From its wonderful architecture on the outside to the dome ceiling inside, this is an amazing building and well worth a visit.  The House of Reps was in session and it was great to see it."
Texas Stars Everywhere,"Trish was a wealth of information as well as sweet and professional.  Beautiful architecture.  Would highly recommend this short, free tour.  No detail too small for Texas.  Embellished door hinges and lighting."
Beautiful Engineering & Architectural Marvel,"The building was designed in 1881 and constructed during 1882 to 1888. A greater than 100 years old building. Having visited atleast 10+ US state Capitols but this is my first inside visit of the capitol and this is just awesome, wonderful architecture, beautiful exteriors and wonderful interiors. Walk around the senate, offices, stairs, look at the dome from inside at the center of the building. Must visit if you are at Austin."
"Interesting for the history of the place, but not a stimulating experience","It's worth the tour, but find other more stimulating activities to interlace for the day. Incredible architecture, impressive history and capital building of the greatest state in the US"
What a Capitol Building!,Go visit and walk around - absolutely stunning. Make sure you go downstairs and upstairs - you won't be disappointed.
Beautiful grounds,"My wife & I did a morning walk in Austin from our hotel near convention center to the Capitol building, very nice grounds & lovely structure of Texas Stone."
Really interesting ,We really enjoyed visiting the Texas State Capitol build. They run free tours throughout the day and the tour guide who led us round the building was really entertaining and gave us loads of history and facts about Texas and the building. It is very grand with loads of historical artwork and was interesting to visit both the Texas house of representatives and the senate. Definitely worth a visit if you are in Austin.
Amazing,It has been years since we visited the capital. Took the tour on a Sunday and it was awesome. I love my great state of Texas.
When in Texas!,When in Austin you have to visit the state capitol! Such beautiful grounds and architecture! They run 30 mins free tours where the guide are very knowledgable which is good.
Weekend get away,Since we were in the Capitol of Texas we decided to visit the grounds.  to Beautiful buildings and a relaxed atmosphere.
Tours available daily ,"Toured the capitol for the Halloween tour.  Beautiful architecture and worth looking around. When not in session, it’s more of a museum than a capitol. Tour guide very informative."
Texas Capitol,For Texans this is a wonderful visit and reminder of the beauty of this building.  For out of state visitors please take a moment to tour the capitol building and seen the architecture of this historic building
Impressive!,"We walked to and around the capitol one evening. The lighting was great and the various monuments around were fascinating. There were people from all walks of life enjoying the grounds. We saw families, joggers, etc. It was well lit and stunning to see at night. Definitely recommend!"
Worth a visit and it's free!,We went to the capitol for a couple of hours.  Very nice grounds around it and it is very nicely maintained.  And you can take a free tour and it cost nothing to get in.  We learned a lot.  Worth a visit.
Beautiful building!,The building is beautiful - and big!  We had a free tour - with Karen as our guide - and she was really knowledgeable and friendly.  The grounds are beautiful too.  A definite must if you're visiting Austin.
Great place to visit ,"Great place to visit.. free entranc and so much to see.. Both chambers, the Rotunda, the old cashiers office..Worth a visit"
Beautiful Architecture,We visited the Texas State Capitol while we were visiting our daughter and son-in-law in Austin. The capitol itself and the surrounding grounds are beautiful. You can stop in the visitor's center and pick up a guide to do a self-tour or you can go inside the capitol and take a guided tour.  It is a beautiful area to walk around and take pictures.  We were there on a Friday afternoon and it was fairly crowded. The visitor's parking garage is free for your first two hours and $1 for every 30 minutes after that.  Definitely worth the visit.
Glad we went!,"We walked to the capital building on a Saturday afternoon. The grounds and building itself are a sight to see. The building is beautiful. We did not do a guided tour because of time restraints, but wish we could have. We strolled through and enjoyed looking at the portraits and the woodwork. Well worth a visit."
Nice place to walk,Walked here from our hotel and enjoyed touring the grounds.  Lots of statues and plaques to explore and learn from.  There was a crowd of people rallying for a cause with the center walk as a congregating point.  Plenty of trees for shade on hot days.  The building itself was remarkable and fun to explore.
I learned so much!,"Lots to brag about the amazing guided tour I had at the Texas Capitol, the interactive movie Texas Spirit, the origin of the term Six Flags, etc. Greatly educational and entertaining  is It!"
Definately worth a visit,Did the public tour on a Saturday. Was very busy. Took about an hour. We had a large group with 50+ people. Would definately recommend the visit.
Guided tour ,Superb guide gave us a tour of the building- a must do for a visit to Austin! A history lesson and an enjoyable introduction to the origins of the state.
Magnificent building,Must see if you go to Austin. Did a two hour tour with Austin tours would highly recommend it as it goes to places you would never see
A must to see!,I can't begin to explain the beauty of this historic building. The rotund is breathtaking. The grounds are manicured and just as impressive as the building itself!
The Real Austin Tour,A great visit to an amazing building .  Awesome information to whet the appetite for a more informed visit at a more relaxed pace .
Mr Jim ,"Kinda okay,  really not much to see.  Since they only meet every two years for a few months I'm not sure why they need this building. They should meet at Dennys and save the taxpayers the expense of running this place."
"Beautiful, take the tour!","Went to visit the Capitol, we happened upon a tour (South entrance), which leaves every 15 to 30 min and lasted about 35 minutes. Our guide, Darcy, was super friendly and knowledgeable. Greatly enjoyed seeing the beautiful architecture and learning about the Capitol history, such as- how did a state which recently got readmitted to the Union after its side lost the Civil War, finance such a fantastic building? Darcy told us! Highly recommend this tour while in Austin. I'm not even a Texan and I got so much out of it!"
Great,I pop in the visitor information and discovered that there is a walking tour free for visitors every 15 minutes. The building is impressive as well as the tour coordinator that will supply you with the full history of Texas and the capitol. It is really a gem.
Everything‘s bigger in Texas!,Everything‘s bigger in Texas including the capital! This is a massive sprawling Capitol building. Lots of history. Definitely take one of the tours. Each month they have themed tours which are pretty cool also. Check out the gardens on the north lawn. Plan to spend about an hour or so depending on which tour you might want to take. Very friendly staff.
Free and nice!,It’s really a beautiful place....inside and out. When you go in be sure to check out the times for the tours. Very educational and just really nice to see. Tour is about 20-30mins if that.
Beautiful building,"The Texas State Capital is a beautiful building! I would give the building itself 5 stars, but the free tour we tried to go on a one star. There were a lot of people for our tour on Saturday. Our tour guide couldn’t project her voice loud enough for us to hear. We ended up doing a self guided tour, which worked out just fine for us."
At Last,"Even though I am a Texan, this was my first visit. Austin Detour guide, Steven, brought this incredible building and it’s history shiningly alive."
Very nice stroll,Really enjoyed our visit to the state Capitol. Good to see Texas hasn't succumbed to the way of liberal stupidity. The statues on the outside were awesome. The walk around the building was very nice.
Must see,"It has the highest dome of all Capitol state buildings and one of the largest, beautiful grounds and really Grand"
Definitely worth the visit!,We got there just in time for the tour. There is one every half hour. Our tour guide was exceptional! Very articulate and congenial. I highly recommended taking the guided tour. Beautiful building and facilities.
Beautiful building,We walked to the capital and happen to get there just as a tour was starting.  The building was very impressive and so well kept.  Everything sparkled.  The tour was great and we learned many things about Texas.The tour was about 45 minutes.  Then we meandered on our own for a while.
GREAT SIGHT TO SEE,"Building contains a lot of texas history, is sometimes a bit too crowded but worth the wait and walk."
Dont go on the weekend,If you go do not go on the weekend. EVERYTHING is closed except the rotunda which is impressive but you walk a bunch to get there and nothing else is available to the general public.
Living History,Very informative tour I wish I could remember our guides name she was bubbly and intelligent and knew her Texas history. You could tell she loved her job so it made us more invested. I would recommend for anyone. Tour lasts less than 1 hour.
Neat building,"If you like neat buildings, check it out! The interior and exterior are both cool, and open later than you'd expect. Worth a visit!"
Guided Tour is a Must!,I have been with both of my kids on field trips and with family visiting twice. I learn something new with every visit. Tons of history and just cool to be in the building where the state's business is conducted.
Amazing.,Very interesting place for numerous reasons.  Definitely a must if you are in Austin.  Beautiful building
Beautiful capitol and grounds,"The state capitol building is an Austin landmark, visible from every part of the city.  We didn't spend a great deal of time but got the sense that Texans are proud of their capitol and planned the city around it."
Neat place to see,We loved getting to see and tour the Capitol building.  It's beautiful!  Details everywhere!  I wish we could have visited on a day to watch proceedings of the Senate but we didn't make it on a day they were in session.  The grounds are also beautiful.
Texas State Capitol,Very interesting history. I recommend taking the 30 min. Free tour. Also allow time to explore on your own.
Wonderful Building,This was a stunning building and worth a couple of hours.   There were free tours with a guide or self guided tours with a free map.
looking for souvenirs,"Gr88888888 service people were really friendly. Ample parking, clean shopping area, good selection of items"
Interesting and beautiful capitol building,We visited as part of the Austin City Detours.  It was informative and fun to see the Texas capitol building!
Amazing Building ,This is a great spot for a walking tour of downtown. Amazing architecture and history. You literally can walk anywhere inside and adventure. The history is well documented and informative. Nice for Texas to open their doors
Good tour,"Big and beautiful capitol. Free guided tour was not a deep dive, but very interesting. Excellent visitor center, so if you need any info regarding Austin or Texas, this is the place to visit."
Texas state Capitol,I definitely recommend anyone to go to the capital and check it out when you go to Austin for the 1st time and also do one of their tours it's very educational and there's lots to see around the building because of the statues and what they mean
State capital ,"Marvelous visit. Guided tours. Everyone was pleasant and helpful. History. Art.  What else do you need? Well, I really liked the capital grille. I spent a lot more for a lot less while visiting Austin. The food was excellent fresh and tasty. There was a huge variety. And it was reasonably priced. I highly recommend the frozen yogurt."
beautiful building and grounds,We walked around the capitol grounds on a very warm September day!  lots of shade and worth the visit.
Worth a visit with free guided tour provided ,This is a very nice building open for public visit for free.  Free guided tour is available with almost 15 mins interval (very frequent during a week day when I visited).  Photo taking is allowed so it’s an advantage!
Quick tour self guided,"Very nice afternoon, took the kids, learned some history. Shoped at the gift shop. Very nice Saturday."
Worth the trip,Great architecture and uncanny resemblance  to DC. Beautiful grounds and side buildings to check out.
Beautiful,"Texas does not disappoint with the grounds and the capitol.  Tour guide was super informed, retired 5th grade teacher.  Views were great and could hear everything guide said."
Lovely setting,"We stopped by on a very hot Sunday afternoon and enjoyed our time in the museum as as in the capitol  We happened upon a symphonic concert in the rotunda, nice touch.  Well worth the time to see."
Cool history,"As a new Texan, it was really cool to get to wander the whole building and see exactly how the Texas legislature works. I didn't take a guided tour, but overheard a few things and talked to other staff, who were all very knowledgeable and happy to entertain my questions."
Iconic and Beautiful,"This building is an outstanding representation of the State of Texas.  At one point, this was the tallest capitol building in the US.  It still is a great representation of the simple but grand state of Texas.  We just walked around after hours, but you can do guided tours."
Classic Texas Masterpiece,If you are in Austin take time at least for a quick walk through this piece of Texas History! Stunning in so many ways & easy to walk through & see the House & Senate Chambers & the stunning rotunda.Tip: Street parking available around the outer edges.
Beautiful building ,"Shame about the protesters chanting and marching around the building:( A bit daft considering everyone official had gone home hours before!Anyway, the building is awesome! Amazing in particular the statues and views, so well done! Great  part of history well captured."
Beautiful architecture,We visited the Texas State Capital building in September 2019.  It is a beautiful building with amazing architecture.  Take note of the hinges on all of the doors!  We toured the House and Senate chamber and viewed many historical portraits lining the walls.  Every Past Governor’s portrait hung in the rotunda.  What I found to be nice also was the fact the building is visible from the University of Texas....very similar to the layout of the Mall in DC.  If you like architecture it’s a must see while in Texas.
At Historic Texas state Capitol,"I visited the State Capitol in Austin on Monday Sept. 16, 2019. I went through both the main portion and the relatively new extension. My tour guide took us to both chambers of the legislature. I found the tour interesting and very thorough. I highly recommend Austin tourists take the tour of this very interesting building."
Peaceful ,It's so peaceful and beautiful here! We came to walk around and it was very informative! This is also a great place to sit down for a bit since it so relaxing since there is alot of shade!
Worth a trip to see,"Incredible architecture and stunning interior, well worth the walk if your downtown.  Make sure you go up the stairs to the top floor and work your way back down."
Capitol,"So cool to see the capitol. The star in the middle of the rotunda is eight feet across, which is hard to believe. And if you stand on the star in the middle of the six flags it’s an unusual auditory experience, which is not to be missed. Great experience!"
Interesting ,We arrived just in time for the last tour. The guide was I teresting and knowledgeable. There is a gift shop in the Capitol at the end of the tour and the visitors center. We had a great time and wish I had more time to walk around but had to get back home. It was an interesting and relaxed environment.
Beautiful builsing,"Not a TON to do. However, it is a gorgeous building and it is so neat to see the actual senate and house chambers. The architecture and history is fantastic! Beautiful grounds around the building as well."
"Amazing building, excellent tuor",One of the largest state capitol buildings in impeccable condition and shown to us by a great guide.
Beautiful elegant building,We went here on an extremely hot day in September but was glad to have made the effort. Not only was the building magnificent but the staff and guides welcoming and knowledgeable. Not to be missed.
"A definite must, beautiful building ","The capitol and it's grounds are really elegant and beautiful. The grounds contain a series of impressive memorial statues and you can get a pamphlet inside the capitol guiding you around them and pointing out the best vista's for each.The capitol building itself is a stunner. Once inside, looking right up into the central dome from the ground floor is fabulous. It's completely free to go into and they also offer free tours once ans hour if you prefer a guide. The council chambers are fascinating too and they contain a good number of paintings depicting important people from the past.Big thumbs up."
Take a free guided tour,"We just showed up and took the offered free guided tour. The guide was a bit mechanical, but he was knowledgeable answered all the questions we had. There was good photo-opportunities, and the view over the park is pretty. It is an experience to see the Senate and the House and all the pretty pieces of art they have in there. It is a free experience, but they have security check by the entrance."
Beautiful!,"I'm more of a nature buff than a history buff, so I'm sure it'd earn 5 stars from the latter. The architecture and grounds are lovely, and they run a free tour every half hour, which I didn't participate in because I wanted to be outdoors, but I'm sure it would be fascinating from a historical/architectural perspective."
Nice tour around the grounds,Beautiful grounds. Very clean and well kept. I just walked around and enjoyed the statues and landscapes.
Beautiful Building,Beautiful structure. Once was the tallest building in Austin. Beautiful inside. We lucked upon the Mexican independence from Spain celebration. Nice shady place to walk and view contrasting monuments saw dedicated to confederate soldiers and one dedicated to the contributions of blacks to the city. Must see.
My boyfriend showed me around,"This building is full of history.  Especially for fans of the Alamo, this is a must see destination!  There are even underground floors and the hardworkers who created this masterpiece of a building are credited."
Amazing visit,"We arrived from the North entrance taking photos of several statues/monuments after going through a security check we walked through to the South entrance having a look at the old vault before going on a your with a guide which is a must do you learn a lot more doing this they are free so would definitely recommend we had a lady called Georgia who had a sense of humour and very informative. Took about 45mins to do the tour.we came out the South entrance which technically is the main entrance,more monuments great photo opportunities amazing building one of my husband's highlights in Austin and other parts of the USA we have travelled to."
Big as Texas,"An absolute not to miss when you visit Austin. The largest state capital of the 50. The pinkish red granite, the paneling is awesome. A lot about Texas history and heroes that made the state great."
Even bigger than it seems! ,"We did a free guided tour that was a bit hard to hear because voices echo a lot (everything is visitable so you don't actually need the tour, but we probably got more out of it anyway than if we'd visited by ourselves). I especially liked the underground part. The guide I think is an unpaid volunteer and very clearly a proud Texan"
"Nice trip to know about Texas and Austin, greatly maintained, very visitor friendly","The State Capitol is surprising friendly to visitors. We spent a couple of hours, touring through the capitol building's various halls and rooms, learning quite a lot about Texas, its history, its people, its government, etc.The building and the surrounding are quite tranquil and pretty, though we came on a weekend. Lots of tourists and none politicians. Well, not a whole lot of tourists either. A good visit for us."
Got to see every state capital! ,"Love the history, murals and the rotunda.  Texas is fascinating and built by hard working brave pioneers who came cross country to settle a new nation.  It became a state but the history remains and the true grit of the people prevails.  Texas is the friendship state.  Nice people, great food and love the history!"
Oath Ceremony,"Attending the Oath Ceremony of TEXAS senator Carol Alvarado was truly an amazing experience for my daughters.   The state Capitol was very wheelchair access accommodating, the building is so beautiful. Every one was cordial.  We will return to visit, definitely."
God Bless Texas,"Clean, safe, historical and Troopers don’t mess with you.  Recommend. Really enjoyed it. Great access to everything and very good experience."
Capitol Building,"Tours are available every 15 minutes! We took a tour with one of the tour guides and you could tell she loved history and telling us the backstory of the Capitol building. I highly reccommend visiting the Capitol, as both the inside and outside is stunning and holds lots of history."
"Interesting, free tour of the State Capitol Building.",Our guide was really great. She took us through the building and showed us the two chambers of the State legislature. The building is beautiful and classic. It was interesting to learn that the legislature meets every other year for about 5 months.
Interesting historic building,"Really enjoyed our visit to the State Capitol. We decided on the escorted tour which was informative (if a little difficult to hear/understand at times) and took us to the various rooms of importance. We were then left to explore on our own and couldn't resist re-creating a few scenes from the ""Little Side Step"" song from Best Little Whorehouse in Texas which was filmed here."
Texas State Capitol,"Texas State Capitol 1100 Congress Ave, Austin, TX Defenders of the Alamo MonumentBoth worth seeing.I used to live across from the Capitol in the Westgate Bldg. So I wld see the Capitol every dayThe buildings and grounds are  BEAUTIFUL. Nice for walking If you come to Austin Texas go see them"
Interesting ,"It looks impressive when you approach it and when you get in and look up to the top it does not disappoint. Free to go in, you can walk around with or without a guide and it’s a very interesting place. Definitely worth a visit."
Interesting!,Went here on a fluke but totally enjoyed it.  Texans definitely are proud of their history.  The free tour was very informative.  Impressive.  I’d recommend.
Very well maintained capitol.,the staff and security are very welcoming and help to make this a very accessible and valuable asset.  I really enjoyed the visit.
"Very Interesting Tour, Hot Day Escape",The tour was very informative and interesting even for this non-Texan. The building is beautiful with lots of historical features. I especially liked the light fixtures in the Chambers! Nice gift shop also for gifts and souvenirs. We walked around the grounds to see the various memorials and sculptures first and then cooled off during the tour.
Visit to Texas State Capitol in Austin,Very nice placeInformation is very helpful Free guide tour every hour Worth a visit. Very historic and nicely labelled museum
Great visit,"The Senate and commons houses are such a great learning experience. Reminds us of our American law system. Stand in the star in the lobby. Look up. And directly in the middle, you voice echoes. One step out and it doesnt. Pretty cool"
Interesting visit,"Enjoyed the visit to the State Capital. Learned quite a bit about a Texas history.  Worth a visit. The building is very impressive.  Took the free guided tour which was about 30 minutes or so.  Gave 3 stars only because I think the visit is more reserved for people who are looking to learn something about the history of Texas. Other than some older paintings of Davey Crocket and the surrender at San Jacinto, there are no earth shattering historical artifacts that are part of the tour."
Did you know...?,"The Texas State Capitol is one of 13 most stunning Capitols in the U.S.? It is certainly one to add to your list of things to do in Austin, especially if you have children. The detailed architecture is something to behold. There is a guided tour that is very popular but I like to meander through the halls alone, looking at the paintings, reading the history, looking up at the ceiling and down at the details on the floor. And I'm not just sayin' this 'cause I'm a TEXAN!"
Worth the trip.,"We really enjoyed our visit. Tours are every  30 minutes. Very informative and free! While we were waiting for our tour, a guide took the two of us in the back to see the old treasury vaults.  The guides are excellent and very knowledgeable.  I'd suggest going earlier in the morning to avoid some crowds."
Very interesting,Take one of the guided tours as you learn a lot of interesting facts about a Texas. It is a beautiful building with detailed architecture. Well worth the trip.
Great historic building ,A great building that shows the grand history of Texas.Houses the state Senate and the meeting hall.Many beautiful paintings and the building by itself is beautiful and extremely well kept to the point that it looks like it was when it was just built
Beautiful place ,Lots of history we took the walking tour with a guide and learned a lot about history some rooms were closed it took less than 2 hours.
Outstanding Tour,"How proud we are to be Texans! Our State Capitol building and grounds are praise worthy. We had not planned to take a tour, because we had visited many times before, but we are so glad we did. We first visited informally with one guide, who is a retired history teacher, and, because of his encouragement, we decided to take the next tour available. Becky was our guide, and she was a wealth of knowledge. Instead of a 1/2 hour tour, she spent a whole hour with us. The visit to the Capitol and the tour were definite highlights of our short trip to Austin. We highly recommend enjoying one of the tours offered by the outstanding staff."
"Free tour, yes!",Great 45 minute tour. The tour guide you could tell loved talking about the history and interacted with the group. I learned a few things and enjoyed the architecture of the building. It took us a few minutes to figure out where to park but when we finally found the right garage it was free for the first two hours. Nice visitor center and park as well.
Love this!,"I so enjoyed the walk around this spectacular building and amazing grounds.To me, it offered so much of what I love, architecture, history and natural beauty.The monuments were detailed and huge and well documented. The architecture was eye catching and the grounds were wonderful. You could walk it and also sit and reflect.I think you must see this when you visit Austin.  I do every time."
The kids even enjoyed it!,"We took our children - ages 7, 12, 15 - on a tour of the Capitol despite their protests that it would be boring. 2 of the 3 really enjoyed it and were engaged throughout the tour. The guide gave a great overview of the history of Texas as well as how the State runs. It was a short (30 minutes) tour but packed full of information as well as seeing different spaces in the building. Great way to get a history lesson and cool off during the hot summer!"
"Beautiful building, informative tour","Did the tour inside the capitol, our guide was great. The tour was short and sweet, worth doing. The building is beautiful. There are multiple things you can see outside. We were there for about 45-60mins.  I recommend seeing"
