Adults visited,Both of my children (now grown up) visited here on school trips so as adults we've never visited when staying in Ballarat. We spent 2.5 hours leisurely walking around and it was enjoyable. Glad we've been now.
Cold wet and controlled.,Half price ticket and half the experience. Treating people as if there is a plague. Using video surveilance to monitor people and keep them apart....wiping down seats and surfaces continually. At this rate Victoria and Australia are facing a totalitarian reset and collapse. Overall it's certainly not the same as it used to be and I would not recommend.
Great day out!,Great day to wander around with the family. Even won’t he Covid restrictions you still have plenty of reasons to stay awhile! And the price of the trinkets was acceptable.
A glimpse of history never hurt anyone,"If you have half a day this attraction is well worth a visit.  It's a very complete view of a slice of history that most people forget about. The reproductions are good, some of it is a little cheesy entertainment, but it's all good fun and a way to bring history to light and make it a bit fun.  Wander the streets, look in the old houses, get a glimpse of what it was like ""back then"".  Even though it's an extra charge, do take the gold mine tour.  It doesn't last very long, but if you get a good guide, you can get a feel of what it must have been like underground.  Very glad we found time to go."
Revisit of  the Gold Mining Attraction,"I visited this place in 2013 and again during my February 2020 Australian trip. Good and hokey as before but this time we went and took the optional mine tour. The tour was the highlight of the  visit since you can imagine what the miners had to do to get the gold. Also enjoyed the gold smelting show - $250,000 of gold melted down and made into a bar. Overall, the visit is well worth spending 3-4 hours."
nice day out,"Wow, and wow again.  This place simply blows you away with its realistic mock up of times gone by.  Costumed staff entertain  you as you wander along.  You can pan for gold in the stream.  Take a horse drawn carriage ride around the streets and visit gift shops to purchase souveniers.  The gold museum over the road wasn't too impressive, although it was very well presented.  For those catching the bus it stops outside the Sovreign hill side (facing uphill) and comes every half hour at 2 minutes past the hour and 32 minutes past the hour.  Its mostly on time and takes around 15 minutes to get to the centre of Ballarat.  A taxi from the train station to Ballarat costs $10 each way and takes around 5 minutes."
Day trip ,A must when you visit Ballarat go back in time period costume and trades of this era Coach restoration and wooden wheel making Leather sewing belts horse gear etc Tin foundry workshop a very rare find A working super long bowling Alley To why it’s all here The Gold Mine and a river to pan for Gold
BRILLIANT,A great family outing. There is so much for both adults and children to see and do. I have been many times but still have a lot of fun.
Highly recommend ,"Love this place, has been years since I was here, I think I was just 14 when I last visited.  Still an amazing place, especially loved the aura show at night. So much to see and do, definitely need to allow several hours to see it all if not all day."
Awesome place to understand the gold mining history,"We had a great experience at Sovereign Hill, which represented the early conditions of mining in Ballarat (which were horrific). We spent 2 full days exploring and visit all the different demonstrations and tours (please note that there are special events on certain weekdays, so please check the schedules). the display, demonstrations and workshops are very interesting and transport you back to the tough past our ancestors all endured/thrived. Highly recommended!If you want to take photos without any tourists, I highly recommend you to stay on the hotel on-site, as it allows you slightly earlier access in the mornings."
Sovereign hill,I was totally bored. Nothing exceptional.  Its a great place for kids though.  There is themuseum too. I thought the entry tickets overpriced.
A Good day out,Excellent day out with lots of activities for all ages. Make sure you wear your walking shoes as it is a big area to cover. Highlight for me was probably the gold pouring.
Great day out,"We had a great day at Sovereign hill ,some things are on the expansive side but if you pack a picnic there is a lovely grass section next to the kids area ,heaps to see that you dont pay any extra for and l think you can return the next day as well on the one ticket i"
Showing its age,First visit in three decades- not much has changed - yes it has expanded and the facilities are better but the buildings and signage is faded and shoe neglect.The interaction with visitors has improved and the interpretative come entrance is impressive but a bit more care in the presentation and maintenance may be an advantage
"Realistic and informative, an enjoyable visit","We couldn’t visit Ballarat and surrounding area without a close-up look at sovereign Hill in the makeshift town that’s been built in the gold rush theme.Initially the walk in price of just under $60 seemed quite expensive but once aware that basically gave you a two day pass it seemed reasonable enough,  although we really only plan to spend a couple of hours. Once in walking around the authentic Twp that so closely mirrors as it would have centuries ago including industry businesses that are working replicas. There are the reenactments, programmed constantly through the day showcasing the art of Cobb & Co coaches, wagon wheel making, steel forging, blacksmithing, gold production, gold panning and so much more. My wife and I ended up returning on the second day to complete the tour and underground Lazarus mine tour, we ran out of time to do on day one!"
Great day trip,Staying in Melbourne CBD we took the train to Ballarat and then the bus to Sovereign Hill.  Very easy.  Sovereign Hill was a great experience and the only downside the costs of all of the extras.  Worth a visit but budget wisely if you want to do everything. Some attractions are included in the entry price but surely one of the other priced events could be part of the entry price.
A blast to the past,This is a great outdoor museum set in the times of the Gold Rush some 170 years ago.  There are many activities to observe.  You need several hours.  One of the best was our visit to the underground mine.  A little frightening at times.  What a terrible working environment for the miners!
A great family experience.,"An experience of the senses,  unlocks the original history of Gold ,and tells the story of the Eureka Stockade story.Plenty to keep the kids and adults amused with lights ,sounds and action."
Very Good but a Wasted Opportunity,"The first part about the Big Bang in 3D is impressive, if a little science-y.The third part about Ballarat and the Eureka stockade is really cleverly put together, innovative and visually appealing.It's the middle section on Aboriginal mythology and the Bunjil creation story that I want to talk about. Please designers/creators and educational historians at Sovereign Hill TAKE NOTE! The average Australian knows quite a bit about The Dreaming already. Presenting a creation story as one third of your show: how exactly do you think this is advancing the Aboriginal cause and educating the Australian public and tourists? What a wasted opportunity! Aboriginal culture is the oldest surviving culture on the planet. Aborigines were skilled farmers, land managers, hunters, gatherers, warriors, painters, story tellers, musicians and performers. They have rich oral traditions, complex customs and laws. There is a wealth of knowledge to explore, not to mention the impacts of white settlement on indigenous people which are alluded to but not explored at all in your show. And you chose a single creation story?! The Christian equivalent is 'God created the earth and Adam and Eve' - people naturally baulk at whoop whoop magic people in the sky stories and switch off or think I already know about Aboriginal spiritual beliefs! The thing is, spirituality is just one facet and this was a perfect opportunity to go beyond the typical Dreaming story that most people already know and really showcase Aboriginal people and their rich history and culture so that people walk away with a greater understanding and hopefully challenging their dismissive attitudes such as 'they weren't using the land' and they weren't farmers' or 'their society was not developed.' Instead you wheeled out the same tropes and tired, narrow, 'seen 'em a hundred times' perspectives and your show does absolutely nothing to further understanding and help ordinary Australians see Aboriginal culture for the extraordinary complex wonder it is!"
Back to the future...,"Back to the future, want to get a taste of life around 1850’s, this is the place to go. Almost got goldfever myself, so was well worth the trip and the money"
"Great place to spend the day, esp. With kids!","Was a bit of a drive from where we were staying (edithvale, melbourne) but I think it was worth it. At first I thought it was a bit expensive but the lady at the counter thought our son was a toddler and didn't charge us for his entree and we didn't argue! We liked the gold panning! Found some gold flecks they throw in the water every day! And the little self guided tour down the mine is also quite exciting (esp. With a 5 year old tagging along) There is a small play area where kids can play which is also nice.Gold pouring; the guy told a nice story! Nice that there were people in character walking around! Didn't get to see and do all, but we came in late. Easily can spend a whole day there if you have kids. I think it was worth every penny and the ride!"
Just fantastic ,"We first went and watched the AURA light show the night before we went to Sovereign Hill and wow, what an experience - a great 3D film about the creation of the universe and gold, a stunning outside light show about the indigenous history of the area and finally an outside theatre show about the more recent history of the gold mine and Ballarat - well worth the money. The next day we went to Sovereign Hill proper and had a great day out - watched the gold pour, sweet making, paid a little extra to go down the gold mine, went gold panning and loads loads more. Only slight niggle was that we found the food choice somewhat limited, but what we did have was delicious. Ended the day with a quick walk around the Gold Museum, spent about 45 minutes there which was plenty of time. The standout though were the staff, an absolute credit to Sovereign Hill."
School visit,We had a wonderful time at this venue. Friendly staff assisted our Japanese students. Hope Bakery is a must for lunch. Gold panning was very enjoyable. The new playground for children near the cafe is wonderful and parents can sit on the cafe decking having a cuppa whilst the children play.
Fun day out,Great place to spend the day and get a feeling for how life was back in those times. Definitely takes you back and it’s great that there’s a variety of things to do and see here. Going down into the mines and learning the history to waking into some of the old factories still making things the way they used to. Kids and adults can enjoy panning for gold and if you figure out to do it you will end up with some specs of gold.Didn’t get a chance to see the night show but there is some entertainment during the daytime as well. Try to avoid windy days as there can be a lot of dust flying around.
Brilliant day!,"Had a great 1/2 day at Sovereign Hill. You would nearly need 2 days to see it all (especially as the ticket includes the Gold museum which we did not have time to go to at all). Luckily the ticket can be used for 2 days, so maybe plan on staying in Ballarat or surounding area? I would especially recommend the wheel making demonstration with the old machinery. It's fabulous! Also enjoyed the (free) mine tour (didn't do the other one, not enough time). The ticket IS expensive ($58), but well worth it if you had time to see and do all. I didn't, but still enjoyed what I did see and do. Great atmosphere, lots of interesting sights, exhibitions and shops.. Highly recommend!"
Excellent days outing but the site does need some work for mobility impaired / parents with prams visitors,"I took my young children here for a visit mid-week.  There were very few tourists on-site which made it easier to navigate through the site and allowed us to wander with a lot more comfort.We loved the fact that people dressed in period costume were walking through the streets (not just weekends) and engaging with tourists.My children loved the new playground behind the bakery area, which is a new addition since our earlier visit.Another new feature is that tickets are valid for two (consecutive) days, not just a single day.  This is good for people who want to stay overnight and come back to enjoy everything on offer.The only negatives that we found on this visit relate to the toilet facilities and parents rooms (needing access with prams).  In the main street, there was only one toilet that we could find.  This was not setup for people in wheelchairs or parents with small children.  Could there be a map provided for people who need to access disabled toilet facilities, highlighting where they can be found?   Also, there needs to be better signage (eg. outside the bakery), showing where the access ramps can be found for access (avoiding the steps to access the buildings).We will come back again and hopefully, further improvements will be made."
Just Great,"This has got to be the best gold mine to visit, amazing to see a whole township still alive and the ability to go underground into gold mine and learn all about the struggles the miners had."
Gold Rush Fever,Just as amazing as when my husband and myself visited 30 years ago. Fantastic atmosphere.  He loved that the bowling alley was still there.  It is a wonderful place for young and old. Plenty to see and do. Would highly recommend this and also the Gold Museum just opposite once you leave Sovereign Hill. Also the staff are very friendly and knowledgeable.
Back to the Gold Rush era,"A fantastic place to visit for adults & kids, great to step back in time and get a taste at what it was like in Victoria during the gold rush era. Definitely worth a visit plenty to see and do 👍🏻"
Very fun and interactive!,"So many things to see and do in Sovereign Hill. It's a place were you really see the 1850s come to life. There are actors in costumes that you can interact with. Plenty of shops to buy items made by blacksmiths, tinsmiths, candlemakers etc. Regular talks and demonstrations are given about these various things. One of my very favourite places in Victoria!"
Good day out but soured by price,"Excellent day out.  Have not been in many years.  Enjoyed all the old buildings and seeing how goods such as wheels, gold pans, sweets etc were made. The only reason this is getting a Poor rating is due to the price.  $58 for Adults to get in but what do you get for this?  A trip down the mine is another $7.50 per Adult, a ride in a coach another $5.50 per Adult and food,which although good, is over-priced - $13.50 for 2 scones and a cup of tea or $27 for fish and chips.  To encourage more locals to visit attractions they need to do something about the pricing.  At this rate it is only overseas tourist who will able to afford to visit.  Maybe we need a system like it is in America and Europe where there is one price for locals and another for overseas visitors - this would encourage more locals to support such attractions.Lovely day but I will not be going back in a hurry.  The Zoo, Healesville or Werribee Park are much better value for money."
Best of mafsydneytravels 2019: One of the top 5 attractions in Melbourne*,*2. Sovereign Hill (Ballarat) - Spend an exciting day in an outdoor museum depicting the gold rush era (1850’s) and be entertained by real life costumed characters.
MAGNIFICENT,"We went during school holidays and were surprised that we had no queues. I have been many times and take visiting family, and I enjoy myself every time."
An excellent day out.,"Great day out, lots to see and do, panning for gold, but without any luck. Great place for all the family, good value for money.the staff were excellent, very knowledgeable."
Excellent day ou,"We are active 70s and loved this experience. It successfully portrays the feeling of the gold rush days with all the refreshment stops well disguised. My husband went down the included Redhill Mine and loved the experience. We loved the gold pouring demonstration and the rifle shooting. We didn’t do the wagon ride but it looked great fun. The buildings and shops are really atmospheric and helped by all the folk in costume. The Gold Museum is included in the price so remember to leave time to go there (opposite the exit). This museum has an enormous number of gold exhibits and also videos showing the development of Ballarat. We stayed at the Mercure hotel which is very close to Sovereign Hill. Tickets cover 2 days, just wished we’d had enough time to return."
Highly recommend it!,"We came from Sydney to Melbourne for a week .Sovereign Hill entry ticket was our Christmas ticket for my daughter, i taught its gonna be a good idea spending a day in the past; we didn’t regret it at all.I highly recommend it for everyone who wants to step back in time even for a short term!Staff friendly and well orientated!Thanks for that great day!"
Interesting day out.,Interesting day full of information. The staff there are very knowledgeable Nd able to answer  any questions asked. Be prepared to walk up and down hills but worth the walking. You have the opportunity to explore over two days. Would reccomend the visit.
Family day out.,"Had a lovely day out with the family, haven’t been in years. We decided to take our two children along. I must say tho may not return again due to the price, even for concession was too high. Plus the things you pay for inside end up spending over $200"
Great historical experience,"This is a replica 1850s goldrush village complete with actors. It has everything that you can think of with a gold mining town and quite a bit of interactive activities, some at extra cost, which we didn’t do. I would recommend watching the sweet making, the gold pour and the free underground mine tour. We looked at everything in 4 hours. I wouldn’t want to be here  on a hot dusty day. Tip: if you want to do the sweet experience where you make your own sweets you would want to book in very early. If you have a family I would advise packing your own food and having a picnic by the lake and huge children’s play area."
Excellent value and fun day,"There is plenty to do and you need a whole day. Ticket enabled you to return the next  day which is good value and incldued the museum entry as well. It nis especially good for chidlren, The staff were friendly and helpful, the activities were enjoyable and plenty to see. A great experience even for an older couple with no children."
Good day,"Decided to take a day trip here while staying with friends. Had a fun day looking at history of the Gold mining times. Lots of interesting displays & people wandering around in olden day costumes. Not a cheap day out, though can fill in the whole day. Shops, machinery, shows lots to see & do."
AMAZING Gold Place,"My family and I went on a trip to sovereign hill and it was AMAZING. There’s so much too do there, you can buy gold go to a gold museum and even pan your OWN gold, it is sooo fun. I DEFINITELY recommend sovereign hill for people who just LOVE gold, like me."
Winter Wonderland!,"We attended our first ever Winter Wonderland at Sovereign Hill and what a remarkable experience it was! Sovereign Hill on its own is special but when coupled with the activities of Winter Wonderland it goes to another level. The light shows, the artificial ‘snow’, the theatre shows, the demonstrations and performances all combine to make for a most enjoyable time. We took advantage of the 2 days for the price of 1 and were entertained for the whole time. The weather was cold, icy cold, but this only heightened the experience. Loved it!"
Fun day out,We had not visited for 30 years. We enjoyed the day. The shows were good. The pantomime was fabulous. Not sure it was worth $58.Probably more like $38. There are extra activities but many are additional cost.
Fun for all ages,"Sovereign Hill provides a fun and educational experience of life during the gold rush period. There was plenty of demonstrations, tours and fun activities (some at extra cost) to keep adults and kids entertained for hours."
Great place to visit ,"Was surprised that I enjoyed this place so much. It was hot and dusty but very enjoyable. Highlights were the light and sound show, overall themed dress and manner of the people employed on site. The pre show dinner was also lovely. The policeman was very entertaining."
Good educational visit,A place to visit and find out about the gold mining history of Ballarat and surrounding district. You can spend hrs here then take a look in the museum.
A great family day out,"A family 2 adults and 3 children 2, 5 and 8 year olds had two fantastic and informative days for the price of one. There is plenty to see and do for all age groups."
A bit of a rip off,"Overpriced, no benefit whatsoever.Goldmine tour its a joke. No information, more like trivia day.Hardly any activity there."
Great family day out.,We recently stayed in Ballarat at the Big4 goldfield which is a 300m walk to sovereign hill. We spent 2 days at sovereign hill and all 4 of us (kids aged 9 & 11) had a ball.The kids did the sweets workshop where they got to make and bring home some boiled lollies and a fantastic tin.We did a mine tour which we all really enjoyed.Got to dress up in olden days costumes and get a photo taken as a memory of our time there.And a trip to sovereign hill isn’t complete until you pan for gold. We spent a few hours panning for gold which we all really enjoyed. Best part is you can take home the gold you find.I would recommend a trip to sovereign hill to anyone as there is so much to see and do there.
Great day out!,"Our family of five enjoyed our day at Sovereign Hill. The entry ticket is costly but we spent the entire day there enjoying activities such as panning for gold, the free mine tour and exploring the buildings. If you have kids, don’t forget to check out the massive playground by the cafe. Our kids loved it."
All worth it ... except the mine tour,"So much what is worthwhile about Sovereign Hill has been described by others and yes, this is a must for all to visualise what life would have been like. However, the mine tour, for an additional $7.50 was disappointing and a waste of 45 minutes (especially if you have been down mines before). We opted for the Secret Chamber tour - telling the ‘composite’ (not real but pieces together from other stories) of two Chinese brothers. The story is projected onto stones whilst you are in the mines. There was nothing wrong with the production but surely there could have been a real story? What also made the tour tedious was the tone and manner of guide - I am sure other groups would have had guides that were more knowledgeable, and lively - ours (may be in the spirit of acting) came across as a little condescending and humourless. A pity."
Loved it but a bit hot,Glad we could have the two day ticket. Quite hot but we got around everything. The water in the planning  area helped. So did the theatre. Loved going back in time.
Grandchildren loved the history...,"We traveled to Ballarat on a very hot day which did detract from our enjoyment. Our group consisted of 6 children, 3 adults and 2 seniors. As seniors we found getting around the park difficult due to steep inclines etc but everyone else thoroughly enjoyed themselves. I found everything very expensive- entry fees, additional tours, souvenirs and food. I would have appreciated more tables and seats in the picnic/playground as we only hound one table with seats. As tourists, you can’t always chose the weather on the day of your travel, but if you do have a choice, don’t visit in the heat."
Full of knowledge and fun,"Sovereign hill is built like the 1850s Australia with lots of activities and shows. My child got to make candles and lollies. The highlights were the gold pouring show, going down the mines in the trams (extra charge), plus another free tour going down another mine. The stories that happened here were amazing. It feels like you’re brought back a century! My dad loved the Gold panning. Also the show at the Victoria theatre - beauty and the beast was funny and awesome. The tickets are a bit expensive but you can come in for two days in a row. I definitely recommend this whether you’re Australian or a tourist."
Back in time,"Had a great few hours in the park, if wasn't for the weather to be so hot (no air-con) and dry (dust everywhere), we would be able to enjoy the place more. The ticket was very pricey, to make it worth the price, it would be recommended to stay somewhere nearby so you can enter again on the second day, but for us it was wasted. The map was not very helpful as it does not list all the events and show time in an orderly faction, you would have to visit each place your self to find out what is going on."
Authentic ( I suppose),"I think good value to see what it was back then, made like a real town very interesting to see how they got the gold and how they processed it only thing i disliked about the place was once your in some of the attractions charge again ,don't mind when you jack up the price of your food and drinks a few dollars not to mention all the trinkets you sell but like charging $7.50 or whatever to go down the mine really why not just put up admission price."
Amazing experience ,"We love this place and can go back again many more times, even after being here a few times already.The theme and whole display inside is just amazing and takes you back to the era of gold rush in Victoria. You can much better understand the history after being here. A full day is easy to spend here and there are many activities and show that run at regular intervals.Tip- - check out the activity time chart handed out at the entry and tick the activities you are most interested in as per times. Since few things are not repeated twice, make sure you are present at right time.- try amazing pies and pasties at the bakery- definitely do the mine tour inside (cost not jncluded in ticket)"
Outstanding,"Worth the money and great value now they have the fact that you can get 2 days for the price of 1.Everything here was excellent, from the shows on the Main Street to the mine tours and the gold pour.Kids loved it and I did it when I was about 7 or 8 and did bring back the memories of my childhood.Only downside was the meet the animals time at 12:30 either never happened or was a meet them and self guided tour?So a bit confusing."
Better than I remembered it,"It’s been about twelve years since I last visited Sovereign Hill, so I was keen to take my kids who have arrived in the interim. The highlight of my trip last time was the Blood on the Southern Cross show. This time, with 6 kids, we couldn’t afford the sound and light show, but they’ve had an amazing time panning, having lunch in the themed New York bakery, in the spacious playground, and visiting the buildings. The junior redcoat program was a hit and included in the entry fee. There are plenty of opportunities to spend on extras, but we did not and I thought there was plenty of value for money for a large family. The pantomime was amazing, and also included value of our entry ticket as there was no extra cost.Loved being able to have wine while the kids played on the playground :) Love the city of Ballarat so much that we are considering moving interstate to live here, in which case we’d be frequent visitors. Thanks,Soverign Hill."
58.50 entrance is a bit too pricey,Went here with my parents and sister. The entrance ticket was 58.50 for general entry which includes the red hill mine self guided tour. The place was quite big and feels like you have gone back in time but definitely think its not worth the price.
Christmas In July.,"Beautiful well decorated Fun, and feels special.There is so much to see and do, but you have to be patient on places to enter because there are big cues, but worth the wait, specially the Lolly shop or the Gift shop.You must wer comfortable shoes a lot of walking."
Loved it,"What a great place to spend the day and step back in time. Really enjoyed walking through the streets and looking in the old shops, plenty off things to buy. Watched lollies getting made and just had to go and buy some."
Night tour.,"It was very Interesting, and the place has such a different feel at night. It is organised very well and fun. Must have comfy shoes and warm clothing."
Expensive- but a great day for the family.,"We visited with our 9 year old and 7 year old.  They loved every second of the visit, and we were here for about 6 hours.Heaps of content which is not additional cost to keep you entertained and a great way to see what life would have been like nearly two centuries ago.Food was grossly overpriced and awful. $11.20 for a “hot dog” (cold) and cold chips is a complete rip off.  And a lot of the merchandise is quite pricey. We also did the photo room which was $79 for the sitting and one photo. Despite the cost it is still an excellent experience and one the kids will be talking about for years to come. Highlight for them was finding real gold and bringing it home in a bottle."
Lots of history.,"A great place to step back in time. Very courteous staff, everyone is friendly.Lots a information or as little as you would like to know. Heaps of car parking.A little expensive for admission but you could spend hours here."
WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE ,"All we wanted to do in Ballarat was to do a mine tour. We weren't expecting having to go into Sovereign Hill, entry over $50 plus another $7.50 for the mine tour. We entered not knowing what to expect but what a wonderful surprise,  stepping back into a town in the late 1800s, everyone in costume of the day. The Cobb and Co coach, another extra cost was a sight to see, as were all the shops and businesses of the day. Yes we did the mine tour eventually, very tourist orientated but enjoyable.  Tried our hand at bowling, watched gold smelting.  Only spent 3 hours there but could have spent the entire day."
Great day out,You need a full day to get the most out of Sovereign Hill. It is great for all ages. From panning for gold to watching the Red Guards acting.
Worthy of a visit,"Great time to be had, varied interests to please all, from old to young ones, could not get thru it all in one day"
A must go,"Relive the times of gold mining days in a city where you see horse carriages running, beautiful ladies donning traditional wear, city with water pump up the well, traditional shops where kids might enjoy. I particularly enjoyed the gold pourer demonstration where the pourer melted gold, poured them to form a gold bar in minutes. It was also a nice tram ride underground to see the conditions gold miners underwent, interesting to see how dangerous explosive activities are for miners too. The gold panning was interesting though we didn’t find any. Seeing how it was done was fun esp for the younger kids and adults. The food in the restaurant was also good, with tasty fish and chips done to perfection. A must go for tourists. :) a very different experience we should go for."
Fourth Visit and still love it,"I have visited sovereign Hill many times now; as a kid with my family, with school in year 5, with my husband and this time with my husband, 2 kids, Mum, hubby’s parents and nieces. Just love this place, I love the history the atmosphere and the many sites to explore."
Fantastic day out for all..,"This is the second time I have been to sovereign hill, I enjoyed it every bit as much as the first time. We took two of our teenage boys with us this time, they thoroughly enjoyed it too.  I love that there is so much to see and do and it's not all touristy and doesn't cost a fortune. All of the wares you can buy from there which are made by the craftsmen are so well priced unlike a lot of other tourist attractions."
Awesome infotainment ,"How did they live, the gold diggers, blacksmith, merchants, teachers, policemen, wheel makers, etc.? Staged in a most authentic way with all these people in their dresses strolling along the main street, obviously loving what they are doing! Great effort by all “actors”, the attention to details in the houses/gardens and stores is second to none. Absolutely worth a visit!"
A Wild West Experience,"If you are interested in stepping back into the Victorian 1850s, then you will enjoy this place.  It is set up like a western town with lots of infoemative exhibits. A highlight is testing out your gold mining skills. Give yourself a day's worth of time to visit this place."
Not cheap but worth a visit,A living Museum portraying the days of the gol rush. Interesting and informative with plenty to amuse young and old.Worth combining with the evening sound and light show.
Tasteful historic village,"Entertaining and educational.  Our second visit.  On this occasion we revisited the stores, camp, mine, etc. Lots to learn and experience. We were there for much of the day (and you get free admission on a consecutive day if needed). We also ate at the New York eatery.  Food was good, combined with historic ambience. We visit during the week, outside of school holidays to avoid the crowds but it is designed to cope with the masses. We also enjoyed the company of one of the ‘volunteers’ “CJ”, who added a personal and delightful dimension to our experience (see photo)."
A Step Back in History!,"Great place for family, kids, couples. Takes you through the history of the gold mining era by way of a historical authentic 1800's mining village. Shops typical of that era with shop assistants & all workers onsite dressed in clothing typical of that time. An excellent way to teach the kids of Australian history. We also did an evening sound & light show which was excellent & well worth paying the extra in costs.All round, a great day out."
Great day out,The mining tour was the highlight of our trip.Entered 90 sec deep underground without light. So not for the faint hearted.But it was the best activity for me as it is so informative and well structured. The whole place is good for learning how mining was in the olden days.Do visit if you have some time when in Melbourne.Bus 21 from train station comes every half hour
My favorite activity during my Melbourne trip,"Sovereign Hill is a beautiful reconstruction of history, and if you're a history fan this place is very rewarding. It's a reconstruction of not just life during the era, but many other facilities such as shops, butcher, candymaking, candles, printing press as well as mining and melting gold. There were people dressed as British soldiers with their marching band on horses periodically. There was also reconstruction on homes of individuals, postmasters. One section which I found very interesting was on the lives of Chinese miners- acknowledging second-class treatment to them, showing videos from their perspective against Chinese tax. Make sure to do the underground mining experience. While walking, holographic images come to life and discuss the pains of mining and forms a story of discovering gold which feels very real. Also do attend the session where they melt gold, and show how it reacts in the furnace at really high temperatures. At the end of the trip, you can also take a trip to the museum which is included in the ticket. It has interesting historical records as well as artifacts such as gold from Gold Rush era.The ticket is on the pricey side at 57 AUD and it is 1.5 hours drive from Melbourne, but at the end I found it an exceptional experience."
Great Visit to Gold Rush Victorian Settlement,"Went to Sovereign Hill today.  A great experience with a bit of everything.  A bit on the pricey side, but if it pays in the upkeep and payment of staff, then we’ll worth it. Note; tickets are valid for a couple of days."
What an experience,"What a wonderful asset for this area.  We spent 6 hours wandering, watching, eating and learning.  So, so worth the effort.The entry fee was expensive and we nearly didn't go in but we're so glad we did.A FABULOUS day"
Had a good day,"Nice and peaceful, my 2 year old daughter loved the little animals there. The whole atmosphere there was really good, we felt like we’re in the movie scene."
Allow at least a day,"Turned up & laughed when they said our ticket allowed access for the next day too, I thought we would be there two hours maximum...how wrong I was. Lots of things to see & do, the staff were fantastic, all in period costume and in character, spent  at least 30 mins chatting to a guy about life in the goldfields, underground tours, wheelwright demo, panning for gold, gold purification & pouring demo just to name a few things. A definite must to visit if in the area"
Sovereign Hill a great day out,"We didn’t use a pre booked tour following some previous reviews which said it was a long drive and you didn’t get long enough at the museumInstead we bought 2 MYKI travel cards for $75 and travelled via train direct from Southern Cross station in the centre of Melbourne through to Ballarat and then a short bus trip on public transport which drops you off at the door, while trip took approx 1 hr 20 minsEntry was $58 per adult which seemed a bit high but gives you access to both Sovereign Hill and the Gold Museum opposite I was very impressed with the scale of the Sovereign Hill site, its range of exhibits and the interaction between the staff who are dressed in period clothing and the visitors. We spent approx 5 hrs at Sovereign Hill and really enjoyed it, we visited the Gold Museum afterwards but didn’t think that much of the Gold Museum"
xmas in July,beautiful and magic place to share with family and friends the food was great and the atmosphere exceptional. we love this experiences .
Excellent experience of a gold mining towl for young and old - very interesting,"Fortunately we arrived early in Ballarat, so we could spend the entire afternoon at Sovereign Hill. They have done a lot to make this a re-living of the early mining experience, with several actors in the streets in 19th century clothes, including a re-enactment of the English Red Coat soldiers and firing of muskets.Lots of old-time shops, live musicians, a bank, a blacksmith, and nice working big steam engines.Make sure you do one of the gold mine tours - worth the extra money.The most spectacular experience for us was the gold pouring, where a smelter showed the audience how a gold bar was made.Very nice snacks at the Hope Bakery.The Chinese camp showed well how the Chinese workers were treated (badly) and discriminated.All in all, time well spent."
A wonderful day out,Traveling from the UK to witness and experiance Sovereign Hill was a real pleasure. This was not our first port of call but it should have been because the history and struggles of the old pioneers is such an eye opener. The sights and smells are all here to savour but what is the most rememberable is the staff and volenteers who make this place a visit well worth the trip.
Aura night show Sovereign Hill,This was certainly worthwhile.  They opened the show especially as lots of people rang to go and see it.
"Great Day Out, very pricey for 4 Adults $230 plus","Had a good look around, went on mine ride trapped, you have to pay extra $7.50 per adult for the entrance fee should be included, food lovely bit pricey. Need more attractions for the price tag and drop the internal prices for the other things.Dress up in period costume and get photo taken great not a bad price either, They do bring Asian buses through, they are very rude and push and shove to get to the front of everything, sorry never again."
Great day out,"Although a little pricey, it is a good day out. Plenty of things to do and see with a lot of attractions being interactive. Enjoyable day"
this place so cool!,Sovereign Hill is a thematic museum and tourist attraction that is sooo cool and beautiful. you must go there!
"Fantastic atmosphere, not great for more than one visit",A wonderful place to immerse yourself in the culture and life of the period. A great learning experience with some magnificent actors and costumes. I wouldn't go more than once in a short amount of time but it is a very very cool place.
A great day out,"Really had an enjoyable day at sovereign hill. Very interesting place to visit with lots to see and do. Probably need a good 3 hours to take it all in, but you could easily spend longer. The gold pour attraction is a must see and the carriage ride is fun. The food in the restaurant is great and reasonable value. Entry is expensive, but you get a lot in return. You also entry to the gold mining museum across the road included in your ticket and this is also enjoyable. If you come by train as we did you can get a free bus once a day straight outside the station, but there is only one chance at around 11am so try and arrive for this. There are other buses (paid for) which also drop you outside."
Good but pricey ,"We went there at 10am and really enjoyed the atmosphere, not much was happening at this time on the day though. We couldn’t visit the gold mine cause of groups bookings at the time we wanted, we had to come back later on which was pretty annoying when you pay that much money ($120 for 2). It doesn’t worth the price. Maybe for someone passionate about this part of the Australian history ..."
Fun and enjoyable,"Went with family for the AURA show as well as the dinner. It was really fun having dinner inside one of the old buildings, and the food was actually really good, especially the slow cooked lamb. The show was ok, certainly great if you've never seen such a thing before. Certainly this is a class of technically sophisticated show you rarely find in Australia."
Such a wide range of things to see and do.,"We entered at 10am and left at 3pm and were thoroughly entertained the whole time. Try to work it to see the different scheduled activities. Musket firing, marching red coat troopers, candle making, Lillie making, wagon wheel making and the list goes on. A most enjoyable day."
Too expensive ,Visited with hubby and adult Son.  Interesting but hard to justify price even with 2 concessions entries and I certainly did not see how there was sufficient to bring us back for a second day as price tried to justify.  Staff in shops in period dress but only a few walking up and down the street in period dress.  Some shops not open.  Other than the gold panning and horse buggy ride I think children would be quickly bored.  There is a playground near a cafe but it would make a very expensive playground outing.  Wasn’t crowded and overall if the price was less expensive for a 1 day entry then I’d have given it more stars.
Excellent Day Out,"We spent half a day here learning about life in the goldfields in the 1850s. We paid extra and did 2 mine adventures, the 'Journey through the Labyrinth of Gold' and 'Trapped' both of these tours take you under ground but are two very different tours and well worth doing. Half a day isn't really long enough to experience all that Sovereign Hill has to offer so would recommend arriving early in the morning as there are so many activities to do and demonstrations to watch."
Fascinating historical insight into the area,"We had an enjoyable day here with lots of information to be learnt through tours and experiences such as going down into a mine, panning for gold, watching the wheelwright in action, watching gold being poured, learning about candle making, watching school in action. My teen daughters particularly enjoyed the boiled sweet making process where you are offered a sample at the end. (We were excited to find out later that day that one of my oldest friends, a local resident of Ballarat, is a direct descendant of the Brown family who developed the business!)The entrance price for a family is reasonable for a day of experiences. (There are other things that you can pay for once you have entered). Try to get there as close to opening time as possible so you can take full advantage of the scheduled events. We kept an eye on the time and managed to get to most of the things that we hoped to see. There are places to buy lunch or you can take your own. We sat on one of the benches undercover in the main street to eat our own picnic. Take a raincoat if the weather looks dicey as you are outside for a lot of the time. We popped into the gold museum across the road (included in the entrance fee) at the end of the day, but we were quite exhausted by then and didn't get the most out of this part of the experience. This aspect is also less interesting for kids, although they had provided fun things to play with such as an old fashioned puppet theatre with puppets. Expensive entry, but you will certainly have a memorable day out. Easy (free) parking."
Fantastic!,"I can’t give enough praise, this was an excellent day and money well spent. So much to see and do, with a perfect mix of education, history and entertainment. A perfect day family day out. The design is great but what truly made this such a memorable day out was the staff, so friendly and so obviously committed to the job. I can’t speak highly enough, without doubt at least a day at Sovereign Hill is a must."
Well worth a visit ,"We'd been to the replica village at Swan Hill and a couple of others so hadn't bothered to check out Sovereign Hill on previous visits to Ballarat partly due to cost. Even with a concession discount, entry is still not cheap, but it does include access to the Gold Museum over the road which was worth a look.Certainly an impressive set up. Buildings authentic but in great condition.  Plenty of working displays and we even scored a tasty and good value lunch in the New York Bakery. Hard to fault really. Recommended!"
Amazing Authentic Village but..,"8 tourists visited one day and we loved it. All the staff make the venue even more interesting and authentic. Two comments, I was disappointed to see a Cafe in the middle of the township. Couldn't this cafe have been built with an old facade in front of a modern cafe and be called Tea Rooms or Refreshments so it was more historically correct? Also in my opinion you need to improve your options for mobility impaired visitors."
Aura - Light and Sound,"Having experienced Blood on the Southern Cross light and sound show previously, I was excited to see its replacement, Aura. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. It starts with a video overview of the big bang, how earth was formed and how gold was formed. It then tells the Aboriginal dreaming story of the traditional people of Ballaratt about how the universe and earth began. This is followed by an abbreviated version of the Eureka Stockade. I did think some 3d video would be a great to enhance the telling of the story. Not worth the money in my mind"
"Quirky, Friendly, Interesting!","We purchased general tickets for Sovereign Hill and the evening Aurora show. Both excellent!You can easily spend the entire day here, panning for gold, taking a trip down the gold mine (costs extra), having cakes & coffee and lunch, and visiting the many shops on site.It’s really well laid out with much to see and learn about the history of the mines. We found the Chinese Quarter of particular interest. The staff are super friendly. Just wished we could have spent more time visiting Ballarat!"
Expensive but worth it!,"My husband & I visited this open-air museum in Ballarat. Parking is free. Entry was expensive at $58.20 but we got our money's worth. We spent hours walking around. We saw candle makers, a saddler polishing a fine horse saddle, a foundry worker using a lathe, a wheelwright making spokes for a coach wheel, a tinsmith making candleholders (we bought one), a blacksmith making horseshoes (for a small price he'll make a unique one with your name), a printer, and so much more.There are coach rides, which seemed to be popular, but we didn't go on one. The marching soldiers were entertaining & looked the part in their red & black uniforms (their guns were deafening). It was a fascinating day!For late lunch we had Devonshire Tea at Sovereign Hill Café - one of 7 or so eateries. It was busy, but food was great & staff were lovely. We continued on & looked at some of the 'old' shops & buildings. I had to drag my husband out of the confectionary factory & he had trouble getting me out of the jewellery shop! We spent time in the fantastic gift shop & bought souvenirs to take home. We highly recommend this place especially if you're into gold mining or Ballarat history. Kids will love it!"
Takes you back in time,"A repeat visit after a number of years. Lots of kids in attendance. It would certainly remind them how far we have come since the days of the gold rush, but I don’t think they would see how harsh it would have been to live in. Love the staff walking around in costume. Good to see some of the old crafts in action."
Interesting but expensive ,Interesting place to visit but for the price you don’t get anything other than entry. Once In there you pay to do anything other than panning for gold. I have heard from someone else that the night tours are great.
Great day out,"We initially thought this was a family experience and certainly there was lots for the kids, but as 2 adults we thought it was a very interesting and well presented day out.  Quite pricey, but we were there from 10am to 5pm!"
Amazing must do,Wow- worth every cent. You can easily spend a day here. Like going back in time!! Food and drink at reasonable prices and lots of interactive experiences. Thoroughly recommend.
Outstanding ,Outstanding place. So well set up and the staff are amazing. They are clearly passionate about history and their job. Excellent value for money and my kids walked away with so much knowledge. Well done Sovereign Hill.
Great for all ages; fun and interesting,"My husband and I (in our late 20s) came here with my in-laws (50s) and we all had a fantastic day. I am not generally a museum person but this place was so great. We spent about 5hrs at Sovereign Hill. The highlight was definitely the underground mine tour. It cost a little bit extra on top of the general entry ticket, but was well worth it in my opinion. We also enjoyed the gold panning. I recommend finding a staff member who can teach you the proper technique, as after we got some tips we were able to find lots of gold pieces. The gold pouring is also worth a look. The staff were so amazing and consistently in character that it really feels like you’ve been transported back to the 1950s.There are a few options for food onsite, including some traditional pubs (meals around $30, cakes and drinks too) and a bakery (both sweet and savoury items for under $10). There’s a modern cafe off the Main Street to the right hand side, which serves more “fresh” things like sandwiches and salad wraps for around $10-15 but the coffee is awful."
Comprehensive heritage display in family friendly interactive format,"A visit to Sovereign Hill is a great fun day out in a well run heritage park. From the ticket booth to the park grounds keeper, the ethos is to keep the visitor engaged and transported to an experience of the past Ballarat. In a safe environment for children, incorporating many hands-on activities such as gold panning, this park is well worth the entrance fee providing a time transporting experience that takes at least a full day to explore. Of particular note is the inclusion of the multicultural basis upon which Australia is built, including the dedicated Chinese section."
Even better than I remembered,"I came here in middle school and was looking forward to sharing the experience with my three boys. We had so much fun!!!Thanks so much to all of the fabulous staff (particularly those playing multiple roles who played along with good humour when my boys recognised them from a previous “scene”). A brilliant day out, we only wish we had more time so we could do it all again tomorrow!! Thankyou :)"
Great way to spend  day,"Took the family here, it was a great way to spend the day, very historic and authentic. Both my boys loved panning for gold. Highly recommended."
Reenactment of the gold rush,"One of the best historical places that I have ever been to. Everything is totally authentic and the staff act as if they are living in the gold rush time. A great place for all ages. Everyone one lives the gold panning - and we got quite a few specks of gold. The gold mine tour is fantastic. The horse-drawn carriage ride is very exciting, especially for children. This is a must-see attraction"
Lovely place ,A beatiful place with friendly people. Feel relaxing and travel back to old times. We had a wonderful time there strolling at the main street.
Great family holiday experience.,"Unfortunately it was pouring rain when we visited Sovereign Hill, however we still enjoyed the experience.  Was a good educational experience for all in our family, the underground mine tours are worthwhile paying for.  We also managed to find a small amount of gold when panning in the river."
A day at Sovereign Hill,A very interesting day tour at the Sovereign Hill. It is a very educational place for the young kids to explore and learn about the history of Victoria.
Christmas in July was a hit,"Although extremely cold we enjoyed our day at Sovereign Hill for Christmas in July. We had wanted to do this for a number of years but just couldn’t fit it in. This year we made sure that we would take the children to experience this beautiful wonderland. We arrived around 2pm, which was perfect as it wasn’t too busy. It did start to pick up as the darkness set in. The food kiosks and food hall had a great choice but by 6-7pm the queues were enormous. We had organised to eat something around 5-5.30pm so we beat the rush. We especially loved the ginger bread and white hot chocolate with raspberry drops. The light shows and faux snow was a winder as was the walk through the light garden.As it got later it got colder, so it is recommended that you take warm and waterproof jackets, hats, boots, gloves etc. I highly recommend for families."
Can easy spend a day here.  ,Our visit to sovereign hill was a good idea. We spent almost a whole day here. There are other things that are add ons like dressing up in costume and having your photo taken - we didn’t - but it would be $79 for a family. There were street theatre acts and different things on at different times. At this mining village the kids most enjoyable part of the day was panning for gold. There were rides around the gold mine on n a horse and cart. The line was very long so you need to wait a while for your chance. We had a takeaway coffee from “ the transit office”. Not the best coffee sadly. My soy milk had split and  over heated and curdled in the cup. When I took the lid off to see why it tasted weird there was half a cup of curdled milk. We had our lunch at the cafe. Lots of choices there and children’s playground. Your entry ticket also lets you into the gold museum.
Interacting with our past.,"We were there for 5 hours and wasn't able to cover all the attractions. Easy to get around, clean and great atmosphere. Staff in were in costume and character and interacted with the visitors."
Good old fashioned fun,"This is our second time visiting with kids and the first time now that they are a bit older. We all enjoyed the mine tours (extra cost) and we also booked in for making the boiled lollies (also extra $20 per person) but that was a highlight for us and the kids got a commemorative tin full of their own boiled lollies that they made. We spent two and a half days here and found plenty to do. Dig deep to find gold, that kept the teenagers occupied for a while. We like the Cornish pasties at the Hope bakery which are half savoury and half apple pie. The gold pour was cool to watch too."
Olde style fun. ,"Top marks for this fun but educational facility in Ballarat. With continuous activities hosted by people in period costume. With a musket demo, gold ingot demo and an olde school school room as part of what is on offer this nugget of family fun is well worth the visit."
Good day out for all ages,"A full day of fun for all the family. School holidays meant it was busy but there was plenty of room to move around. This was our second visit, however we did feel that this time there seemed to be lacking a bit of the ""street theatre"" that we experienced last time. Still  very enjoyable  and being a cold and damp day, the many fire pits in main street were very welcome."
Top attraction with plenty to do,Thoroughly enjoyable family day out with lots of different activities and opportunities to learn about the golden era. Highly recommend booking a mine tour.We chose the Secret Chamber tourwhich we all thoroughly enjoyed. The kids were eager to learn from the knowledgeable guides.
Amazing holiday choice,"Kids and adults all loved this place. Lots to see and experience. Mine tours and gold panning a must see and do. Too much to see in one day but all good fun. Would recommend 2 days, and stay on site at the hotel"
Fantastic ,"Great day out. Wish we had 2 days here to see and do everything as we didn’t even get time to see the museum.Took public transport from Melbourne city (cheapest option as a tourist)Took the Vline train: Southern Cross Station to Ballarat stationThen onto the public bus #21 from Ballarat station, which drops you outside Sovereign Hill attraction entrance in just 10minutes.Book early at sovereign hill for all extra activities The bakery at the entrance is the cheapest deal for food.$13.50 deal for pie, cake and cold drink ‘Actors’ walking around and in shops were good (dressed in traditional clothing)Only suggestion would be for them to be more interactive and be ‘in character’ more"
Nota must see,Great educational tool to showcase the history of gold in Ballarat I believe it is definitely directed at children to highlight the history but not a must see for adults
Great Day Out,"Perfect weather for our visit. There is lots to see and do. Extra activities/ experiences for kids are reasonable prices. Friendly staff, who are helpful and very informative about Sovereign Hill and the history of the area."
Great educational day out ,"We visited over the Winter Wonderland festivities and had an amazing time! Unfortunately we were unable to stay at the sovereign hill hotel this time as there was no availability left for larger families (We are 2 adults and 4 kids). We thoroughly enjoyed the extra activities on offer during winter wonderland, especially the lights at night time!  We booked a table for 12 for the special dinner the night we were there also which was absolutely delicious, all 8 kids that were in our group loved the meals. Thanks for a great weekend away"
Worth a visit!,"It does give you a good feeling of going back to the past.The buildings are as original as they can be.Try to attend as many of the performances and tours as possible. These will give you lots of information.End the day with a nice tour of the Gold Museum, which is just next door.Great and relaxing place to spend the day!"
Step back in time,"This is a town renactment of Australia's gold rush in the 1850's. You can nearly spend a whole day here seeing all the sights the old buildings, the mines and do a little panning for gold yourself. Everyone you meet will be dressed in colonial attire. I recommend the mine tour and the bowling alley and the lolly shop."
Wonderful day out,A truely amazing place that caters for all ages. You can easily spend the whole day here. The food prices are very reasonably priced or you can take your own and eat on the many tables or grassy areas.
back to old century,It is an interesting place to visit particularly to know and learn how's life back during the gold mining rush in Australia. The people wear the same clothes during the old ages in Australia. They are very nice and friendly. The park is so huge which needs more than one day to see and feel the experiences there. The ticket is worth for two day tour which is good
Sovereign Hill Tour,"I took this particular tour with the Wildlife tour option. I was dropped off at a nearby Wildlife park in Ballarat. Kangaroos roam the premises and you can pet and feed with food specific  and bought from gift shop.  There was about 45-55 minutes tour with a ranger and she talked about their resident animals. There was one young kangaroo named Squeezy, she is so friendly and curious, she jumps inside the gift  shop right before the door closes. There were cute koalas and babies, beautiful dingos, curious tasmanian devils,  meerkats, red kangaroos. I even petted a sweet hungry wombat , Georgie.  The Sovereign Hill is part  of the gold rush town in Ballarat. It stayed as is, just a living museum of the mining town where you find foundry ships, blacksmiths and lumberyards with actual people in complete costume regalia. The clothes and fabric shops were open, touring school children were dressed in authentic costumes, ""walked in town streets  and  attend actual classes.""I particularly loved the Hope Bakery where they served hot very tasty chicken pies and others and delicious pastries. There were also opened houses you can go in and see the small, wellkept bedrooms, kitchens, and open spaces with backyard animals and gardens. I really appreciate how  families lived during the gold rush in Ballarat. Just outside the ""town"", there is the Gold museum   You can also tour and learn more about finding gold in Ballarat.This was again a pleasurable  learning trip in Ballarat, Victoria state, Australia."
Lots To Like,"I was told by locals that a trip to Sovereign Hill was a good idea.  I decided I'd take them up on their advice and take a break from finding my own gold nuggets.  It was fantastic.  All of the guides and personnel are in period costumes and play their 'parts' as if they were really in the time.  They had teachers, school kids, stage coaches, mine owners, panning is available and lots of other mining information."
Great place to visit and learn some history,"Great place to visit, you really need two days if you want to see and do everything. If you only have 1 book yourself a Mine tour underground, it was $7.50pp and it was amazing!!"
Amazing,"We saw the show with our three kids aged 14, 13 and 11. They all enjoyed the show and getting some facts in a entertaining way. Strongly recommended."
"A must see attraction for all, the story lives on in Sovereign Hill","Our visit to this so amazing outdoor museum was the number one highlight when visiting Victoria. We thought the entry price was steep, however at the end of the tour we agreed the price, was well worth it.  You get two days entry on the one ticket however we were in Ballarat just for the one day only so the two day ticket was of no use to us.  As soon as we stepped on the main street we were transported back to how life was like in a gold mining town in the 1850s. Loved everything, how the staff were dressed in authentic clothing,  the working shops, the demonstrations, the gold pour, the Red Coats marching and firing, the panning for gold, the coach driven by Clydesdale horses and the Gold Museum across the road.  Loved every minute of it and we left with lots of well priced souvenirs to remember our amazing visit."
Absolutely fantastic,"Today we were at this amazing recreation of the 1850s gold mining town of Ballarat, Victoria.We loved every minute of our stay. We will be back again tomorrow as you get 2 days for the price of one.We could not find any faults during  our stay and was so great to get the feel of how it was like on the goldfields of Ballarat in the 1850s."
Much more than we expected,We went to Sovereign Hill thinking that we would be in and out pretty quickly.  We were wrong.  We could have easily spent the whole day and probably come back the next day.  There are lots of tours and displays to see and experience.  Well worth the visit.  Just be aware for anyone that has problems with walking....there are a few hills and inclines/declines to tackle.
One off my bucket list. ,"A boyhood dream was to go here one day, well today was that day. Sovereign Hill did not disappoint. The exhibits were fantastic and the staff were exceptional. The gentleman in the gold pour exhibit was fantastic funny and informative. Highly recommend paying for the gold tour mine. We did 2 of them. Red Hill mine was also fantastic. So much to see and do. Don’t forget the gold museum across the road. The kids will Love it."
Good history experience,"Visiting Sovereign Hill is a good way to spend the day.  A lot of effort was made to make this an authentic experience for visitors.  The gold panning is a hit for visitors of all ages.  Love the various shops and demonstrations.  We particularly liked the pies and sausage roll at the Hope Bakery, all baked in a wood fire over.  So good! Highly recommend the beef pie.  Would come again, if I had the chance."
"Money, money, money","Firstly I am aware that this is run as a non-profit making venture. However I did feel that it was quite expensive. You have no option other than to buy a ticket that allows you to visit for two days, even if you know for sure that you are only going to be in the area, and able to use the admission ticket for half a day. What pushes the price up even more than that are the additional charges for taking part in some of the activities - the gold mine visit, the carriage ride, helping to make the candles or sweets. I am not sure how families will find this affordable. I visited on my own and did not take part in any of the extra activities. Having said that, it was an enjoyable way to spend an afternoon. There are several interesting buildings to explore. Unfortunately the only afternoon I was in Ballarat was also quite cold and wet, so it wasn’t possible to walk through all the areas I wanted to walk through. And there were several large groups of school children who were running in and out of the buildings without any apparent supervision from teachers."
So much fun even without any kids,"My partner and I got to relive our childhood visiting sovereign hill recently. Loved seeing the old buildings and stores but my favourite was still the gold panning. Make sure ask one of the staff to show you what to do. Once we knew, we got so addicted to it and all the tiny specks of gold we were finding that we ended up running out of time and coming back the second day. The second day is free with your ticket thankfully although really didn't expect we would need it. Make sure you catch the gold pouring demonstration and the candy making demonstration (you get to taste raspberry drops while still warm - amazing!). Also liked the mine tour and making a wish at the chinese temple. If you are a big kid at heart, I highly recommend it!"
Kids loved Christmas Wonderland,"We went for Christmas in July  particularly light show. The whole place was transformed into the Christmas theme. Shop windows, decorations, certain times of day with the bubbles that represent snow falling from building roofs. Hot festive drinks and food.Best of all when a normal entry ticket was purchased we were able to enter all weekend."
"Great immersive experience, lacking some explanations","Even on a cold winter's day, we had an enjoyable time at Sovereign Hill.There are fascinating and well explained demonstrations throughout the day at the different businesses in the town (we especially enjoyed the blacksmith and the boiled lolly making), however outside of these specific presentations, I felt explanations were lacking a bit elsewhere.Furthermore we did one of the underground tours and felt like we only had half a tour, the little mine train we took at the end passed in front of many things that merited an explanation.The choice of food in the musuem is a bit ordinary so don't hesitate to bring your own lunch.We saw a lot of bored and unhappy young children throughout the day, and the museum probably isn't appropriate for them."
Superb.,"An absolutely fantastic day out. At first we were hesitant about the entry price, but after spending the day there it was definitely money well spent. If you're tossing up the idea of a trip to Ballarat plus the cost of entry - just do it! The amount of effort the owners and staff have undertaken to make this place so authentic is just unbelievable. The guided mine tour was the highlight and an absolute must. We spent about 6 hours here and still needed a bit more time."
Day great; night show awful,"Sovereign Hill during the day has the right combination of education and fun added to that the great candy store and I am happy. Wish we hadn’t wasted our time with the new night show; it has a confusing plot, you spend more time being moved to locations than being entertained and the traditional focus on the birth of democracy through the stockade uprising is lost in amongst effect and who knows what!Unless you want a science lesson meets indigenous history class meets gold lesson all in 1.5hours save your time and cash!!"
Well Worth A Visit.,"We had a very enjoyable visit there over two days, a fantastic place with so much to see and do, I loved being able to pan for gold! The staff were friendly and helpful and obviously love their jobs. I hope to go there again one day."
Amazing,This place is timeless you just enjoy the moment watching and participating in this place. Young and old will create great memories
Very disappointing,We had very high expectations for this new sound and light show having seen the previous Blood on theSouthern Cross. The 3D film at the start of the experience was very well produced. The second part told the indigenous story. Sadly this was not linked with either the 3D film or the third part of the story. The final part telling of the formation of the gold panning camps and the Eureka stockade was very drawn out. It could have been condensed and been more punchy in its presentation. There was an attempt to show how Ballarat has evolved however it lacked the detail of what happened in the twentieth century. For the cost it was very disappointing.
Winter Wonderlights a must see,"Purchased a 2 day ticket attended the Wonder Lights at night ( this event is only held during June and July) Colourful, entertaining, interesting night with activities and fun for adults and children had photo taken with Mr & Mrs Claus. Returned during daylight hours experienced the candle dipping, the gold pouring, drank mead at the hotel, watched the re-enactment of the Eureka uprising, listened to the Brass Band, purchased souvenirs, watched the gold-panning, saw the horse and carts, the soldiers and people dressed in period costume. Purchased lots of souvenirs. Will definitely return next year with the family. It's a must do. Recommend purchase of  the 2 Day ticket you get 2 days for the price of 1."
Winter Wonderland Lights ,"What a fantastic place to visit, we loved our day out the tour guides, the map was great to get around and see what times the different talks were on. The little shops to buy things were cute and we tried to find some gold, we had some luck :) all the staff are great and it was ace seeing them walking around as if we were back in time, going about their daily jobs. The winter wonder lights were amazing, really good time of year to visit. It was cold so wrap up, lovely experience and very Christmassy. Highly recommend a visit here!"
Winter Wonderland,"Fist time attending this event,  good job with all the lights,  snow machine and lit up buildings,very magical,   very expensive entry fee,  European market was 3 stalls,  hardly worth mentioning,  need to have more eateries to cater for large crowds."
Great Day,If Australian history and people with passion and character are your thing. Then you are in luck! This is a must. Great value as well. Your entry gets you two consecutive days of entertainment. As well as the Aura Christmas light experience while it's on. Had historic photos done. So much fun and they turned out brilliantly. In the words of our Molly Meldrum....Do yourself a favour!
So much fun especially the Winter Wonderlights,"We visited Sovereign Hill 30 years ago, can I say not much has changed pun intended.We had so much fun yes, of course the actual buildings have not changed but the interaction with the guests has really improved.  You could watch the blacksmith, the school teachers, ladies showing the girls cross stitch and so much more. It was great just sitting at watching children playing games in the street and the horse and carriages going around the village. We  chatted to the store owners about the wares and how it was done in the Gold Rush times of Ballarat. We went on the free mine tour which was great and the paid mine tour both very informative.As we had the Winter Wonderlights pass we also went to the Light show at night, this is like a mini Vivid from NSW.  The production was excellant and a gold bar to the team who produced it.We also had the Christmas in July dinner which was average but still went with the whole expereince.  The staff were very nice.  It was a shame about 1 large table of guests who had very poor table manners and allowed the children to run around and be quite noisy.  I would recommed going to Sovereign Hill and if you get the chance do the Winter Wonderlights Expereince.  We will be back with the grandchildren one day soon"
Mark,"Would highly recommend, great day, grandchildren  had so much to do. They learnt about the early gold rush  period, actually panned for gold as well. Rode on the stagecoach and enjoyed old style ten pin bowling as well as many other attractions."
Panning for gold was fun,"I missed watching the Red Soldiers fire their guns as I was in the midst of my meal. There were a lot of customers inside & that made service slower.  Unfortunately, this show only happened once a day. When I ran out wanting  to snap a photo of the Red Soldiers, my daughter suddenly said she needed to use the toilet. Ugh! I told her to wait a moment as I wanted to queue to have my photo taken but she said it was urgent. So we went quickly & came back quickly to find that the Red Soldiers had all gone. What a disappointment. I wish the organizers would make it twice a day since it is a popular show.I like the candle making workshop. I just wished the guy had told me the exact steps needed to make a rainbow candle as I was totally clueless. In the end my candle was not as pretty as I hoped it would turn out. But well, it is better than being completely white.I also wish the candy workshop had run the candy making activity on a weekday too instead of only limiting it to the weekend as tourists do not have time to come back again.Be careful where you out foot as there are horse poop here & there."
Fun day but very expensive,"We had a good, full day of fun at Sovereign Hill and really enjoyed it. The entry price is very high compared with other attractions. It would be ok if you didn't then have to spend more money to do additional activities once inside. We spent more on the horse carriage ride and the mine tour. All up we would have spent around $250 just for tickets. We probably would have spent more on souvenirs but didn't due to high costs. On the plus side there was a lot to see and experience. The ""snow"" after the Redcoats parade was really fun and made the main street look really magical. I would recommend packing some snacks and drinks to make it more affordable as food was on the expensive side. The pies and sausage rolls we had at the bakery were very good though. The Trapped mine tour was great and told an incredible story really well. Our guide was the great great grandson of someone who didn't survive the disaster and was a wonderful guide and brought a personal touch to the experience. Would have loved to explore the mine longer or be able to do more than one of the tours at the same time."
Gold mine tour,"Although a wet and very cold day the experience here was wonderful. One highlight was the gold mine tour which was wonderful. The theatre performances were excellent, too. The Chinese village demonstrated the extreme conditions people lived in. The evening light show was another highlight of day. This place is well a visit."
Great family day. “Trapped” mine tour a must!,"My family and I spent a wonderful day here in July. We took the gold rush express from Melbourne’s Southern Cross station (leaving at 9:16, returning at 5:15, 90 minutes or so each way), which was about the right amount of time unless we wanted to extend the stay into the evening, which we didn’t for personal travel reasons (but kind of wish we had time!). It was so fun to wander around. We started off by watching a blacksmith forge iron, then we panned for gold, where the Scottish guy running it was incredibly nice to my son and helped him a lot. Then we had a quick and good lunch of a delicious pies, followed by the ”Trapped” mine tour. That was truly terrific. It was led by an ancestor of one of the men who died in the terrible mine accident back during the gold rush. It was probably the most poignant such presentation I’ve ever seen, and I was quite moved by it, as was my family. It was also just neat to be down in a mine and do the whole tour. We couldn’t have had a nicer time."
Winter Wonderland Lights,"Like many Victorians i went to Sovereign Hill in School and never returned.I was loured back with the winter wonderland exhibit.I took my wife and 5yr old son and we arrived a bit after lunch during school holidays. It was busy, but not unbearable.Lots to do and see, and obviously lots of improvements since my school days.I was very disappointed that despite the very expensive entry tickets (general admissions as well as winter wonderland) once inside you had to keep dipping into your pocket to do things.There was enough basic things to do for free, but everything else was pay as you go. Horse and cart ride, an actual mine tour, etc etc. I expected that there exhibits would be free and you would only have to pay for food, special photos or behind the scene's extras.Panning for gold was a bit of fun, for those who have never done it i think they would be frustrated by no staff present to give a demonstration.The winter wonderland experience was set in the evening and was basically the main street all lit up with special projectors. They had bubble machines making it 'snow'. This was actually pretty cool. My family enjoyed it and there was also the back streets all decorated with fairy lights.Im glad i didnt go just for the lights as it wasnt worth admission on its own, but tied together with a full day its a good experience.Overall i enjoyed my visit, and if you go expecting to pay out some more money to do the activities then it could be a great day out.Warmer weather would be the preferred time of year to visit as it is mostly an outdoor experience."
"Denied Entry, Rude and Intimidating Staff","We had a 2 day ticket but were denied entry on the second day because of one of the staff made the conclusion that we breached the conditions of the ticket.The website states the following conditions for a 2 day ticket:*The free second day must be used over two consecutive days*Offer is not transferable*Photo ID requiredWe could not prove that the ticket was not transferred to us because on the first day we were not asked for a photo ID. We were asked if we had pictures from our visit the day before but did not have any, for various reasons. Our ticket was torn right before us and we were denied entry.Emotions and reactions aside, our complaint is based on the conditions set but have not been followed through with a thorough implementation. Instead, have relied on other forms of questions and reasoning, and requesting for other forms of proofs to arrive at a conclusion which we believe is unjustified. Dare we say the approach was even considered rude or intimidating by some.Needless to say, never again, and not just because of the price of the ticket!"
Family visit ,"Great for kids and families with activities that are fun and educational. Winter wonder lights and the X mas decor gave a sense of cheer to cold rainy day. Loved the gold mine tour, and the candle shop."
Winter Wonderlights 2019,"It was a chilly night but we managed to keep dry and have some fun. We panned for gold and found a couple of specks. There were many people in the ten pin bowling saloon seeking shelter from the rain so we went to the candle decorating. After buying candles the children were able to decorate them by dipping them in dyes. A visit to Clarke’s to buy boiled lollies before the Winter Wonderlights began in the Main Street. It looked quite magical with the “snow” falling and the buildings transformed with colour. The brass band was playing in the Main Street to welcome the lights. There were also free craft activities for the kids, a light tunnel and a European street market. There were plenty of places to buy snacks and warm drinks. It is essential to wear warm, waterproof clothes and rubber boots would be great to keep feet dry. Sovereign Hill is a fabulous historic tourist attraction and certainly worthwhile visiting."
Winter Wonderland at Sovereign Hill,"I really enjoyed this! It reminded me of Colonial Willliamsburg (home to my alma mater, the College of William & Mary!). It was quite cute, with all the old timey shops and buildings. Be warned, though: it is essentially a big souvenir shop, with a pretty hefty admission price. The goldmine tours will set you back extra ($7.50). The light show when it gets dark was absolutely amazing! For Melbourne locals, it's very similar to the Christmas light shows, but there's some interaction among the characters on the buildings. It also ""snows"": clumps of bubbles masquerading as snowflakes are pumped out on the Main Street throughout the day during this Christmas in July celebration. This actually reminded me of the snow at Christmas time in Celebration, Florida. All in all, the decorations and everything reminded me of my northern hemisphere Christmas (which I really miss!) I was glad I came, and recommend it, but for those wanting value for their dollar, you may be disappointed."
Winter wonderland ,It was cold and muddy but still a great place to visit. The snow was fun. The night lights were a bit for the very young kids. The Xmas markets were a nice touch. Always happy to come to SH.
Magical,Wonderful night wandering with Our little ones.If your in town this is a must do.So lucky to have this in our home town.Can’t wait for next year already to create special memories with my family.
Living History,As soon as u step inside u are transported into the 1850s...it is beautiful...what happened during the gold Rush and how did the people who can be called as the pioneers of this nation survive and thrive and passed on their culture and riches for the generations to come...all explained and preserved in this beautiful little place. Worth the extravagant fees.
Winter Wonderland ,Visited Sovereign Hill last night with my family after dark for for Winter Wonderful.It was delightful and joyous with a very professional lighting laser show and fake snow enthralling all who attended!
Expensive history,"As a Victorian, I have visited Sovereign Hill many times, particularly in my role as a teacher.This time the visit was to show our exchange student some Australia history and to take in the Winter Wonderlights.The first thing that struck me was how expensive it is to visit Sovereign Hill nowadays. At +$60 per adult, it is a very expensive day out and I would imagine out of the range for many families, especially when you consider that many activities within the park attract an extra fee.The fairy lights and light show in the Main Street were beautiful but during the daylight I felt the masses of light cables detracted a bit from the authenticity of the experience."
new experience,"it was more than 4 years ago since the last trip here. they have improved tremendously in terms of ease of purchasing tickets, and having a 2 day pass, separate entrance for multiple entries, very friendly people, and  most important of all, additional shops, dining outlets, and other events available for all..... all of a sudden, feel that a single day is not enough to see all. would strongly advice to make appointments for the photo shoot. lucky we got the two day pass!"
Fantastic day out ,"We went up for the winter wonderland in July school holidays. It was fantastic! Great costumes, friendly staff. We did the old school photograph (loved it, it's a little pricey but so worth it, you are clipped in so don't stress about sizes, they cater to a lot! Approx $79 per family including costumes and a large picture), the mine tour was really well worth it. $7.50 per adult and $4 per child 5 and up. It can be a bit scary going into the mine as it goes totally dark. Once you're in, it's clean and wide paths. Really interesting stories available (3 of them). We took our 1yo and 8yo and both loved the tour. Also did the horse and carriage tour which is similar price to mine tour. Once again it was good fun (We went after lunch as it was quiter). Also do the candle dipping. It's $4 to $5 for your candle but you can dip and make it unique. Gold panning was busy, fun for kids to see if they can find gold. Food wise, can be expensive. I saw some people bring a picnic, which is cheaper. We had lunch at the cafe next to playground. The sub type sandwiches are excellent. The bakery as you walk in has a good deal, for around $14 you get a hot item, a sweet item and a drink (don't do coffee unfortunately!). You can also grab an adult beverage if you desire."
Really interesting way to learn our history ,We had an excellent day exploring Sovereign Hill. We got the 2nd day entry for free which was super helpful as it meant we didn’t have to rush through anything. It’s a great day and suitable for everyone
Winter Wonderlights but poor dining experience,"Just finished our 3rd year visiting Sovereign Hills Winter Wonderlights. The lights and night experience was excellent as usual. Each year the Winter Wonderlights adds something different and keep providing an amazing experience for the family. The crowds are quite large, however this really doesn't distract and probably adds to the overall atmosphere.What let the night down was the extremely poor dining experience. This is our second year attempt at this, and quite honestly both were extremely dissapointing. The first time was at the NY Bakery.This year we were huddled into a small back room of the US hotel with 4 other groups. It had almost no atmosphere, and even a bit of music might of helped. It felt like being in the back kitchen dining room with 4 families with bright flourescent lighting.We ordered off the drinks menu. The wines on it were not available, and in the end my wife settled on the Shiraz, only to be told it wasn't the same shiraz as on the menu.We also ordered a beer (Tooheys Dry), which the waitress later apologised as they didn't have that beer available. I cancelled the beer as the main course had arrived. There was no time to have a pre-drink.Main course arrived minutes after we arrived at 6:45pm. The whole service was rushed as it had to be completed within 75mins. We were gone in under 45mins. Main course was turkey and lamb. The lamb was square...never seen square lamb before. It was very tender and tasted like lamb. Tender as it felt and looked like it was processed and looked like a small brick.The turkey was a one inch slice of rolled roast turkey. Almost no vegetables provided. The turkey had a sauce, 2 small rings of onion and a tiny baby beetroot. There was a teaspoon of sweet potatoe spread as a ring around the turkey.Desert was an apple tart. I wouldn't rate this highly and left 80% of it.It was quickly over. There was no atmosphere, and as people left it was uncomfortable to stay.For the price we paid ($151 without drinks), it was probably a 2 star food and a 1 star experience. The staff was pleasant, however they had to work with what they were given...poor food, fluorescent lit dining room, and dining room that was void of any atmosphere.For a great winter wonderlight experience, it was severely let down to the point of disappointing memory. I wouldn't recommend sovereign hill for a dining experience. Two years now and the same outcome and conclusion"
Wow!,Came here as a teacher on holiday! Was not disappointed! Very busy in holidays but a faulous experience.
If you’re a teacher they let you in for free!,"Well we went to have a look and see if it as worth it. We left 7 hours later with two tired but happy kids and mum and dad looking for a glass of wine after a long day! So many cool things to see and do. We didn’t really plan so missed some of the exhibits but when we figured ourselves out it was sweet. We found lots of good advice from other travellers here about cheap options but the best was to take a packed lunch! Talking to someone in line they told me they get in free if you are a teacher, I couldn’t show my Qld teachers registration but a few emails on my phone and my license was enough to cut it so happy days. Definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for time to spend with their family and explore a begone era."
National Treasure!,"An authentic experience in which you can immerse yourself into Ballarat town during the 1850's. You can hang out with the ""locals"" dressed in costume of the era or gold miners by the digs as they tell tales from their calico tents replete with open fires, pan for gold, dip candles, watch traditional sweets being made, take a ride in a stage coach or go underground and visit a gold mine.  Unlike other ""theme parks"", it doesn't feel like you are constantly reaching for your wallet. The Hope Bakery makes wonderful pies and sweet treats, just be sure to head there early during peak season - or be prepared to wait in line...for a long time. Don't forget to stop by the sweet shop for your Raspberry Drops - amazing!It's great that the Two Day pass has been reinstated, and free entry into the Gold Museum across the road as part of your entry fee makes visiting Sovereign Hill excellent value for money for families as well as being a wonderful day out!"
Could Not Handle Large Crowds,Booked to take the kids to the Winter Wonderland and everything was booked out and they cut lines midway as they couldn't handle the volume of people.Very disappointed and staff werent quipped to deal with complaints and volume. Their excuse was we don't have enough people staffed - if you know this is the 'busiest day of the year' perhaps you should be more prepared!! won't rush back!
Exchange student visit is a hit!,lovely sunny winters day out at sovereign hill...enjoyed this tourist spot on a full on tourist day-rare for us!
Winter Wonderlights was fantastic but dinner was dismal!,"We have visited Sovereign Hill regularly over the last couple of decades, especially with interstate and overseas visitors and it has never disappointed.  Until now.  Our Winter Wonderlights dinner - pre-booked and quite expensive, was dismal! I cannot admit to my family how much I paid for a pretty mean meal, which was supposed to be special.  Our waitress was fantastic, as was the setting and the atmosphere.  The food just wasn't good - especially the wierd slow cooked lamb.  Very few veggies! My children said that that the children's meal wasn't as good as their school camp food and for them veggies = frozen peas...Sorry for bad review but that menu and offering really does need to be reviewed...  The awesome light projections and installations really deserve a worthy accompaniment..."
not too bad,just walk around and take nice picture and have a average lunch at the cafe. not too good for adultery due too much walking
Family trip,"My son (11yo) said to give the review a 5 stars. Lots to see and do! Gold panning, horse cart rides, gold pouring demonstration AND more.This is a great destination for any family"
Being in Wonderland,"It is my great good fortune to visit the Winter Festival on July 3 2019.You are suddenly and miraculously transported into the Gold Rush/Gold Discovery year 1851 .Fortunes were created and a new era commenced in Australia.The Gold Museum was inaugurated in 1978.The township/shopping complex the snow falling ,the music,soldiers firing muskets and the costumes of people walking makes you feel that you are really living in the bye gone era.It is an amazing and marvellous creation.Advice to those who have not been there,It is a must if you are holidaying in Australia.   Regards,Dr.S.K.Pachauri IAS Retd        Delhi INDIA"
A must see in Melbourne ,"The last time I've been to Sovereign Hill was actually a long time ago, probably 2011, and I've been more than a couple of times and it's always been pure joy going! I love the 1800s and so it's always been my most favourite attraction/museum in Melbourne!!"
To get Famous Sausage Rolls,Best Sausage Rolls.Very expensive to get in but worth while the visit.If you get a chance go see Blood on the Stone at night
Appalled at entrance price - Free for registered educators,"We took a day trip to Ballarat from Melbourne excited to explore the area and Sovereign Hill museum.However, the entrance price stopped us in our tracks. For 2 of us - including a concession, it would cost over a hundred dollars?? Plus paying for extras inside. How is this affordable?Compared to other attractions around Australia (and the world) this is too expensive. Ballarat is not close to Melbourne.When I got home and researched the website again it mentions 'free educator pass' Being a registered teacher I could have gone in for free - this was not mentioned at the entrance. Being new to Melbourne I was not aware of this! Please be aware if you are a registered educator or student teacher in Victoria you can access at the entrance. If you are from another Aus state pre register online. I'm not sure for international educators.Looks like we will be making the trip back another day!"
Amazing experience,Couldn't rate this any higher! A great day for solo travelers like myself and also great for kids. So many interesting and interactive displays. Definitely one to try when you're in the area
Golden nugget,"Its great to see this place keeping their local history alive. Town, reenactments and talks are all well done and very informative. We felt the paid extras inside were a little cheeky given the entry price. Good day out though especially if you've not been before. Have a look around the museum opposite the town too."
Day Outing,It has been a number of years since I had been here. Thought it would be a worthwhile day out and to see what had change. I liked the way in which things were done. There had been a few little changes since I had been there the first time. It is a worthwhile place to visit. Plenty of history to be discovered. There is enough things to see and do to make it day out. I enjoyed the way things were laid out. Would recommend a visit.
Simply great to go back in time,Don’t miss the soldiers firing their muskets around lunch break. Simply awesome just to watch and hear the ancient muskets come alive. It was a fun place to be learning about life in the olden days of gold prospectors.  They had a rugged life. The mine tours were so educational and the gold pouring must be the highlight of this attraction.
Disappointing visit,I went to Sovereign Hill with some Hong Kong visitors and was appalled to find the only option was a two day pass for $58 per adult. We were not in a position to drive back to Melbourne and come back the next day. Once inside the experience was poor. No one spoke to us. I thought the people were supposed to re enact the characters of the time and engage with visitors to enhance the experience But no . The whole visit was really passive and bland. I do not think I will be taking international visitors there again
A perfect day ,"Magical winter day on the Ballarat goldfields. So much to see and do. A wonderful interactive museum for all ages. Seems expensive when you enter, and a bargain when you leave. A Ballarat gem."
A nicely done interpretation of our historic past,Was initially worried it might have been a tacky and touristy fake village. But far from it. This is like a real walk down the main street in the 1800s.
Going Back in Time,"It is a great place to spend a day with the family, friends or on your own. There is so much to see. Get the feeling of what life was like in those days , so much to learn, it is a very interesting place, I enjoyed the gold panning , if lucky you can find some gold. very interesting place. I went as a child, took my own children and have been on my one and with friends over the years and there has always been something new or something I missed last visit, I am looking forward to my next visit."
 Not worth for money ,"58AUD per entry plus other expenses depends what do you do inside , Tram ride for nearly a minute and walk underground for 45min It’s good experience But tickets shouldn’t be that’s expensive  Food inside is expensive, designed to rip your money out to max It’s a good place to visit .Money vs experience- not my recommendation I saw the previous reviews here before I comment We did not stay overnight,went there at 11am left at5pm"
Journey through history in a colourful way!,"This was an amazing experience, the story telling is out of this world! Every different form of the story is engaging from their State of the arts 3D cinema to the lights theatre by the pond into the outdoor theater with projectors! Amazing work put in there and the food was great at the restaurant before the tour. Totally recommended!"
Interesting,"Having visited Sovereign Hill a few times but never having seen the previous light show, we decided to treat ourselves to Aura recently.  (We also partook in the dinner beforehand which we really enjoyed by the way!)  As advised, everyone was 'rugged up' for the commencement in the theatre. It starts with the creation of earth (and therefore gold) so we all wore 3D glasses for this as bits of exploding stuff hurtles towards you!  After this we boarded a bus/train for a 10 min journey to their outdoor arena/theatre.  The indigenous story is told projected onto rocks (I think ... it was very dark!).  It is under cover but the wind can be very chilly. Then you move into the main viewing area for gold rush/Eureka part.  It finishes with the bus journey back to the start.To be honest I'm not sure how much the younger members of the audience would have understood.  There is obviously loud noises (gun fire) in the Eureka stockade.  However, worth seeing for historical purposes.  All staff were excellent!"
Great place,The night tours were great.We did the candlelight tour.Its a shame you had to pay separately for entry and any other tours no combined tickets were offered.The Hope pie shop was amazing.There were queues for the gold melting so plan ahead.Gold panning was good fun
Lots of fun,"We visited as a couple. $60 per adult. It’s a long day with lots of different and exciting activities to do. Quite a few events are scheduled at the same time which makes seeing everything difficult. There are a few activities that cost additional money to your ticket price. I have taken my children here in the past. One recommendation I’d make to parents is to remember that the site is not flat. There are hills and the paths are gravel. Prams are difficult to manoeuvre. Small children (under the age of 6) can get very bored waiting in line and staying quiet during presentations. I’m not saying not to take them, but I am saying that it would be nice if you were considerate of the other people there. It’s a great place to learn about the history of the Ballarat gold rush."
Great Place to see,"On a recent visit to Victoria, as a photographer ""Sovereign Hill"" was on my must see list and it didn't disappoint. The architecture of the buildings, the costumed characters, The Cobb & Co. Coach and The Redcoats were all fantastic, as they help to immerse you in the time of 1880's Victoria. The costumed characters were always willing to stop for another photo. The Children from visiting school groups are transported back in time as they dress, learn and play like children did back then."
Who couldn't love Sovereign Hill?,"I've been here a number of times and never tire of it.  So much to see and do and activities and demonstrations are on throughout the day with the only difficulty being which to choose when they overlap!  School holidays are in July and the winter wonderlights are on at that time too.  I went early June and it was incredibly quiet, I imagine, because of that.  The Christmas in July is amazing but if you want to avoid the crowds, this time is perfect.  I had plenty of time to chat with the shop keepers and the ladies in the houses, which really enhanced my visit."
History and memorabilia,Was good but possibly needs more interaction with the guests It fitted in well with the Sovereign Hill visit.
Australian History unfolded,"The Mine tour was excellent and excellent value for money, the stage coast ride was good, but very overpriced, it should be included in the entry fee.There were a lot of schools there with children participating in the events in period costumes, which was an excellent idea for them to learn about Australian history."
"Great experience going back 170 yrs to a traditional Aussie/English mining town.""","Great experience going back 170 yrs to a traditional Aussie/English mining town.""A very authentic place to visit and well laid out but make sure you wear proper footwear as it's all dirt and up and downhill.The gold panning in the creek was lots of fun especially because you get to keep the gold that you find.We tasted the best pies and sausage rolls at the bakery; highly recommended."
Expensive,"I found Sovereign Hill a little disappointing. It is brilliantly put together and there is an authentic 19th century feel to the place as you walk around; however almost every one of the buildings there is to see is a shop or a restaurant involving extra expense. I didn't find there was much of a ""museum"" aspect to it and can't say I learnt anything about the gold rush era. That said, the Gold Pour has to be seen to be believed and was almost worth the entry fee alone. I am not easily impressed but I had to life my jaw back up off the floor as the bright orange melted mould turned into 99.99% gold! The Labyrinth mine tour was better than the self-guided one and included a cool underground tram ride and a secret tunnel. The various skits performed throughout the day were also good if a tad cheesy. A visit here makes for a pleasant day out but it will quickly turn costly if you aren't careful."
The best old world town recreation I've seen.,Sovereign Hill is expensive but is totally worth it. The entrance ticket can be used on 2 consecutive days which is great as it is a vast place with such a lot to see and do. The old buildings are great to go into and staff are dressed in period clothes and tell you about life for the inhabitant of the house or shop you are in.
Great Day Out,"Congratulations on the wonderful historic site you have recreated ,we had a fabulous day there inspire of it being only 9 degrees"
Unexpectedly one of the BEST destinations to go to near Melbourne!,"The Sovereign Hill is an experience like no other. It's going to be like you're really transported to the gold town in 1850s. (And an entire cast of 190 townspeople are acting the entire day to day). We have been to several countries and attractions before, but this is certainly a MUST GO TO when you're in Melbourne (even if it's not so popular). My favorite experience here was just the atmosphere. Example, at around 12:45pm I saw a bunch of students (cosplayed by actors) just having a conversation they had to go back to school by 1pm, but 1 student wanted to still drop by the candy store... I don't want to spoil anymore, because you really must experience it! But it's the little things like this that just immerse you in a different world and will make the entire trip unforgettable."
Favourite place ever,I can not describe how much my family and I love this place. It has something for all ages and the new play spaces are fantastic. All the volunteers go above and beyond to make it memorable for years to come. They were absolutely beautiful with my 11month old and more then happy to have photos with him. If you haven’t been you are missing out!
winter wonderland,Visited Sovereign Hill during the winter wonderland period last year with my husband. It was amazing loved every minute of the 6 hours we soent there. Have just booked tickets for myself and 3 friends to visit the winter wonderland again this year. Weve decided to stay the night and do all the activities dinner etc. cant wait
World Class Living History,"The characters are vivid.  The times were rough.  Such is the message of the actors you meet on the Living Stage of Sovereign Hill.  I found myself in a time machine going back to a time and place that is somewhat unimaginable without the extensive attention to detail.  The 'hosts' that you can listen to give brief tours are completely immersed in their characters.  If you stop anyone in costume on the streets, including the kids they are 'playing their parts' just as if they were in the 1850s and 60s.  Every place you look in the town it is going as it would if we were not there visiting with some notable exceptions.  It is not as dirty and crowded as reality but you get a glimpse of it.  This is a must see slice of past life.  Ballarat has preserved and celebrated its history with its flaws left for us to learn from.  They have not chosen to destroy it and make us believe it was so evil you can't build good out of a sordid past.  I don't quite know what to compare this place to as a preservation of history."
Great time,"Alm the kids had a ball,  love this place it's a living museum,  dressups, mine tours, informative cast all around the town, go gold mining  just a great time"
Fun & informative,"Visited with our three children 4, 13 and 18 years old. We really enjoyed the atmosphere and the people in period costumes, it was like going back in time. We did a mine tour and gold panning. The place is great, so much to see and if you want to see all, you will need the 2 days (included in the entry ticket). It can also be very hot during the day, bring a hat. I must say that it is not a cheap outing, be prepared to spend some serious money."
Bazndi,"Travelled Australia and this place is the best tourist attraction we have seen. The cost of an entry ticket is for 2 days and you can easily be fooled into doing it in a day but that’s not the case. Take your time stay another night and experience our culture and lifestyle over the 2 days it’s amazing. The kids will love it and they can pan for gold, or dress up and take a family portrait which was pretty cool. There are plenty of live shows ranging from Musket shooting to riding in the Cobb and Co carriage and many more. The staff are amazing and so entertaining as they wander the streets in period costume it really does make you think you have gone back in time. A wonderful 2 days and the best 2 days we have spent on the road for 12 months."
WONDERFUL AMAZING PLACE,My husband and I sent the day wondering around this beautiful well presented place and I reccommend it to everyone. We did all the tours during the day and found them to be very informative. We went back at night to do the Aura Lights as well.Both the day and night features are amazing and really interesting. Australia is so lucky to have a place like this and I hope it stays like this for years to come. A big thanks to the staff be it paid or volunteers for making this amazing place a truely incredible unforgettable experience.
Excellent Day,"Had a great day at Sovereign Hill.  I had visited when I was 6 with my family, so this visit was very nostalgic.  Brought back many fond memories - the place has changed big time but the feeling associated to the visit, was strong.  Invest the time and see it all - it is so worth it.My husband and I shared a sausage roll from the bakery, you could tell it was home-made.  Very tasty.  Afternoon tea was had at the ""saloon"" - once again, we shared scones. The serves are big enough for two.The history this place holds is unbelievable. Thank you for an excellent day and fond memories.Tip:  purchase your tickets on line via RAA/RACQ/RACV you end up saving approx $7pp"
Absolutely breathtaking,Very imaginative and well thought out. Please wear warm clothing as it is at night and was a little cold. The story line was very real and informative. Great for all the family.
great historic place,"love the history that has been preserved in this great place, those raspberry drops are delicious aswell :)well worth a visit, it can be quite costly.. but if you would like to check it out, lower your amount of people going,Great day out."
Fantastic,"Very informative, if you want to attend all demonstrations or theatrical performances then make good use of the 2day pass."
Awesome day out,Had a fabulous day. We spent the whole day wondering around. Hubby went on a mine tour and said it was good. Did the orientation tour which was good and got the down low on the happenings around the place. Watched some candy being made and got to have a taste. Played a street game. Everyone stayed in character throughout the day.
Great place - need a minimum of three hours,We loved our visit. The buildings are so realistic and just help you learn so much about life in the goldfields. The characters are great and know their stuff as well - the boilermaker was a qualified tradie in character.  The items on sale were great and mostly locally made so we were happy to spend on them. The only thing that disappointed me was that this was completely separate from the Eureka information - it would be so much better if they were together.
Fun and interesting day for all,"We visiting as a 3 family group of 4 adults and 5 kids spending pretty much the while of a day there. Kids highlights included the gold pour, sweet making, the show in the theatre, the rope making, lessons in the school and panning for gold. With the 9 year old who actually found two small flakes of gold whilst panning completely delighted. The adults enjoyed the wheel making, buildings themselves and basically all the things the kids did too. The small mine tour was good fun for all and one of the longer tours was also good for a smaller group of us. The actual buildings and costume are very well done with plenty of things going on throughout the day. The drive from Melbourne made it a long day, but not unmanageable. Four of our group did stay in the onsite hotel too which was fine even if the walls were a bit thin."
Wish we had been able to go for longer,Had a job trying to convince my wife to go.... afterwards she and I admitted it was much better than expected. Seemed authentic and not at all disney fied.... Excellent historic re-enactment.  Very educational too but in a fun way. The school parties there seemed to be enjoying!
Fantastic,Have been to Australia 3 times now and each time I've been I've made it a must to go here. There is so much to see and do for all ages. Reasonable prices. Cant wait to go again
A fun day but very expensive,"My husband and I had a great day at Sovereign Hill. We arrived at about 10:30am on a Sunday and didn’t leave until 5pm, so prepare for a full day. Even on a weekend, there were no crowds. I would say the must-do activities are the photography room, gold mine tour, red hill mine tour, candle dipping, panning for gold, gold pour and buying a jar of the raspberry hard-boiled candies. Unfortunately what lets this place down is the ongoing cost. As two adults, we paid almost $120 just to walk through the door, followed by $90 for the photography, money for the gold mine tour, money for the candle dipping, money for the horse ride etc etc. My husband and I are not adverse to spending big on a fun day out but $5 for a gingerbread man was actually ridiculius (we paid it though). I wouldn’t come back for this reason, even though I really enjoyed the day."
Great fun,"Every visitor to Victoria must visit sovereign hill what else can I say , go gold panning see horse shoes been mad, go old style 10 pin bowling"
Excellent day out,We were undecided whether to visit due to some of the more negative reviews on here but so glad we did. We spent around 6 hours here and thoroughly enjoyed it. Somewhat surprised at some of the comments regarding cost as we did not find it greatly different to Oz prices generally. The Mine visit as an extra we would say is well worth paying for and the reconstructions of the children’s classrooms and practical classes were first class. A definite thumbs up from us.
What can I say.. It's Sovereign Hill how can you go wrong ,You will love this place. I went here when I  was a kids and was overseas for 27 years and had another visit recently and absolutely love it. I took my wife and 5 kids.. We had a great time. A must see
Fantastic family day out,"We bought tickets using Red Balloon and under 4 is free. The customer service from all those in costume is excellent. They play their roles and know the history of the town so well. We did the Labyrinth underground tour (extra $7.50) which goes for 45 mins. Can't compare this value to a $10,  90 second carnival ride. There were shops, pantomime and street shows, panning in the creek, animals. Love the brassware to buy and prices very reasonable unlike many tourist attractions."
Brilliant,Great way to spend a day out of Melbourne. The whole of Sovereign Hill is a class act and the ultimate old Australiana experience..
super fun day,Had a great day taking in all Sovereign Hill had to offer. It was worth paying the extra fees for the under ground tour which was only $7 or so.
We started with the immersive Aura and spent the next day enjoying all Sovereign Hill offered,"We ate raspberry drops and saw them being made, delighted in lemon tarts from the bakery, made and dipped candles, had our names stamped on a wanted poster, visited the museum, travelled underground to see a small portion of the mines beneath this wonderful living museum. We even purchased a hand forged steel fry pan and pizza tray. Sovereign Hill is a great adventure in to the past. The most awesome component of our visit however was without doubt Aura which started with the beginning of the galaxy to illustrate where gold came from. Giving context to the gold rush was terrific, but giving context to the importance of this rich land to Australia's first owners was unique and to be celebrated. The story loses the plot in parts, but the special effects and First Nations creation story was brilliant and not to be missed."
A detailed review - day & evening tour.,"We read plenty of reviews before organising our Easter getaway around Sovereign Hill (which we hoped would highlight our weekend). Many other reviewers did comment on the experience itself being underwhelming/overpriced and we feel we must also say the same. The entry fee truly has no worth in it, as almost 80% of the activities/gold mine attractions incur charges once in the village. The village itself is mostly stores where you can purchase items such as baked goods, lollies, cast iron and leather goods. The 'activity' options displayed on the website do not really deserve advertised mention, the camera obscura is a small laundry sized room in which you see a handful of very faint upside down images on a screen (maybe we were not using it right?) we couldn't find any instructions, the bowling alley was filled with people divided into two lines adults/children, who could each have a go at bowling the ball once and the lost trade set-up of making a potpourri sachet by taking a handful of lavender and placing it in a handkerchief - was well just that! Most of the activities including Goldfields Family Life, The Pantomimes and other demonstrations where finished by 1pm which was the time we arrived. The gold mine underground tour was something we were looking forward to however after lining up for 25 minutes, we were advised that there was a three hour waiting time for the sectioned groups. The real downside to the whole set-up is the commercialism, there is so much room for re-enactors to truly fill the space and make an experience come to life. We felt like we were walking through a backstage set with a few interactive props here and there, as oppose to walking through a time in history and truly getting a feel for it. There should be re-enactors in the streets, in the bars, in the bowling alleys, in the houses and churches and school. We saw one man dressed as a police-officer and another in a black long-suit with a top hat looking like it was way past their home time - they easily could have sparked up a small act on the street and commenced an inclusive experience. We did not bother going over to the Gold Museum after the hour we spent at Sovereign Hill, we just felt like it was a waste of money and not much more could turn our experience around. We purchased a Lamplight Tour in our ticket package, our time slot for this was 7.15pm, admittedly we contemplated not attending, however felt like maybe we should try get some monies worth out of the day - much to the credit of our outstanding host Zerene our evening ended well and left us on a high note for the day. Zerene was extremely bubbly and remained in character the whole time, the stories that she shared along the tour really gave us the experience we were looking for throughout the day, we were very engaged as was the whole tour group and the interactive stops along the way had us wanting more and more! I would recommend the Lamplight Tour on its own and definitely advise anyone attending during the day to save their money. We will not be attending again in future, we will keep an eye out on reviews to come following the $10 million dollar grant see if there are any major changes as needed."
Great historical attraction for the whole family,We went there not really planning to go and we weren't disappointed. Spent a very enjoyable afternoon wondering around. The main street is straight out of the wild west! The mine tours are a must see and very enjoyable. There is a huge play area great for picnics too. Plan to bring a bit of cash but most of the shops have efpos. Horse carriage ride was fun.Lots of shops to buy gifts from the time and souvenirs
A fun day for the family,"We visited Sovereign Hill with children (aged 9 and 6) and enjoyed a fun-filled although jam packed day!  We arrived at 10am, opening time, and proceeded down the Main Street to book a Mine Tour for later in the day. We then attended our prebooked Photography session, a fun experience taking us back to what it would be like dressing in the era, the photos turned out great, pricey but worth it! We then rushed to the sweet demonstration, yummy taste tester, and our Mine Tour which was very informative. Making our way to the New York Bakery for lunch, sitting by the window over looking the people panning for gold was a nice outlook. We then proceeded to join them in their hunt for gold and making it big, wishful thinking! We walked away finding 3 flakes of gold which we took home in a little glass bottle. Moving into the candle making demonstration and gold pour demonstration before rushing up to the horse and carriage ride making it onto the last ride before the end of the day. By this stage it was 4pm and we made it to the last blacksmith demonstration for the day. We were hoping to have a quite drink before leaving however most places were closing up by 4.30pm which was disappointing considering the Hill was still open until 5pm. We missed out on visiting a few places so 2 days spent at Sovereign Hill would have made it more relaxing and less of a rush. Both my husband and I had visited as young kids so our expectations were high and Sovereign Hilll didn’t disappoint. A fun, memory making day for the family!"
Highway Robbery... ,"Disappointed by the disgraceful price on arrival for a family of four when you walk five paces into the main strip and are then greeted by every shop requesting a Ye Old’e EFTPOS card. If you haven’t got your EFTPOS card you’re welcome to use the ATM at the front of the building. The cost of your right arm covers that. After a candle making session, riding the horse cart and the mine tour we were another $100 in the hole. After lunch we were glad we had requested a second mortgage on the house to cover the $300 of a 1 day visit. I expect a reply stating they’ll cover this in their forward planning, however don’t expect any of the prices to go backwards nor any family to simply visit the attraction without having to outlay any other money. The owners have created their own ongoing gold rush. The park has over 450,000 people visit a year... you do the math."
Beautiful insight into the past,Beautiful day out. We learnt so much about how life used to be. Easy access to everything. Must see if you’re in Ballarat.
Great day,"Loved all of this experience, from start to finish. The gold museum is informative, interesting and definitely worth seeing. Sovereign Hill has lots of worthwhile activities and wandering the streets of a bygone era felt true to life. Lots of 1800’s shops to visit, go down into a mine, watch gold bullion being poured, horse drawn carriage rides, candle dipping.... Went beyond my expectations, great experience of our Australian history. Highly recommend. Do the night time Aura show also, wow...that was great."
A nice experience but a little pricey for what is covered in the General Entry. Would be fun for kids though,"Gold Mine Tour, which is paid for extra and not included in the general entry is excellent. They take you underground through a train where gold was mined in the 19th century. Well worth a visit"
Gold Rush of 1850's LIVE!,"My first visit was very exciting, in 2013 when I saw the school children playing, the baker in the black dress, the blacksmith, the postman, the horse carriages, the modern visitors panning for gold while rich ladies walked about in silk dresses and the parade of Brit soldiers in red. My second visit a couple of days back was quite late - an hour before the closing hours (Please go there in mid-morning because by noon every activity is on the peak!) so what was on? The stage/theatre of those days! People were still panning for gold and the 4 horse carriage was still the public transport, bowling was about to close and the school had already closed."
A must visit,"Great experience going back 170yrs to a traditional Aussie/English mining town. All staffs  were excellent and friendly. I've got experience with Gold panning and Gold mine tour. There are bakery shop, cafe, gift shop and restaurant inside. There are many shows and activities you will be enjoying whole day. I loved the night show indoor and outdoor theater. A truly wonderful day out."
Fun but pricey,Good day experiencing what it may of been like during the gold rush days. The cast really to try to keep in character so interacting with them was fun. Panning for gold is hard work and maybe not for those who have knee or back issues as you spend so much time on your knees or squatting. You do find gold in the panning area but you are only finding gold flakes. It gives you an appreciation of how hard the work would have been for the gold panners. The extra  activities will add to the overall cost of the visit which is pricey. Food is typical pricey like a theme park.
Stepping back in time,"Very informative and educational, not to mention good fun. All of the guides were dressed in period clothing, they were friendley and knowledgeable."
Sovereign Hill Day out,"An easy drive from Melbourne, makes for a perfect day trip to Sovereign Hill. Definitely book through trip advisor to save you a few dollars. You can spend that on a fossicking licence for the kids if they strike gold..! Check out the self guided mine tour as well the sausage rolls from the bakery on the Main Street near the entrance - you won’t regret it."
Missing something,"Have visited previously - about 30 years ago.Not much has changed. Lacked some vibrancy,  though it was 3pm, windy and a day or two before start on Vic school holidays. Hardly anybody there and a number of the attractions (stores) were closed.Still think it has something to offer in the education market but it needs some more action/interactive events to engage adults."
Sound and Light Show,"This spectacle is truly amazing. Apart from the light and sound experience, you get a much better appreciation of just what happened at that time."
Better than expected,"This is our 2nd time here, laast time was more than 10 years ago. Seems like a lot more to see and do now. The gold mine tour is a must do, we paid for family of 4 ticket. But be warned some walking and darkness and interesting tram/train rides. Service at New York Cafe was slow, waited 40 mins for food despite repeated reminders. Red Coat parade and gold panning was also interesting. All in all a good few hours spent in a historical site. Buy your tickets in advance to get some savings. Entrance to the Gold Museum opposite was included and is worth a visit."
Great day out for all ages!,"This is a wonderful place to visit for any age group.  There is so much to do and see and you can do as much or as little as you like!  You can take as much time as you need to wander around and see everything at your own pace and stop and rest in one of the cafes, do try the scones and a cup of tea/coffee, ideal way to recharge for the drive home!"
Excellent Day,"Something for everyone here. An interesting insight into our gold mining history with period costumes, stage coach, red coat soldiers etc.We found the food and goods sold to be of high quality and reasonably priced."
"Great place, beware of wasps!","Had a great day there with my kids and siblings, something for everyone and the items you can buy there are pretty good value. However our experience was ruined by the wasps, couldn’t go anywhere without them landing on us, we had to ditch our lunch and run away and literally grab my son out of his pram and run because 6, yes 6!! Wasps were on my toddler son. I understand wasps are natural but sovereign hill needs to take responsibility for the safety of their guests and relocate them, we would have loved to let the kids play on the playground whilst we ate but it wasn’t possible. Let down"
Great,"All ages will enjoy a day spent here. So many things of interest, you can get involved or just be an observer."
Surprising ,"I thought this was going to be an Old Sydney town experience , but it was so much better , we went on the guided tour around the town and was amused by the shows that were staged . I have never seen a working beam engine and crusher which are all steam powered , we also visited the Chinese village which is part of the place and checked out the gardens , well worth the entry fee"
Perfect timing,"I’ve been to Sovereign Hill before a few times. This trip I had a friend visiting from the US and wanted to share with her some local history. From the moment we arrived, our timing seemed to be just right. Without rushing we strolled from one activity to the next.First we explored the walk through indoor part of the museum. It is down the hallway to the left once you get tickets. People often miss it, but it explains how hard it was for migrants to come to Australia, and it worth a walk through. Then went to watch them making lollies. The explanation and visual display is very interesting and afterwards we even got to taste a freshly made raspberry drop!Next we walked over to Gold pour, one of my favourites, that never ceases to amaze me no matter how many times I see it! When that finished, we went to book in to a mine tour. During weekends and school holidays, this is best done when you first arrive, to avoid disappointment as tour can fill quickly. Fortunately we booked in for the next tour, which was only a 5 minute wait!The Underground train takes you down into the mine with a knowledgeable tour guide. Each time I have gone I have really enjoyed the tour guide’s antidotal stories and facts, no two tours have been exactly the same for us! Once the 45 min tour ended it was time for the Red Coats 1:30 display in Main Street. After the demo, they kindly pose for photos. We decided to take a break for lunch. We brought a picnic but I have been pleased with the various dining options in the past. There’s sit down restaurant in Main Street, a cafeteria style food court, a bakery, and sandwich/soup/bread bowl shop, to name a few that I remember. I want to make a note about how nice it is to have an establishment that allows you to bring your own outside food. (Which is rare)We decided to split our visit into two consecutive days, taking advantage of the 2-day entry pass. On our way out after lunch, we happened upon the blacksmith’s shop and arrived just in time for a demonstration! Knowledgeable and friendly blacksmith kindly and patiently explained his methods and answered all the questions from my inquisitive 3 yr old.We came back the day after and enjoyed some gold panning, walking Red Hill mine tour, a horse/carriage ride, candle dipping and many more activities. There certainly enough to see, to fill up two days if you like!I would recommend this venue for all ages. The staff and volunteers alike, make the experience even more pleasurable. Perhaps in the future, we will investigate the annual family membership."
Well Worth the Admission Fee,"Yes, it is quite expensive to get in but there is so much to see and do that you can spend many, many hours here.We were worried that it might be a rather Disneyfied theme park but everything is extremely realistic and it is like taking a step back in time, really bringing the stories of the Gold Rush to life together with the highs and the lows of life back then. There were quite a few school parties there at the time of our visit and I  would imagine it would be of immense educational value as well as being thoroughly entertaining. So allow plenty of time to get round properly and, when it comes to the admission price, imagine how much it costs to keep an attraction like this going. A truly wonderful day out."
Step back in time,Worth a visit. Great recreation of gold rush era. Pan for gold and explore the mines. We visited on a week day so not very busy even with school groups. Half a day was enough for us however it would be easy to spend a day here.
Exorbitant ,"For 2 adults and a 5 yr old it was $143! Then many experiences inside were extra $$, for example the candle making was $20. The food at one of the restaurants was really awful and cost approx $25-30 per dish. The overall experience was ok but really overshadowed by the ridiculous price point. Will not come again."
Make sure to get your money’s worth ,"I came here with my Dad while he was visiting from NZ. Overall it was a great experience, and incredibly well put together. However, at $50 per person just to get through the front door you will want to get your money’s worth. Make sure you go to as many presentations as you can, which will mean that you will want to spend at least 3 or 4 hours at Sovereign Hill"
Very interesting,A nice place to visit and an interesting way to learn about life in the 1850's. It has wheelchairs available but with the steepness of the roads etc. I think it would be difficult to get around.I realise the number of people working there and the upkeep would be expensive however the entrance fee would be off putting for many people. We were lucky in that we are concession card holders and so received discounts. The fee allows you entrance to SH and the Gold Museum for two days but I couldn't justify the two days.
"Highly recommend ""Aura""","We went to the new sound and light show, which replaces ""Blood on the Southern Cross"". Absolutely fantastic. The staff are wonderful, the transport around the town in the dark, is safe and exciting. The show itself is clever and unlike anything else you will see."
A Must Do Experience,"I had my reservations about going to visit Sovereign Hill as I thought it might be a Disney styled venue. Thankfully I was wrong, this is a wonderfully recreated living museum. The costumed characters bring the place to life and the beautifully created craft stores have something for everyone. There are timed shows around the town such as the Sweet Maker and Blacksmiths. And you can go down to the steam and pan for gold or enjoy a ride in the stage coach (this has a fee) or enjoy a snack and drink at one of the cafe. A wonderful day out."
Should be the top thing to do in Victoria!,"We love visiting historical sights, especially those with re-enactors, so we made special plans to drive out to Ballarat to see Sovereign Hill.  The town is a re-build, set up near an old gold mine, so it's not a re-creation of the original town, but rather filled with buildings and experiences that reflect life in the gold fields in 1850s.  We found the sight really easily due to the great signs and walked up the steps to the entrance center.  There was a short walk through display in the center that talked about then town, then out into the sunlight to walk around.  The town is built on a hill (figured that out from the name) so it takes a bit of walking to get to the upper town, but nothing too hard.  We hadn't walked for just a few minutes before we ran into our first set of re-enactors who were bringing the 1850's to life!  We hadn't seen this much density of re-enactors in any town other than the famous Williamsburg in Virginia.  The stores were mostly staffed with very helpful townspeople who weren't necessarily in character, but were great to talk to.  We enjoyed the live action at the blacksmith, the wheelwright, the mine, the tinsmith, the local constables, the redcoats, the candymakers, and especially the gold pour.  A special treat was the old-time bowling alley!  Every in the town was knowledgeable and more than willing to share what they know about the history of the town and the gold rush times.   We really enjoyed seeing that the town caters to young people, hosting many school groups who were very well behaved, but it was obvious the children were having a great time!  Highly Recommended"
Enjoyable Day,"Sovereign Hill is a reproduction of an historic gold mining town. Many shops, with products for sale that are made there, there is a mine to explore, old fashioned bowling, gold pouring, watching lollies being made, gold panning, stage coach ride, re-enactment of a police ""arrest"" on a man who didnt have a ""gold licence"". Food shops, playground. While we were there, there were children being taught school like the olden days, they were dressed in old fashioned clothes. Just a fun day. The ticket allows you to visit the Gold Museum which straight across the road. Plenty of parking. You can also stay in the overnight accommodation."
Amazing Show,"Wow, this experience is amazing. Watch a 3d documentary first, then a light show, then watch an excellent story of the Eureka Stockade. Made up of actors on screens telling the story. There was fire and fire works. Brilliantly done."
First rate Australian historic experience,"Allow a full day to experience all this wonderful historic site has to offer. It's a great attraction for all ages. We travelled with young kids (5 and 2) and their grandparents (70+), and everyone loved it.One mine is free with your ticket and the gold mine is $7.50 extra, but well worth it, especially as it includes a couple of short train rides underground.Would advise getting there early (opens at 10am) as the days get hot fast most of the year. Take some bottled water with you as it's expensive to buy it in the cafes.This is a must-see attraction for anyone visiting Victoria. We spent a couple of days in Ballarat just to see this and it was well worth it."
Old time ballarat,"Haven’t been for a few years however there were a few new displays. Some seemed to have shut down eg wood turning area. All the usual attractions were there - horse carriages, general store etc. The gentleman talking about gold was very interesting and gave a good rundown on the topic."
Good day out,Spent five hours here and the time went quick. Lots to do and eat and a great playground for when the kids want to come back to the 21st century.
A must visit in ballarat,"We went on a Sunday morning, glad we took a hat as it was a warm day. Very interesting, do the guided tour with the lovely Zerene, she’s a vault of information and funny too. Husband did gold panning, found a few specks. Had a ride in the horse drawn coach. There is a gold pouring demonstration which is quite interesting. Watched the lollies being made, raspberry drops are yum. There is a cafeteria on site for light meals. Don’t leave Ballarat without visiting here, it’s a wonderful attraction."
Truly a trip back in time!,"Get the feel of an authentic Gold Mining town from back in the day. This place is meticulously preserved or recreated to give you the back in time experience. From panning for your own gold, to taking the guided tour of the mine where the huge gold nugget was found, the entertainment at the bar, the food beer and beverages were all of outstanding quality."
A must,Better than the backcountry museum back home high praise indeed.The history of the area and gold mining brought to life
Unreal,The new light show is brilliant. Fantastic 3D movie followed by unreal projections on the hillside and finally the Eureka Stockade show. It really is unmissable and I don’t say that very often. Educational and spectacular all at the same time. A must see in Ballerat.
Great attraction,"So much to see and do. Make sure you visit the gold museum.  While you can see most things in a day, it really is easy to spend two days there."
An amazing educational experience,"I have really enjoyed the Indigenous activities offered such as the corroboree, lectures and the professional development for teachers. It is great to see Sovereign Hill and Narmbool recognising our indigenous Peoples of Ballarat. I would like to see more!"
must do,"a trip to ballarat would not be complete without a trip to sovereign , the people that work there seem to really love their jobs"
Great day out,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to Sovereign Hill - there is so much to see and do & it's so well done. We paid extra for the labyrinth mine tour which was good but we both thought the Red Hill self guided mine tour was better. We watched the gold pour, did the orientation tour plus watched the blacksmith, harnessing & wheel Wright demos - they were all excellent. The day flew by, so much so that we ran out of time so used the free second day option to go back & see a few things we'd missed plus the horse & carriage ride. The mining camp is great but the Main Street and houses are are amazing. It was great to see school kids in costume too."
Great day down memory lane,"We hadn’t been to Sovereign Hill I’m over ten years and it didn’t disappoint. The gold pour is always amazing- the colour of the liquid gold is stunning. We did the labyrinth mine tour going down in the train- a wonderful experience. Walking up and dirk those dusty roads brought back such a feeling of nostalgia. Well worth a visit, again and again and then once more!!!"
Break from the City life,"It is good experience and a break from the City life, have a nice atmosphere and horse riding, black smith, nice food etc. The Gold panning was really wonderful experience. Another attraction is Gold Smelting, I really enjoyed it. The entry fee is bit costly Museum and Sovereign hill is 57 $."
Quiet weekday visit,"We just love visiting Sovereign Hill and this visit was no exception. This time was the quietist we have ever seen it which was wonderful as it made for an extremely relaxing way to spend our time - a quiet drink in the pub, a hot sausage roll and wagon wheel in the bakery, bowling in the ten pin bowling alley, panning for gold on the diggings, attending class in the schoolhouse, checking out the boiler house and watching the salute to Queen Victoria. We then went to the Gold museum where I was able to “meet” my 3rd great grand uncle Louis Jean Michel who discovered the first gold at Warrandyte and view the amazing township and gold finds of Ballarat. Overall another wonderful experience"
Going Back IN time,"Its well worth the visit plan for a good day if you rush you will miss exploring the past, all dressed in 1850s dress pan for gold , make candy go under ground . don't miss it ."
Long weekend history lesson,"Took the family here for the long weekend.An amazing experiance, kids learnt so much. Take 2 days and plan ahead to get the most out of demonstrations. Try the lollie making the kids will love it."
Sovereign Hill,"Spent the whole day wandering and exploring authentic 1850s gold mining village. 2 underground mines to tour, lots of steam operated equipment to observe in operations and items made for purchase."
Family day trip,"Been along time since I had been here so time to take the family, booked online with RACV to receive a 10% discount. SH opened at 10am on the Friday, we arrived at about 11am. Plenty of parking. Walked out into the diggings and you can borrow strollers and wheel chairs. Always something going on in terms of displays and you are given a map to assist with planning. Great shops, lollies, foundary, candles, bakery, photography, bowling, horse ride, mine tours & gold panning. Staff are all in period costumes. Good gift shop. Great place!"
An outing in the 1850s ,"As a frequent visitor to sovereign hill, I enjoy coming back and learning something new on my trips here. One of my favourite things was seeing the $180k gold pour and learned how it had to be over 1000c to be melted down. Definitely be back again soon for more fun."
Third Visit in 18 Months,"We attended the last two Winter Wonderlights Festivals.  They were magical, but to return to the park during hot summer weather was quite a different experience!This time, we travelled with someone in a wheelchair.  The park is literally on a hill - luckily the wheelchair is powered!  Most - but not all - of the park is accessible.  Certainly enough is accessible to make it worth visiting in a wheelchair.We also attended two different after hours experiences.  For both of these, we had a dedicated staff member assisting us, which was greatly appreciated.  What's more, the staff were clearly trained and experienced in managing wheelchairs.  We did not feel that we missed out in any way.Thanks to the assistance of the staff, we had a genuinely memorable family trip."
Great day out,"A really enjoyable step back in time, with a town which comes to life with soldiers, police men and locals.Fun activities like panning for gold"
Fabulous and authentic,We really enjoyed our time here. I thought it might bea but theme park like but it’s a fabulous living museum. We easily spent two days and could have done more. Kids thoroughly enjoyed. Plenty to do!
A golden experience in more ways than one!,"Spend an enchanted day in this amazing recreation of an era gone by.  One that shaped this nation and should be a must for all Australians!  Sovereign Hill is a beautifully restored, maintained and presented recreation of a gold-rush village that has something for visitors of all ages.  The mine tour and the gold pouring is an absolute must - as is, of course, your opportunity to pan for real gold that you get to keep!  Enhanced beautifully and stylishly by authenttically dressed character actors ""going about their daily business"" in the village as they would have in the 1850's and 1860's.  No wonder this attraction is still beloved after 50 years!"
day and night fantastic,"you almost need two full days to see everything, we took overseas visitors and had an awesome time. the night show is probably one of the most incredible shows you will see ."
Inteesting comparison to California Gold Rush,"Sovereign Hill has lots to offer and was especially interesting to us as Californians who could appreciate the comparisons between the two gold rushes in the mid 19th century. A tour into the deep cool mines is welcome on a hot day. It is fascinating to watch a black smith quickly forge a tool, or an old fashioned candy maker prepare a large sheet of raspberry hard candies and then offer a free and tasty sample. The walking night tour is especially captivating with actors at each location making everyday life in the 1800s here come alive in just a few minutes at each venue."
A step back in time ,"To see how the gold rush panned out and the way the pioneers survived made the whole experience and $57.00 worth it. Great day out. Loved the making of the gold ingot, such a small amount of gold weighed so much. Not to mention the raspberry boiled lollies."
Enjoyable day out,Great place to visit and we will definately come back again. We were stupid though and didn't take to two day visit as we were time poor but next time two days for sure. Staff were attentive and in period and this made the experience more memorable.It was great to see all the kids in costume and i beleive that experience will be with them for life.Well done.
Great family day out,"We visited Sovereign Hill for one day with our family of 3 (2 adults and our 8yr old son).There’s so much to do and see we needed a 2nd day to enjoy everything.Our son loved the gold panning, horse and carriage ride, gold pour and Lilly making workshops.A brilliant day out for young and old highly recommended."
Fabulous place to visit,"What a great day we spent here. Originally thought the price to get in was expensive, quickly changed our minds. It was well worth it. Sovereign Hill is an amazing place to visit, particularly if you enjoy learning about history. We attended the gold pour, the sweet making demonstration and did a gold mine tour. We took part in Trapped which told the story of a mine collapse in the area and the rescue attempts in the late 1800's. It was so good. My husband and I were so glad we did it, very authentic,  entertaining and informative. The tour guide was also great. We loved how he added a personal touch as his great grandfather was one of the men that died in the collapse and he showed us his pocket watch. The rest of Sovereign Hill is awesome. All very authentic, staff dressed appropriately, lots of atmosphere. What a great way to learn about the gold mining history of the area and get an accurate idea what it would have been like. The only bad thing I can say is that when I went to enquire about a carriage ride the woman taking the money was very rude to me. This seemed unnecessary, she could have just answered my question politely. If you do want to do the carriage ride there take cash. Overall an awesome experience, would 100% recommend it to anyone. Thanks for a great day."
More suitable for children ,"I think Sovereign Hill is just like Disney! If I were child, it must attract me more! Actually the shops really looked like over 100 years ago! And there were some shows each hour like Disney parade! For me, the underground cart + mine hole visit was most attractive! It showed us how the workers did over 100 years ago! The food in restaurant should be improved most! It was pricy and unpalatable!"
Sovereign Hill continues to amaze.,It has been 30 years since we were last at Sovereign Hill and boy have they been busy. From new exhibits to fun re-enactments we really enjoyed our day. A must see is the new AURA experience. This is run every evening and is awesome.
Awesome experience,"I haven’t been to sovereign hill in about 15 years, I found the experience to be one of the best memories that I will cherish forever.I wasn’t sure if my children would like it, but they absolutely loved it.  They were all a little disappointed when it was time to leave. You do really need a whole day if not two to explore everything that they have to offer."
There’s gold in them thar hills,"The last time I was a tourist in Ballarat, my adult children were young. It is still a great tourist destination even for oldies like me. The proviso is that it is expensive to visit and the on-site food and beverage leave a lot to be desired, both in quality and price. Everything should be included but there are ads-ons, which, at about $AUD60pp for the entry, is just not right. The activities and site tours are excellent and demonstrations including Lollie making, gold pouring etc are world class. The Gold museum is a must. The guided tour is interesting and is free. The museum entry is included in the overall price, which can be used for full entry the next day. Whilst in Ballarat, a visit to the Art Gallery is worthwhile, as is the Eureka Stockade. All in all, a very good destination full of Young Australia’s culture and history."
"Great attraction, poor food","Really enjoyed sovereign hill. It has so much detail, right down to the staff actors whom roam the streets who suddenly burst out into impromptu performances which were very entertaining. Also well organised. It was very busy due to Chinese New Year, but we never felt crowded. I felt the cafe we ate lunch at left the attraction down. If you can, I recommend to bring in your own food. Plus you will save a small fortune as well."
"Visiting grandkids, over from the UK","Having visit the UKs north of England’s Beamish many times was expecting to maybe a little disappointed as Beamish (a living, working museum set in 500 acres of beautiful Durham with costumed folk bringing life to the rebuilt town). This expectation was soon expelled within minutes of walking in the entrance.This place is an absolute credit to the staff and volunteers.Spent two days here and and just managed to see most of the site, demonstrations and tours. Most impressive were the mining tours of which there are 4 , one free and three costing $7.50 (excellent value) , managed to do 3 of theses and all impressive. The work that’s gone into the wooded lining of the levels impressive and extensive. The cast (as they would known in Disney world lol😉) were informative, helpful, friendly, entertaining, proactive and as at Beamish brought the place to life. Do try the pie shop (bakery) as the steak pies are out of this world , had two while here! Had gread fun panning for gold, but didn’t initially find any bits. On visiting the nearby store i mentioned this to one of the staff who asured me that poeple find some everyday and said that if he didn’t have to man the shop he would show me and the grankids how to pan properly . All talk so I thought but then his colleague turned up and he immediately took us down to the stream and demonstrated the correct way to pan. He soon produced two specks of gold! I then had a go and found a large spec - over the moon!I could go on and on but I think you will have got my drift by now.NOT TO BE MISSED IF VISITING MELBURNE !!!!!"
