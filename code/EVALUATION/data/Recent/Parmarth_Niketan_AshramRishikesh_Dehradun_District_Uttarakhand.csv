Powerful place,The place to be if you want to share powerful vibes and songs. Let's your body talk to you during the Aarti and just be grateful to life
A beautiful place,I spent the day looking around and loved the atmosphere of the place.It is right on the Ganga and they do the traditional devotion service to the river each evening.I wish to return there a continue Sadhana.
Selfie Heaven not much meditation going on anymore,"Like a pest Western and Indians flock the place with their phones held up high recording the fire ceremony. All one can see is a sea of phones, followed by TV cameras on the bridge and more people with phones. Afterwards everyone is busy doing selfies, trying to look handsome cute and sexy. Oh boy am I sad about the state of Rishikesh and the showiness & commercialism taking over this place. Please stop allowing cameras and inspire people to appreciate, meditate and honour this place. Sick!"
Ganga arti,Ganga arti is simply a moving experience Today’s highlight was solemnisation of a wedding at d same venue along with d arti Very serene to be by d river Can keep washrooms in a better condition
See here's ganga aarti in evening,"Peaceful place ,u enjoy in daily evening aarti at parmath niketan ghat,u feel like spiritual and magical moments"
Ganga Aarti ,Shouldn't be missed! Also the very inspirational visit to the Satsang room afterwards. Very moving. Beautiful ashram grounds.
Amazing place to be in Rishikesh for Ganga Aarti,"This place is very well maintained by management. There is Ganga Aarti everyday at 5:30 PM here. You should plan accordingly so that you can witness this wonderful Aarti.Apart from that this place also provides clean water through kiosk and probably cleanest washrooms in Rishikesh. It's right there in Ram Jula main market. So, you are gonna enjoy being there!"
Wonderful Ganga Aarti,Ganga aarti at Parmarth aashram has always been a wonderful experience.The atmosphere is amazing and chanting of aarti with lamps glowing makes it very beautiful as well. The timing of aarti is 6PM everyday.
Worth a Visit,"The largest ashram in Rishikesh, if not in India with over 2,000 rooms. Across to the front is the Triveni Ghat where they hold the daily/nightly aarti ganga. It is worth a visit but if you plan to stay, make plenty of room/time to make the reservation. They get packed. You will also have to abide by the ashram life."
Site and ambience,Used to be very good once in 1982. But its ok as the development takes place. Gardens are ok and peaceful. Did not see any sage outside the building. Arti area is very good
Ganga Darshan,"The set up of the Ashram is really beautiful. Loved the way everything is so well organised, they hv a large canteen too where one can eat at lunch/ dinner or even in between tea times at very nominal rates. The Rath at the entrance to Ganga ghat is beautiful, was awed by Hanumanjis statue & Shivjis across the stairs in the Ganges. They started with a Hawan & beautiful recitation of bhajans, shlokas & then Guruji came along --- it was a wonderful sight to see such young disciples chanting along. We too were given the Arti to perform at the Ganges. Lovely experience, very Divine."
no words to explain,There is something about this place that I would like to go back to the place again very soon. Should not be missed
Surreal Aarti,Visited here to attend ganga aarti. The bhajans are very soothing. We went as a group. It's an experience to cherish.
Peacful place to visit,It's a place to visit for peace and harmony.. A blissful place there is satsang and artist every evening which one should def see it's jus worth the whole trip..
"beautiful place, just too noisy and too little ashram atmosphere","it was my second stay, ashram is beautiful, people so nice. It is just the times are changing, and the atmosphere has changed. it i more hotel type now, I missed old serving of food in silence, I missed silence in general. Now it is very busy place."
Divine Ganga Aarti,simply divine experience Aarti at Parmarth Niketan Rishikesh. you cant miss this divine experience. the kids singing. havan. swamiji changes the whole vibe at aarti. they have satsang at the ashram soon after the aarti is over. and everyone can attend.
Aarti,"Ashram and temple where the Ganga Aarti is conducted in Rishikesh, walking distance from the Ram Jhula."
A Must visit place on your rishikesh trip,The parmarth ashram is a must visit place on your rishikesh trip. Best time to visit is in the evening when the young students of the Gurukul do hanuman chalisa which is followed by Ganga aarti .
Beautiful temple ,Dun Haridwar Rishikesh belt is famous for its temples . What a wonderful atmosphere one gets here and peace of mind
"If you have never seen the hindu fire ceremony, come here ",This place is located on the ganges Bank and the ceremony takes place everydayThe amount of people that participates is hugeYou will be able to watch the the ceremony with a backdrop of a huge statue of an hindu God on the gangesThe guru comes from the Ashram which is just across the street and everybody gets excited with how his presenceBeautyful pictures at sunset
Evening Aarti @ Aashram,A beautiful location & a well organised Ganga Aarti.. The premises are neat & clean. They have a place to keep your footwear while u go to the Ghat barefoot. They have clean drinking water too..
Ganga Matha Aarthi at sunset,"Another popular location for the daily event. Full of people with music, singing hymns and truly enriching. Something to experience."
"Famous for Ganga arti, yoga and various arts made by man handmade","If you want to see best part of this temple to watch Ganga arti in the evening timing period.. with lots of lights, diya’s... morning timing period you will see most people doing yoga on this place just because you will feel yourself relaxing.. must to go there always"
An extraordinary experience for the Western man,"Being present at the ceremony during which mantras are chanted until the sun goes down below the horizon, behind Shiva's huge statue in the Ganges is special and highly recommended."
Evening Arti must do activity,It is good place for yoga lovers and religious people. Evening Aarti is must do activity. Book room in advance through their website if you want to stay in ashram. That have Ac and Non AC both rooms
EVENING AARTI,"We went for evening aarti, which is a must see event of the day. With Ganga ji flowing along side, ved mantras and all people singing aarti is very soothing."
Commercial outreach snatching the spirituality of the place,"The place in itself it just amazing, serene and spiritual but approach to it is very commercial due to which I feel the calmness of the place is getting lost somewhere. The big Shivji murti is just breath taking and you can sit besides the Ganga watching that murti for hours."
Spiritual place with commercial touch,"Old Ashram on bank of river Ganga now famous for daily evening Ganga Arti, international yoga festival. Years back it has lots of spiritual activities, lectures and visited by famous Saints and scholars. People stay here with basic facilities and nominal charges. Now with current management it's fully commercialised and have facilities and charges like a hotel even they receive lots of tax exempted donations."
Parmarth,Huge temple complex with a ghat on the river Ganga. The ghat is beautiful and very clean. The Ganga aarti in evening is an experience not to be missed.
Loosing its heritage,Going to Parmarth Niketan since childhood (35 years) regularly and seeing that it is becoming more commercial like lodge & hotels. Now you don't feel the calmness and satisfaction. Evening Ganga Aarati has converted to a marketing event to earn money.
Ganga Aarti,The Ganga Aarti here is beautiful and lifetime experience. The ghats are neat & clean. Option of stay is also available in this ashram
Ganga Arti ,"Beautiful, peaceful and nice Arti at Ganges on ghar of Parmarth Niketan ashram , lots of mantras and Arti sung by Swamis and little kids takes you to another world . You can come by boat to ghat and walking across jhula . Not to be missed"
Landmark in Rishikesh skyline!,Situated near Ram jhula is this busy but quiet ashram. It has beautiful temples of all important Hindu deities. Guides help you with detail explanation of aspects of Hindu mythology and events. Ganga Aarti at this ashram is well known and tourists and pilgrims from all over participate here. However If you are only for short trip to rishikesh don't miss the Aarti at the triveni sangam. That is somewhat like varanasi style.
"Nice, clean, quiet and safe place","Really a nice place. Pity that the yoga classes are only for the people who stay overnight there.Parmarth Niketan canteen => Certainly the last place to eat something in this area. This not a restaurant but a canteen for the pilgrims who sleep in the ashram.  There are no windows, no natural light, no air. We found the food very very average and at the same price than outside Hemadri Ayurveda CentreCertainly the best place for Ayurveda doctor and massages there - Went there twice and had a fantastic massage for 1000 Rs for one hour, with a skillfull masseur"
Beautiful experience,"What a beautiful experience it was! So lovely, peaceful (even though there were many people), very well planned. . . It was a wonderful experience for us and our daughter’s aged 9 & 5 years. Highly recommended to everybody visiting Rishikesh"
Great place to visit,"Go to the Ashram and have lunch, great value for money.  Good to walk round, join in the classes, one is made to feel most welcome."
"Peaceful place, near Ram Jhula, visit in evening to see the aarti","I went here during a morning walk, and found it to be a peaceful place, near Ram Jhula, It is a must visit in evening to see the aarti.  A place visited by many foreign dignitaries and also where people think in the ""welfare for all"""
peaceful,"don't miss the Aarti in the evening ,very neat and clean, well organised, loved the bhajans and sating conducted before the Aarti in the evening"
Parmarth Niketan,Parmarth Niketan situated in the bank of River Ganga and this Ashram was founded by Pujya Swami Shukdevanand Ji Maharaj in the year of 1942. The Ashram is the largest in the Rishikesh with over 1000 rooms.
A Most Visit,"The place was suggested by a hotel receptionist and it was one of the best things to do, I arrived before 6pm for the Aratri (Aarti) ceremony; it’s right BY the Sacred Ganga river, I saw the Most beautiful Siva statue I’ve ever seen, in fact I saw it in the internet before but I didn’t know it was HERE! The ceremony is one hour long and I suggest getting here before 6 o’clock to get a decent place, you’ll be seating on the floor or stairs. You are allowed to take photos and film. It happens in open air and there’s a safe place to store your shoes, the good man will give you a tag"
Beautiful time ,Felt blessed attending the evening arti and chants - a must!! It was crowded but the good part is that the arti thali is passed through out and enough time for everyone to hold. The Guru ji had very positive and excellent messages for the attendees which will help out earth and can educate a lot of locals and visiting devotees.
spiritual,the ashram is located near ram jhula and it is a very famous ashram in rishikesh. also evening aarti is performed
A 'Glamourized' Aarti.,"This temple and 'aarti' are tourist attractions. Lots of 'firangis', all colours and shades, a melange of cultures.Most Indians visit out of curiousity."
Parmarth niketan swargashram,A very good Hindu religious organisation ashram center on the bank of Ganga famous Hindu river at Rishikesh a must visit to all persons Beautiful murties and statues of hindu gods and famous character in vedas and puran old religious books  Parmarth ashram ved school is also important point to visit .Young rishi kumars assemble on the ganga ghat in evening to perform famous AARTI .Head of the ashram if present in Rishikesh also participate in AARTI .A very good event to attend and feel and enjoy the event a must visit for all devotee
Do not miss Parmarth Niketan,"Parmarth Niketan and its peaceful atmosphere will astound you. Beautiful cared for, an abode of nature and silence makes of this place a marvelous stay. The every evening Aarthi and sat sang were my favorite moments of communion with the inner. A beautiful way to find the joy and the peace."
Triveni Ghat is better for a Ganga Arti experience,"We went to see the ganga arti from Parmath Niketan and well it was a very okay experience. They started talking about the upcoming elections in the middle. If you're visiting Parmath for Ganga Arti, it is better if you reach at the end, say at around 6:20. You'll be just in time for the arti and can avoid the staff before. However for the Ganga Arti, Triveni Ghat is a much better option according to me."
Best place for Aarti,I must say that if you wish to plan Rishikesh and would want to do Aarti peacefully this is one place and you would fall in love with this This place offers the best Aarti with Bhajan and keertans and I am sure anyone one who visit is going to vouch for what I am been mentioning This place will be crowded free and just recheck the time of Aarti as it may change based on the season and time of the year
Nice Temple right by the Ganga,Nice Temple with direct access to the Ganga which is near by Ram Juhla.It is a beautiful and relaxing place with a great view on the Gange to the right and left. This calm an peaceful place is ideal to come to a rest and relax or meditate for a while and watch the Ganga stream by.
Fire Ceremony and Satsang,"A spiritual experience not to be missed. A traditional ceremony by the ganges, amazing and heart warming. Do not miss the Satsang after in the Temple. This is one of the places I miss most after returning home. It now holds a special place in my heart and I will be back as soon as possible. Anyone going to Rishikesh has to experience an evening there. Also the food in the canteen was great."
"A beautiful ashram, with wonderful garden ","This is one of the famously ashram in Rishikesh. There is a beautiful garden inside, and every evening they organise a ceremony above the Ganga.Lot’s of foreign artists come to play music and sing.An amazing ambiance with the sunset over the river. Don’t miss it !"
must visit,"at night ganga aarti from 5pm, we were there for International Yoga Festival 2019, love the talk, Yoga and aarti"
An interesting experience.,It is a place where people go to visit the gardens and the statues of different Indian Gods. The place is very quiet and has very agreeable vegetation and there are benches to relax and read or eat or simply see people go by.
Just another place to make money,"I had heard a lot about this place and was very hopeful to see divinity from a close quarter but was highly disappointed as the entire machinery was geared up to take money from visitors, be it in the name of aarti or stay.  Found the entire street filled with sadhus who were well bodied and still held out their hands for seeking charity"
Very good,"Situated on the bank of river Ganga ,this is a famous spot for the famous Ganga Aarti . Quite serene and peaceful spot . A few good temples here are very nice . Lots of activities keep on happening here . A must visit"
evening aarti,the most remarkable experience of visiting rishikesh is the evening ganga aarti on parmath niketan temple ghats.
Definitely a place to visit,The temple is on the side of the Ganges and is a must see. It is full of mythology and Some great statues. It is locatied next to the Ganges and is in a busy areia where there is a lot of action going on.
Peace place,"Excellent get up. Very sombre ambience. Kitchen serves very tasty food at very affordable rate to everyone. Rooms are very clean, modestly decorated and priced reasonably. Booking done on line. Popular among tourists both National and International. Gangs artist in the evening is a real crowd puller. Must stay while in Rishikesh. Provision stores are available with good stock.its one of the prestigious and famous Ashram. People from different countries came here for practice Yoga. Very religious and peaceful atmosphere .you can see holy river Ganga. Rooms available simply clean room & little expensive . Ashram atmosphere is better holy & peaceful.."
Quiet and peaceful,"The Aarti here is very beautiful, less number of people attend here, so you will be able to attend it in a better way."
Amazing experience,Very spiritual and interesting chanting on Ganga river side. We spend amazing evening and would like to come back.
Nice Place to visit,"One of the best peaceful place in Rishikesh, everyone should go there for yoga and meditation. this place is famous globally"
If you're in Rishikesh it's a must really!,Come here to watch the sun setting on the Ganga river - it is simply incredible and a fantastic way to be welcomed (and also say goodbye) to Rishikesh.
Visited Ashram during Rishikesh Stay,The ashram is the largest in Rishikesh and it works for many social causes including cleaning of Ganges river under the Namami Ganges initiative. The Ashram also has around 1000 rooms for visitors and if someone wants to stay here then they can send in the request by applying online on the ashram's website.
Spiritually motivated,"Parmarth Nikaten is very famous place of Rishikesh for spiritual activity. Yoga, Ganga darshan,Ganga Arati are main attractions. Situated on the left bank of Ganga river. Some years ago Lord Shiva statue is constructed along or in the deeply submerged area of left bank  creates beautiful view or spiritual view for meditation or worship."
A place for prayers n peace for soul on banks of river Ganges ,Just One needs to be there ....can not be explained by words ....The blessings of Maa Ganges is what one needs to be here...The Aarti is most pleasant and people of Parmarth Ashram have very nice and simple management during Aarti...one should be well on time ...
Beautiful but COLD,"Stayed at Parmath Niketan Feb 4 to Feb 8.  Beautiful grounds, excellent Aarti, room with view of Ganga.  But room was cold and drafty and dimly lit. Not particularly clean, but hey it's an ashram.  Shower has NO PRESSURE at all- hard to wash hair, took forever even for a basic shower. If someone flushes- you get scalded.  Upside?  did not run out of hot water."
