Fast stop,Easy fast stop to The Holy Cross.   15 minutes to see church and the view. Parking lot is small but turns over quickly.
must see in Sedona,The view  is breath taking of the mountains around Holy Cross. The cross it self is also well worth seeing.  Park up the hill as high as you can to reduce your walk.
"Beautiful views, religious or not",I‚Äôm going to piggy-back on another commenter who mentioned that this place feels sad. This chapel did not feel like a holy place to me‚Äî and I‚Äôve been a church-going Christian for my whole life. The space inside is small and I‚Äôm surprised there wasn‚Äôt any sort of attendant/staff there to perform any sort of crowd management during the COVID pandemic. The views from the outside are beautiful and that can be appreciated whether or not you are religious. It‚Äôs a free visit and worth a quick trip. We visited at the end of the day and 30 minutes was all we needed.
Interesting ,"This chapel is a popular stop in Sedona.  It is not as large as pictures make it appear, but it is an amazing structure nonetheless."
What A View.,"A little bit of a short, steep hike up for a Senior, but go slow because it is a spectacular view. Take a moment to sit in the chapel for some quiet time. God is close."
Some sadness here,Can't put my finger on it. This structure is cool. It felt spiritually malnourished. Crowded over visited. They neighborhood is overbuilt. I felt sad when I left it.
Worth a visit but not on a weekend!,"This is a special little chapel built into the rocks, but it is absolutely packed on the weekends. People were parking almost a mile away. I would definitely recommend a stop here - but make it on a week day if possible!"
Beautiful day for a walk to a stunning church,"We were told this was a don‚Äôt miss, the outside is beautiful and inside too.  Parking was rough and the walk is all up hill. Wearing masks, due to COVID makes it a little harder to walk in the heat. Great pictures were taken and I would recommend"
Wonderful place!,"Place is great to visit, inside and out. Highly recommend. Only thing a bit crazy was the turn around at the top, should find a better way, especially with trolleys, not sure how they did  the turn but did."
Outstanding view,The view at chapel of the holy cross was outstanding. A very spiritual experience meditating in the chapel.
Nice little excursion,"It definitely is a sight to see. We went in the morning as some other reviewers stated it's the best time parking-wise. And so it was. We didn't find parking on the way up but shortly after we turned around to go back down. The way to the chapel is a little bit up the hill but nothing really strenuous. Aside from the chapel which is unique and beautiful, the view down into the valley is very picturesque as well. Saw a mansion with its own waterfall while looking down. Took pictures of that too. Everything very nice and absolutely worth a trip. Thumbs up."
The Beauty of it all. . .,Not much available but the view is all that it takes to enjoy this little rest spot in God's house. Got very close to the rock canyon and the views are breath taking. Went inside and lite some candles for the Family and Friends. May ALL feel the peace and Love of this church.
"Pretty views, no hiking required","If you don‚Äôt want to hike our climb, this is a great place to come for the views. You can see a lot of different angles from here and it is beautiful. The Catholic Church is also beautiful but worth going even if it is not open. We enjoyed it. Convenient to Cathedral Rock."
Beautiful ,"Quick trip that everyone should make. The chapel is small but so powerful. Grab a brochure and read and really take a look at the statue. So peaceful, powerful and beautiful."
Iconic Structure and Free Photo Op,"Easy to find and easy to walk up the ramp to the chapel.  It is in an upscale neighborhood with beautiful views and a lovely interior.  The explanation of all the symbolism on the crucifix is interesting.  Opens at 9 am, NOT 10 am as I was told at the resort where we stayed.  It is the gift shop that opens at 10am."
free    You get a great view of the red rocks,Fantastic Cross with Jesus   The most ornate and artistic I have seen Ever!!!  Some have to park lower at hill.....I saw a handicapped person and assistant trying to get up the hill.....It didnt look very handicap freindly but there are workarounds   Perhaps drive to top and let that person out..   Small gift store down stairs.
Impressive,One of the most unique chapels I've seen and with amazing views.  I was so glad we got there before it closed at 5 PM.
Beautiful ,Quiet reflective moment well worth the stop üôè. Church is peaceful and serene feeling blessed!  üôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè
beatiful chapel and view,"It is a lovely, serene chapel with a wonderful view of the surrounding Red Rocks. It can get crowded for parking. God early."
Amazing to see the chapel cut into the rock,I was amazed to see the chapel carved into the red rock.  Coming closer it was nice to go inside and tour the chapel.  If you are Christian/Spiritual you will enjoy this stop.
Very Spiritual Visit,The chapel was beautiful. The crucifix inside the chapel was beautiful and spiritually mesmerizing. Wonderful visit!
Did a drive by visit,It was a hot day but we wanted to see this wonder so we didn‚Äôt park but saw it from below and next door as we drove around. Very neat structure out in the desert. Easy to get to from the main road.
Chapel of the Holy Cross,A great Christian place to visit. We highly recommend this stop during your stay. Very close to Creekside Inn
A truly Sedona spiritual  experience,"So glad we took the time to travel up to this incredible and peaceful space.  The chapel was not only beautiful but inspirational as well.  Make sure that you take the time to enter the chapel.  Found people to be thoughtful of others and their experiences there. Hint, the highest parking is for handicap, but there is parking above the bottom lot if you go early."
A great experience at the Holy Cross Chaple,"Chapel of the Holy Cross has a great view. But the most important is the Holiness of the place, It is a small chapel on the rock. However it is architectonically gorgeous!! It has two small beautiful fountains outside. What I liked the most is that it a christian worshiping place. Although it is managed by the Catholic church, it was built for the worshiping God by any christian denomination. It is just about Jesus and you! It is place to visit because it is a landmark in Sedona, but also for it holiness. From there you can see also three picks on side mountains that look like MAry and the Baby Jesus , kind of the holy family in the rock. IT IS GORGEOUS.   You can take the trolley or go by yourself oun you own car. It is free. But remember to give a donation so they can keep that gorgeous place open."
"Perfect spot to see the area, pray and hit a gift store",So beautiful!  Gift cart help was nice as I am on crutches.  Can go to the church and not feel rushed (I did a a Rosary.).
"A Beautiful Church, View and Story ","First off.... please be respectful... this is a church. The builder wanted to share it with everyone... but it is a holy place.  The story is of a lifetime dream that became a reality in the 1950‚Äôs. Built into the red stone Sedona mountain with the enormous Holy Cross and inside Christ looking down upon you. Take time to read the story to the left of the entry doors. Also, silence your phone Enjoy this extraordinary church ‚õ™Ô∏è"
Well worth the trip. ,Beautiful church and an amazing view.   Easy access.  Watch time though as they do not open until 9am.  We were a little early and had to wait outside the gate.
Beautiful!,This is a beautiful structure and a great story on how it was created. As soon as I walked in I was filled with the Holy Spirit. But even if you are not a religious person it is well worth the trip and the views are beautiful. It will only take 10-15 minutes out of your life so take the time to see it. You will be impressed.
Breathtaking views,We parked at the very bottom and hiked up.  Nice jaunt up the hill.  The chapel is beautiful.  The views outdoors are incredible.  Stopped there on our way to Sedona and was a fantastic spot to start our vacation.
Chapel of the Holy Cross,Very nice church. Make sure you read the history of the church so that you will fully understand. Hopefully you can get a parking spot at the top or you may have a nice walk instead.
Refreshing,This place is it to get your chaka in line. Come get your blessing and leave refreshed. This is a must visit.
Visit during the week when it's slow and when you can visit without a lot of folks.,"Don't go on a weekend!  I've been before and not on a weekend which we were able to visit the Chapel which was beautiful!  This day was not and completely our fault as we wanted to visit on our way out of town.  The parking is very limited and on a dead end making it tricky to turn around on a busy day.  But don't let me discourage you to go, just a warning on when not to go.  It's along the Scenic Highway which is beautiful."
Denise V,Such a beautiful place to visit and certainly worth the drive. Peaceful!  It‚Äôs uphill walk to get there but there‚Äôs golf cart drivers that will assist.  Highly recommend
A Sacred Moment; An Amazing Setting,This is such a unique and beautiful Chapel with magnificent views.  Definitely worth the stop!  We visited on an overcast day at around 4 pm....it was breathtaking.
Nice views of the area,"This is a quick thirty minute stop , at most, if you‚Äôre in the area. You have to walk up a steep hill to reach the church, but the views are worth it. The church is small but the crucifix is spectacular."
Amazing views,Great spot with amazing views .  A must see in Sedona. Can't wait to go again!  We went in the early morning to beat the heat.
Beautiful!,"This is a must see when in Sedona!! My second visit. Beautiful chapel, beautiful views! Great spot for photos!"
Beautiful ,The chapel was built in a fabulous space. Make sure you ask about the two nuns and the Madonna and child.  Beautiful crucifix! Friendly staff. Make sure you visit the gift shop.
Beautiful,This place is stunning! Very peaceful and the inside is amazing.  Would love to go back someday in the future.
A must see!,Amazing architecture and spectacular views. Millions of people visit this chapel annually! Must see!
Spiritual,"We stop by here every visit to Sedona.  This latest time was on a Wednesday afternoon and we actually got parking up top!  On weekends, it tends to get busy you often have to park at the very bottom and walk along the road up to the top.  Our last visit was in 2014 and they've gotten a new addition to the interior - a statue of Jesus on the cross on the window inside.  The gift shop downstairs was limiting visitors due to COVID-19 and masks are required.  Please be respectful.  This is still a church.  Please take your hats off inside and be quiet."
Must see,"This is a beautiful must see chapel. We arrived shortly after the park opened about 9:05 on a Saturday and was delighted to find a parking spot. The outside grounds are dog friendly and there are beautiful views of so many rocks! There are no entry fees to this chapel. A small warning though if you have small children, beware as there are no guard rails...just low seating around the top. However, the main attraction is the chapel. Just walking in feels very serene. There is beautiful artwork along the walls and prayer candles for a $5 donation. I recommend making the donation, lighting a candle and saying a prayer."
Beautiful!,This is such a special and amazing place. We are so glad we went. Short walk up a ramp. Don‚Äôt worry. It‚Äôs worth it.
Very special Church ,"This church is breathtaking from the moment you arrive, as you walk up the hill admiring the the architectural designs but as soon as you enter the chapel you will see how special this church is. A must when in Sedona"
Favorite church in America ,I came here with my grandparents years ago and I go every time I'm in Sedona. It's breath taking. This was the 1st time I visited the gift shop.
Chapel of the Holy Cross,It is a beautiful church with a breathtaking view! We were able to visit by taking the Sedona trolley tour. It was a week day so it was not overcrowded. What a peaceful feeling! I would certainly go again.
Breath Taking,Beautiful church in a stunning environment.   Easy to get to but could see it busy on the weekends.Great overlooks of the Sedona hills.The church is small but really cool.  Check it out.
Beautiful Catholic Chapel built into Lovely Mountainside,"This Catholic Chapel is a fantastic spectacle; with colouring the same as the surrounding rock, and is nestled directly in between two towering peaks.  The valley and mountainside surrounding make the entire experience a must-see."
Amazing,This chapel is an amazing in location and architectural design.  Looks like a Frank Lloyd Wright design.  Small but very touching.
Worth the stop!,The neatest church I've been to in the United States. It's really quite beautiful. Parking is limited so I recommend going early. It's a short walk up a hill that is not difficult but maybe some older folks will have to do it slowly. It's definitely worth it!
Sedona Experience,"The View of course! Stunning, breath taking, cleansing to the soul. Pictures do not do this place justice!"
Breathtaking Views,"This was a last minute decision to stop here and we were not disappointed...it is just a few minutes off the road through a neighborhood. Parking isn't the best and can require a short uphill walk unless you have Handicap parking privileges. Once parked, you will take a short walk up a ramp-like walkway that ends at the entrance of the chapel. The views from the inside are beautiful. and the red rock views as you walk up the ramp seems so ""up close and personal"". Donations are accepted. There is a Gift Shop below the Chapel but was closed when we arrived. Can't believe how many times I have visited Sedona and never stopped but should of."
Arizona Trip,This was closed when we went but it was still beautiful to see. It is not far off the main road and I'm sure it was beautiful on the inside to see.
Breathtaking Views,"We went with my three and a half year old and my dad who is in his 60‚Äôs. Very short climb up a ramp to access the chapel which was beautiful. Even prettier were the views from all sides of the chapel. Beautiful, free (donations accepted), and family friendly."
Must do when in Sedona,"This is  must do when in Sedona, lovely little chapel built into the rocks  with amazing views , good to see everyone practicing  the social  distancing rules as well"
A beautiful and spiritual Sedona landmark,The Chapel of the Holy Cross is a beautiful landmark whatever your religious affiliation.  My husband is Catholic and I am Mormon/LDS and it is just a wonderful escape from the world to visit the chapel and the gift shop.  A beautiful view as well.
A magical experience nestled in the  mountainside.,Not far from Sedona is a magnificent chapel of the Holy Cross.  The setting is perfect and the views from the chapel are awesome!
Breathtaking,"No stop in Sedona is complete without a visit to the Chapel.  It is moving and the views are breathtaking.  Face masks were required to enter, which I was glad to see."
chapel,This is very tiny and a little overrated. It was on our way back to our hotel though from a hike so it was convenient to go here. I would not go out of your way though otherwise.
TN visitors amazed,The sites were breathtaking. Walking in and seeing the outstanding craftsmanship and detail of Jesus on the Cross was really touching. The gift shop was difficult to access and limited I guess due to COVID 19. I didn‚Äôt spend a lot of time here but long enough to appreciate the site. The location was easy to access and it‚Äôs hard to believe such an amazing site is still that close to town.
Chapel of the Holy Cross,"Sitting high atop the red rocks in Sedona Arizona, the Chapel of the Holy Church is a spiritual location inspired by local rancher and sculptor Marguerite Brunswig Staude. The Christian monument is attractive to people of all denominations who come to offer prayers and praises, and marvel at the buildings distinctive architecture and panoramic vistas. Sedona is well known for its connection to new-age mysticism and energy vortices on the outskirts of the city. The architectural landmark is a ""must see"" with many non-religious visitors describing their trek up the red red rocks as a spiritual event."
Must see,If you‚Äôre in Sedona this is a must see. The history behind the chapel is interesting and the views are amazing. Parking can be an issue sometimes.
Holy Cross ,"The Chapel of the Holy Cross, sitting high atop the red rocks in Sedona, Arizona, was inspired and commissioned by local rancher and sculptor Marguerite Brunswig Staude.The Chapel of the Holy Cross¬†is a Roman Catholic Chapel built into the¬†buttes of¬†Sedona, Arizona.Although the 90-foot cross on¬†its facade makes the Chapel of the Holy Cross a distinctly Christian monument, visitors without an interest in religion often describe their trek up the red rocks as a spiritual event.The Chapel is located in the heart of what many describe as a vortex bringing gratitude to those who flock there."
Powerful,"One of the prettiest little chapels I have ever seen.  Amazing views.  Limited parking, but I believe they have a golf cart available for anybody that needs assistance walking up the hill"
A Must see ,Absolutely stunning & breathtaking. And If you look down you can see the house of the creator of LASIK eye surgery.
Church ,There was a very small crowd. Parking was easy to come by. Great building. Nice feel to it. Dramatic crucifix.
Words do not express...,"Just absolutely stunning...the drive, the chapel, the views...but nothing more stunning than the crucifix of our Lord."
Heaven Sent,"The breathtaking view from all areas and of course,the gorgeous chapel itself!! It truly is so beautiful"
Scenic adventure!,"Beautiful scenery. We loved the entire area!!! A little costly to stay in Sedona, but very much worth it!"
Wonderful Experience ,A great place to visit when you are in the Sedona area. Very quiet and spiritual place to be and have quiet time with God. Absolutely breathtaking.
Amazing pitstop ,"Beautiful small chapel with amazing views of the red rocks surrounding.  Quick visit, easy to access, in and out in 30 minutes"
Don't miss this scenic/peaceful place !,Chapel built into the red rocks with a uniquely carved cross. Very prayerful and serene but also somehow quaint. Worth the side trip !
Meditative Beauty,"This is a well maintained tourist site.  The chapel's architecture is tastefully elegant and doesn't detract from the natural beauty of the rock's form.  The chapel meditative, the gardens are well done, the gift shop has reasonable prices and good amount of items.  The driveway is steep to walk, if you have physical limitations you can be driven almost to the entrance.  The turn around in the drive at the top can be tight.  There are excellent panoramic views all around the chapel entrance area."
Worth the trip,"While in Sedona, we decided to visit the chapel.  How beautiful! Altough with COVID restrictions, we couldn't enter without masks, we were still able to enjoy the interior from a distance. Felt peaceful and serene. Great view too."
Spiritual,What a special place...  third time to go and finally found it open (COVID19). Prepare for a uphill walk that may be challenging.
A truly beautiful structure,"Not only is this church a beautiful structure to behold both inside and out, but the views from all around are spectacular."
Sedona,Beautiful scenery  easy to get toSmall parking lot with shuttle to the chapel makes it easy to get toOr you can walk up the hillAmazing viewsVery spiritualI would highly recommend visitingChapel is really a beautiful building with great stained glass
Calm and peaceful,Amazing architecture gracefully executed with a spectacular view. Sit a while inside the chapel to enjoy the peaceful environment.
"Beautiful chapel, worth checking out",The chapel was much smaller than I had expected? Pictures always made it look larger. It was however still worth it. It's a beautiful place as well as able to check out the 40 million dollar mansion at the base of it.
Breathtaking,Breathtaking and beautiful view.  Peaceful inside. Worth the visit.  Definitely a must stop in Sedona. The chapel and the crucified Christ sculpture are absolutely beautiful and the detail is unbelievable. It is a great place to meditate.
Very unique chapel,This chapel is very popular and is often a place people will stop in when visiting from out of town. It is very unique in that it sits amongst the surrounding red rock formations which is unlike any other place. The chapel blends in perfectly to the environment and this road leading to it just adds that much more to the scene. Because of the popularity of the chapel you need to get there early when they first open the gates or towards the end of the day right before it clears out. There is very limited parking in the chapel lot and the surrounding area does not have any parking as it is private residence. We suggest stopping here right when they open as you may be able to see some fog rolling out in the colder months which adds an additional layer of mystique. It is also nearby a lot of hikes so it‚Äôs an easy stop along the way to hiking or exploring what else Sedona has to offer!- @wanderingwithustwo
Popular Tour,"We tried to visit the Chapel one afternoon, and after waiting in a line of cars for a parking spot for about 15 minutes, we gave up and went early the next morning.  We zipped right into one of the closest spots then.  Go early!"
Beautiful,"moving experience to enter this beautiful building, as a Catholic it resonated with my it is very small, very as the French say ""impressionante"""
Stunning but busy,"Gorgeous building, even if you're not religious. No bathrooms though, so go before you get there. Gift shop is also lovely."
Chapel of the Holy Cross,What a breathtaking place.  Absolutely a must go to when visiting Sedona.  Just a short drive from uptown with so many stunning sites!
Awesome view,"I was interested in this site, but I was more interested in hiking. Glad I stopped, though. We found a parking spot on a busy day, and the view is amazing as well as the chapel itself. Long walk from the bottom."
Uniquely beautiful,"Stunning, yet simple architecture built right into the Sedona red rock, if not looking for it, easy to overlook, obviously everyone and their brother know of it, traffic can be overwhelming as parking is definitely hard to come by. Might be better to hike the Little Horse trail to the Chapel trail and make this a real adventure, enjoy."
Simply beautiful ,The simple beauty of the Chapel is surrounded by God‚Äôs glory - The amazing view of the red rocks. Right off 179 easy to get to. Don‚Äôt pass up this beautiful place.
Absolutely Stunning,"This is a short trip up the hill (either by walking or by riding a golf cart) to an absolutely stunning chapel. There is no fee to be up there, unless you take the golf cart and wish to trip the driver. I could have stood there for hours. Just beautiful. I think there could be more signage to explain how the church came to the built there - we got a crash course from our golf cart driver - but also this is a church, a free place to sight see at, so I'm not complaining."
Amazing ,"So glad we had the opportunity to visit today. So beautiful and serene. My husband and I both had tears when we left, especially in light of current events. Just FYI, they are shutting down after today. "
Beauty,We were I. The area exploring the magnificent sights of this area.  You won‚Äôt be disappointed visiting this area.  I strongly recommend driving the residential streets in the area for beautiful photo opportunities. 
Beautiful church in unique setting,Gorgeous church!   Helps one feel the grandeur of God‚Äôs creation!  Must see.  Go early small parking lot fills up quick. 
very nice,we loved this place/ the views are fantastic took lots of pics / it was a very nice place to visit / we will be coming back next time we are in sedona
Truely inspiring!,The chapel was our first stop on our trip to Sedona. Awe inspiring! Visitors were very respectful as they entered the chapel. The gift shop downstairs had a wide range of religious goods to purchase. The scenery was breathtaking in all directions. 
Spectacular Site and Views!,"After a great day of exploring, we took a detour and drove up to the Chapel of the Holy Cross. It's an incredible building, and the Chapel's staff does an excellent job of handling the daily (hourly?) influx of visitors. We were there mid-week, so I can't comment on weekend crowds or holding services.If you're not inspired by the chapel or the immediate grounds, then take a look at the surrounding beauty of Sedona's red rocks. The cliffs are almost close enough to touch.Two quick notes: (1) Either go first thing in the morning (check the Chapel's schedule) or go late in the afternoon. The crowds seem to thin-out before a second wave shows up for sunset. (2) Park towards the bottom of the road - not in the neighborhood - and utilize the Chapel's golf-cart (taxi) service. The drivers are friendly and provide you with additional tidbits about the Chapel and Sedona."
Spiritual and spectacular,This is a must see for not only it's beautiful backdrop but the strong spiritual feel. There is parking along the road and if you drive up the winding road you can find parking up top of you're lucky. Just an all around beautiful place.
A must see and an easy visit for those less physically prepared,Perfect fill in or extra sight to see after a tough hike and before the relaxation starts. Easy to get to and provides picture perfect architecture and Sedona red.
worth the drive and wait,"by driving in the rain , it was somewhat of a challenge, but very well worth the experience. There were carts that were available to help with the walky to the entrance, One spot that cannot be missed"
Most unusual church,"Brilliantly conceived, built between two mountains! Well worth the uphill walk to view this small church, with lovely views"
cool visit,"great spot to check out, views were great, nice and quiet and respectful inside the church. shop was downstairs. wish the drive up was open at sunset, probably would have a great view. great place to stop and see."
Stunning!,"This is an easy ""must-see"" in Sedona. I suggest parking at the bottom of the hill and walking up to see the chapel. The views are stunning. We did this after our Cathedral Rock hike so it was fun to look over to where we had just hiked. The crucifix hanging in the window overlooking the red rocks is breathtaking."
A Sedona must!,Just breathtaking.  I can't believe someone made this happen. Limited parking. This chapel was made to be in this location.
"Beautiful Chapel, incredible views","You can drive up to the chapel and walk up the steep incline or they can provide a shuttle for those who are not able to.  Once at the chapel the views are amazing.  The chapel itself is beautiful with amazing stained glass windows and  pews, where you can reflect and pray and also has candles you can light for loved ones."
Chapel,Very nice and peaceful place. Have been here several times over the years. Parking can be a bit challenging but they do have golf cart shuttles to help out people.
Must See!,Beautiful church with beautiful views. A definite must see when in Sedona. Parking is a little crazy here. We lucked out and got a spot near the top just as someone was leaving.
Beautiful ,"Parking is tough but there are folks to help direct, be patient and you‚Äôll eventually park. A pretty good walk up a fairly steep incline. Seems many folks were spiritually overwhelmed and were having quite deep feelings inside the church. Surrounded by the beautiful rocks so very picturesque. Inside there is a huge art piece, I think bronze, of Jesus on the cross. Many tours stop here, I‚Äôm glad I went."
Ruined by a change,"The Chapel of the Holy Cross has been a beautiful, simple and tasteful landmark in the increasingly commercialized town of Sedona.  On a recent visit, we were horrified to find that the basic cross, acting as a main support of the building and the primary sign of a Christian faith, has been totally ruined by a huge,  ghastly crucifix.  M. Brunswig-Staude and others who worked hard to create this remarkable building must be turning in their grave  at the sight of this ruinous addition."
Simply beautiful!,"When you are in Sedona this is a must visit it doesn't matter your religious beliefs the beautiful in the crucifix is so detailed it takes your breath away!! I visited 3 years ago and the lady of Mercy painting was not there and I love this beautiful modern painting of the Virgin Mary! The gift shop had allot of their own gifts which I love one of a kid limited items, very nice cashier answered all of our questions about the church!"
A MustVisit,"When traveling to Sedona, the chapel is a must visit. The chapel and crucifix are awesome to see. The views from up there overlooking Sedona are beautiful! They were some of the best pictures we took while we visited the Sedona area."
"Beautiful, solemn,  stunning",This is a gorgeous place. It can be enjoyed in s short visit and should be seen during any visit to Sedona.
Crucifix was amazing.,A et of a walk uphill but worth it.  We drove to the top before we parked and found a place to park near the chapel.  Beautiful views and chapel.
Not to miss,"Wether your religious or not, it is amazing to see this. A chapel built into the rock, you can go in and visit. Views from here are breathtaking."
Beautiful views,"This is owned by the Catholic Church, but anyone can visit. It isn't a formal church, but a chapel for contemplation. Outside the views are fantastic and worth the trip. There's also a store in the basement where you can buy religious related items."
Duval Brothers Sedona trip,Place was very busy and crowded with visitors but worth the experience            (weekend )..Time to meditate and reflect ..great views and excellent weather ...  walking up a very long hill but paved ... Family and friends would enjoy it ...the great outdoors ...
Beautiful Chapel,"The Chapel of the Holy Cross is stunning.  Awesome views, very peaceful.  Be patient with parking - the visit can be fairly quick - but worth it.  Very easy to find."
Beautiful place,"Quick stop - maybe 45 min? - the longest was spent looking for a parking place- some down below and some up top, you just circle around and come back, people directing traffic were helpful. We walked from below, a little steep, person with knee issues in our group ended up getting a ride back down in the golf cart option. Worked well. Totally worth it for the views and the chapel is so beautiful. Don‚Äôt miss it!"
Very cool indeed!,"Awesome views, very peaceful, light a candle for a loved one and they have a really nice gift shop inside also :-)"
Chapel of the Holy Cross ,Easy to find right off the Red Rock scenic byway the Chapel of the Holy Cross is a must see. The Chapel sits high on a cliff but they have volunteers giving rides in golf carts to the Chapel and the scenery all around you is beautiful. You eill also see praying hands rock and Mother with child rock.
Beautiful!!,"Really glad we went to see this chapel.  It is gorgeous and the views are amazing.  Use care when driving, it is a tight road but they have people directing the traffic to help with that."
Crazy crazy crazy,I would highly recommend getting here very early or maybe late? Luckily we rode our bikes here via a mountain bike trail. Lines and lines of people trying to park. Mobs of people. Not for me. Plenty of other places to visit without all of the craziness.
A Chapel with a view,This was my 2nd time visit the chapel;; nice architecture with a breathtaking view of Cathedral Rock in distance.
"Gorgeous from the outside, inside not worth the effort of parking","The exterior of this church is amazing, but parking is difficult, we had to wait for a spot and walk, then the inside is a bit of a letdown (with the same view as our parking spot)."
A must see while in Sedona,"Visited the chapel while in Sedona.  Chapel is so beautiful.  What a great place to take a moment to pay homage.  One word of caution... it‚Äôs a steep windy walkway to the chapel.  While we were there though, free rides in a golf cart were being offered."
Nice viewing spot,This small chapel built into the mountain has a wonderful viewing area at the top of a hill. The interior of the chapel is very modern.
Beautiful view. Beautiful chapel. ,"Definitely a must see for the view. The chapel is beautiful as well. Beware parking can be limited and a tight fit when busy, but the chapel does have some folks with golf carts to give visitors rides up/down the hill. (We tipped our driver.) Also there are no public bathrooms at the Chapel. So go before. Otherwise your option is a port-a-john by one parking lot. I would advise getting there early when they open. The gift shop is nice, and please don‚Äôt take photos in the shop. (There are signs posted asking folks not to but I still saw several people whipping out their cell phones at every corner.)"
Magnificent ,"They added a cross in 2018. If you haven‚Äôt seen it, it is worth a stop. They do shuttle you from car to church. Handicap accessible. Views are breath taking. They close at 5."
Beautiful.. absolutely beautiful,We parked down at the bottom of the hill then walked half way up before catching a ride on the go carts that go back and forth from the parking lot to the church. The sight is unlike anything you will ever see.
Arizona road trip,Much of Sedona area has fabulous vistas with hiking trails & this is one includes a unique chapel in addition to a lovely place to view Mother Nature‚Äôs beauty!
Beautiful Church and Views,The views are breathtaking and vast. Light a candle in the chapel or visit the gift shop downstairs. This is a fairly modern church from the 50s so there isn't ancient history here but still worth the visit. This isn't a must-see but it's so easy to see that you might as well go. It offers spectacular views with a cozy little church situated within the red rock.
Awe Inspiring,This beautiful chapel took my breath away.  The sites are amazing and the chapel allows for reverent prayers.
Lovely setting amongst the red rocks,"Its worth a stop at this chapel on the hill, but in the afternoon plan on visiting with lots of other people.  Parking is limited unless you want to walk up a short but steep hill.  It‚Äôs lovely to sit for a few minutes in the quiet of the chapel, then exit for a round of picture taking."
Calmness in a crowd,"We expected the chapel to be larger as it looks very large from pictures and as you approach. We arrived to fins many cars already parked and had concerns about the drive, parking and walk as my husband wears ankle braces and I have cancer. We were able to find parking and a volunteer immediately showed up in a golf cart to transport us to the ramp leading in. Although there were many people as we approached the entrance people were quiet and inside I could sit and pray although there were many picture takers. I none the less felt as if I was the only person there and in fact most people did not sit down or go down the small aisle. Made for a very pleasant experience."
Beautiful church,We stopped by and did the trail up to chicken point. Beautiful church. The parking lot does fill fast. We parked rown the road as we were going on the trail.
"Super pretty place, well worth the visit","I was there on a rainy day, and it was just lovely.  It's easy to find, and the surroundings are beautiful.  The chapel itself is a nice place to sit quietly and say a prayer.   The gift shop is wonderful and I bought quite a few things for friends and family back home."
Chapel of the Holy Cross,A must see architecturally and spiritually. Built into the redrock as its foundation creates a sprawling view of the surrounding enviorment.
Beautiful,Beautiful chapel. Wish the people outside were more reverent. It would have made it so much better. Still worth going too.
"Beautiful, Peaceful Chapel","We stopped by the Chapel of the Holy Cross as we had seen photos and it looked beautiful. It is quite beautiful but smaller than I thought. Parking is difficult with several small lots all the way up to the base of the Chapel. Although we went on a Thursday morning in February, most spots were full. It‚Äôs a short walk up to the Chapel and there are many places to take pictures overlooking the Sedona area. The chapel itself is worth a visit but it doesn‚Äôt take long as there‚Äôs not too much to do.  The best pictures are from below the chapel, alongside the road."
Awe inspiring,The beautiful architect and the Arizona vistas are worth the stop. An added bonus is A magnificent view of Cathedral Rock and Bell Rock.
Worth a look,I'm not a religious sort but this place could change that - Beautiful building and cross - free cart rides up the hill were a nice touch.
Lovely,Beautiful chapel and worth the quick stop. Lots of people but not so crowded that we felt impeded. Beautiful view from the top and outside the chapel.
Must see in Sedona ,"Don‚Äôt miss this stop while in Sedona. It‚Äôs a long walk to the top, so try to drive up if you can.  Or get lucky like we did and get a ride in the golf cart. The setting of the chapel is awe inspiring and it has a very interesting history as well."
Stop and see this cool chapel up high in the rocks,"Special modern chapel in the red rocks. Beautiful views and no fee. Not a long or steep walk, parking close by."
"Very Simple, But Dramatic","parking is difficult. the way up is steep. but the view of the area and the chapel itself is worth the effort. Park on the flats before the driveway and wait for one of the two golf carts for transport. Be sure to tip, properly."
Extraordinary views!,We stopped at the Chapel on our way out of town. What a beautiful spot! The views are stunning. The space is very spiritual. Well worth the trip!
Thankful it's free!,"The chapel itself is cute and sweet. Nothing particularly jaw dropping though. However, this tourist destination is a must see because 1) it's actually free so why not? And 2) the view from just outside the chapel is breathtaking and you'll get some great photos out of it."
Holiday ,Amazing Holy Chapel on the sacred red rocks just a little out side sedona town well worth a visit many visitors from around the world üôè
Beautiful view,The view is beautiful. You can see a long ways. The chapel is quaint.  There is a little shop beneath the Chapel where you can find many nice treasures.
Chapel,My wife enjoyed the chapel very much.  Beautiful and quaint at the same time.  Then we did the one mile out and back hike which was a great enjoyable hike.
Awesome,"This is a must see if you are in the Sedona area.  The Chapel is awesome and you must go inside.  They have golf carts to take you up the hill from the parking area if you need assistance.  Parking is a problem as it is at most places especially on the weekends.  The mountain behind is incredible.  Look for the eagle, mushrooms and the mitten.  Just a great site."
Stunning!!,"Such a beautiful church incorporated right into the gorgeous scenery. It was very crowded on a sunny Saturday, but they had people directing traffic and it all went well. Definitely worth a visit, even with the crowds."
Phenomenal Views,If you can get a parking spot this is a must see. The views from the chapel are breathtaking. You‚Äôll have to walk up a pretty steep hill or the volunteers can give you a ride up in a golf cart. The chapel itself is small but beautiful.
Going to Church,"Very nice church built in the rocks of Sedona.  This is a great free thing to do.  On way in to town from Oak Creek, worth the visitüòé"
Best at sunset,"After visiting the chapel, it became obvious that sun glows on the red rocks are absolutely blazing in red colors! Must see! Beautful architecture, great church to meditate and prayers."
Great Location,Beautiful location amongst the red cliffs and a wonderful view. There is limited parking on the road up the hill but golf carts offer rides for free to those who want it.
A must see stop,"A truly inspiring site - no matter your religious preference, it is a place of reverence and awe. Best to go early since parking is at a premium."
A very calm place ,"I felt blessed to have an opportunity to visit. It‚Äôs awesome view, awesome calmness in the air. Take some time to sit in the church to enjoy the ambience."
So incredibly beautiful.,I lit a votive in memory of my beautiful precious friend Ashley. I felt the presence of God here. I was overcome with emotion while in awe by the beauty yet felt completely at peace. It is such an incredible sight that everyone must see with his own eyes.
Must see,Stunning views.  You can drive most of the way up to the Chapel.  Then a nice walkway takes you the rest of the way.  Chapel is simple but beautiful.  You can light a candle in memory of someone for a small donation.
Spirit in the Rocks,"This is always a wonderful experience although best time to go is early before too many people are here.  It can get busy, and the walk is a bit steep.  There are accommodations for those who need assistance.  I like to sit in the chapel."
Stunning Spiritual Sedona!,"Nestled into the side of a red rock formation, the Chapel of the Holy Cross is well worth the visit (and the walk up from the parking lot). It is an active Catholic Church, but visitors are quite welcome. I'm not even Christian, and I found this place to be filled with the Holy Spirit. The gift shop underneath the chapel has very nice religious items ranging from inexpensive gifts to pricey art."
Beautiful but Busy,"The location is beautiful. The chapel itself is far less ornate than one would expect from a catholic establishment, but that‚Äôs because the natural beauty that the chapel highlights is the focus. This is a must do in Sedona, which means it is a fairly busy attraction."
Part of Redrock Magic Tour,Very inspiring. Beautiful views. A must see in Sedona and don't miss the gift shop downstairs. You will feel a magic spirit.
Easy to get to Great view,This was a busy day. Even with all the cars going up the hill it was easy to find a parking spot. To jump out of the car and take advantage of this breathtaking view. But you must be aware of the hours.
Vacation ,This was a defining moment in our visit to Sedona. Beautiful and uplifting.  A must see for all ages.
Wow! A must see in Sedona. ,The chapel is not active. It is only for visitors. It has a gift shop. There is also a really cool story behind how the chapel came to be.  There are so many picturesque scenes surrounding it. The mansion that you see on the overlook was and may still be owned by the man who invented lasik surgery according to our tour guide. Take your time and take it all in. You will be blessed.
Beautiful and complete views,"What a beautiful way to capture the various rock formations. And for those who have to walk up to the church, the church provides assistance with small golf carts with knowledgeable and friendly drivers."
Beautiful stop,"More of a tourist stop, but the view is beautiful from the top.  Busy, limited parking, short walk uphill to visit. No more than a 10 minute stop."
Sedona attraction,"Hard to miss. When in Sedona you always seem to be looking at the orange colored mountians, there so beautiful. Whine doing that we seen the chapel. We searched it out and found it.  We didn't know at first it was a tourist attraction. It's apparent when you get close because of the crowd it pulls in. I didn't climb the walkway up to see it, I just wasn't that interested. I can see where it would interest some seeing that it is built into the mountainside."
Unbelievable Architecture,Architecture that is indescribable and absolutely breath-taking.A must see church built in and on the rock!Truly a structure of Truth and Love!
Meditative atmosphere ,Beautiful setting and the construction of the chapel must have been something to behold. Really appreciated the quiet inside the chapel and it was a nice place to stop and reflect. Views from around it very pretty
Breath taking views,It's easy to feel the peaceful high energy here and the views are awesome ... don't forget your camera!
Lovely memorial to the parents of the donor,This is for all faiths even though the builder was Catholic.  It has nice views and is worth seeing.  It is a photo opportunity.
AWESOME!,Absolutely loved our visit; awe inspiring views and peaceful serenity.  The complimentary golf cart ride (tips appreciated) is a wonderful bonus for those with mobility issues or seniors although the privilege seemed to be available to everyone.  We visited around 11 am on a Monday and had no trouble finding parking.  Nice gift shop with lots of religious options but also beautiful note cards and postcards.  Good idea to check out the postcards for ideas/information.  Without them I would have missed the eagles overlooking the chapel.  The beautiful home in the foreground is for sale for a mere $28 MILLION!
Unexpected,An unexpected chapel in an unexpected location.  Fascinating architecture and history.  Magnificent views.  Stop an visit this place.  It‚Äôs worth your time.
An amazing place with an amazing view.,"While there are several natural wonders to behold while in Sedona, this one is a man-made wonder that you simply must see. Whether or not religion plays a part in your life, this is a most worthwhile visit. All are welcomed. The Chapel and grounds are built right into Sedona‚Äôs red rock and perfectly blends with these gorgeous, high-desert surroundings. The views from the grounds are magnificent and not to be missed.Expect it to be busy, yet even at peak times the Chapel is very serene. The grounds are accessed via Chapel Road. You enter through the gate and up a long, winding, narrow stretch of asphalt leading to the elevated, spiral walkway that takes you up to the entrance of the Chapel. For those with disabilities, assuming you have disabled plates/hangers, drive all the way up to the very top, past all the other parking spaces. There are 6 or 7 disabled spaces and a vehicle turn-around there. Even if the disabled spaces are full, you can drop off passengers, and head back down to find other parking. There is also small electric golf cart type shuttle to take you back up to the Chapel from the lower parking areas. You will not be disappointed."
Amazing chapel in the red rocks ,Such a beautiful place an arquitectural wonder It doesn‚Äôt clash with the environment I went late afternoon and I was not busy got to see all the surroundings and enjoy the sunset there also Totally recommend a visit
Emotionally beautiful,Such a beautiful place with breathtaking views! The chapel had such an emotional impact on me; was not prepared for that!
A must see in Sedona!,A beautiful work of art and architecture! It honestly is a very spiritual place and will have you mesmerized. The views inside and outside the chapel are breathtaking üòç this is a must see stop in Sedona!
If you have time a must see,Beautiful to see. What a monument to architectural brilliance. It was interesting to read about the history. The only undesirable thing was the parking lot- it‚Äôs a weird curved lot so please drive slowly- lots of people walking on the road. I also found it funny that they had a gift shop- like a ride at Disneyland that empties into a gift shop. I still bought some stuff though. Lol
Innovative but spiritual ,While leaving Sedona I went to this place and suddenly got connected with the vibe .The architecture of this place is nice The cross sign between the rocksLooks amazing
Amazing experience ,Absolutely breathtaking!! So beautiful location in addition to the Cooper Christ inside. A must to visit when in Sedona..
Chapel Wonder,Great place to experience and a must see for many. The walk up the hill can be strenuous. There is parking at the top and also people offering rides on Golf type cats. I believe they take donations/tips as a price for the ride.
Beautiful,Loved visiting. Incredible architecture... but more importantly a very spiritual place. Holy ground. Amazing cross ... the eyes of Jesus ... wow ... must visit
 Serene and Peaceful! ,"This chapel is a calm and peaceful place to pray, meditate or light a candle. The area is also beautiful and has gorgeous views of Sedona and the red rock mountains. The walk uphill to reach the chapel is absolutely worth it."
Beautiful and peaceful,This was a quick visit but I highly recommend if you are able to make it. Parking was easy and they even had golf carts to take people up to the top if they needed help. Wonderful church in a magnificent setting.
Serenity,"My mother always had a postcard of this place in her Bible, so this was a bucket list place for me. It did not disappoint. The views were dramatic and the interior of the church was serene. I loved walking up the winding road to the hill. I was glad I parked at the bottom to get those iconic photos of the church in the rocks. Tips: There is a Porta-poty at the bottom of the hill - that's it. The road is steep and winding, but there is parking along the road, so keep driving if you don't want to walk all the way up hill (like me)."
Absolutely amazing! ,Went to see the chapel in the Red Rocks as well as take a short hike. Gates don't open till 9 on a Sunday. We parked at the bottom and walked up. The chapel is a must see! I love Frank Lloyd Wright architecture. After opening there are golf carts available to take you up to the chapel but we walked up. On a Sunday in January the crowds were minimal. We liked that. We also found the chapel trail and took a short hike. I would definitely recommend this as a must see if in the Sedona area.
Peacefull,I was pleasantly surprised. Very beautiful place. Had a place to pray & light candles. I took full advantage of that. The scenery is the most beautiful.
Beautiful church6,Stunning structure of a church poised on dramatically elevated red rocks.not for the types who are afraid of heights.Parking very limited especially on weekends.
Breathtaking ,"Views at the top are breathtaking.   Stop at the bottom and get the full view then drive up the hill there should be parking.  At the very top was a handicap lot, which we were thankful for."
Awesome Views,"This small, modern chapel was designed by a student of Frank Lloyd Wright after she saw the views from this location (especially the 2 rock formations known as the Two Nuns & Mother & Child).  A trip to the Sedona area wouldn‚Äôt be complete without going there."
Small chapel with amazing views,"A friend of mine who actually got married in this chapel took me here while I was in town visiting. There was lots of traffic and it was difficult to find a parking spot. You have to walk up a slight incline to get to the chapel. It is small, but cool to see. There is a gift shop below that sell all sorts of religious souvenirs and bottled water. The best part about this visit are the views, which are amazing. Enjoy."
Visit,"We went over to see the Chapel and the view from here. The views were great, the parking can be a little challenging depending on when you go."
Beautiful views,Not a far walk up the hill but could also get a ride with Little shuttle‚Äôs Views are beautiful Inside there‚Äôs also a gift shop
Spiritual Experince,This is very unique and interesting extension for anyone and especially if you are Catholic. We were moved visiting this chapel
Very quick spot and worth checking out,"If you visit during the down season, you can park basically at the Chapel so definitely worth checking out as it can be a quick stop. Cool that you can just walk in the Chapel (respectfully of course) and see the unique architecture. The views of the Red Rock formation in the distance are awesome too."
A Spiritural Place,"You dont have to be a religious person to enjoy a stop at this unique church built into the Sedona mountains.  Regardless of your beliefs, you will find this a true spiritual adventure."
A spectacular view!,The Chapel of the Holy Cross brings an awareness of the work of God in nature as you experience a breath taking beauty everywhere you look!  Worth the trip!
Just beautiful ,"Well worth your time, catholic or not. Views are unreal as is the chapel itself. Do yourself a favour and stop if your in the Sedona area."
Amazing!!!!,Arrived in the area right before the sunset.  Watched the sun turn these rocks a wonderful red and the sky a mix of pinks and blues.  Worth the stop to see it any time during the day or evening.
Beautiful Chapel and View ,Very easy to find and access. Drive up to a parking lot and easy incline up a ramp to the chapel. Great views of Sedona both outside the building and through the windows of the chapel. Down the stairs is a gift shop - that chapel itself it quite small. It‚Äôs picturesque and add to view and you have a must do during you visit to Sedona.
Inspiring,"First ""hike"" of our trip.  Parked along the road on a Sunday and could have taken the golf cart up the road to the Chapel but we decided to walk the steep climb on roadway.  Nice view of Sedona Red Rocks from the Chapel and a beautiful architectural structure.  Gift shop below is OK if you're in need of a souvenir..."
Spectacular views!,A piece of heaven on earth! No trip to Sedona is complete without a visit here. The view and serenity is beyond comparison.
Tour,"Stunning church, will take your breath away!  Amazing architecture and wonderful story of how the church came to be designed and built in Sedona"
Chapel of the Holy Cross,"Besides the spectacular view at the Chapel, it‚Äôs worth the visit for the reverence of this location. The architecture is inspiring. There was hardly anyone there when we went mid week. Was able to sit in the Chapel peacefully; say a prayer if you were so inclined and light a candle in memory of lost loved ones."
An Amazing Structure,Adding to the vortex of this area is an amazing feat of engineering and archicture. Do not miss this icon.
Busy but peaceful,"The parking is limited, but they have it pretty organized. Larger vehicles, like extra long trucks, might have difficulty turning around at the top of the hill. Handicap parking is at the top of the hill. There are volunteers/staff that are directing traffic and offering rides with a golf cart to get to the chapel. Paved road, just steep. We got to the chapel around 11am. Pretty busy around the chapel. Great views. Inside the chapel is pretty small, but people respected the signs about staying quiet. I was able to have a few minutes in silence to reflect and light candles for my family. There also weren't that many people inside. And most of those that there were, hovered by the door."
Inspiring ,The story of how long it took for the Chapel to come to life is amazing.  Take the time to read before entering.  The chapel is small but inspiring. Any faith can feel the opportunity to be still and think while inside.
Loved this!,"Easy walk up, so peaceful and inspiring! This is for everyone. A must see. Enjoyable especially at night."
Chapel of Holy Cross,Nice visit to see a church created and built into the rock. Nice views from the site as well of area of Sedona. Quaint little church with history.
Interesting place for a chapel,This look more like a church/chapel made for tourists to visit than anything else. Amazing red rocks are surrounding the chapel and it is very interesting architecture.Worth seeing
Spiritual,For sure the spirits are here. Catheral is a beautiful shrine to the site and God magnificence. Gorgeous red rock.  Expect a crowd so go early in the morning.
Worth a stop along the highway,"Take the time to turn off the highway, park, walk up the approach road, read about the history and just appreciate the architecture.  Sit in the chapel and absorb for 10 minutes.  You will leave in a better frame of mind then when you arrived."
Awe inspiring,It‚Äôs a small Roman Catholic chapel literally built on and into rock. Scenery was amazing. Interior was beautiful. 30 minutes should give you more then enough time.
Easy to get to and free rides from parking to top,Everyone should take the time to go - the free ride up the hill from the lower parking was appreciated.   The chapel is cool and the views amazing.
Such lovely views,"It was so serene visiting this chapel, the views were beautiful all around. Parking isn‚Äôt available easily but people were so respectful, waiting patiently for the cars to leave and take their spots. I loved visiting the chapel, so did my kids. My friend told me that whatever you wish here comes true, not sure if that‚Äôs true but good to know. Worth visiting."
"Peacefulc, spiritual",This can get crowded and parking is limited. We get a whole lot of visitors and this is one of the major tourist attractions. They do have a golf cart that will pick people up from farther parking spots. Just flag him down when he's cruising up and down the hill. Especially if you have mobility issues. It's a walk up to the church but it's a paved ramp. I found myself actually feeling something special inside. Sort of a spiritual buzz but that's just me.
Say Jesus!,"Go earlyBeat the crowd It‚Äôs worth it!I was inspired to pray there, and hope you do too,It‚Äôs Jesus in the midst of some of his best creation."
Beautiful site,"Visited to light candles for my list parents. It was a beautiful and moving visit. You may have to park a ways down the road and walk up, depending on how busy it is."
Very peaceful,"We stopped here while exploring the area around Sedona. It's a Catholic chapel, but all are welcome to stop in and look around. The view is fantastic and the chapel itself is small but beautiful. It was built to blend into the cliff it sits on."
You have to see it to believe it!,Stunning site. Short hike to an architechural wonder. You don't have to be spiritual to appreciate. No charge for parking or visit.
Good views was not I really impressed by chapel ,"Amazing views but the chapel itself is small, little bit of a hike up hill if you park at first parking lot but the views are beautiful!"
A Must See,The location of this chapel is beautiful.  The short hike to the chapel is very easy and is surrounded by so many canyons.  The chapel itself was calming and we took a few minutes inside to reflect.  If you are visiting Sedona you must stop here.
A must visit while in Sedona,"Outstanding structure and location. You don't have to be religious to appreciate this church. The structure is unique and the views beyond belief. Try to point out the natural eagle to your left as you exit the church and the Madona and Child in the rocks as you descend the hill. Try to go on an offseason or weekday as parking is limited. Do go, you will be glad you did."
Stunning Views,"This is a place of solemnity, spirituality and peace. The sanctuary is understated with the crucified Christ being the unquestionable focal point. Great views from the deck."
Awesome!,"A beautiful, awe inspiring place. A must visit!   There a little bit of a climb up a circular roadway, but a person with a golf cart can give you a ride up if you want."
Last moment Sedona trip!,"What a beautiful day to visit this Chapel of the Holy Cross! The mountains surrounding it as well the fact this church is built within the structure of one of the mountains is majestic, grand with such grace!It is a 'must experience/see!'"
Chapel,"some guys build this chapel about 70 years ago.Absolutely beautiful. must visit, its build up inside a mountain"
Amazing,"Some guys build a church in the middle of a mountain.Must see, absolutely beautiful, I think it was build about 70 years ago and still in perfect condition. If you dont want to walk up there, free Golf Cart drivers take you"
Chapel of the Holy Cross,Beautiful vistas and views. Designed by a female student of Frank Lloyd Wright. Built into mountain.  Worth visiting.
Beautiful!,This is a must see while in Sedona and ‚Äúfree‚Äù.   Interesting story about how the church came to be and it is appreciated more if you read about it prior to going.   The Crucifix inside is quite spectacular.  You do not have to be Catholic to go inside but I was disappointed by the lack of respect for ‚Äúquiet‚Äù by the many tourists and parents not preparing their children prior to entering the worship space ...the gift shop downstairs had a nice selection.  All was open on 12/24 and they even gave golf cart rides if you did not want to walk up the road!   Looked like lots of parking but still was almost full on 12/24.  Highly recommend visiting ...
Doesn‚Äôt worth the trip,"Takes long to reach, very crowded, no guidance . Wasted about 90 min of my precious time just to see almost nothing"
Chapel of the Holy CRoss,"Beautiful, spiritual, relaxing and a must experience while visiting Sedona.Take time to enjoy the views and sit peacefully in the sanctuary reflecting on life."
Chapel of the Holy Cross and new Crucifix,"I have been a visitor to the chapel for over 50 years.  I attended a concert recently featuring the cream of the Master Chorale of Flagstaff.  It was wonderful.  The acoustics are wonderful. However, new crucifix is not.  I had to very deliberately aim the camera on the chorus to avoid pictures of the crotch of Christ.  The whole feature is overbearing and detracts from the simplicity of the building."
Beautiful place,"Beautiful, yet very small chapel. Very warm and welcoming. Scenic view from here is beautiful. Worth the drive."
Beautiful and peaceful,"This was a gorgeous site with an interesting history.  It is well worth stopping to see, and cart rides are available for those with ambulatory issues.   It is also beautiful lit up at night."
Nice stop,We stopped by right as it opened. It was a nice place to walk around and take some photos. The chapel is pleasant as well.
Beautiful site,Our tour took us up to chapel which saved us walking up the hill. The grounds are beautiful and the view from the chapel was striking.
Stunning!,"Even on a downcast day, the views from outside and inside the chapel were stunning! Not every visitor complied with the suggestion to keep silent as it is a sacred place but it was a spiritual experience nonetheless."
Peaceful,"Easy to get to. Not alot of parking, may have to walk abit. Worth the time. The view is outstanding. Take your time and relax and enjoy the views."
Not to be missed!,The Chapel itself is awe-inspiring. It is dark and solemn and was a nice quite refuge for a few minutes during our busy vacation.No photos are allowed in the Chapel. The views from outside the Chapel are spectacular!!!! That alone is worth the trip.There is a small religious gift shop just down a flight of stairs in the chapel. I recommend a visit. A very nice selection.
Pretty Church,Chapel of the Holy Cross is a contemporary Catholic church built into the side of the rocks.  Follow the parking lot to the top for easy access without walking too far and take in the sites around you.  The church inside is actually very small with a beautiful cross made of wood.  There is a small gift shop in the basement of the church with a few items for sale.   This is a good stop just south of Sedona.
Beautiful and Tranquil.,We visited in the afternoon and although it was very busy with other tourists it was still peaceful and very comfortable and absolutely stunning views.
Unique structure & location ,"This chapel is the icing on the cake. Sedona is fantastic to visit, the chapel is a must. Easy parking. Golf cart friendly drivers take you up to the chapel.Not much walking there but the scenery around it is so worth it especially the mountain formation of the mother & baby on the left side of the entrance. You can sit inside have a moment of silence or pray, stare at the huge Jesus sculpture on the cross or visit the souvenir shop downstairs. Perfect weather in November."
Should be your 1st Stop,The Chapel is the embodiment of Sedona and allows one to experience the Beauty of the Red Rocks as a reflection of God‚Äôs hand in all things.When there be sue to look at the rock spires East of the Chapel.   The 2nd spire from the left is unmistakable as the Virgin holding the Christ Child.The Chapel has recently installed a new sculpture in the chapel that is amazing.   The result of years of small contributions from visitors to fund the project.
Great,"Incredible church unusual and spiritual at the same time, surrounded be majestic red rock. The gift shop was poorly supplied otherwise everything was perfect"
Beautiful & spiritual ,A stunning building and location that is intensely spiritual. It was a special spot to light a candle and remember loved ones
Nice solemn spot in the rocks,This is a beautiful chapel in the red rocks of sedona. The views from here is spectacular. Certainly well worth a visit.
Some beautiful views,"Stopped by enroute to Flagstaff from Phoenix. Detour through Seasons was well worth it, and this place was beautiful. The chapel itself has a magnificent floor-to-ceiling crucifix, and the panoramic views of the mesas and other rock formations are breathtaking. Worth a stop if you're in the area."
Do NOT Miss This,"The Chapel is both beautiful and spiritual.  The views from outside the chapel are some of the best  I encountered driving around Sedona. The inside of the chapel, while modernistic when compared to most also exceeds their spirituality and grandeur. If you are a christian, you will feel the presence of God."
Awesome place,"There are plenty of parking, on contrary to what i have read earlier. There are multiple parking slots along the way going up the hills. We parked below and walk up , and it only took about 7 mins. There are buggies busy ferrying passengers up and down the chapels. The view is amazing on the top !!"
Beautiful & Very Spiritual,There are not works to describe How Beautiful The Chapel is!  If you are ever in Sedona ‚ÄúThe Chapel üíí is a must see.
Ever holy place,MY wife and I just sat there and felt the peace of God my wife's faith is deeper then mine she could ear the Angels singing and I know she could
Awesome ,"The chapel was outstanding.  It's built on the side of mountain.  Some of the rock formations near it were also amazing and all were natural,  not man made."
Beautiful site,The views were gorgeous! The chapel was amazing to see.  The walk can be difficult if you are not used to walking uphill. Try and park in the upper lot but those spaces go quick. I did read a golf cart would take you to the top and we saw parked golf carts but no drivers so not sure if you have to request that service.
Impressive!,Astounding concept and story about its construction. Beautiful vistas. Learned about the cactus plants from my tour guide.
Amazing view from there,"We did not go into the church, but just the view from there is amazing. There is not a lot of parking and I would recommend not driving all the way to the top as it is a little tight turning around especially if another car is there also. The trolley comes up to let people off and pick them up and I am surprised it can manage to turn around."
A Beautiful stop to Pray or Light a Candle,"We came here to light a candle for friends and family who are dealing with cancer.It is a beautiful church, with gorgeous grounds and a breathtaking view.For anyone who needs to be lifted up or to pray, this is the perfect place."
Stunning Architecture & Views,Truly impressive chapel designed by Marguerite Brunswig Staude and built in 1956. It's always crowded and there is little parking to meet the demand. Go early. The views from below looking up at the chapel  and from above at the chapel looking out at the valley and mountains is spectacular.
A very unique Church,"As you walk throuh the red ridges and rocks of Sedona, you can feel a sense of spiritual transcendence. Architect Marguerite Brunswig Staude felt it too, and it took her about ten years to find this place in Sedona for this church. The Chapel of the Holy Cross was completed in 1956, and when you visit this church, you are thrilled by its inner beauty and the way it is in harmony with humanity and the environment."
Just beautiful ,Do not miss this on your way up to Sedona. I‚Äôll beautiful chapel in the mountains hills. It was just lovely!
Very moving,This is a beautiful place to visit and to go into the church. There is a golf cart that you can take up the hill and the driver gives a very good narrative of the chapel. The view from it is beautiful
Cool views,"This place is good to check out for the almost 360 views of the valley from the walkway next to the church. It's also easy to marvel at the view of the church itself which is quite impressive how it was built into and now part of the mountainside. If you've got time to kill and looking for something to do, give it a look, there's also several trailheads nearby."
Must visit!,It‚Äôs absolutely stunning! Also it‚Äôs easily accessible with strollers and with small children.. views are so beautiful and the church inside is outstanding... not to miss while in Sedona!
"Chapel of the Holy Cross, Sedona, AZ","The place was very crowded, but what a view from their, it was the holiday week of Thanksgiving. We were on the trolley tour went right to the top, the a small walk to the Chapel."
Amazing little chapel nestled into the natural rock.,"There is a lot of traffic to this little tourist attraction and sometimes it is a little hike from where you have to park.  But go into the chapel and sit a spell.  It is beautiful, inspiring, worth the trip.  The story of how it got built, with all the restrictions on building here, is a minor miracle.  You'll leave the chapel feeling a new peace."
Beautiful chapel.,"Get there early so you can grab a parking space at the top of the hill, otherwise you will have to walk up the hill."
Nice place to meditate,Chapel of the Holy Cross is a very modern building with a great view through window with cross.  Great views from plaza outside.  Park below and hike up or try for a parking space above or wait for one of the guides to pick you up in a golf cart -- all depending on how much energy you have.  Spend a few minutes to contemplate how you came to be in the midst of this wonderous creation.
Beautiful experience,"Beautiful experience at the Chapel of the Holy Cross. There are two parking lots - one lower and one upper - both are extremely limited. During the hours of operation, there are golf carts that will take you up the hill as it is a pretty steep. You  don't need a ton of time here. You will see some great views of the red rocks and the inside of the church is beautiful,but small. Downstairs there is a small gift shop. Be sure to take a picture from the lower parking area so you can get the front of the church."
Worth the wait.,"Even though it took some time to get to the top, (lots of traffic and people walking along the roads) it was very worth it.  The chapel is gorgeous and memorable!"
Part of Tour,We saw this as part of our trolley tour. The chapel is amazing. It was great to learn the history and to see the view of Sedona.
Thanksgiving,"A small Catholic chapel on the hillside with a spectacular view.  Very heartwarming, peaceful and serene.  Lit candles for our lost loved ones."
"Amazing Architecture and Views, Chapel of he Holy Cross, Sedona, Arizona","We very much enjoyed our peaceful visit to see Chapel of he Holy Cross in Sedona, Arizona.  The cross in the church is deeply religious  The views from the Chapel overlooking Sedona are amazing.The archicture of the chapel is something to see.We parked in the lower parking lot and took the golf cart to the chapel area and back Its nice that they offer this service."
Well worth walking up to see the Chapel,"Parking was at a premium when we were there but the hike to the chapel was worth it. We ended up walking the wrong way and a kind tour guide in a golf cart gave us a lift up with great points of interest along the way. The chapel is an amazing building, well worth seeing. And the rocks shaped like the Madonna & Baby and Trump were neat too."
Beautiful sacral spot in a special place,"I love the location and the idea of this church but unfortunately when I visited, many tourists were chatting and laughing while taking selfies..... forgetting that at the end of the day a church is still a sacral place. This made me a little bit sad and impacted my visit. So, go, enjoy, take pics but be quite :)"
What a view!! ,"Stunning! Breathtaking view, gorgeous structure, whether you're religious or not it makes you want to give thanks for being alive!"
Awesom,A must see spot. Very prayerful. Very interesting architecture. A really nice gift shop. Don‚Äôt miss this spot
Just okay,Not a bad stop if you are in the area and not in a hurry. Good spot to take photos from and get great views. It is a hassle to get parked and to leave due to the design and the outside is the coolest part which you can take photos just from driving by.
sTUNNING,"The Chapel of the Holy Cross is well worth the short drive to see.  You're struck by the powerful simplicity of the structure as it seems to rise out of the red rock.  Inside, the sun coming through the large windows creates a very spiritual sense.  With the bigger than life size crucifix silhouetted against the sky I unconsciously felt a sense of awe and wonder at what it represented."
Sadona ,Sadona was great. Wasn't impressed with the chapel.  I prefer the natural beauty and not a man made structure defacing it.
A spiritual experience,My wife and I decided that this was a must stop visit to the Holy Cross Chapel. Neither of us are religious people alight we are believers. When we arrived we both felt so something unique and special. We entered this holy church and were taken back by the beauty. You can feel the spirit of the lord as you sit in this amazing church. I would put this on your list of must visit places while in sedona!
breathtaking.,"If you are a Christian, this is a must see. You can experience what it was like for Christ to hang on the cross. The view is breathtaking. Even inside the Chapel is a sense of peace and love."
Beautiful views,Small chapel set in the beauty of the Sedona red rocks. Amazing views and tranquil setting within the chapel. A wonderful place to get close to god and nature.
"Touristic place, like most churches (empty of connection)","I respect the limitation of religious people and this place must work for them as it is super busy and it is hard to find parking. In my humble opinion, absolutely nothing to see there. The feeling is empty and yes they accept credit cards for votive candles."
Beautiful!!!,Set right in the heart and surrounded by red rocks this beautiful structure is a sight to see!! Take time and go in the Chapel!! You won't be disappointed!!  Beautifully built!!
Amazing,Went to the Taize service; moving!!!!   Our second time to this service. Extremely well done.  Absolutely recommend
Anniversary ,Spectacular view worth the trip up the road.  It was very special to lite candles for family members fighting cancer.  Such an uplifting Chapel.
Go EARLY,"To be up front on this review, we ended up not going into the chapel.  We went on a Saturday on Veteran's Day weekend around 1pm.  Cars were parked about 1/2 a mile away down the hill, people were walking up the hill along the side of the road.  There were two people directing traffic when you got closer to the chapel as it was crazy busy.  We inched our way in traffic up to the chapel, went around the drop off area, and then back down the hill.  We decided we would come back earlier in the day the next day but ended up heading straight to the airport instead.So my advice is - go early.  After looking at YouTube videos it does appear to be beautiful and it is tucked nicely in the red mountains of Sedona.  It's on our list for the next visit.Hope this helps others plan their day."
Loved it,"Parking is limited, but the chapel and views around it are gorgeous. I saw recommendations to go in the morning, so I think that helped me get a parking space."
Don't miss this!,This is a must see when visiting Sedona! Such a beautiful and unique chapel in an amazing setting. Great views too!
We really enjoyed visiting the Chapel of the Holy Cross,The Chapel is beautifully designed to flow from the red rocks surrounding it. The walkways are even beautiful with curved paths. The surrounding rocks and views are gorgeous. Highly recommended.
Chapel of the holy cross,"Worthwhile visiting, beautiful building, built into the red rocks, you have to walk up to the church , if you can't walk you need someone who can take you up, because there is not enough parking up there"
Short hike,Beautiful location.  Small chapel. Catholic but all are welcomed. Short hike up a hill. Gift shop in basement.
Interesting and a number of people,We were here on Saturday noon and found parking and then caught the golf cart ride up. There were getting to be quite a few people so it was a bit of a challenge to feel truly inspired but it is a special place to see.  I wish we could have gone mid week.
Worth a 'golden hour' visit,"Parking is as described (park low & get a ride in a golf cart, or keep heading up and maybe you'll get a great spot).Amazing setting, interesting architecture, nice calm atmosphere inside.  Note the ramp from the parking area up to the Chapel is a bit steeper than current ADA standards.  Check out the basement gift shop - you can go all the way to the window and peek out (not possible upstairs in the Chapel)."
Amazing location for a church,"Beautiful church, sitting amidst the red rock.  Just a beautiful spot for a church. Definitely worth the stop."
Breathtaking,"What majestic surroundings!  We decided to park in the lower parking lot and walk up the hill to the chapel. At this elevation expected to be breathless from the climb. Instead, left breathless by the surrounding view nestled against rust red cliffs. The chapel a lot smaller than imagined. Impressive and humbling interior all at the same time."
Lovely chapel,This is a lovely chapel built into the buttes of Sedona.  Parking was challenging as the lot of very small.  It‚Äôs best to park low and walk up the hill.  You can light a candle for either $1 or $5.  Well worth the stop.
Epic,"Reverent quite a special place. Parking can be a challenge, best to park low and walk up. Well worth the effort."
