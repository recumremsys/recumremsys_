Friends ,Amazing place... wonderful palace . I have been to many places in India but this one will always be my favourite place of all time
Aamer,Must visit...the best fort in India...see the richness...and the mammoth structure on top of the hill
Hotel royal view jaipur,good hotel . This hotel is situated at good location and it has huge parking place. Hotel staff are very cooperative and rooms are very decorate. I love it ‚ù§. On the top floor terrace has very beautiful garden and restaurant.
Beautiful Fort with Water front ,It‚Äôs a beautiful spot to sit & enjoy the luxury of past . A great fort with a lake in its entrance is beautifully amazing to visually. Photogenic spot
Too good,"Great Fort, huge and very well maintained. There you can have audio guide in voice of Amitabh bachan ji. Many movies shoot here"
Nice Place,"Amer Fort is must visit place for travellers visiting Jaipur, RajasthanIn the evening you can also enjoy sound & light show"
Excellent,"What a monument, a UNESCO World Heritage fort and excellent historical sight. Trully amazing. Will come back to Jaipur soon."
King Palace ,If you love to see combination of architecture and artist skills than you must visit this Palace. Very good painting works and well managed historical hub
Stunning! ,"Located north outside of Jaipur the Fort is about 30mins drive from the centre. The views of this palace start when you arrive along the road to where the tuktuks park up. There you can walk up to the Fort. The walk is fine in the cool of the morning. You will see tourists (local and foreign) getting elephant rides up - seeing this made us very sad üòî as the cruelty to these animals is widely reported and fuelled but ignorance and Instagram. The Fort has some sumptuous palaces within it which are intricately carved, I late for painted. The amount of time you spend there is dependent on how much you take in as you wander through the fort. Toilets in the square were clean for India."
Outstanding,one word - outstanding. if you not visited this fort in your jaipur trip than it is not a complete trip. Big fort & the place from where jaipur is born. its old capital. many movies got shoot here.

A Favorite,One of our very favorites from the many historic sites we visited on our tour of India. Enjoyed the drive to and surrounding areas to reach the Amber Fort. The surrounding views from the fortress are almost as special as the fort itself. So much to explore inside (watching the‚Ä¶

great fort,Huge palace. One of the most beautiful places I have been. great views from the top. a lot of rooms. a must to visit in jaipur
"Jaipur, the pink city","Have you ever wanted to visit a place with a beautiful amalgamation of architecture and art? If yes, then you need to visit Jaipur. Jaipur, one of the most stunning places in the desert land of Rajasthan, is an integral part of India's tourism. Popularly known as Pink City, it is well known around the world for its spectacular forts and magnificent places.  Amer fort one of the most famous forts of Rajasthan. Amer, originally, was the capital of the state before Jaipur. It is an old fort, the town of Amer and the Amber Fort were originally built by the Meena‚Äôs and later it was ruled by Raja Man Singh l."
Stunning situation,We had a very knowledgeable guide and an extensive tour around the Fort looking out over the lake.  Very worthwhile tour.
Don't miss it.,"Unbelievable !!! Go there, but walk, don't use the elephants to reach the top. Respect the animals and then enjoy the panorama. Ivanromeo."
"Extremely interesting place, a must see for everyone who claims being to Rajastan!",Well-preserved palace and fort overlooking the vally of the Amber City. The entire city is surrounded by walls to protect the p[eople from invadors and is very picturesque.
best historical place,"good  architecture and beauty , location is also good, light and sound show with the voice of amitabh bachan is heart touching"
Enormous building,Our tour guide was an expert on indian history he explained very well all things we saw. He is living in this beautiful town.
guaranteed vashikaran pay after work done,"black magic specialist in Delhi Lover Vashikaran Specialist +91-9925077133 Our astrologers knows how to overcome the effect of black magic. If seen, black magic usually reflects the call of evil spirits with objective villains and sees negative spirits and gives an impression of their being black magic all over the world."
Awesome Fort- A Must Visit,"Amber Fort is an awesome fort that you must visit, if you are in Jaipur. It is majestic and very pictureque. It evokes the medieval times very easily and is beautiful both from the outside and the inside. There is plenty to explore and it requires a few hours with a good guide to do it real justice. We took the elephant ride to the fort, which was the highlight of our visit to the fort. As children growing up in India, we had been on elephant rides, but for my daughter, it was the first time and we enjoyed it immensely. Only two people are allowed per elephant, along with the mahout.The only bad taste was left by the ""mahout"" of the elephant, who demnded tips even though, it was written everywhere that tips are strictly forbidden. What is worse, I was prepared to tip him, but he sneered at the amount that I offered and demanded more."
Not impressed even on second visit,The fort is just a symbol for all of us t know how some ruling clans looted India with an alliance of Mughal Tyrants. A visit is a must if you are in Jaipur to know the history of agents like Maan Singh and company
Truly magnificent!!!,"Please be a responsible Tourist and walk up to the Forts main entrance, the Sun Gate. Don‚Äôt add to the misery of the poor Elephants who trudge up this same route all day, day after day. On entering the Sun gate into the main courtyard visit the beautiful little Temple to the right of the staircase to the main Palace with its silver doors( no pictures are allowed)Once up the staircase you will come to the second courtyard with it rows of double columns, the Hall of Audiences. The third courtyard leads off this through the beautifully frescoes Ganesh Pol. In front of you is a lovely manicured garden flanked by Hall of Victory on the left with its magnificent mirrored and inlaid panels and ceiling. Some of the most beautiful examples of this I have seen. On the right is the Hall of Pleasure with its cooling water channel. Walk up the stairs to the little balcony where the ladies sat to overlook the the Hall of Audience. You also get to wander around the Zenana or Ladies quarters. It‚Äôs a fascinating look into the lives of the Mughals and the Royal Family of that time"

AWESOMENESS!,The Amber Fort showed the awesomeness of so many architects over a period of time. The court yards were as amazing as each story that went with it. So worth the trip.
Greatest Fort in Jaipur,"I have been to Amber Fort in the capacity of guest, tourist, and educational lecturer multiple times since 2012- this past visit in November was one of my favorites-  Arriving first thing in the morning to take the elephant ride up to the fort only enhances the experience!

Fort,"Located high on a hill, it is the principal tourist attraction in Jaipur.[3][4]¬†Amer Fort is known for its artistic style elements. With its large ramparts and series of gates and cobbled paths, the fort overlooks¬†Maota Lake,¬†which is the main source of water for the Amer Palace."
Well Preserved Fort,Visited the Amber Fort as part of our Golden Triangle tour. There are three forts sharing the wall. Fort of Bombay is the oldest from 1590. After looking at the forts over the water we drove up to the Amber Fort. Elephant Hall has sandstone columns on the outside and marble‚Ä¶
A must visit,"A truly wonderful place to visit. Very interesting. We also viewed the lights of Jaipur by night in an open jeep ride, very good."
Majestic,"This is  monumental place although the hawkers at the main entrance are a real pain along with parking issues. It would take around couple of hours t complete the visit ,there are interesting shops and restaurants at the Amer fort which is located 10km away from jaipur"
AN AMAZING PLACE.,"Great visit. Brilliant architecture, beautiful gardens and marvellous views over the city and lake. Loved the elephants. "
A true vision of the history of India,"A magnificdent structure, with superb views, wonderful buildings within buildongs. Not to be missed."
Wonderful historical palace,The view is so breathtaking from a huge wall opposite to amber fort. The architecture is grand and its so amazing to walk inside the palace. It makes you feel like a king yourself. The elephant rides are the special attraction here.
Well maintained,Amber Fort is the fort of Raja Man Singh. It is on a hill top on the out skirts of Jaipur city. Well maintained and guarded.
Stunning Site,Another World Heritage Monument preserved for generations to come if we come thru this virus ! The visit started with a wild jeep trip to the top. Then on foot we examined & enjoyed this magnificent relic. Its size & breadth is amazing and it is hard to imagine when the Raj‚Ä¶
Perfect photography destination,Popularly this fort is known as the Amer Fort. Around 5000 tourists visit this fort every day. This fort is one of the significant vacation destinations in Jaipur.   People visiting here enjoy the elephant rides that takes one inside the fort in a regal way.   The sound and‚Ä¶
For me this place was on par with the Taj Mahal,Spectacular building from the moment that you see it. Totally dominates the area. Fantastic views from all sides. We were taken up in a jeep although you could have gone by elephant. A real good guide brings this building to life. A must see place.
Inside the walls,"My wife and I visited the  Amber Fort in Jaipur as part of a 3 week luxury tour of India. We arrived by coach at the bottom of the fort and were taken by a convoy of Tuk Tuks to the top. Luckily,  due to the restricted size of the roadway, we didn't encounter any elephants on‚Ä¶"
The jewel of Jaipur,This simply has to be done. This is a living Palace as well as well laid out historical account of the grandeur of Jaipur. It is as spectacular as it is enchanting.
An imposing fort and a must see.,We went with a guide as part of our tour of Jaipur.  The fort is imposing from ground level viewed across the man made lake and more so as you reach it.  We were taken by car and then our guide took over - parking is almost impossible.  There are other ways of getting to the‚Ä¶
Nice,Jaipur is rajashthan one of the best city .clean and its also called pink city and i went to amber fort is great location and i loved it
Interesting history,"Clean, well maintained historic palace.  Step walls somewhat reminiscent of the Great Wall, beautiful views."
Compulsory viewing!,A magnificent old fort in a picturesque setting.  It is reached by jeep or an elephant ride.  There are four courtyards on four levels and plenty of opportunities for photographs. The Jai Mandir (Hall of  Victory) with its many mirrors is not to be missed.
Beautiful!!!,"Gorgeous!!!! I believe I paid 500 INR for entry fee per person.. expect to spend an hour exploring here...And do the elephant ride to get to the top.. very cool, I believe it cost 1100 INR per person for the elephant ride & if it is Sunny & Hot grab an umbrella beforehand- it‚Ä¶"
Stunning fort on top of the hill,"You can get to this fort by jeep- or by elephant! Of course, walking is always an option, but it is a hefty climb. Once at the top, the fort is on three levels and it is worth slowly meandering through to see it all. I learned the difference between Hindu and Islamic‚Ä¶"
Be early to visit the amazing fort,"It's 11 km from Jaipur . Don't be adventurous and walk up to fort,take jeep. It'll cost 400-500 rs. It's difficult for private car to reach up there.

Amber Fort,Amber Fort is a historical fort. Everyone should visit this place and get a glimpse of the past era.
Out of the world Palace and Fort. Top Notch,Cant believe we have such an amazing palace and fort in India !!!! Absolutely spend time and also go for the evening light and sound show.
Mirror Palace,"India has lots of forts but they're all different.  We visited this one as part of a tour group and had a tour guide which is the best way to see these sorts of places as they can help bring them alive with stories and history.  This was no exception.I guess the feature that sets this fort apart is the beautiful mirror palace area.  Exquisite.  Check it out via Google.  It will whet your appetite.Yes, another fort but well worth a visit."
Nice,I liked it while going from Rajasthan Pari Tours i visited this place. This is a beautiful place. And will surely return again
Magnificent,Absolutely amazing. What fascinated me the most was the structure of the forts living quarters built to hold all of the Kings  Queens.
Superb ,Our escorted visit to the Amber Fort was amazing. The history and architecture were difficult to digest during a short visit. It‚Äôs size and location something to behold especially taking into account the mammoth task of creating such a fort so many centuries ago.Well worth a visit and thank you to our guide Sushil for his comprehensive history of the region
"Amazing fort,  amazing views",Definitely worth a visit. The fort itself is stunning and so well preserved and looked after. The views are amazing.
Royal Architecture,"this marvlous building depicits royalty of Indian Kings, it is located on a hilltop and you have a option to group by local jeep or by elephant ride which is amazing, entire fort is built with certain design to save it from intruders, light and sound show is also good to watch‚Ä¶"
"Beautiful architecture, rich history",The excitement starts with the jeep ride up to the entrance to the courtyard. I am not sure why the line of vehicles continually stops along the narrow route. You will be bombarded by vendors. Our guide took our group (by foot) through the four palaces on the compound and‚Ä¶
Stunning!,"On tour with Newmarket Holidays we visited so many places of interest, Amber Fort being one of the many. The sights and sounds of the whole area was just an amazing experience. Another huge wow factor and must visit place to explore."
Great Amber Fort,"This is one of the Best Forts in Rajasthan. Most unique Experience in the visit is taking Elephant ride going up to the top of the Fort. Once in Life Time experience, must if you are in Rajasthan!!!"
Marvellous,"Very different to the other forts we had seen on our trip and a must see if you are nearby. Amazing scenery, gardens and sheer scale. A must see place."
"Best fort to visit in Jaipur, world heritage monument","Must see in Jaipur. It's been declared a world heritage monument and lot of work is going on to preserve the old architecture which is worth watching.Approach : Easy, 20 mins away from main jaipur city. Two entrances to go up the fort: 1 is from front through Elephant ride from the entrance below and the 2nd from the back through jeep or powerful SUV to go up to the ticket counter.Preferably have a guide with you for quick and better understanding.Very scenic views within and of outside from the fort.Tunnel from the basement to Jaigarh Fort is also interesting to walk through 2 kms and then a battery driven car can take you to the Jaigarh Fort which was a military headquarter of the king.Salute to the architects of that era who with minimum resources built up technically a very sound palace then with all sorts of luxury for the kind ng and queens.Lots of photography points for single, couples and family to have memories with you.Sheesh Mahal is one not to be missed in the palace."
Scalpers,"The fort needs renovation and is receiving it. The real problem is the scalpers who try to sell you things as you wait in line. They will not desist; ""harassment"" best describes the experience, and it ruined the fort for me."
Impressive ,"It's huge! The price is ridiculously high for foreigners. Honestly, just visiting outside is enough. We felt it wasn't that exiciting inside."
Marvellous structure perched atop a mountain. ,"Ride an elephant 1100 rupee, or take a 4wd 200 rupee return. Be blown away by the stunning architecture and detail. Mughul and Hindu influences clash in spectacular fashion. Secret hallways where princesses could peer out discreetly. Ornate carvings and inlay gold on frescos adorning arches and ceilings. A must do, when visiting"
Great experience,Great views and guides. Located in a narrow path but the fort was amazing. Also had dinner at the hotel there and everything was perfect.
"Amazing Palace, must see in Jaipur. Bit of a climb up to the gate but well worth it if you can manage the climb",The Amber Fort is a must-see in Jaipur. Little bit out of Jaipur city and a small climb (steps) up to the main gate but once you get inside and see the Sheesh Mahal (palace of mirrors) it will all be worth it. Unfortunately guy at ticket window didnt know what SAARC rates are‚Ä¶
Don't miss this place. ,"There are no ATMs or ways to pay except cash. So be prepared.  We chose to do the elephant ride, it's not that comfortable, you sit side on and sway back and forth all the way up. Be prepared for the hawkers,  only pay about 60% of the price they initially nominate :) also you‚Ä¶"
Stunning,Amazing fort from a distance and fascinating inside. An absolute must visit when in Jaipur. We didn't take the elephant ride up to the top because of animal welfare concerns.  We were assured they were well looked after and that they aren't used in the hot times of the day. ‚Ä¶
Amazing Structure,My wife and I visited the old fort of Kachwaha clan of Amber as part of a Golden Triangle tour with the TripaDeal group in February.   We had a perfect day and stopped below the fort in a car park with the lake in the foreground. The reflection on the water of the Amber Fort‚Ä¶
Wonderfull Fort but please please dont ride the elephants ,Visited as part of our trip. It's an incredible fort and experience with much to see. Local guide provided rich history and detail.  One plea. Please dont ride the majestic female elephants up.  As they turned for the trip down it was terrible to hear their distress and see them being beaten and mistreated by the drivers.  Much better to get a jeep up or even walk! .
Wonderful old fort and beautiful setting,"As much as it is great to see those lovely elephants in their paint and splendour I feel guilty and hope that they are not mistreated. Our group walked up the hill avoiding elephant poop and the men that gathered it up as soon as it was dropped.Avoid the ladies in brightly coloured saris ""sweeping with brooms"" as they are part of the backdrop and will expect to be paid if you take their photos. Otherwise enjoy the beautiful buildings, artwork and architecture of this site."
Fun time elephant ride,Go in the morning aroun 6:00 am for elephant bath and elephant ride to the fort ... u can book the rides for anything between 1200-1500 .... there r photographers taking photos as u riding on the elephant make sure u clearly tell them how many pics u need .-.surely a royal feeling to go up the fort on an elephant ... also take guide to know the history of the fort as it is really interesting ... after fort is done u can go to the museum to buy Rajasthani authentic handicrafts ... prices are worth the quality
Amazing world heritage site,"Amber Fort is one of the most amazing places I've ever visited. What a history, views, buildings! We had a round trip with a group from Finland, and our Finnish guide was excellent, which of course helped us understand the history and the importance of the fort. I'm really happy we didn't take the elephant ride, but had jeeps instead to get up to the fort."
Amazing old fort and palace!,We visited the fort by taking an elephant ride from the bottom up to the fort; it was much easier than walking and sort of a fun experience even if you have already rode on an elephant.  The Fort and the Palace inside are definitely worth a visit either way.
Airconditioning system at Amber fort,When we visit AMBERPALACE we should clearly understand that one which mostly tourist visit is Amber palace not Amber fort .The one above known as Jaigarh fort is actually Amber fort. When we visit AMBER PALCE  the architects desisigned air conditioning system for every season. For example for Mansoon season they designed SUKH MANDIR  where they had a system to uplift water through persian whell and the water used to flow through the marble cascade and than back to the source. Simoulreneously the air used to come in contact to this water and thus thus cool air used to flow throught the room. The room was intionally built with lime which could absorb humadity in mansoon season.                                                                                                                                      Seesh mahal is another room used for keeping the room pleasnt during winter and the room was enclosed with woolen curtains and closed from all the sides so that the temperature was maintained.For summer they used two water reservoires  filled with perfumed water wich would flow through a copper pipe on a curtain made out of khas khas and thus the blowing wind crossing the vurtan shall make the room cool pleasant and perfumed.
Sad elephants,"Another beautiful and interesting fort. Tour around the palatial areas by armed forces personnel and spectacular views. So much to see and hear but a little spoilt by people who continue to ride up the path on painted exploited elephants despite signs, websites and logic telling us not to. Great busker"
An amazing start of the day ! Visit Amer Fort,"Jaipur is all about forts, museums, food, monuments, shopping and many more things.The Amer fort is located on a hill and was a strong defense around the city. The Indian and Mughal blend of architecture is immensely beautiful. It is said that even the attackers did not want to destroy it. Very Beautiful and worth to visit !!"
Excellent ,Awesome fort. clean and well maintain fort. Guide service is very helpful. Purchase of gift items may be avoided.
Very nice,Long walk up if you choose too.... also Jeep path as optional... very good views.... many things to see inside... easy walk down...
Impressive,It is a worthwhile visit. It is huge and breathtaking. The history of the building and the individual rooms is interesting. It gave me a glimpse of how royalty lived.
Go see this!,This is most impressive and definitely not to be missed. The one room is so stunning with all the mirrors in the walls and ceiling!  The wall surrounding the fort is extensive.
Totally memorable visit - more than equal of Red Fort,"You will always remember this, from the distant view to the many colourful elephants (sadly giving rides) and the multiple wonderful pieces of architecture and history in the buildings. This needs to be number 1 attraction in Jaipur - just outstanding."
Amber Fort,Loved visiting this historical site. A lovely walk up the hill to enjoy the building and view. 500 rupees entrance fee for foreign tourists. A lovely garden area to sit and contemplate at bottom.
Magnificent and Historical ,"Riding up to the fort on the back of an elephant begins the adventure. And though I had some ethical misgivings on whether or not there was mistreatment of the elephants, I was informed that they only do 3 trips up a day per elephant and are then taken to eat and rest and are very well cared for. They all looked healthy despite reports I‚Äôve read to the contrary. So it is a very personal choice to do or not to do the elephant ride up. Gimmicky, perhaps, but personally, I am glad we did, for you truly get a sense of history as you ride these magnificent animals through the gates, just as they did 400 years ago.The Palace is divided into six separate but main sections each with its own entry gate and courtyard. And Constructed of red sandstone and marble, the attractive, opulent palace is laid out on four levels, each with a courtyard. Plan to spend 2 plus hours here so you can see everything!"
Good experience - definitely worth a visit,We enjoyed a trip up to Amber Fort - as long as you ignore all the people trying to sell stuff or offer you a guide then you will have an interesting trip - we had our own registered guide and that was well worth it - you need a good couple of hours.
The highlight of our trip to India!,"An amazing place with a breathtaking view. We had a great elephant ride to the fort and then after wandering to admire all the buildings inside, we drove down on a jeep."
What an amazing project this would have been,"this Fort is simply amazing, its huge and sprawls over the hills and must have been an amazing project to undertake all those years ago, also give insight into how they lived in the times, its a bit of climbing but certainly worth the effort"
Amazing,This place is a must.Drive up was in a jeep through the village of Amber.Some people go up on an elephant but not approved.The scenery from the fort is fantastic and you can see for miles.Very colourful and pen spaces.More to see than you think as goes quite far back.We had our‚Ä¶
Amazing,"Don't miss the chance to see one of the most astonishing place!  Go up the opposite side by the wall, it's not easy steps, but absolutely worth it, amazing views!!!!"
Top attraction,"This place is known as Amer Fort or Amber Fort. It is the iconic attraction of Jaipur and a must on any itinerary. It was built about 1600 by Maharaja Maan Singh.Set on top of a hill and overlooking the Maota Lake, Amer Palace is a fine example of Indo-Islamic architecture. Inside the Amber fort there are 4 courtyards. There are various other buildings within these courtyards i.e., Palace of Man Singh I, Garden, Tripolia gate, Lion gate, Diwan-I-Aam, Sheesh Mahal, Sukh Mahal, etc. The place is huge and will take several hours to wander and see everything. There is a light show in the evening but as our trip was in the morning cannot comment on that. There is an elephant ride to the top. But we refrained from using them due to concerns about the welfare of these majestic animals. There is supposed to be a time limit of two hours when the elephants can be used but this rule is ignored.The climb to the top is a challenge but taking is slowly enjoy the panoramic scene as you climb is an absolute delight. The view from the top is something to enjoy."
Must see in Jaipur,Light and sound show is excellent experience.Architecture and planning and Vastu shastra followed is something to learn about.I will recommend to hire proper guide to enjoy this place .Careful with the links between guide and shops around.Shops around may be overpriced.
Great architecture and history,"Some great views from the top and a real feat of architecture. It‚Äôs a must stop when in Jaipur, beware of snake charmers outside"
Great place,The most beautiful fort in a Jaipur city.we were very lucky to be able to visit this fort  early morning.
Beautiful,"Very nice and beautiful! I liked that it was so big so even though there were many visitors it never got too crowded. The small tempel inside was very nice as well and there are many different affordable striking souvenirs. The color is beautiful and pictures are nice. End of February was a really good time to visit since the weather was really nice, not too hot."
Judahaa Akber Film was Here,"You MUST go there if you are in Jaipur. The palace is very impressive with a great view. Some of the locals also bring the elephants from the elephant village to the palace, although I didn't ride them and felt sad for them."
Must Visit Attraction in Jaipur,"This is one place every visitor to Jaipur MUST visit. We reached the drop-off point by our hired car  and had to negotiate only a short climb of small incline. The Guide was very well informed and explained to us the intricate details of the architecture, interior artifacts and‚Ä¶"
Early Morning visit as part of the Golden Triangle Tour,What can I say other than to say this is a MUST see visit! I was most fortunate to visit first thing in the morning (09.00). This way one avoids much of the crowds. One can go up to the fort on an Elephant (slow) or in a Jeep (faster) or do as I did arrive by taxi to the‚Ä¶
Impressive ,Fort is split into palace and fort and one ticket covers both - and can used over 2 days. The palace was extremely busy with tourists but well worth a visit. The fort is impressive and was totally empty when we visited first thing in the morning. The views were great back down‚Ä¶
Amber fort visit,"Visited with a work colleague whilst in Jaipur to celebrate a friends engagement. You can see why this fort was so impressive in years gone by, we had a very knowledgeable guide who made the whole experience come alive."
Grand Palace,"The best kept palace in the Pink City, had chance to visit during the short visit to Jaipur, it was crowded by Indian traveller so had to wait but it was worth...thoroughly enjoyed .  On return one now have chance to get down by battery operated cars"
Historic Fort,Lots of history and a guide is worth it as they will give the history and detail which makes the fort of old come alive.  Beautiful place for half a day.
Vacation,"If you love history, this is the place to visit. The architecture and beauty is still in tact. Go see it if you have the opportunity. "
Agra fort ,"Wonderful historic site. Really interesting to visit, it was not very crowded. Highly suggest visiting this place "
Very impressive fort,"This structure is amazing, I recommend having a guide to tell you about all the parts of the fort. It's massive with some incredible artwork. The stairs to get to the fort are numerous but the incline is not too steep.   You'll encounter a lot of hawkers, be firm and polite and‚Ä¶"
Well maintained Royalty,Was amazed to see the palace in good state and its grandeur still present.  The drive was halfway to fort was in car then we had to climb little bit on foot.  I was astonished with the beauty of the fort and the collections too.  It was magnificent and a great experience to see‚Ä¶
A fort with a lot of Rajasthani history,"A huge fort with a lot of history.  Well preserved and well maintained museums.  Take a guide, otherwise you wont understand a thing (he will also take take pictures of you). Guide cost Rs.300."
Brilliant ,Loved this place. Really  worthwhile  the visit. Walls whisper  ancient  stories  of mughal  history.  Do not miss this fort.
Must see,Amber fort is a must see for anyone visiting Jaipur.   It‚Äôs a very old historic fort in fairly good condition. It‚Äôs a marvelous piece of history. Sheesh Mahal is awesome. This is my second time visiting the fort and I still found it of great interest.   It‚Äôs owned by the state‚Ä¶

Well preserved heritage site ,"This is the prime tourist location of Jaipur. It is said that once you visit Amer fort, 50% Off your Jaipur sight seeing is done. The main attractions inside Amer fort are the courtyard, Diwan-e-aam, Diwan-e-khas,Sheesh Mahal, elaborate and intricately designed garden, Queens quarters.Sheesh Mahal(Hall of Mirrors) is an intricate piece of work If you flash a light on the ceiling of the Sheesh Mahal, you get the feeling of looking at many twinkling stars. In Sheesh Mahal, there are small mirrors where you can take a photo from the rear camera of your phone but the effect will be as if it a selfie photo.Besides there are a lot of areas to see inside the fort. Having a guide ensures that you don't miss on the must see areas of the fort. I would definitely recommend hiring a guide."
Exceeded expectations!,"This DEFINITELY needs to be on your ""Must See"" list. I don't have words to describe how beautiful this place is. It's worth the entrance fees and the crowds, but I do recommend taking your own tour guide in as it has a lot of history to be shared. Plan on spending several hours exploring the grounds and taking in the incredible views. Also, there are bathrooms for pay at the very end that are incredibly clean and worth the 5 rupee ""fee""."
Very impressive ,Fantastic visit to this architectural wonder just outside of Jaipur. We drove up to the top but many people came up on elephants. Nowadays elephants carry just two people up to the Fort and walk back down without any people on their backs. They do 3 trips up and down and they‚Äôre‚Ä¶
Nice experience but unsure of animal treatment,We had an amazing time with Chanchal and Dildar. Lovely human and even lovelier elephant. Real strong connection.  However I hope we did not spend the big 4 500 rupees in someplace that fakes good treatment.  The mahout (Dildar) seemed very genuine in his love and care for‚Ä¶
Elephant ride should not be allowed,"This is an amazing place to visit until you see the animal Abuse with the elephants. They are forced 14 times a day to walk tourists up a long hill in the heat, look in their eyes and you see the sadness.  Visit the fort. DO NOT ride the elephants  If you think this is not‚Ä¶"
Heartbreaking ,"The fort is spectacular and an absolute must see however the elephants that are made to work all day in the heat, walk on hard cement paths and carry people that damage their backs is heart breaking and tourists should help the government put a stop to this cruel practice.‚Ä¶"
Another awesome Fort in India,"Just to see how some people (royalty) lived back in the day. This is definitely a must see. We took a 4wd up to the Fort, you can also ride an elephant up. You can spend hours in here going through rooms and courtyards, gardens, kitchens, bathrooms and learn the history and‚Ä¶"
Well worth visiting......,The Amber Fort is a huge structure that blends in with the landscape. The story behind this fort is amazing.... it is well maintained and a very popular tourist attraction. One thing though - they offer elephant rides which I do not approve of but realise that this is part of the history of the fort. We chose to take a Jeep up to the Fort.
beautiful stonework,Go with a guide or be sure to get the history of this place. The stone carvings and decorations are amazing.
Architectural gem,"The Amber Fort was definitely worth visiting. The views of the surrounding areas are spectacular. The fort is very interesting with lots of fascinating architectural features. The elephant ride up the hill was fun although I would not recommend it to anyone afraid of heights.Like at many tourist destinations, tourist dollars are a major source of income for the locals and hawking/begging can be relentless. Just be prepared and don‚Äôt get intimidated. Despite signs saying not to tip the elephant drivers, my driver badgered me continuously. I had planned to give him what I felt was a fair tip, which I did, and ignored his requests for more. Just say ‚Äúno‚Äù to things you don‚Äôt want and say it forcefully. Feel free to continue walking and don‚Äôt feel that you have to engage the vendor. If you want to shop have a small amount that you can conveniently reach; don‚Äôt flash large sums of money. This is all part of the travel experience, learn to work with it."
Stunning....,Amazing place to spend a day. There is so much to see. Much better if you have a guide to explain the history and features of the Fort. Fabulous views and so much to explore. I would take a jeep up to the main entrance rather than the elephants and ask them to stop off on the way to see the Step Well. A great photo opportunity
Old fort outside of Jaipur,"We took the elephants up to the fort, it was fun but they constantly try to sell you things on the way up.  Some people took up the jeep and you are harassed less in that.  When you first get up there into the square there are more sellers but once you leave the square they leave you alone.  it's good to go with a guide because there is so much history there that without one you miss out on a lot."
Elephant Ride to Amber Fort,Our Guide actively tried to put us off this Elephant Ride up to the Amber Fort.  We made our own decision and I'm glad we did.  The elephants were in great shape and the ride was up a fairly gentle gradient and lasted about 15 minutes.  When we left the Fort our Guide then came clean about the elephants.  It appears that each elephant only does five round trips a day (there are 150 elephants working in shifts) and after that they are taken back to the government run sanctuary where they are fed and allowed to rest and bathe until the next day.  All their expenses are covered by the government including vaccinations.  Your elephant driver will try to get money out of you for 'bananas for the elephants'.  You should refuse this as there is a notice saying 'No Tipping' and all expenses are covered by the Indian Government.
Busy!,Fabulous place but so busy. Shame still using elephant transport but most large UK companies no longer do so.
A lovely fort in a beautiful setting,"Perched high on a rocky outcrop the Amber Fort is a sensational sight. On foot or with open topped Jeeps, as well as the more traditional elephants, providing an easy way up to the fort; you can choose how to enter this wonderful fort.Once inside you have a panoramic view of the surrounding area as well as a beautiful garden to visit."
Amazing place,"A great place to visit , really good , we enjoyed the guides knowledge, if you wantto be harrassed ask how much something is , and they won t go away then follow you everywhere"
Take the Jeep Up.,We took the elephant up and got hassled all the way up to the top for a tip. And then got tracked down and hounded by photographers trying to sell your your picture on the elephant.Theyeven tracked us down in town again.
Worth a visit,The fort was very impressive and should not be missed.  Highly recommend getting a guide for the visit.
A Fabulous Visit,"Set aside quite a lot of time for a visit to the Amber Fort. There is masses to see and a good guide is essential. When it is busy, it is very busy. The elephant ride up to the fort is bizarre but better than the jeep alternative. Lots of street sellers at the bottom, and at the first main fort courtyard, and they are a nuisance - but that is India!"
Huge fort worth the visit,"When the fort first comes into view you cant believe the size of it, but taking over 140 years to complete with additions by different rulers than maybe you will then understand why it's so big. We had a private tour guide so we drove to the fort but you can pay to go so far up via an elephant if you wish. We toured the fort for about 2-3 hours and having the guide was brilliant so if you can afford its worth it. If you dont want a tour guide you can hire the audio guide as you come in.If a group it would be cheaper for a guide than individual audio guide. They are so many different parts to the fort and lots a people and kids selling stuff, if you dont want anything just say no or ignore them, its harsh but eventually they get the message."
Endless maze of rooms,Get there early. Gets quite crowded w tourists. There are 100s of rooms in seemingly endless maze of rooms. One of the must see sites in Jaipur. Don't forget to visit the Stepwell just in back of the fort.
Amazing fort,"Very nice place to explore. It is a very massive fort, full of history and fascinating. Unfortunately, inside there is not so much to see if you want to admire some artistic treasures. The architecture itself worth a visit and from the fort you can see also some very nice views of the landscapes nearby. Take your time for lost yourself inside the tight and long corridors or to enjoy a pause in one of the several balconies."
Massive piece of history,Really great place to visit and get a feel of how the maharajas lived 400 years ago. It's truly epic. Recommend to take a tourguide. Our guide spoke very good English and was able to show us the place in an entertaining way. Go there during morning (latest by 11am) to see the‚Ä¶
Amazing,"Amber fort is about 15-30 minutes drive outside jaipur. It‚Äôs huge, and the views as you approach it are amazing. We had to repeat several times to our guide that we did not want an elephant ride up to the fort, instead we drove up to the entrance through the village. The fort‚Ä¶"
Gigantic Fort,"Amber Fort is an iconic Fort in Jaipur city. Located bit on city outskirts, if offers a panoramic view of the Pink city. Lot of tourists flock here throughout the year. Carry lot of water for hydration. Avoid summer season, as it would be very hot and sultry."
Imposing,Huge edifice with extensive outer walls protecting lavish royal palaces. You will need plenty of time to explore all that this complex has to offer and you will not be disappointed.
The second best amazing place after Taj Mahal,"We visited this Amber Fort as part of our G Adventure guided tour. We were taken by our coach then in a Jeep uphill, then walked uphill very short distance on stone steps. The initial view of the Fort up above water is amazing and breathtaking. Every aspect was very interesting‚Ä¶"
A Highlight of Jaipur,Consider beating the traffic by heading up there earlier in the morning. The walk up the hill is an energizing one that doesn't look quite as long as it seems from the parking area if you choose not to ride the elephants up.
"great place, stunning history and views, take the audio guide!","great place, make sure to go into the chamber saying latrines - stunning stone windows with view to the valley hidden behind there"
Amazing fort and palace!,"This is a beautiful sit with incredible stone in-lays, designs, and palaces!  Definitely worth the trip- and a guide really makes it come alive!  You can ride elephants up to the top  (the animals are in great shape and very, very well cared for) but get tickets ahead or get there early as space is limited and the elephants only work in the morning."
Beautiful Fort,"The most beautiful fort of Jaipur, approx 20 km from the city. Crowded place, you may not found the art work like Red Fort of Delhi and Agra here. Must visit Kali Mata temple at Fort."
Must See!,"An imposing fort, with well organised tourist infrastructure. Much more fun,if one can organise elephant ride up,if not ask your driver to take you to Elephant Hut, for private Elephant ride"
Interesting Place,This place is a must visit when in Jaipur. Highly recommended. Interesting history. Book your tour with Welcome Rajasthan Tours and Travels for a  hassle free vacation. :)
First Trip Of 2020,Very nice ancient work... You will find this Fort even more beautiful during evening light and sound show... Must visit both...
A must visit - Amber Fort,"If you are in Jaipur, you shall not miss the visit to Amber Firt and their sound and light show. It is a very well organized fort and very well crafted story on the Amber Fort. "
Iconic Rajasthani Fort,"This place is magnificent by any standards, perched halfway up the hillside ad overlooked by the separate Jaigarh Fort, this structure stands out and also blends in at the same time. Unfortunately they still use Elephants to bring tourists up to the main gate, however aside from‚Ä¶"
Steeped in history!!!,Amazing architecture! Historical significance! Great view from the top too. The steep climb added to the splendour. 
Awesomely stunning palace,"Beautiful architecture, well-maintained and preserved, massive palace and gardens for Indian royalty. Magnificently decorated interior walls."
Early Morning Tour,"We were fortunate to be able to do an early morning tour of the fort by car, hence we did not ride the elephants and jeeps that are required if you travel there by tour bus. It was great to see the elephants enter the gates of this fort."
Breathtaking,A must for anyone visiting Jaipur. A guide is recommended as they will explain the history of the fort but it's not essential. A great experience
2nd only to the Taj Mahal,"We loved the Amber Fort almost as much as the Taj Mahal,very ineresting place to visit,beautiful palace a must if you stay in Jaipur"
Amber Palace,Best place in Jaipur to visit. Look up Ashok Sharma as your tour guide he is the best! Excellent place for shopping and dinning.
Pride of Jaipur,"Wonderful place, I can say Pride of Jaipur. Architectural style is Mughul.Large rampparts & series of gates.its amazing exprience.You can see the Jaigarh fort & the hill view of the Jaipur City."
Walks and Elephant ride to view the granduer of the Rajput kingdom,Excellent historical property. Wear light shoes. Have head cover to protect from the sun. Beware of taxi or autos which charge exorbitantly for a short distance which can be walked if physically fot. Do not miss the evening light and sound show.
Excellent,Visited as part of Gold Triangle tour - a must see had excellent English guide.  Wear comfortable shoes as lot of walking and steps.  Lots of history.
India trip ,"Visited here on our trip with our wonderful guide, stppoed on the way to take the long shot pictures and were hassled by the snake ‚Äúcharmers‚Äù who we were told actually stitch the snakes mouths closed so they don‚Äôt get bitten ! Truly awful! Our guide also told us that the elephants at the fort are not that well looked after, not that we would take a ride on them but others do. The fort itself was outstanding"
Beautiful building,"Got a taxi from hotel not too expensive about 900 rupees for half day sightseeing.  Lovely place, cost was 500 rupees each, 50 for locals and 500 for tourists which is the norm in India. Touts at the Fort give you a bit of hassle, just give them a firm no and say it like you mean it then you will be left alone. Also in close proximity to water palace on a lake for good photoopportunities."
do not bother with the audio,rented the audio cassette.. the problem is that there is very little direction and you wander around wondering where the next number starts.  Also there is a lot of shadow and sunshine so you are constantly struggling to see where youare going. other wise it is a fascinating place.
Nighttime Tour highly recommended,"I was able to visit the fort after sunset which I highly recommend. It was like a private VIP tour, the space was empty and I was able to take the most beautiful photos without hoards of people in them. I had a lovely local guide who was an architect (found on Airbnb experiences, highly knowledgeable) who explained every detail of the design and building of the fort as well as info on the architecture of city of Jaipur. It‚Äôs an amazing place to visit and to see it under the moon adds to the allure of this magical place."
Magnificent Amber Fort,The Amber Palace is one of a UNESCO World Heritage Sites of India. It was  built by Raja Man Singh II in the year 1592. If you read the Rajput history of Rajastan and visit this palace it will me more interesting. One of the very few sites in India where elephant ride is still permitted.
Well worth a visit.,This transports you back to India as you would expect during the British Raj period and before !!The Fort is a truely spectacular structure which opens up a window into India's past history. Truely historical site that is well worth visiting. It presents you with a number of great photographic opportunities due to its location on top of the hill. Glad we visited.
Best place in Jaipur,Wow don‚Äôt miss this! Beats the Great Wall of china!Your mind will remember this amazing place: no need for photos!Take water comfortable shoes there are steps to climb to get in!Cost is about 500 rupees
Step-by-Step,The Amber Fort is one of the many highlights in Jaipur a tourist can visit.  I know that many reviewers before me have written about and praised this amazing attraction. I can only add my own personal experience to what others have already said  about it.  As my wife and I‚Ä¶

Not to be missed!,Beautiful creation of the Maharajas!Adorned with intricate carvings and wonderful interiors. The fort is a must visit attraction in Jaipur.
Interesting site.,Lots to see at this site. Very well preserved we walked up rather than take an elephant or jeep. The walk was not difficult even though our guide told us it would be. ( suspect it was just to get more money from us) You also get to see some really good views across the City from the top
Amber is necessary to understand more about India,"Many places you can visit, Amber fort is the one you cannot miss, remember do not do when sun is high, try to taste the flavour of this place leaving some detail, and try to get the entire situation."
Spectacular ,Spectacular place. Journey to the top and back in a Jeep was quite the wild but fun experience. Plan on spending a good amount of time here. It is an amazing site. UNESCO
Fort,Underground Tunnel was closed because they are filming a movie. Got there around 9:15 and packed full of tour groups. Sellers will harass you at the beginning. Don‚Äôt ride the elephants!
Wow Wow Wow,"An amazing place, we went up in a jeep - otherwise it is a long walk. No Elephant rides on the day we visited due to a visit from UNESCO as they are hoping to gain World Heritage site status. Our guide informed us that all visitors are asked not to ride them due to poor animal‚Ä¶"
Super crowded with rude tourists ,The fort was nice to see. A steep walk to the top. (Saw many people riding elephants which is so sad to see them abused)  The architectural details in side were really nice. Wish there weren‚Äôt so many people pushing around  Would recommend. 
A must see location,"You cannot fail to be impressed by the magnificence of this WHS which is over 1000 years old and dominating the landscape for miles around.  It is in an amazing state of preservation and allows one to marvel at the vision and imagination of the original owner, Raja Man Singh. ‚Ä¶"
Wonder of the world,The beauty of this place is breathtaking. It takes you back in history and fills you with awe. Its an architectural wonder. The elephant rides are amazing.

You will find lots of your guides, can use them or audio guideAll attractions in Jaipur ends at 5 pm. Plan accordingly"
This is a must see.,"This is a very impressive fort and palace.Inside are a number of courtyards, near the top are the summer and winter palace rooms. Simple for summer, ornate with mirrors for winter. Further up were suites for each of the maharajas 12 wives with a 'secret' passage joining them.Whilst we were visiting filming was taking place and the public were able to watch a few scenes being shot."
Take the elephant ride!,"Private cars or buses are not allowed; you can reach it by elephant ride or jeep. Our agency booked the jeep, pretending this was the spectacular way to arrive.   It was very uncomfortable; if the roof is on, you‚Äôll have to crouch  down (if you‚Äôre taller than 5 feet) ; the smell of burnt diesel from the jeeps in front of us got me really dizzy.  And the bumps on the road don¬¥t help.But once you get there, you¬¥ll forget about this... until it¬¥s time to come down. At least, I asked to sit shot, by the driver.The fort, as many Indian forts, is really a palace surrounded by a fort. The visit willtake at least 2 hours, and many,  many pictures."
Beautiful Fort,The amber fort is a beautiful fort and palace built atop a hill.  The elephant ride up the hill to the entrance costs a fixed 1100 rupees ($15 USD). Beware aggressive hawkers/vendors and ignore them at all costs.
Don‚Äôt ride the elephants ,"Very interesting visit however, saddened by the elephant rides. I am not sure why people still find enjoyment in riding painted and abused animals up a hill but this was big here. I witnessed one of the workers beat an elephant hard with a stick for moving while they were resting. Think about what you‚Äôre doing and paying for when you give into this type of tourism. The animals are treated poorly and this is not what they should be doing. We should not be riding, painting one of the most intelligent animals in the world."
Nice place ,Do have a guide with you. It will be really a nice historic trip. You will enjoy stories related to king and queens.
Beautiful fort and palace ,"A must see in Jaipur.Quite grand .. lots of things to see .. amazing architecture, art work and beauty."
Elephant ride experience was great,Amazing palaces to visit and touch on the history of these great monuments.Thanks to Maharaja Trails.

Well worth seeing,It is certainly a must if you are in Jaipur. Amazing architecture. Elephants do still carry passengers up to the fort but I understand they are trying to stop this. The walk up to the fort is not a problem.

Really worth a visit,"An amazing place, really beautiful and such an interesting history. We would recommend that you have a guide as there is so much detail. "
India's Great Wall,"Amazing, awe inspiring, all of the cliches. Worth taking time from the many choice site of Juipur, if only to roam about below"
A great wall in Jaipur,Was pleasantly surprised with the visit to Amber Fort - I wasn't expecting to be blown away but we were all thrilled with the palace - fantastic architecture so long ago  There are about 100 elephants carrying tourists up the hill and I wonder why in this day and age that is‚Ä¶
Wonderful interesting fort,"On arriving here the steps seemed quite difficult, but after 15 minutes of climbing stairs we made it to the Palace.It was excellent, with the beautiful outbuildings, mirrored ceilings , manicured gardens. What a place to visit."
Excellent Visit to the Fort ,"We really enjoyed the Fort, it wasn't overly busy and electric cars are available to take you up if you do not fancy the step walk.Elephants are available but it does not seem right at all to use them and apparently there pass have been worn off due to this trip.A cafe and restaurant is available.once you are up the top of the fort."
Stunning,Stunning piece of architecture.  Take the guided elephant ride to the top.  We had an excellent guide through Explore India.
Wonderful marvel of Jaipur,"This is a must visit if you are in Jaipur. This is an excellently built palace / fort a few hundred years ago. You can enjoy and wonder about each and every bit of the fort. Having a guide with you is advisable to get a most out of the place. They hardly charge you 150 to 200 rupees. Its definitely worth it. It located on a very small hill. So a jeap or elephant ride is provided to reach the entrance of the fort if you are not on a personal vehicle. Please do not take the elephant ride. Please!! Please !! The animals seem to be so badly treated. I pity the animals.If possible, plan a visit in the evening and try attending the sound and light show in the late evening. I missed it. But heard its very nice!Overall, don't think skipping the place if you are in Jaipur."
Beautiful,A very nice experience of royalty.  Very good architecture. Worth a visit in Jaipur. The sheesh mahal is beautiful
Great Fort.  ,A labyrinth of rooms.We walked up. People with walking difficulties can get a jeep.Look out for the tunnels. Excellent. Many people miss them.Beware of helpful people. They usually want money for telling you a piece of info or pointing out a staircase. We were pre warned by our tuck tuck driver but others were not so lucky.
Stunning architecture,We first visited for the light and sound show which is a good introduction.This is a large fort which displays both Hindi and Muslim architecture. stunning views from every angle of the gardens and city wall. Well worth a visit.
Great monument ,Amazing place to visit. Huge old construction with many stories and facts related to. Really a must see
Royal,Excellent view from the top. Tye elephant ride going up is an experience bu itself. I liked the architecture of this palace and found it at par with the TAJ.. only if they could control the hawkers there it would have been a more pleasant experience.
Awesome place to visit,"We were lucky to start our day here and see it in the gorgeous morning light as we approached across the water. One of our favourite places we visited in India. Lots to see and many rooms, courtyards, nooks and crannies and views to see. Avoided the poor miserable looking elephants and walked up the hill which gave us time to appreciate the impressive location and impact of the building upon visitors old and new. Not to be missed."
Amazing,"Beautiful, fantastic views, so much history and loved seeing the elephants. A trip not to be missed, but do take a jeep to the fort enterance, as it is quite a long steep walk if you don't"
A must see in Jaipur,If you‚Äôre in Jaipur you can‚Äôt can‚Äôt see the Amber fort because it is over the next hill. This does not allow you to not see the fort. It is exquisite in its beauty and a must see whether you are in Jaipur for a day or a week. 
Magnificent,A true reflection of magnificent history of RAJASTHAN. Even one day is not enough for exploring the whole of Amber fort. Must try the elephant ride over here also
Beautiful!,Beautiful fort! We went up the hill with a jeep because we didn‚Äôt felt comfortable riding on a elephant. Lots to see inside the fort. Beautiful colors and interesting history. Can definitely recommend to have a tour guide who can tell you something about the palace  
Don't get Cheated by local Tour Guide. Worth to Visit!,"We went on a private tour with a local tour guide. He received confirmed Itinerary to Amber/Jaipur Day Tour and we almost got cheated as he asked for Elephant Ride payment INR1,100/pax to ride up to Amber Fort and we remembered it was included in our Tour fees. Do read what you‚Ä¶"
Visit to the Royal Palace with grandeur,The Royal Fort with grandeur and history. ‚ÄòLive life king size‚Äô this is what is actually derived from here having the royal lustre exposed during that era.
"Its soo good place,, one day isn't enough to see the wonders of the palce",One day isn't enough to see the wonders of palce ...we enjoyed a lot n construction was amazing... This is a place to visit in jaipur
Amber - the capital of princely Jaipur state,"It is one of the most well-known and most-visited forts in India. It is made out of sandstone and marble, architecture is very beautiful. Many people choose to remain at the fort for the evening sound and light show, night viewing, and dinner. The fort reopens, evocatively‚Ä¶"
Royally grand,Arguably the best attraction in Jaipur. This cannot be missed at all. Tourists can climb up the stairs (900 odd stairs I am told) or can hire a jeep for 500 Rs return journey. The Jeep takes the back route of the fort and on the way stops at Panna meena ka kund (stairwell) and‚Ä¶
A most beautiful and interesting place. ,This is such a stunning Fort built on a hill. It is huge. You can get to it by taking an elephant ride. This in itself is a wonderful experience. Once there you will not be disappointed with what is there to see. The place is huge. There is one particular place worth a mention.‚Ä¶
Just what you would expect from an old castle! Amazing.,A must-see if you are in Jaipur. Well worth the journey out of town. An amazing structure from the outside and beautifully decorated inside.
Stunning architecture of this fort with hilly view,"In Jaipur, this is the place you have to visit must. Many buses go from outside of Railway station to here in Rs.30. Entry is free. One area called Sheesh Mehal you have to buy ticket of Rs.100 to go in this area, it's worth. The wall of this Hall is carved with pure glass and mirrors. Here you can see 'Din me tare' with flash light point on ceiling. Parking facility is available."
Best place in Jaipur 100%,Strongly recommend stop. We went upstairs and it took us only 15 min... everyone will ask you to take the jeep but I don‚Äôt think is worth it unless you are fat or old. Place was amazing and it had lots of areas that you can get lost. Have fun
Fascinating Site. Ride an Elephant. So Cool. ,"This site is fascinating and beautiful. Visit it with a guide. And take an elephant ride. Although touristy and hokey, it‚Äôs a real hoot."
Stunning,"Fabulous visit. Lots to see, many photo opportunities and fabulous views. Sad to see elephants being used to carry tourists up to the entrance , this was the only downside."
Breathtaking,"This is one awesome sight not to be missed. Being on a hill, it offers great views of the city of Jaipur from various angles. But its most impressive features are the influences of Hindu and Mughal architecture combined into one sprawling, magnificent structure that gives you an idea of what life was like in the 11th century onwards. This should be on one's must-see list when visiting Jaipur."
Nice Day time visit  to Fort + Beautiful Sound & Light show in evening,"We very much enjoyed visiting the fort in the day time and stayed on for the Sound & Light show in the evening which was good.If visiting in winter, make sure to be prepared with warm outerwear for the evening show as it gets bitterly cold."
Like a maze,Breathtaking from the moment you walk in. You need to steal yourself from the many hawkers as they can be persistent. Patience is needed as there are a lot of tourists. Lovely views over Amer. so glad we had our guide.
Beautiful,This fort is really beautiful with tons to see so make sure you allow a good couple of hours to have time to look round properly.
Fort with history ,Lovely fort but not maintained well. Remember my early days when the Amer Fort was so grand and magnificent. But now just did not get the feel of my old remembrances. A bit down after going there after almost 30 years
Best Fort,This place is stunning.  The place is huge and goes on for miles.  You could spend forever here if wanted.  Walk up is a good hike so wear good shoes.  The architecture is insane. There is so much going on inside this Fort. The views go on for miles so take lots of photos.  Glad we came and saw this amazing Fort.
Absolutely beautiful,"My husband and I visited here in January 2020, the drive to the fort was impressive. Our driver gave us a brief history of the fort and then left us to explore. What a place!We walked around for an hour or so, I had the best chai tea here! Lots of people asked us for selfies! Definitely worth a visit, it‚Äôs absolutely stunning. We didn‚Äôt pay to go inside the fort."
Rider Mohammed & Female Elephant Monica,"We visited Amer Fort for its artistic style elements. Entering the fort is by riding an elephant.  The Fort is located on a hill. My Rider Mohammed was so happy and pleasant. His elephant, Monica did a great job. Amer Fort is a magnificent site with beautiful Mirror palace inside. SEE photos."
Truly a must  ,"Visited yesterday, booked via our travelAgents with a tour guide.A truly memorable visit, with with an elephant ride into the fort, breath taking views, both In and outside the fort. With persistent traders wanting to sell their goods.The tour guide gave an in-depth description on the fort and it‚Äôs uses for its Maharaja, occupants, history and its use today by the royal family.A visit not to be missedüôèüèº"
Stunning Fort! ,"We had a guide (Raj) who explained so much about this impressive Fort. Don't miss this place but be aware that if you are offered the option to see a textile block printing demo, you will be 'encouraged' to buy something."
Excellent visit ,Would not miss this. Very interesting visit. Have a guide or read up beforehand. Allow a couple of hours.
Trip to the Fort,"A very large fort in the old area of Jaipur. Our driver avoided the normal entrance where people were queuing for elephants for the ride up, and went round through the old town to the entrance where we could easily walk up a short climb and into the fort. The fort is huge, but much of it is not open to the public. It is a great place and takes 2-3 hours to see it all. You can also watch the Indian Kites swooping around looking for food. They call them eagles but I am sure they are kites."
Day trip,"Very good visit. Guide worthwhile. Chose to walk to Fort rather than take elephant ride, but the elephants are a sight themselves. The Fort has plenty to see if you know what you are looking at and easily fills 2 hours."
After the Taj Mahal it‚Äôs my favourite place in India. ,"Fantastic place, so beautiful. The views are in readable. Jaipur is amazing. So crazy busy but brilliant. I love this place. Highly recommended. A must see."
Great experience,The fort is really well maintained and is a great experience to visit. The entry fee is expensive though.
Astonishing!,"The Amber Fort is a must see for anyone visiting Jaipur, and it requires a few hours to do the place any justice.  The workmanship of the rooms in the noble areas is almost unimaginable."
A wonderful place to visit,"I think that every guide book lists this site as the main one to be sure to see, and I agree.  It's also in a quiet location away from the hustle and bustle of the city, but not expensive to get to."
Frank,"Think 'Frank' from the vicar of dibley and you will get our tour guide. Even through the sexism  (after 20 mins the ladies head phones were off) you couldn't but be impressed with the fort. External wall 21km (I was listening) which you don't have to walk. The creativity of the architects is amazing with the tools/tech that they had. The stories of the Kings etc was overly interesting. Downside always one, mayhem getting the vehicles upto the fort, the hawkers, you just have to roll with that one.  The use of elephants to take tourists 400m is debatable, gave that amiss even after they said they only work from 8am to 11am. They still had to walk upto 7km each day to get there...I'm sure some of them were moonlighting in the evenings. But.. it is a must place to go with a guide to get the full history, even with Frankie"
Very good historical review of Jaipur,It is rather big but contains a significant portion of the history in Jaipur. A lot of the original decorations are conserved/renovated so looks more beautiful than the forts in Agra/Delhi.
Amazing place!!!,It is a must if you visit Rajastan. It is a fairytale place.We did not have the elephant ride but if you have time it is also an interesting experience
Must see,An impressive fortress built in 16th century with lots of empty chamber‚Äôs dungeons servant quarters halls & enclosed gardens. It‚Äôs possible to take elephant ride up to the palace but it seemed cruel to us so our taxi took us up. A great tour that you must see whilst I‚Äôm Jaipur 
Fabulous,"Beautiful fort, huge, plenty of area to walk around, intricate, well kept, with fabulous views, one of my highlights in India..."
Amazing site and views across the valley,"Visited first thing in the morning, the temperature was cool at this time of the year. A fascinating site, well worth visiting. Elephant rides were available."
Totally freaking amazing,"Straight out of Indiana Jones or Game of Thrones. I had no idea this kind of fortress existed in real life. Nothing in Europe, China or Japan holds a candle in comparison. Must see"
Heffalump,My life is far more complete now that I can say that I have written an elephant. It is kind of a cool novelty and doesn't really take that much time. The only reason I didn't give it five stars for fun is that we had come to expect there to be an entire Safari of elephants. When‚Ä¶
Way up there,"The sport would have been a whole lot more fun at who is more accessible the people who are over 25 years old. It's quite a jaunt to get there and for some may be worth it. For me, there were other attractions that are easier to get to and just as beautiful"
A magnificent backdrop,An evening of music and dance as part of the Jaipur Lit Fest organized at the Amer Fort. You truly experience what it must have felt to be royalty enjoying the arts.
Afternoon at Amer Fort,"Lots of people, but a must visit destination in Jaipur. We could have spent hours exploring around this fort!"
Nice experience,"The Amber fort, popularly known as Amer fort, is the main attraction in Amer and it does not disappoint.Easy to reach and offers excellent views of Amer. The guides and overall experience could be better though, but in general the place does not disappoint for a small day-trip from Jaipur.Not a lot of great restaurants or good food options nearby, however special mention for a cafe called Kokum Bistro (right opposite paid parking area of the fort), which offers excellent Indian and continental delicacies with beautiful interiors and friendly staff, making it stand out amidst a typical tourist place like Amer."
Fabulous insight into a bygone era,A superbly interesting fort overlooking the environs of Jaipur. An easy walk from the car park although an elephant ride is a unique and pleasant option. A must see if in the area!!
Entry and elephnat ride,Excellent visit with guide and all entries paid.Really enjoyed with all the family. A long walkdown with splendid views all round.
Amazing experience,Good experience.Highly recommend to hire one of the govt approved tourist guide who can give you knowledge of the palace and history behind it.Earlier drive through palace was not allowed however it is very much possible now.All an all a very good experience.
A must see site in Jaipur,This is a fascinating fort area.  A guide is essential to knowing what to look at and to understanding the history of the fort (for example the reason for marble window screens).  There are very few informative signs here.  There is much to see and learn at this site.  The size and the number of soldiers accommodated at the site as well as its location make this interesting as well as photogenic.
A very historic and beautiful fort,"We were very pleased with the history of the palace and got to know about it as we hired a guide(strongly recommend to hire a guide to know the historic importance). We liked the defence system, mini palaces of all 12 wives, king's secret passages and the Jodha Akbar locations. The kids liked it too but had to walk a lot. It was so surprising to witness the techniques used in summer and winter palaces."
A Mesmerizing window of past,"Amber fort or Amer Fort is a legendary place in all respects. A very well maintained property, clean and decorated. The elephant ride to the palace is the highlight. But to enjoy the elephant ride one needs to reach the place before 12 noon. Palace has 3 zones, Diwan-e-Aam, Diwan-e-Khas and Mansingh Palace. Each has a story of its own. Its recommended hiring a guide to fully understand the stories."
Amber Fort,Amazing historical site.  One of the best we visited in the Golden Triangle including even the Taj!  Well worth the visit.
A must visit UNESCO World Heritage Site,"Amer fort is one of the principal attraction of Jaipur, its around 7 KM far from Jaipur situated in north east of Jaipur City. Amber or Amer fort is a magnificent fort built on a hill. One can easily visit this place by car. The best time to visit is late afternoon or evening so‚Ä¶"
Nice place to visit,Must visit place whenever you travel to Jaipur. The place which is well-known for its historic stories. You can hire a guide here in 100 to 200 rs so that they give you exact knowledge of this place
Great visit ,Fantastic views and experience visiting the amber fort. People we‚Äôre friendly and helpful and the views were amazing 
Def visit,"Was wonderful experience, esp the elephant ride up the fort. Make it a point to reach there by morning 7.30. There are more than 100 elephants, so doesn‚Äôt take much time to clear the que. The elephant ride ends by 12 noon.  Take a guide for sure. Excellent architecture &‚Ä¶"
Nice and beautiful.,Nice fort despite the huge potential for historic site. The authorities managing this fort are not looking after it is well as ..
Well worth a visit! ,The Amber Fort is incredibly beautiful and I would recommend all tourists visiting. The fort is surprisingly well preserved. It is massive and like a rabbit warren! I would leave at least a couple of hours to walk around if not longer. The mirrored room is just beautiful! üòÉ
Not worth it,Yet another sad and disgusting example of blatant commercialization. We got a government certified guide who was mediocre at best. He could not really understand our questions and seem to have limited knowledge of the history. He was however very eager to steer us towards all‚Ä¶
Fascinating,Well worth a visit. Beautiful and engaging. The architecture is gorgeous and the history fascinating.
Fascinating Complex built on a the hills above a 9th century village,We spent most of a morning on this visit and it was worth it.  We left the bus outside of the village and took a Jeep up to the fort.  It is hilly but worth the effort.  Numerous courtyards with sensational views. You can ride an elephant as well if you want.  The story of the‚Ä¶
