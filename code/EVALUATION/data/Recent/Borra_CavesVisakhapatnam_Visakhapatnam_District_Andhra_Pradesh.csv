Caves with culture,Mind blowing naturally formed caves where in architectural beautiful carvings and sculptures exists.For aged people it is not advised as there are many steps inside the caves.
Sameeksha By Sachin - It's a Mesmerizing Experience to See Borra Caves,"Borra Caves is located in the Anantagiri mountain range, about ninety kilometers from Visakhapatnam. It was discovered in 1807 by a British geologist named William King. It is believed that Borra Caves are 150 million years old. When you see the large entrance of the Borra Caves, that scene leaves behind all imaginations and creates new dimensions of experience. The depth of this cave is about eighty meters, and this is two hundred meters long., One has to trek about three hundred and twenty five meters inside the cave to see the cave from inside. Mineral pillars, which are called stalagmites and stalacites, amaze tourists with their variety of shapes created as a result of chemical reaction between water leakage and stones inside the cave. The surprising thing is that the railway track also passes over the Borra Caves and the Gosthani River also flows from near the Borra Caves. Evidence of thirty thousand years to fifty thousand years old human civilization has also been found in Borra Caves . There is also a natural Shivalinga inside the cave, priest is also there to worship the Shivalinga, to reach to the Shivalinga first one has to go through the steps of the cave to the floor of the cave and then trek back in the other direction from the floor. One has to climb up the iron staircases, these stairs become very narrow as they go up. Overall, the experience of watching Borra Caves is very exciting and awesome. This is a must visit place and I highly recommend this place to visit."
Huge Beautiful caves,"The Borra caves in Araku Valley were just magnificent. Full of beautiful stalactites,stalagmites and complete pillars. Discovered in 1807 but said to be 150 million years old. The sudden disappearance of a grazing cow led to its discovery. The lighting is a little garish but doesn't mask the grandeur of the caves. Highly recommended to hire a local guide easily available outside the caves."
Impressive cave on a nice location,The Borra cave is a huge cave which is located at a very nice spot. You can enter the cave on your own and there are also guided tours. The area around the cave is also nice and you can walk around. There are a lot of monkeys! Be careful with your bags.
A marvelous creation of nature,"Borra Caves were discovered by William King George in 1807 by Geological survey of India, which are located on East coast of India. Borra caves are located in the Araku Valley of the Anathagiri Hill Range. It is 90 km away from Vishakhapatnam and mostly a hill road journey which will take around 3 hours at normal traffic. There is train service also available from Vishakhapatnam, which is running between Vishakhapatnam to Araku and one has to get down at Borra Guhalu Station. This train will go through 58 Tunnels.Borra caves were formed as a result of the flow of Gosthani River on the limestone deposits. A marvelous creation of nature.Bongulo chicken is one which is famous here. All Non Vegetarians want to have once in a life this bongulo chicken. Don't miss it in your next tripBest time to visit is November to MarchNear By Attractions:	1. Araku Valley	2. Galikonda View point	3. Katiki Water Falls	4. Araku Tribal Museum	5. Araku Cofee Museum	6. Kothapally waterfalls	7. ChapaRai falls	8. Padmapuram Gardens Entry Charges:Adults: 70 INR, Childs: 45 INR, Digital Camera: 100 INR"
Underground caves with great lighting,"The cave is beautiful. They have installed very colorful lightings, which gives a really good ambience, combined with the naturally formed unique shaped rocks.The cave opens at 10a.m and we were there much before that to avoid the crowds. However, the ticket counter opened 10 mins late and people who couldn't tender exact change were made to wait to buy tickets.When we entered the cave, it was like a different world. The cave is very wide, but not too long.After a while, the cave got too crowded and some people were whistling and shouting too loudly, which is very irritating, given that it is a closed space and the voice echoes. Tribals had also come to perform pooja for deities inside the cave. They were seen climbing the rocks in restricted areas for this, but we could also see other tourists doing the same thing to click pictures. One suggestion for the staff is to control all these and take strict actions against those violating the rules, which would be good for other tourists and also help in preserving this natural attraction."
Borra Caves,Takes a couple of hours to reach the Borra caves from Vizag ... try taking the early morning train from Vizag and get down in the station called Borra Guhalu. The train passes through a series of tunnels. Not a normal experience which one has. Caves remind us of geography classes back in school and actually get to see stalagmites and stalactites
just caves,"nothing special about this place.. some caves near to the famous hill station near vizag, araku valley.. has some interesting history"
Beautiful caves but visitors were not disciplined,"Beautiful caves. People were not disciplined. They were touching the formations which took millions of years to form. Also, the caves were made religious by making some formations religious symbols. It's a tourist attraction, not a religious place."
Great place,"Recommend you take the time to go and visit the caves. Lots of monkeys around also. The area was very clean. One of the cleanest tourist sites ive been to visit here. Toilets were clean, no western toilet but was fine"
Natural marvel spoiled by silly lights,This is an amazing discovery that people thronged to see till recently. I have to say the stairs made it very easy for people to go till the very end of the cave. But the party lights are simply disgusting. Simple white lights would have  have been enough. I am sure no one wants to see blue stalactites and green stalagmites. Those who have been to Kolkata during Durga puja have seen at least one pandal with the exact same interiors.P.S. The place is closed from 1pm to 2pm for lunch. Make sure you buy the ticket and enter the cave before that. Also there is a steep climb from the car parking to the gate of the cave. So try reaching there at least by 12.15 pm if u dnt want to waste the one hour lunch
Caves,The whole experience gave me a glimpse of India's natural heritage and what this beautiful country can offer to an international tourist from Afica.
"Very rare to see, unique kind of caves","As the name suggest, it's the caves with hole at the top of hill. Starting from top, these natural caves extends up to bottom of the valley, where a river is flowing. The caves are now well developed by the government with properly constructed steps and colourful lightning. The history of the cave is based on mythological story.Worth to visit for unique experience.Be prepared for steep hiking to enjoy this place at the fullest."
The magnificent borra cave,Its a must visit place if u havent seen borra then you hv seen nothing its really a huge natural cave the moment u see it will hypnotise u u cant take ur eyes of it
Borra caves- Amazing experience,"This is the most beautiful cave that I have visited. You are able to travel 350 mtrs inside the cave.Lot of steps to climb down and top. Near to Borra station. After getting down at Borra station, you can get share cabs for trip to Borra caves and Araku valley@ 350/- per person. You have to bargain.Also do try Bamboo chicken."
Must Visit while on the to Arku Valley,"These were wonder caves formed naturally a millennia  ago. you will feel thrilled in side these caves, it also have a Shiva temple inside .Avoid visiting on weekends or public holidays"
Nature's Attraction,Interesting Place; a natural formation of stalactites and stalagmites in side the cave with a breath taking view of various shapes and sizes. Well illuminated and made attractive for the visitors. However there can be  explanation Audio video presentations and  info boards can be added th make the visit a learning and right experience. Also there can be a souvenir shop  with T shirts Key chains and replicas which can generate revenue to make the place better. There are paid freelancers who act a guide but their authenticity is a question mark. Wheel chair access is not done hence this place cannot be accessed by differently abled people.
Borra Caves,A place of geological importance. A good opportunity to see stalactites and stalagmites. Approach is a bit tiresome cause of bad roads. With lesser crowds you can enjoy it
"Borra Caves, Taaki Valley","An attraction for one and all, Borra caves are located in Araku Valley. This a natural beauty attracting visitors. Worth visiting a place, about 3 hours drive from Visakhapatnam. Besides old existing caves, one can notice new formations within are coming up as well. The site is inder control of APTDC and caves are open to visit round the year during day time."
"150,000 year old caves!","Found more than a century back these caves are more than 150,000 years old! If one is interested in seeing Stalactites &  Stalagmites or is a Physical Fitness freak, interested in getting down 400 steps & climbing back a similar number of steps, one should not miss these caves.If you are not physically fit you can as well avoid it after getting 50 odd steps to get an idea of these caves.We landed up on a Sunday, jam-packed with huge crowds! Visit preferably on a working day."
"Borra Caves, Aarku valley","Too crowded. Nothing different about it from other caves except it's huge and has been fitted with Lightning. If you are not a fan of caves, you can skip it totally. But a cave lover, you might enjoy this one"
The Natural n untouched cave,Highly recommended! People roam all around the world to visit so many monuments and places to explore .I can bet our India is not less than that if you visit once this Beautiful cave situated just a 70 km drive from Vizag city . It's so big once u enter and so deep inside  feels like really adventurous. Some people showed us the point where the railway line goes right on top of the Borra Caves. Ticket is nominal and the counter closed by 5 pm in the evening.
Well kept and must to visit place near Visakhapatnam.,Borra Caves is nearly 3 hours drive away directly north of Visakhapatnam. This place is highly underrated especially its scale. It is huge cave with many stalactites and stalagmites structure. The best thing about Borra caves is its management and colorful lighting. I strongly recommend visiting this place.
Great caves with wide area,"Borra caves are located in the annathagiri giri hill range of eastern ghats. It is around 40km far from araku. Buses, trains & autos facility are available to go there.very  big caves & needs guide to clearly know everything about caves. In total, it's must sight to visit if visit to vizag."
Majestic Caves ... Chaotic Arrangements !!,"While the overall caves are natural marvel and a different experience altogether. The tourist destination is great in itself but it is poorly managed and really made me uncomfortable while i was travelling with the family. I personally did not enjoy it.Sincere request to AP tourism to seriously to do a safety assessment of the arrangements at Borra caves. It has an urgent need to scale up the operations and management of the destination. In all no crowd management best practices at this place. To highlight a few aspectsSingle line for both incoming and outgoing crowd. Narrow and uneven stairs make it more dangerous. Some attempts to manually segregate it but not effective. No guidelines on how many people can enter the caves. Narrow passage and too crowded walkways and stairs makes it claustrophobic. No Emergency exit provisions. With narrow stairs and overcrowded place it is unimaginable how so many people can come out.No consideration for public convenience. For a place that is visited by thousands of people daily having just one toilet and that too small is not enoughParking can be more streamlined. Although we have some designated places for bus, car other vehicles but it at peak hours it is all over the place"
Highlight of Vizag trip,The sheer size of this natural wonder leaves you with quite an awe. The only let down is the colored lights which kind of spoils it's natural beauty.
Borra caves,"About hundred kilometres from Vishakhapatnam are the very ancient and the deepest and largest caves in India. These are in the eastern mountain ranges of Ananthagiri hills of Andra Pradesh. It is a treat to see the stalactites and stalagmites formed by the limestone. You have to walk quite a lot inside the caves. There is a small Shiva lingam inside and there are some stories about it, like lord Shiva is supposed to have rested here etc. When you visit Araku valley you must visit the Borra caves."
Good one,This is a Good one to visit for tourists. If you carry big bags you need to keep at the cost of 10 rupees per bag . Small hand bags are allowed . Incase of crowd it is difficult to reach top . Bit difficult to carry kids in crowd . But worth to visit . Go till top where shiv linga is there .
Spectacular,Surely one of India's great sites it does not disappoint. It does get crowded at times but it is worth it. And do try out the instant pictures-they do a good job of it.
awsome nature creation,"Borra cave is just awesome, this cave is formed by natural process. It is difficult to imagine how such big cave is formed. Stair cases are made to enter the cave and explore.The cave extends upto 1km inside.At least 2 hours are needed to explore. You can monkeys around."
Nature's creation at its finest!,I went to visit Visakhapatnam this year with a friend and decided to give these caves a visit. One of the best decisions I've made! These caves are incredibly beautiful.
Y. N Prasad ,Beautiful natural formation. Care should be taken to prevent grafitti writing by senseless tourists.
Awesome exp,"Vizag always surprised me, the cave was really excellent, the way of going Araku valley by train was excellent, the tunnels while going to Araku valley was unforgotten experience"
Borra caves excellent tourist spot 90 KMS away from Vizag,While travelling to Araku one should give atleast 2-3 hours in Borra Caves. Its approx 90kms from Vizag and 27 kms from Araku. One can travel by road or by Train to Borra Caves. The train station is approx few meters from the cave. Avoid visiting from 1-2PM when there is lunch break and visitors are not allowed to enter during this time. Sol plan accordingly ensuring no time wastage. APTDC restaurant is just beside the entry gate and one can have meals during this break.
Inviting but needs Extensive Cleaning Up,"After a fabulous stay at Visakhapatnam, one of the cleanest cities in India, it was very disappointing to visit Borra Caves, a dirty and crowded approach, filthy toilets, littered, inadequate traffic control..the Ministry of Tourism must address this issue urgently"
Natural and Raw,Awesome place and one can go nearer to nature. Beautiful lights make the caves look more beautiful. Must visit
Borra,Borra caves is one of good place we can enjoy lot this place we can travel with family friends and children's also we have to visit this place in winter there is an greenery around the borra caves it is good place I visit this place  throealy with family it is good
Lacks the Charm ,"It is hard to criticise anything natural but honestly nothing was natural about the experience except when the idea of being inside a cave. The formations are obviously natural  - but you cannot enjoy in natural light - thanks to some  brilliant mind that decided to beautify the caves with lights that change colours a few seconds.You have small shops, photographers shouting, screaming and playing loud music inside the cave. Where you would expect calm, quiet and  bats you just find a marketplace. If one has visited any of the cave sites in other countries ( at least in SE Asia ) - they would know how important it is to keep quiet to not disturb the natural habitat. By this post I can only hope that someone in authority reads this and does something to make the experience more natural and better. And yes - please get rid of those hideous lights. People can use their mobile phone torch to see, if they want."
Borra Caves,"Extensive caves of Calcium deposition which reach the floor from the top. The cave is electrified, and the stairs reach to every nook of the caves. There is also a place where the goddess is worshipped."
"Visit To Borra Caves, Vishakhapatnam",I had been to Borra Caves in the last week of October’2019.It had been a nice experience to go down and going inside the Caves. The caves are over a million years old and  full of stalactites and stalagmites which are beautifully illuminated with various colour lamps.These stalactites and stalagmites are in their individual natural stunning shapes.I had fully enjoyed this trip inside the Caves.
An unforgettable experience,"its the creation of Nature, and located in the middle of a place will full of natural beauty .its located around 90 Km from Visakhapatnam (by rod) though its better to visit Borra Caves by Train ( but because we done have advance plan, we could not get train tickets ) . its a must place to visit , if you are visiting the region, a few suggestions 1. Its always better a hire a guide to show around the cave , the information that they share will make your visit more significant. they charge only 100 Rs./group, and even they click some beautiful pictures of your group inside the cave, they are equipped with torch 2. The Photographers that are placed with equipment  inside the cave are stealing the calm and peaceful ambiance inside the cave.3. The lights that are highlighting the rocks inside the cave , are stealing the natural beauty of Cave, they should be more natural, 4. Good fitness level is required to visit Borra Caves, as you need a climb many stairs while returning from caves.5. Its always better to plan a visit Via Train"
Superb caves,This is a very big caves which is almost 500 m deep inside. Made of Calcium deposit which makes it very nice.
Beautiful and Strange,This was the first time I visited a cave. It is is a naturally created cave created around 115 million years ago. Very big and its impossible to think how it would it was created. Ticket price for adult is 70. Children below 5 go free. Children from 5 to 12 pay 40. Parking is available and free. There are two small eating shops outside the cave. There nice not very good. You will also find few small local shops from where you can buy some interesting show pieces. The road to Buddha caves is in good shape however it passes through ghats. So you need to be skilled driver to drive to this place. Happy caving.
It could be better,"Borra caves is definitely a geological wonder. It is huge and has some fantastic natural formations worth amazing at. And the best part is that formations are still happening and u can see them right now. The minuses are. 1. The garish colour lighting. It takes away the natural beauty. 2. It has become very touristy drawing people who would ""tick"" their list but ideally it should have solitude for a genuine student or someone who appreciates nature. 3. I remembered Gol Gumbaz in Karnataka where u hear only shouts and it is the same here. 4. We need some knowledgable guides and not amateur photographers with a torch who double up as a guide. 5. We need better refreshment shops since the place is quite hot and the visit involves climb down and up.6. Finally ,transport to that place. (I have covered that separately). But,overall, do not miss. It is awesome. Worth a visit."
Borra Caves,Wonderful creation of Nature. Mesmerizing view of cave. Well maintained. It's a added feather on the cap of Arakau Valley's beauty. I liked it.
Family tour,Very nice and attractive too. Travellers can spend a whole day easily. They must taste bamboo chicken which is very delicious.
Unique mesmerizing experience,"It was unique mesmerizing experience. It was mind-blowing to see what all shapes sheer force of water can create. The good part was that we reached there by 10:30 so there was no so much rush till then. A strongly recommend taking a guide as it's totally worth spending 100-150 Rs on that. There are lot many stairs (100+) in reaching to borra coves and then lot many (few hundred) in the caves which hurts more while climbing back. However, as we reached in the morning so it was not tiring for us. Non-slippary stairs and excellent weather inside cave (due to water running at places) also helped."
Visited twice,Once v visited around two decades back n second was recent Now lot of crowd Needs better crowd management Be careful in climbing up n down Water dripping at places
"Nice, Ancient caves, Natural formation","Bora caves is accessible by train from Vizag and by car also, It is very good and advisable to visit Aarku valley by train from Vizag and visit Bora caves while coming back to vizag by car. This is cost effective and both different natural view experience."
Amazing caves,"We were eagerly waiting to see this place during our recent visit to Vizag. After seeing other tourism points we finally reached at 5pm here. We spent 1hour but min two hours required to enjoy the cave and to take photographs.Very exiting and amazing place, formation of various shapes and rock from limestone. Different colored LED light on caves and rocks makes it more attractive.Must visit..."
Visit at Borra Caves,The cost for entry has been escalated for payment of cameras and mobile phones. The steps are slippery and the handrail of the stairs are far apart. This is really difficult for senior visitors. There is a paucity of oxygen as you go deep inside the caves. Artificial draught system is required inside the caves. However the mammothness and the intricate beauty  of the structure insignifies all the shortfalls.
"Grossly overrated, poor crowd management","Visited in October and, unfortunately, on a weekend. The stairs were so crowded that we were not able to get down comfortably. Returned midway without entering the caves."
Mesmerizing Geological Formation. But visit if you can able to climb down & up 200 Ft. without much problem,"Very rare place. One has to visit this Cave once in a life time, to know how the geological formation would be. Speleologist would undoubtedly love this place. This cave looks different, at different heights and it is really mesmerizing. But for the aged persons or people suffering from heart dieses or with joint problems, it is better not to visit this cave, as one has to climb down & up minimum 100 ft. to have glimpses of this cave (for simple imagination, one Floor Height will be around 10 Ft.) & especially during summer it would very strenuous also."
The deepest caves in India.,"The Borra Caves, are located on the East Coast of India, in the Ananthagiri hills of the Araku Valley in Andhra Pradesh. The caves, one of the largest in the country, at an elevation of about 2,313 ft.The caves are basically karstic limestone structures extending to a depth of 260 ft, They are basically karstic limestone structures extending to a depth of 80 m and are considered to be the deepest cave in India. British geologist William King discovered this million years old cave in the year 1807. November - March are the best months to visit this destination. The interior of these amazing caves are lit with 63 lamps of mercury, sodium vapor and halogen. Donot forget to take a camera at the time of entrance."
incredible natural phenomena,"I was initially worried about the steps i would have to walk up and down because of torn ligaments in my knee plus I am Claustrophobic. however didnt have to worry on either count. even though there was some rain and the stairs as well as floor in most places were wet , there is a solid banister all along the steps to hold on to, which I recommend one holds on to anyway as it gives support for the climb. also there are only a couple of spots where you have to crouch through but otherwise it was quite spacious and I didn't feel claustrophobic at all. and of course having taken care of these two concerns I could thoroughly enjoy the beauty of the natural rock formations and the really deep and large cave. some beautiful lighting.I made my wife do an initial recce to check if I would be able to manage it. but hope this review does the same for all future viewers.a decent walk around takes about 30-45 minutes. at the bottom there are photographers who will take your photo and give you an instant polaroid for 40 Rs. Please done take a selfie. The focus will be your face and you will miss the beauty of the vastness"
Best place to visit,"First we went to  Aracu valley and on returning  visited  excellent Nature's excellent creation Borra caves on 14 September 19 when season was pleasant with rainy evening.  APTD has made excellent coloured light arrangement so inside of caves get illuminated.  Inside smooth road and staircase prepared to see every part of the caves. One should visit upto end part then only we get an idea how beautiful are the caves. Since caves entry closed 5PM , it is better one should reach early so 3-4 hours can be spend comfortable inside and sufficient time to climb in & out of the caves. Better to be with company while visit as one may not feel alone. Commentary on history and describing caves  each part is going on speakers installed in various part . Many youngsters make loud noises so elder one may get scared but don't worry . Don't take food material inside & don't throw plastic bottles/ food rappers inside as it will spoil beauty of caves. You may also notice many bats flying in deeper part of the caves. But its won't harm you."
Naturally formed caves with an amazing View!,"Borra caves are naturally formatted caves and looks so amazing. Many stones here are formatted in natural shapes like humans, animals and in other shapes. Light works inside the cave makes it more attractive."
Worth the visit,"You will find many reviews on the caves, so let me write something else here:1. Keep it a pleasure trip instead of...oh let me touch this place too :-). Take a morning train from Vizag, enjoy the crowd and ride. You will hardly find anything to eat in the train except samosas, tea / coffee. So for your children's sake, plan and carry something to eat.2. Don't get into the trap of bamboo chicken / biryani. It is interesting to see how it is made, other than that it is not at all the worth to have it. I have my doubts if at all they really cook it in the bamboo or just an eye wash. If you really want to have it, just stand there and get it made in front of you. All the joints ask to pay advance and ask to visit the caves.3. There is a Mian who makes really good mitha pan, worth having it;4. From the station, the caves are walkable, there is no need to hire a cab unless there are senior citizens who can't walk for 15 minutes.3."
Rare caves,These caves were located on the way the Araku while going by road..these caves were of stalagmites and lit by which are very huge and dark..There is also a small temple inside the cave..We can also find water dripping from those stalagmites In the cave
site seeing,Only children above 12 years is recommendable & old age people better not to visit. Route to this borra caves is horrible.
Borra caves,Nice place... Must visit... The ambience and location makes it worth a trip... Arakku and other places nearby makes it a must visit
Magnificent but a lot of walking ,"Very well maintained cave and do wear comfortable shoes as it was massive and a lot of walking. We walked down and up a lot of stairs, the inside was lovely with coloured lights to make the cave look more magnificent."
Nature's marvel dating 150 million years,Amazing natural creation.But need stamina to walk up and down.lighting should have been more natural.Walls remind of famous rock paintings.A temple inside adds up the mystery dating more than 150 million years.A must see
Borra gruhaalu ,"The caves are excellent and amazing. Well maintained and are extremely beautiful. U can get best pictures inside the caves. I would advise each of you to carry water bottles while entering caves. And discharge yourself and become free before entering caves because it would be extremely difficult once you enter the cave. You need to come back all the way just to urinate urself. In case if you are non-vegetarian, never forget to eat bamboo chicken there. It is the one of my favourite dish till date. The taste is amazing and will be cherished by you throughout your lifetime. Initially we ordered one kg of bamboo chicken. It was so delicious that we dint even think of next minute and ordered another kg. You can have it with roti or can have it like a starter. You will remember that chicken more than the cave. You feel that walking after long way is after all worthy. Try to order chicken before entering cave because it takes one hour of time to cook. So after returning you can enjoy the food."
Great Historic Plcae.,A must go place in the way of araku and vizag. I would like to suggest every one that must visit this place and visit with guide because without guide you dont know about what this place have ....
Revisiting Chemistry Classes,"One would have read about stalactites & stalagmites in their schools but here in Borra Caves, we actually saw their formation over millions of years. There is an entry fee and if you dont buy a separate camera ticket, then you are not allowed to take your mobiles inside. Inside there are guides available who explain the formation although we did not take one. One can go through the entire caves which have illuminated lights to view the various formations."
superb experience,Please do take a guide with you. They usually charge around 100 rupees per family and it is totally worth it.
Staff is very rude here but the place is good,Staff behaves worst than any govt employees.. they were making obscene gestures and insulting elderly ladies. I wish i would know the mechanism to escalate  their behavior
Splendid view,Deepest caves you wanna see please pack your bags...... wanna see the preview google it... worth visiting it.
Its a kind of tour in itself.,"Best place to visit with kids studying above class 5,as they will enjoy learning about stalactices rock formation and how nature is powerful.Better to avoid old people as it has almost 4000 steps to walk over.Place worth visit in araku."
Holiday spot near vizag,"A perfect holiday place..Offers both adventure and knowledge..Good to see stalagmites...Well maintained. In the old en days no fixed lighting is available, now it is illuminated...Good place to relax from routine"
Awesome place,Excellent place to visit.I was simply awestruck from the time i entered the cave.Natural environment.
Good place to visit ,"It's one of the best place in visakhapatnam and aruku if any visit vizag don't miss this place  because of greenery and borrakase and water falls , coffee plants every thing it's like wow factor ."
Stalagtites and Stalagmites,"Wow - Great place to bring in your kids and family - lot of thinks to observe and do take a Guide he will show you a lot of interesting  shapes , don't forget to eat the Bamboo Chicken  Dry or Biriyani just  near the cave . its a must for foodies."
Stalactites and Stalagmites,"School time reading of these 2 concepts of Stalactites and Stalagmites came alive when we visited the Borra Caves. We traveled by the VistaDome train which is an open carriage. There is only 1 carriage in the train from Vizag. A very unique experience in the train.The Borra Caves are long winding caves with good lighting and steps provided, however there are over 600 steps so unless you are fit, it would be a difficult haul. But worth the walk"
Nice place to visit with family,Nice place to visit with family...Beware of Monkees... We visited this place in April and it was an awesome experience... Loved the place...
One must see place in Vizag,"Good cave experience. Mischievous activities of monkeys on the way are adding some spices {though one should be careful to stay away from them. Sometimes, they become too aggressive!}. Maintenance inside the cave should be improved. Though some spots were dangerous {specially for kids & elderly people}, didn't notice any special protection folks/ security guards. So, you should be on your own ... Overall experience was good ...."
Borra caves,Famous place to visit  .I visited with my friends we enjoyed a lot lots of ancient sclupters are there..
Experience the Cave in Real,"Good to have such natural cave in Borra, Andhra Pradesh. Cave is large and well maintained. Too rush in any time of the year, Reach as early as possible to get ticket, No e-Ticket option available. So need to stand on line to buy ticket."
Once worth visiting.,Worth visiting once. Be careful while climbing stairs. Inside it's quite dark. More pedestal light should be installed.Beware of monkeys. They will grab any food items in yr hand.
visit to Borra caves,"We went to the caves from Vizag by road,the landscape is very beautiful.The caves are well maintained and entry fee is nominal.Just near the entry gate you have an opportunity to taste Bamboo chicken."
Do take a guide when you visit the Borra Caves,Borra caves burrowing deep into the hill expose a fascinating range of stalactites and stalagmites. Unfortunately loud crowds mar the experience. It is well worth engaging a guide who can point out to remarkable resemblances in the natural structures to gods and goddesses as well as man-made  artifacts like chandeliers
Winter tour,I visited this place with family. These are very ancient caves. It was so beautiful. It is must visit place.so visit.
Amazing natural caves,Stalactite and Stalagmite forming this cave is really a nature's gem.With some colourful flashlights interestingly placed in the caves added its beauty. The cave is well maintained by the authority.Stairs were made nicely for approaching different area of the caves. A must see in tour itinerary of Vizag.
Beautiful Natural Formation,The Borra caves are about 2 - 3 hrs drive from Vizag. The caves have beautiful natural rock formations which have made it a popular tourist destination. The caves are well lit and the entire area is well managed by AP tourism department.
Nice drive (like 1:30 min from the city). Cave is not bad.,"The drive and the mountain are nice, the cave is kind of average with too many people and noisy. Overall, I would give it 3.5."
A Must Visit-Borra Caves,"Borra caves have magnificent stalagmite [crystal pillars] and stalactite [hanging icicles]] formations formed millions of years ago from the nearby limestone hills. The caves are easy to walk down [around 120-150 steps] and explorable by every age group. Well illuminated for ease of viewing and exploring.

Not for the weak-kneed,"Visited the Borra Caves....having studied geology at the master's level it was an item on the bucket list.But for all those who are 50+,slightly on the heavy side,having breathing difficulty it is a strict no-no.The steps are steep,going down also requires use of muscles in the legs and climbing up can be a ordeal even for the normally fit.Well,frankly it is a let down.No natural light enters the cave .The artificial lights lend a modicum of visibility....in its absence it  would be pitch dark.The guide,if you hve hired one will point out  to structures resembling some dieties or celebrities,but that is mostly auto-suggestion and the devout would no doubt marvel st the handi-work of  nature.If you are going with family be assured that the kids will find it boring and the not-so-fit will opt out.So no point inmaking the trip if you are not genuinely intetested."
Borra caves,"Bora caves are located on the way to Araku,at a distance of arround 90km from vishakhapatnam.The caves are located in the midst of the Godavari river,beautiful hils and valleys"
Am ust visit place if you are in Vuzag,A memorable experience while entering inside the caves. colorful lightening makes it more decorative. Water dripping from the top and rock formation are eye catching. You have to be careful while going down and coming back as staircases are narrow. Better to wear non slippery shoes and the floor is wet at many places. Try to reach in the day time and also visit waterfall close to it. Luggage is restricted but you can store it outside on payment. Photography is chargeable.
Mother nature at her best,Awesome experience. Must visit while on Vizag trip. Take 6:50 AM train to Araku up to Bora guhalu. Go through about 45 tunnels and magnificent views. Don't rely on train for back journey. It could be late by several hours. Instead take bus to Vizag.
Awesome View,One of the hidden jems of Visakha District. The experience was splendid and formation of the caves made me amaze.. Journey to the Caves were a bit hectic as its 120 km from Visakhapatnam
Just awesome cave and best part of Araku single day trip,Borra cave is almost half way to Araku. If you are going for single day trip to Araku then would suggest you spend good time here as this is the best attraction of the trip.Entry fees is there but a full paisa vasool.You have to go Dowm the cave. There are many stairs and then climb up back. There are colour lights at different place that make it look more beautiful. Old people ma u face trouble and their is no assistance.Carry your water bottle.
Wonderful natural caves,"Deepest natural karstic limestone caves in India. This is a must visit place near Vizag. Since this place is approximately 90 Kms from Vizag city, it is better to arrange for a taxi or own vehicle to reach here. Well protected & maintained bu govt. with good lighting and  guides are also available here."
Nice trip,"Caves were great, spent about an hour there wandering round. Busy when in there with lots of photo opportunities"
Borra cave  at Anatagiri hills,"Excellent  place ,In our life should visit this place,good learning for children's,should move in group inside the cave ."
A deep cave,This cave is a very deep cave and you have to go downwards a long to reach at the end so please be careful about this cave.
Follow these tips,"There is no doubt that Borra caves are simply amazing and are far better than all other places in vizag. One should reach here by 10 am (opening time) as u will not find crowd at this time. Please take a guide (they charge around 100-150 RS), otherwise u will not be able to understand what u r seeing. Elders with joints problems may find it difficult to climb the stairs. Also take a water bottle with u for kids."
Thrilling,It was great walking inside the huge caves.Did not imagine the magnanimity of the caves before the real visit.A great experience.The artificial coloured lights seemed to have reduced the natural feel though.A very crowded place.Better to be visited just after it opens in the morning.
Breathtaking Caves,"The first glimpse of the cave and you have a drop jaw.Massive entrance to the cave can describe it as a King of Caves. and than it drops down deep inside. Steps have been made to enable viewers to go deep down to the bottom of the cave.Water trickles along the walls of the cave and at one point you have the huge stalactites dropping down as a molten lava.the only disappointing thing is the coloured lights that are fitted inside which mars the beauty of the caves.Other than that, the cave is worth a visit."
"Awesome natural caves, a must visit place in Araku Valley","Borra Caves are natural caves, believed to be millions of years old and are situated  in the Ananthagiri hill ranges in Eastern Ghats at a distance of about 90 kms from Vishakhapatnam city and 37 kms from Araku (Andhra Pradesh). The nearest railway station is Borra Guhalu, which is at walking distance from the Caves. These caves are about 300 metres long with a depth of about 80 metres. The inside of the caves has multi stage stair cases and railings to help tourists go down the caves. Extra care should be taken for the elderly persons and children. The multi colour illumination inside the caves gives an impression of entering a different world of fairy tales. The view of the river Gostani from the view point just before the entrance of the caves is also fascinating. There is an entry fee for this attraction. Cameras, bags etc. can be kept an adjacent Cloak room for a nominal fee. There are plenty of eateries outside the caves. Road side preparation of Bamboo Chicken is a very common sight. Ovearall, this is the most sought after tourist attraction in Araku Valley and one must not miss a visit to this place, though it remains very crowded especially during seasons."
Borra Caves,Beautiful caves visited by thousands people daily. On the Entrance you see Nandi [Bull]. as you godeep in the cave you feel more excited. at bottom you feel like that you are in adeep well.
An amazing natural cave close to Vizag,"Borra caves is a spot on the road to Araku valley from Vizag. consist of large underground cave system where amazing formations. Groups of visitors have to pass through designated routes starting from the entrance to the exit , witnessing the stalactites and stalagmites illuminated by lighting. Those with knee problem may find it tough going."
Field trip,"Last year i had went to borra caves for field trip base on project woth my classmates, i had enjoyed a lot"
bora caves,Very good to see.Must visit  by train to have the experience of about 40+ tunnels. No need to go to Araku.
A good attraction !!,Visited the Borra Caves today with family.  Was delighted to visit the natural caves. The lighting has surely improved the beauty of the spot. Needs about an hour and half to have a good well paced tour. The caves are well ventilated (naturally) and one can spot various scriptures depending on ones imagination. A good attraction just about 90 Km from the city. Well maintained by the AP Tourism department.
majestic natural caves,"Experience the energy and depth underneath created naturally over years, you can see many sculptures and artwork through natural deposition of limestone & water seeping through it. Hire a guide, costing about Rs. 100/-You can pass crawling through a narrow passage at end of the caves reaching almost halfway back, only with your guide."
Awesome natural waves with amazing patterns and rock forms,"Worth going. If u have elderly people with you, avoid taking them along as it has many stairs to climb on. Eatables-snacks are available outside, coconut water, ice creams, bhutta hot-boiled with spices."
Must Visit - You will have to walk a lot ,"The caves are scenic and historic beauty ! You can admire the peace , sculpture and beauty of light on caves ! Must wear comfortable shoe because you will have to walk around a hour or more to see the complete caves !"
Must See place with a Guide!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Very important point. Don't visit this place without a guide. Guide will explain you the different formation of the stalagmites happened from Limestone. He will show you the different shapes of the rock like, Shiv Parvati statue, Hanuman Foot print, Tiger and many ore things which formed naturally. Without guide you will understand anything.The guide charge is very nominal, only Rs. 150. So it's best recommended to visit this place with guide. Also different colorful lights are provided to see those structures and shapes formed naturally. Everyone will enjoy. Not suitable for old people. Because needs to climb down lots of stairs."
Worth a visit,The caves are worth a visit as they speak history. There is a lot of walking and climbing involved which may cause discomfort for old and very young. The colorful and garish lightings take away the natural charm and look of the rock formation. The road leading to the ticket counter has numerous stalls selling bamboo chicken and other local knick-knacks. One way of seeing the caves peacefully is to reach there early.
Exquisite nature at its very best.,"Ever someone told you that mother earth provided human civilization with far and enough to flourish. Perhaps, this place is a live example of it. Having its age in millions of years, these natural caves with enough scope for natural air and sunlight perhaps were the home for early men. This place is very well maintained despite the large number of tourist who visit this place daily. There may not be enough food opportunities for those who are not accustomed to Andhra-food but then this is real far from the main city. Nonetheless the coconut water and berries sold by the locals is enough to take you through. The walk inside the cave is an experience for the life-time. Do take back enough photo memories you can."
Burra caves is a massive example of intense geographical weathering work inside the valley of Araku on Eastern Ghat. ,"At an altitude of 910 m from sea level, Burra caves is situated in the vicinity of Araku valley inside the eastern ghat hill region. It is a massive example of geographical weathering work. The cave is neatly lighted with varieties of lights by the Andhra Pradesh tourism. Tourists groups are mainly complied with locals and Bengalis (from the state of West Bengal, India). Very rare international visitors. Visiting fees are ₹60 per person & ₹25 per camera either in the form of mobile phone of DSLRS. Instant photo printing facility is available at 2 places inside the cave. Two small Lord shive lingas can be seen. Nearest city is Vizag which is 91 km away from the cave. Not much stiffness is there on the way from Vizag to Burra but sharp bends through the hill range of Eastern ghats made the road one of the dangerous road circuits of India. Tent accommodation is available by the side of the way on places. Night drive requires fog lamps as there is no street lighting at night."
Bora caves,"From Vizag we started early in the morning around 5.30 am to Arraku Valey by car. On the way we had visited Lord Laxminarasimha Swamy temple at Simhachalam hills which is a very famous one. We proceeded towards Araku valley and on the way we stopped at Bora caves. The drive was good and it was ghat roads and as it the month of May, it was dry.When we approched the caves, we dint ecpect much from outside. But, once we passed the ticket counter and entered in, amazed to see the caves. As we enter inside its bit drak and with good lighting facilty, its a different experience all together. There are guides around but, we dint feel their services and went ahead on our own. Actually, at the end we felt that guide service is not at all required. We can go on exploring the caves as per our interest and energy at our disposal. There's a small temple inside and one can indentify the caves in many telugu movies songs. Actuaaly, these caves were indentified by a Britisher before independence and later developed. This information and other intersting fact were writen abt the caves at the entrance. Can spend 2 to 3 hours with family. Altogether a diffrent experieance."
Borra Caves,We went on a public holiday hence it was very crowded. Its must visit place and one of its kind. Natural cave with beautiful lighting.Avoid going on a public holiday as its very crowded.
Far off but very Good,"I have seen many caves, many in North East. But this one is little different, in a way that it is very wide, Pathways are made inside and it is comfortable to walk inside, these are limestone caves."
Good light work in the cave,Their is a good light work in the cave but their was nothing more. It's not a good place for hanging out with friends.
Magnificent,"Visited Borra caves and truly it's worth visiting. It's a two hours drive from vishakaptnam .Entry fees is of INR 60 for adults plus a fees of INR 25 for phone Which has camera.caves are in 3 levels with top most level is called bat caves which is not open for general public.middle level is open for public and please take a guide along so that you can know better about the types of rocks and different formations of staglamites .These caves are of different level ,so grand it's truly mesmerising.Old age people will may find difficulty in stairs otherwise it's flat inside.I wish authorities have placed tungsten lights instead of colorful lights. Worth a visit and not many vegetrains options around cave but if you like chicken then do taste bamboo chicken."
A Wonderful Experince,It is hard to believe walking in and touching something that is 150 million years old.  It was fantastic.  Word to the wise - do not go on a weekend as it is packed especially with school kids.
The best thing in Arraku,"This is a natural wonder. Never seen this type of huge cave in my life.One of the 2 tings worth spending time in Arraku , the first being the tunnels."
Terrible experience,We visited this place on a Sunday. There were thousands and thousands of people. Might have enjoyed it if the crowd was less.

Nature’s wonder,"An unimaginable place on earth. This cave is a wonderful place. Worth visiting while staying in Vizag. Naturally made more than 1.5 millions years ago, discovered in 1807."
Borra Caves,It is situated in way from Visakhapatnam to Araku. You can go there by train from Visakhapatnam to Borragulau station. It is in Anantagiri Hills. Maintained by Andhra Pradesh tourism. Good path way to go caves. Ticketed caves. Guides available. Visakhapatnam arkau train line go over the caves. Must see places in Visakhapatnam.

Natural caves,"I visited here along with my family. There is free road side parking almost 500 meters from ticket counter. There is small open place as well near road where you can easily park your vehicle as well. So parking is not a problem.There are many shops selling all knick knacks, tender coconuts, Araku coffee powder and Bamboo chicken within that 500 meters from parking to ticket counter. There is OTDC hotel near ticket counter where you get few breakfast items and veg limited meals for Rs.100The security allows only water inside caves. Food items are not allowed. Once you enter inside you will find washrooms on left side. From here the steps are present to descend into cave, if you want a guide then you need to approach someone sitting with torch with them (yes they are guides and you need to approach them). The guide will take Rs.150 for exploring entire cave in 1 hour.The steps are easy ones to descend. The cave is divided in two section, the guide will show you all sorts of shapes and sizes formed on rocks naturally. He will also show you different sort of stones and surfaces formed inside this cave. There is good and colourful lights inside which makes these caves looks more beautiful. There is ancient Shiva temple at one place where you need to climb some 30-40 steps to reach, very old peoples with knee pain and pregnant ladies should not do it. There is ample amount of place to sit inside the cave and relax. There are some professional photographers available inside the cave as well. Exploring entire cave will take hardly 1 to 1.30 hours. The climbing or walking inside is not at all hectic, everyone can do it. The cave is not at all slippery or watery, it has good floors and railing along the pathway. No need to carry/wear comfortable shoes or anything as been adviced by some people in TripadvisorAll in all a good natural cave formation which can be explored in relax way with the help of guide. Go with your family, friends and dear ones to see this amazing cave."
Borra,Borra caves located in araku it is good place to watch comfortable with family there is gift shops and visuals place no pollution pleasant place and in the caves lighting is good it is wonderful place
Nice place,Visited this cave in October 2018. It was a nice and eerie experience visitng the caves. The cave was dark and illuminated by colourful lights.  This cave is the main attraction of Araku. The tribal museum and botanical gardens are not worth of a visit and is just time waste.
Great location,"Must visit place on Araku tour, Place which has great beauty within.Age old people be cautious as there are many steps to climb and get down. Do carry the camera with you to capture wonderful nature creation. Before entering the caves get your food ordered as you will very hungry after the visit.The charges for an adult is Rs 60, Child is 40 and 100 for Camera.Do carry a mobile with touch light only then you can capture the beauty of the caves."
Well maintained and a must visit,"Trip to Borra caves was main attraction of our vacation to Araku valley. Generally when someone talks about caves, you get a picture of small caves. Borra caves are really really huge and has many mini to big caves that you would even imagine. My family thoroughly (from my 3 years old daughter to us) enjoyed walking into the huge caves. We took a guide @ Rs. 100, he told us complete history of cave and beautiful formation crated by dripping water since millions of years. My recommendation is to take a local guide for the tour, otherwise you would not be able to appreciate the beauty of this natural structure.Cave is well maintained and lit with artificial colorful lights on Key formations of limestone structures. Exactly on top of cave Railway line passes through. There is 100 feet hill between railway line and the cave. It was interesting to see a naturally made cave pillars with millions of years of water drops. We have also seen a few Cave pillars under formation. Cave has shiny stones, which is due to limestone and marble. Guide showed us a human brain type looking structure formed due to water drops. Many areas of cave are closed for general visitor. There was a part of cave where it is full honey bees and therefore closed. A 50 feed Part of cave where you can come out of cave by crawling. In order to do this adventure, you need to be fit, thin and need a guide. Generally this place is closed for general visitors. Few more caves in here explored recently and found to be 50-100 feet long (Guide showed us one at the roof of the main cave). There were hanging ropes and stairs to climb up cave explorers.  Who should visit: It is advisable to visit with Kids above 6-7 years for educational purpose. My 9 yrs old son thoroughly enjoyed the views inside the cave. He found some small places to trek, instead of taking stairs (essentially good place if you have monkey type kids ;-)). Along with this guide made it interesting, he showed many Animal shaped formations (lion, crocodile, elephant) via natural stones and water drops. This kept the kids engaged through out the tour of cave. Elder people having issues with Knees etc may find it very exhausting. You need to 250 feet deep and then 500 feet walk inside the cave. Presence of monkeys is good attraction for kids. But you need to be careful if you or kids are carrying any eatables in their hands. Food: Before reaching caves, there is Bengali Bhojnalay. They offer good Bamboo Veg and Chicken biryani. You need to order while going and can have delicious biryani on the way back, when you are completely drained out of your batteries. This is small restaurant but tasty food. We are veg people enjoyed the food, I am sure Non-veg guys will relish it more (Adding picture of the same in my pics). I had a local driver from Araku, who informed me about this place. Looking at the restaurant we were skeptical about taste, so we ordered just 1 biryani, which we regretted later. There is an APTDC restaurant there but we didn't try it. Cleanliness: Overall approach road to cave is clean. Toilets are well maintained. You won't find garbage here and there. How to reach: We traveled via train to Araku and stayed there. We took at local cab and driver to Borra caves. Local driver also partially acted as a guide ;-)."
Well maintained,"Visiting Borra caves was the highlight of our Vizag and Araku tour. These caves descend deep and wide into the earth and the views that you get to see inside the cave are amazing. Didn't feel claustrophobic anywhere inside.There are multiple sections within the cave and all of them are well lit. Even though you can sense the presence of several bats, however there is no foul smell emanating as the tourism department has done a great job in maintaining these caves.Do not miss this natural wonder at any cost on your trip to Vizag. Ticket counter stays closed between 1-2 PM so plan your visit accordingly."
Natural wonder,"Though exploring the cave is physically exhausting (Especially for middle aged), at the end you will cherish this visit. A natural cave formed over thousands of years and only one of the two famous caves in south india."
Amazing!,Caves & monkeys. What more can you ask for! Make sure you climb to the top of the cave to the temple to get your blessing.
Too crowded,Too crowded and involves lot of walking. No good eating joints nearby. Can be skipped if you are travelling with senior citizens and kids. Interesting only if you like trekking
Amazing caves,"We could compare Borra Caves with a cave in South Africa, never knew such a place exists near Vizag ."
Nice palace,"Imaging palace , located 45 km from Araku , natural beauty , lighting facility in caves if have any questions than call me9414711009"
A must in list,Cave with nice stairs - comfy for kids & senior citizens who can walk on stairs. Plenty of natural light & electric light.
Must visit at Araku,What a natural cave! 150 million years old. very thrilling to enter into it. Excellent color display by lighting. But difficult for the aged ones to move through the steps.
Burad cave trip,350 steps  stair is very long energy use in this point . So if u have mos 350 steps  stair is very long energy use in this point . So if u have most energy in body must visit . t energy in body must visit .
Tiring but an excellent experience,"We visited the Borra Caves on 16 Oct 2018. We had seen caves in Columbus Ohio with stalactites and stalagmites and we thought it was wonderful.After the visit to the Borra Caves I feel this was much more enthralling and engrossing than that one! The AP Tourism has done a wonderful job of making the pathways, the steps and other facilities at the Caves. The insides are lit up to highlight various formations and one must not miss a visit to this site if in that area. A word of warning though - if you are not physically fit, or have any other ailment that is restrictive in nature for physical activity, please visit just the entrance level and then return and relax in the cafeteria till your companions return.There is one idea that struck me - the lighting up inside the cave is coloured, changing colours, in hues of red, blue, yellow and white. That makes it very garish. I feel nature's work would have been highlighted better if the lighting was just white/yellow."
Amazing Bora caves ,"I am writing something which may help to visit Bora caves.  If anybody has knee or joint pain please don't get upset,  just enter the caves as much as possible,  from that place anybody can enjoy the beauty of caves. The stairs / road is well built,  sufficient lights are there,  really even a kid can walk easily into the caves. Except few areas all the places has sufficient space to enjoy the beauty of the Cave. If anybody has good energy can travel all parts of the cave. One precaution while returning back give sufficient time and walk slowly otherwise you may face breathing problem. You may carry a bottle of water.  The place is good for photography."
Couple trip ,Beautiful lighting inside the caves.  Road trip was also beautiful with lots of sceans. Nice place.  Even train is an option to reach there
The Amazing Borra Caves,"Locally known by the name borra guhalu, this beautiful elevated caves are located on the eastern coast of India in Visakhapatnam district. The caves are basically limestone structures and many geologists consider it to be the deepest  caves in India. This place offers a very rich flora and fauna. Best months to visit the caves are november and december. The Araku Valley, a hill station, about 30 kms away is also a very nice place to visit. Borra caves are really very nice place to visit along with family. It will be definately one of the most memorable visits."
A must visit iconic cave,"This one is a must visit place. For those who have visited other hill stations, Arakku has nothing much to offer. On the contrary, Borra caves has everything to offer. It is a massive cave and is around 100 million years old. I'd visited this place in 1992 and again now, in Oct 2018. Way back then, the cave was pitch dark barring the opening. The guide used to use 'mashaal' those days to show us the path. Things have changed drastically now. There is lot of lighting within the cave and nothing appears to be scary. This cave is very tall and wide and has many stalagtite and stalagmite formations. Too many bats within, but nothing to be scared of. take a guide. They usually charge around 100/-, but worth it. if you plan to take mobile phones inside, you need to pay another 25/- per mobile. Entry ticket is quite pricey these days. You do not have good hotels there. We are vegetarians and had absolutely no options. Fo non veg, they do cook something called bamboo chicken.you do get tender coconut water. Do take the train from Vizag to Borra caves. Train starts from Vizag at 6:50 am from platform number 6 or 7. You will come across many tunnels which kids will enjoy. In the return direction also there is a passenger train which comes from Kirandul to Vizag and is supposed to reach Borra caves at 4:48 pm but it reached at 6:45 pm and reached Vizag at 11:05, the train invariably gets delayed. That is one negative point. But, as i mentioned, train + caves is a feast overall. There are 3 sections to this cave and the 3rd section involves adventure where people would have to crawl through narrow crevices to come out near river Gosthani. This one would need the assistance of a guide and they take people on this trip only if there is a group of size 10 members and this takes 2 hours it seems"
Borra caves,"My friends came from Mumbai, I have taken them to Borra caves,they all enjoyed, the lighting is good"
A gift from mother nature!,"One of the must visit places on the way to Araku valley. It is a gift from mother nature. Beautiful caves that are well maintained. One must wear very comfortable shoes as there is lots of walking and climbing involved. There is also a nature made shiva linga that is formed inside another tiny cave. At a reasonable fare, there are many photographers and guides who can make the visit a pleasant experience."
"Nature's wonder, 150 Million years old! Yes 1 and 1/2 crores years ago, it was formed. Main attraction, Must visit.","William King the British Geologist discovered on 1807 the Borra Caves, which was formed naturally, believed to be formed 150 million years ago. Total 420 Stair case you have to go down approximate 1/2 km inside.  Stone is formed inside in various shape like human brain, goddess Shiva, Parbati, Kailash, Ganesh, Mother and child, Lion, Hound dog, Shiva ling etc formed naturally, Foot  print of Hanumanji also available.  It is believed that Lord Rama and Sita ji stayed here during their exile, The hill was broken in two parts and again joined naturally with the strongest natural adhesive which is clearly visible inside the case. Local people name the hill as Lab and Kush hill. Visitor are requested hire a Tribal Guide, other guide is not allowed inside, to make your trip successful ,  You can visualize all these natural formation of idols with the help of guide."
Trip to Vizag,A wonderful creation of Mother Nature !!Steps take us right down to the deepest part.Rocky structures take the breath away.One should carry fluids to maintain hydration.Another thing which is bothering is smell of bat droplings for some areas.Some special places for photo session is there.Keep in mind to visit the place a bit early to avoid crowding.
Extraordinary experience inside the caves!,"YOu can go in almost 400-500 metres winding through the pathways inside the caves---and in almost total darkness, except for the artificial lighting.  The stalactites and stalagmites are quite impressive too!  The floor is quite slippery and one has to be watchful of one's head also at some points! But a very exhilarating experience, especially for youngsters and those who have not seen a cave earlier!"
highlight of vizag trip,any trips to Vizag should definitely have Borra Caves in the ititernary. well maintained and perfect for a day trip
Early age stone caves,Its a marvelous stone caves. u can enjoy the caves inside lighting. u need to walk down for almost 1.5 km to visit the full caves.
Great experience,Borra Caves have absolutely beautiful lighting to enhance the experience. Stalactites and Stalagmites in shapes of animals and birds and imaginations make the visit interesting. Very well maintained compared to many tourist sites I visited in india. Must see place when one visits Araku and around
Great place,Excellent place to be with family but need a little more energy to complete all the attractions inside.
An enjoyable place,Great amount of time we can spend with friends a holiday trip a joyful place to visit I am very delighted to visit the place
Worth visit..nature's wonder,Borra caves take us to different world. One has to walk long to see the whole borra caves.but it is worth to walk.when you walk it will be slippery should be careful.
Very good trip,Entry ticket fare 60rs +25rs for camera phoneWorth place to visit... Best time to visit on September to January....week to days is best to avoid the rush....while planning from vizag book a cab and tell the driver to report in borra caves and take train from vizag....Not recommended for elder peoples...Very important don't order food without seeing the menu in the hotels..Don't miss to try the bamboo chicken
Lovely place and non regrettable,"Bora caves dates its origin to formation through water channels on the mountain.refer my picture pasted below.Do take a guide cost 100/-,  ticket cost is 60 per adult and 25 for a mobile camera.Total time required to visit cave is 1hr.Approachable by train ex vizag, package tours ex Vizag , personal vehicle of hired cab. Enough parking space and sapringly maintained location.Don't forget to take a plunge at bamboo chicken at the gates .. local Shaks and authentic.."
Long drive ,Borra Caves - Nestled in East coast (Vizag District) ! Morning and evenings are best time to visit this place. In nights it will be circulated with colorful lights which enhances the beauty of natural rock formations... This formations are due to continuous water flow on limestone's.. Better to avoid visit in Summer afternoons..
Borra Caves: Must visit,"Borra cave is huge, very very big. I hired a guide and it took me 2 hours to see it.Tip 1: Please hire guide else, you won’t enjoy it. Guide charges are 150/- Rs only.Tip 2: Carry water bottle. It is humid inside and you will sweat a lot.Tip 3: There is clock room available. So don’t worry about your luggage, drop it in clock room and enjoy cave.Tip 4: There is Lord Shiva temple in cave. It is very small, stairs are very slippery and extremely dangerous, only one can enter inside and other has to wait outside. Kids and elder person, please avoid going inside. Worship from outside"
Sight seeing attraction ,It is one of the most popular sight seeing attraction with attractive colourful lightning and one can go deep inside the caves. It has water too so very small kids n elderly should be a bit careful or don't go far inside. Though I feel it's hyped...one visit can be made if one is around. Drive from #vizag to araku valley is quite picturesque though.
A neverending long cave full of surprises. Dont give up and finish it,"The borra caves is one of the most popular destinations in arku valley. The cave is like an adventure for a beginner like me. Its never ending and full of surprises at each step.Its dark but lit with fancy lights inside.Be careful while you walk, its slippery.Photographs can be taken inside with instant print facilityWe however, asked the camera man to click us with our own camera an paid him an agreed amount..Things to do-1.Wear slip resistant shoes (since water is slippery inside the cave)2. Lot of walking involved, so pre plan the meals 3. Camera inside is chargeable4. Don't give up, its long but worth it5. mobile light will be  a great helpI have a full video based on my experience and preview of this, you can watch it on Youtube - Khushi NotOnlyMakeup"
Lovely,It is an experience of its kind. One who has live to see nature how things take shape during passage of time will love this place.The problem os of toilet and not much of good quality food is available around the caves. One has to keep this in mine while visiting it. Also it is not advisable for too old people as climbing and descending is needed carefully
Wondering experience with natural cave,Beautiful and exciting and amazing adventures experience most and must visit place on the way to araku Don't miss to visit this place but you should reach early hours like 9am otherwise when you return back you may face traffic jam
Lifetime experience,"Must see in your lifetime, Do not miss. Natural caves. Total walk of about 1-2 hrs inside. Totally worth"
Simply Mesmerizing..,The drive on the serpentine hill road of Ananatgiri Hills is a pleasure. The inside of the Cave is quite large and thanks to AP Tourism for making beautiful arrangements for the visitors..
Wonderful experience without much physical stress,Borra cave is an wonderful experience. Wonderful view of stalactites and stalagmites and over structures created by flowing and seeping water. Place is well maintained and clean.
"Magnanimous, Enchanting","We took a day taxi from Vizag to take a trip to Borra Caves and Araku Valley. It should cost one anywhere between INR 4000-5000.The first stop was Borra Caves. Though I had visited different limestone caves like Belum (Andhra Pradesh, ndia), Mawsmai (Meghalaya, India) Skocjan (Slovenia), this one was still an attraction to watch.A very mouth to enter and very well curated and lit up, the cave boasts of wide passages and fine/detailed natural erosion pattern.Unlike others, there aren't that prominent stalagmites and stalagtites probably because there isn't any running/dripping water as of now.But a good place to spend 45-60 mins. Take a guide (speaks Bangla/Oriya/Telugu/English) (100-500 INR) so that he/she can make it interesting and historical for you."
Awesome caves ,"The borra caves are a few million years old cave formation near Araku. These were found by a British traveller in early 1800. The caves are really very beautiful and well maintained by the AP government. The lighting is awesome and makes the experience quite enchanting. The drive to the caves is awesome, if you are comfortable driving in the hills, would highly recommend it. The steps inside the cave are 450 in total so the total time to fully explore the caves and come back up is roughly an hour n ten mins ( depends on how many photo stops you make 😊). Just remember to wear comfortable shoes."
Good but trouble,"This cave is good, but very trouble to up and down . Mainly trouble for aged person . Because this caves height is too much long from upper entrance to down. Nearest Railway Station is Borra guhalu. And only one train is vskp krdl pass."
Hill station ,Named as andhra ooty where naturally formed shiva lingam and caves. A must see nature caves and near by waterfalls
Natural Wonder,Nice place. Natural wonder. The rocks are formed and designed by nature. Imagination come true with magical rocks.
"Natural Wonder near Vizag Must visit, Excitement in every step","Borra caves are  natural caves, that are said to have originated from the Gosthani river, which flows through these caves.Anyone who has gone through the borra caves will definitely find it amusing."
Good one,Good one to visit once. But little unhygienic and with lot of people crowded at little place. But stalagmites and stalactites are treat to watch with underground waterfall.
"Must watch, divine presence!","It lies on the way to Araku valley, around 100 kms from Vizag. Roads were amazing. Ticket cost RS. 60/- and additional RS. 25/- for smart phone camera. Locker charge Rs10/-. Climb down around 100 steps followed by steep stairs climbing up.lighting was awesome and these caves have some natural and amazing formations. Don't forget to climb at the topmost stairs as there is one natural shiva lingam. Definitely recommended. Worth travelling 100 kms from Vizag."
must for all,its a must see attraction for all if u miss it u would repent for the same after wards u must go and explore it
Reminds you of your school's geography classes,"Very well maintained and colorful lighting of the caves have added to the charm making it pretty attractive for the tourists.The cave is covered with stalactites and stalagmites which has formed over the ages. They even have formed in the shape of Shivji and a temple has been created inside the cave. Temple is at a height and there are like hundreds of steps to reach it which lazy me avoided. But there were tourists flocking towards it so I guess it can be given a try in case you are ok with climbing the stairs.The rest of the cave is also pretty vast but at the same level with less no. of stairs so you can cover it in less than half n hour. However in case your parents or some  one have leg pain, it's better to avoid it since there is decent amount of walking involved in visiting the caves.The best part however was the charcoal chicken the locals were selling just outside the caves.. It's no oil no water chicken cooked in fire and very tasty. It's a must try when you visit caves. Just give them the order when you are entering the cave and take it while leaving. Cost was around Rs. 130 for like 250-300gm.In case you are staying in Vizag, you can plan a trip to Borra caves for full day. Totally worth it!"
Beautiful,Borra caves are well maintained .U need a lot of stamina to walk around .There are stairs so choose the people u go with carefully before heading for the caves.Good lighting arrangements.must visit.
Famous beauty near Vizag,"This place is quite a good attraction nearby to Vizag. Although this is approximately 100kms from Vizag. I visited this place twice, one is around 2006 and the recent in this June. This place have a very good lighting which enriches the experience of a Cave. One may need atleast 1hr to observe this place. There are lot of stairs, so never advisable for old people or who have back/leg pains. Please allow some more time to feel the cold ambience and take photos. I will highly recommend this place anytime."
Deepest cave ,Borra caves. Caves will surely give you thrill of ups and downs and understand the rock inside. Lights will make you see  a different shape of colours
A delight - do try the bamboo chicken from outside the one of the shops,A must place to visit if natural wonders excite you. The natural caves are well maintained with LeD color changing lighting. They could have made the lighting a bit more real and subtle rather than the flashy color changing.The facilities were clean and well maintained.
Borra caves,"Borra caves are the natural caves, that are said to have originated from the Gosthani river, which flows through these caves. The caves were created due to the flow of river over the limestone area."
Excitement at every step!!!,Anyone who has gone through the borra caves will definitely find it amusing.We were two couples visited this place. There was a huge rush being a holiday. We managed to grab the entry tickets after a waiting of 2 hrs. Though we didn’t hire any tour guide we later realized that there was alot history about this place and regretted for not doing it.We had beautiful pictures of ourselves at each corner or spots in the caces. Dslr cameras work great in the low lighting. Overall a 3 hour tour in the Borra caves left us great memories for the rest of our life.
Must visit place in vizag,Borra caves is largest cave in India with inside natural formation of lime stones of different structures. This is place where all age people will enjoy througly. Also govt approved guides available near ticket counter who gives you complete history and in and out of place. Worth visiting place. You never forget it.
Visit to Borra Caves,Good for one visit. To much crowd. Climbing stairs could be much of a task so if with kids try not to go very far inside the caves.
nice place must visit place,these are ancient caves and is easy to access from railway station. going to Borra caves by train also wonderful experience.
"Lovely place, lots of stairs to climb !!!!!",1. Unique place.2. Very well maintained.3. More than 300 stairs to climb. So patients with kee problem and the elderly to take precaution.4. Well lit with beautiful colours.5. Stalactites and Stalagmites at its shining glory !!!!6. LACK OF GOOD RESTAURANTS AROUND. SO CARRY OWN FOOD. 01 RESTAURANT IA THERE BUT NOT WORTH AS FOOD IS LIMITED. MORE OF A CANTEEN.7. Must try the Bamboo chicken at the Parking area. Its expensive at Rs 500 for 1 Kg. But for 1 time its worth a try. Tastes really good.8. Bamboo cut beer glasses were a special novelty i saw here. Picked up 6 Large Bamboo beer mugs.9. Better to go in the non summer months. However even in summer months inside the cave is amazingly cool !!!!
It’s a Cave!,Amazing! This cave is good exploration tour with children and adults. The cave is a very old one and has history to it. The inside of the cave is mesmerising. Could be scary if you are claustrophobic. Must visit!
Awesome!! must visit caves,"This is an awesome place. A must visit place if you are in Vizag. Our tourism department should develop these kind of places. They open around 10am, try eating bamboo chicken. Its awesome."
Amazing,Interesting to visit. Lot of rush on weekends. Inside there is a temple also. Wont find such caves anywhere else.
Must visit.Mind blowing caves,One of the best sightseeing locations near Vizag. Very few locations in India can match this place.Natural beauty.
Must for First Timer,"This is located on the way to  Araku Valley from Vizag and is about 2.5 Hr drive.These caves are said to be millions-years old having large palaeolithic structure made up of limestone. Such formations are common in lime stone but normally remain buried under hills foliage or underground remaining unexposed. This one is not only big but also providing dry access locating not very deep under the ground. The cave area is kept pretty clean except some part of deep end area where bat potty is littered all over and one has to be lucky not to get one from the roof top being home of huge numbers of bats. The cave has been beautified with the help of colorful lights. This is attractive for many but at the same time irritating for some due to natural color being altered due to artificial color lights. If you have small kids with you it may be better to take a guide who would show a number of rocks having shapes of animals as well as mythological characters just out of imagination as such lime stone formations do take a number of shapes due to water action.The location showing alignment of railway line above the cave structure is really exciting.The surroundings outside cave provide scenic views, the view of the river with exposed marble rocks is specially beautiful.For entering inside one has to walk downstairs. For entering into the deepest parts one has to walk more downstairs which may be exhausting. For old ones one has to take care about the exertion.Tip: Take some coconut water available near exit and some rest before undertaking further journey as it may help to recoup the energy for onward schedule."
Amazing caves,"Its located in the araku valley, about 2 hours from Visakhapatnam. One of the largest caves in India. The Caves are due formation of limestone. There is a shiv ling inside the caves. It was a very nice experience inside the caves. The beautiful formation of the rocks. View of valley is also very nice. Outside the borra caves available is the famous bamboo chicken. One should definitely try it. It is specially found there only. Overall a very good experience."
A Thrilling Experience,"It is a beautiful place and equally thrilling to walk down the huge caves. Yes, these caves are recently illuminated but there was a time before illumination when a guide would lead you through these dark caves with a fire torch.Caution: If you have any breathing issues, please be cautious as deep inside this cave you might face oxygen percentage dropping in the air, this can lead to breathing issues for some. Also at such a time if you wish to come out of the cave you will have to climb a lot of stairs; making it really hard."
Good place to visit,"Liked it, its a different exp. Good exercise as well need to climb down and up a lot of stairs. The lighting and cave structure is quite unique. Worth visiting the place."
Superb,We have to go on inside the caves..it was 200 kms inside ups n downs....the lighting is superb...really it was awesome place...
Amazing place. Beautiful to watch. Mesmerizing beauty.,Well maintained too. The lighting arrangement is also pretty goodWhen there is too much of rush..bit difficult to get tickets and have a good view of the caves. They charge Rs.25 for cellphone...so better to carry cellphone with which you can take good photographs.Better to take some food along with...in case of visiting on holidays as getting food from hotel prove to be a challenge.
Ancient Caves,A mystic place formed naturally. It is cool in the caves. Different shapes of lime rocks appearing inside the cave in laser lights.
Good visit,"It was a good trip, 2.5 hr travel from Vizag by car. Interested people can also travel by train, however the flexibility of travel will be dependent on train timings."
Must visit,Borra Caves is one of the must visit places in Araku. It is better if you go with a guide who will be available at the entrance.
An unforgettable experience,This is experiencing magic in the bowels of a hill. Fantastic stalagmites and stalactites creating strange eerie sculptures that seem out of a dream! Not to be MIssed.But be prepared to walk up and down uneven terrain and stairs--NO high heels and not for aged people.
A Never-Miss Sightseeing,"This is a wonderful creation of Nature. 'Borra' means Hole. Legends say that, there was a cow grazing on the top of the cave which dropped from the hole, later the local villagers found this huge caves in search of that cow. There's a beautiful view of River Gosthani while climbing down the stair case to see this Caves. We can find different shapes which were formed by  stalactites and stalagmites"
An exciting place to visit,Borra caves is located at a distance of about 90 Kms from Vishakapatanam on the way to Araku. Located on the east coast of India the Borra caves are situvated in the Anathagiri hills of Araku valley.It is said that British geologist William King discovered this caves in 1807.This cave is longest anddeepest cave in India.There are many steps to go down and again climb up.The lighting arrangements in the cave makes it a facinating place to visit.There is an entry fee to see the caves and also for camera.It is must vist place.One can travel to Borra Caves by road or by train. The train ride is exciting since it passes through many tunnels.We could not get train tickets and hence travelled by road.
Worth a visit from Vizag,"Borra caves are about 65 km away from Vizag and it takes about one and half hours due to Ghat roads . The drive is scenic through forest areas. It takes an hour to explore the caves. There are few hundred steps overall but they are not steep. One can stop in between if they can not walk continuously. Water dripping into caves above melts the calcium and over millennia giant formations of hanging rocks were created. These are illuminated to make them visible to tourists.Bongu Chicken , chicken cooked in bamboo stems is another interesting item for food lovers in the stalls nearby."
wonders of nature. Geological awe,Borra caves are geological formations that happened 150 million years ago. Due to prolonged chemical reactions these caves were formed by calcite. It is wonderful to visit this place.
Worth seeing place,It is a place we have to see. Youngsters can go till the end of the caves as i am 55+  I went half the way and sat down there to admire the caves. Feeling sad I was not able to go further down.
Adventerous & exciting,"a very different experience , a must visit place in arakku valley tour. steps go down inside the cave and the senior people may find it difficult to climb back.  Recommended for others, dont miss the naturally formed limestone caves"
Borra cave,"After visiting several museums parks and view points through APTDC bus ultimately reached Borra cave.This was my first visit, Was amazed to see natures spectacular creation. The lay out to visit the cave by the authority was neatly done and quite hassle free to move around . On the flip side was the artificial lighting at time i felt i am in a filmy set or a cave pub.A similar cave of smaller size have seen in Malyasia called Batu cave which is preserved more naturally even though our cave is much bigger and the formations are mind blowing inside."
AWESOME,Bora Caves are nature's beauty and a wonderful place. It is one of its kinds in India there are some caves in Meghalaya also. The cave is deep and it is mesmerizing when you go down the steps. The artificial lighting has added to the beauty. A must visit place
Nature at its best,Borra Caves are huge and very big and is also very well maintained. Rock formations due to water flow are very well highlighted with decorative lighting and also the place is adequately lit. There are lot of stairs and walking but this creation of God deserve this much efforts from us.
Must visit Place,"Dont hesitate to pay Guide charges. It is better viewed with guides because we may miss few spots which are beyond our imaginations. Loved every thrilling experience of Nature. Water, stone and Time can do lot of magics. will not say no if there is a second time too."
Good Experience,"Good place to visit.Nicely decorated with different color lights.There are lots of staircases go down the caves ,difficult for aged persons to visit total cave."
Good place to visit for young people,"Nature's creation made comfortable for common people. Young people please visit the place if you are in Araku. Though man made construction and lighting has made the natural elements artificial..still I think for mass viewing it was necessary. Advice for old people is that even if you go down do it very slowly and depending upon your age,physical ability, decide how much you should go down. Many steps and they are quite steep. Should take about 2 hrs to complete viewing. Fortunately seating arrangement is available outside the entry gate. Older people can rest there and have some snacks. About 1 hr it takes to go from Araku. Restaurant available outside the entry gate. Separate charge for camera."
Marvelous place for kids and adults alike!,"I visited Borra Caves along with my family on Christmas day in 2017. I had previously visited Borra Caves nearly 20 years ago. This is a ticketed place with tickets being Rs 100 for adults and Rs 50 for children. Please take note that cameras are all charged at Rs 100 per camera with mobile cameras too being charged at Rs 25 per camera.There is a definite change in the upkeep and management of these caves - all for the better. As already known, these caves have been around for millions of years. It is truly a natural wonder. The inside of the caves are well lit and the stairs, though steep at places are safe to climb. Once inside, there are number of spots where you can indulge in photography. At one place, there are photographers available who will take your photographs and give you a copy almost immediately. One should allot about 2 hours for this place. One cannot hurry through a place such as Borra Caves. The only place of concern is the approach road to the Caves. This is in shambles with approach roads in really poor condition. Being a public holiday, finding a place to park was a bit of challenge. Parking through free is actually raodside parking and is really very chaotic. The other aspect of concern was common to most of the touristy places in India that I have visited. Garbage is deposited everywhere around you with banana/ orange peel, sugarcane garbage, plastic waste. It is really a shame to see people litter the place with no concern whatsoever. This is an aspect that the authorities need to look into and find a solution.Inspite of all the peripheral issues around the Caves, a visit to these Caves are a must if are visiting the beautiful coastal city of Visakhapatnam. If Indonesia has its volcanoes then Visakhapatnam has the Borra Caves!"
Must visit,Really a wonderful place and nature's beauty. The cave is deep and it looks serene when u go down the steps. Great effort of construction of steps in the cave hats off.
Good place for nature lovers,Nice place for nature lovers. One of its kind in India. But artificial lightening has ruined the natural beauty to some extent. Also it’s very crowdy and some gases are also present in the cave which may pose breathing issue to some people.

must visit,a huge cave filled up with stalactites and stalagmites is a major tourist attraction. the area is clean and easily accessible
"Awesome Marvel of Nature, Exhilirating Experience","Borra Caves is about 4hrs drive by road (good roads) from Vizag. A good part of the Drive is Uphill through beautiful Hillsides. The Vast Caves, 260ft deep & 660ft long, are an Extraordinary Visual Spectacle at all times & all around. Clean, Strong, Firm, Steps with a convenient Strong Railing on both sides, as required, lead down into the Caves. The height of the steps are comfortable to step even by Senior citizens. The railings are also convenient to hold for elderly & infirm. The entire inside is aesthetically lighted with delightful colours to provide visibility of Steps even while keeping the Cave excitingly dark. The Vast interior is Cool & Refreshing & Awesomely Rugged. The single Ticket counter at the entrance for the hundreds of Visitors (on a week day !) makes purchase of tickets a painful time. Buses are stopped about 1/2 km away from the Ticket counter, which makes the Uphill Walk a needlessly daunting task. A more tourist-friendly Govt could easily provide a Bus-Drop, & Pickup, point much closer to the Ticket counter. Borra Caves is a Must-See for anyone interested in a low-cost Real life Thrill of Nature."
Not appealing,"The coloured lights really killed the natural appearance of the cave. Added to it, the crowd. In short, if you are keen in visiting, visit during non peak season"
This place is around 120 Kms from Visakhapatnam,"Excellent place to visit.Carry torch and wear sports shoes, ladies to wear comfortable dress for long walk... Avoid weekends as it is too crowded."
Must visit place in vizag,It is the place where we find historical creature and it's about a 1500 years old place with a great feelings.I assure you when visit this place You will defiantly not disappointed.I value your money and time that's why I'm giving assurance you will defiantly enjoy this place with Huge crowd.
Must visit place,"Magnificient view....natural cave.... If you miss Bora caves, ur vizag tour will be considered as incomplete... Must visit..."
Mesmerizing experience,"The Borra Caves, are located on the East Coast of India, in the Ananthagiri hills of the Araku Valleyof the Visakhapatnam district in Andhra Pradesh. The caves, one of the largest in the country, at an elevation of about 705 m  distinctly exhibit a variety of speleothems ranging in size and irregularly shaped stalactites and stalagmites. The natural  formation of different shapes is treat to watch if you believe in ancient culture. Overall the place is nicely maintained by gov of Andhra and worth to visit by taking assistance of local guide who can add more knowledge about the place."
Amazing ancient super cave.,"This is a very big ancient cave system. The cave is very well lit and you can view it without caving gears. The cave is great for the geology enthusiasts, ones tied up with history and anthropology."
Must Visit place.,Try to visit early in day. not required to take any guide at all. You can roam around by yourself no problem at well.
Fab experience,Borra caves was one of the highlights of our trip. They are well-maintained and one feels like travelling through time and experiencing the story it has to tell.
Nature's architecture,"Borra caves are considered amongst the largest caves in India. They are estimated to be some 150 million years old. Borra caves are located around 2.5-3 hrs drive from Vizag city (about 90 kms). If travelling by train, one should get off at the 'Borra Guhalu' station.Coming to the caves, they were formed by the reaction of humic acid from water and the various minerals constituting the local hilly region. The caves are famous for their stalactites and stalagmites formations. The interior of the caves go down to almost 650 mts, however only 350 mts are open to public. The caves are lined with stairways making it easy to walk and explore the caves. The caves will definitely be a delight for someone who enjoys and appreciates geography and geology.Ticket prices as on January 2018 was INR 60. However an extra INR 100 will be charged if you carry a camera and a further INR 25 if you carry a mobile with a camera. There is a cloakroom where you can deposit your belongings at nominal charges.Visit to the Borra caves is a must. However be prepared for some disappoinents. It is advised that you take a guide, however it's a bit difficult to find one who is good enough. The other major disappointing thing is, who in their right mind installs nightclub lights inside caves? The ever changing colors completely ruined the natarul texture and color of the caves. Also avoid visiting the caves during holidays since the huge rush just ruins the atmosphere inside the caves. The place becomes loud and noisy to the point of irritation."
Time capsule,"A brilliantly crafted piece by time & nature. 150 million years old,the caves themselves speak their story.Place opens at 10 AM,so go between 9-9:30 AM to avoid staying in line."
Memorable trip to down under,The caves are nice and the maintenance is awesome. We had a very nice guide who explained everything in details. Every formation is given a religious angle relating it to a god. We were the last people in there as we arrived quite late and it was a very nice trip into almost secluded massive caves.
Caves are wonderful,It's visiting period is from September to February and especially in November & December is excellent. we can visit with family also
Wonderful place ,"It is stated to be 150 million years old , naturally formed caves .The government has laid out safe steps for people to climb down and up within the caves  , provided hand rails at all places for safety . Elderly people can think of carrying their walking stick for a comfortable walking inside the caves .It is wonderfully presented to the visiting public with attractive lighting arrangements and audio explanations given through speakers kept at number of places .It is a unique experience going through the caves which you will remember for long time . I was reminded of Batu caves in Malaysia while Visiting this cave There is a small suyambu Sivalingam in the cave which has religious significance. That was the highlight of my trip to Borra caves and made it an extremely worthy visit . Climb very carefully through the steps here as the steps very small and steep."
Walk into Nature's Ancient Age,"The Borra Caves is one of nature's incredible way of telling you that Universe is beyond one's imagination and control. These naturally formed Rock are breath taking and is a view of amazement. The down-side are the bats that you will see flying. It's  a nature's haven, so be prepared to see them nest and fly in and out of the caves.  I visited it few months back and I wish the tourism department do more to maintain it. They have done quite a bit but more can be done since this is a tourist place."
Steep Descent to Natural Wonders,Visited as part of Araku Valley tour package. Very beautiful formations near Vizag but was unaware of how deep the descent is and the steps are somewhat moist due to the cave environment. There are signs not to carry snacks near the caves as the local monkeys will swoop in and take them- saw some tourists ignore the warning and saw the monkeys' action live!! Enjoyed going here a lot.
Marvelous caves,We went to Borra caves.It is unique place. It is very and huge caves with its natural beauty It is a tourist attraction. There are artificial coloured lights which makes the place very attractive. Well maintained.We enjoyed a lot.
"Natural rock formation, not exciting","Been to this place with family (6 adults 1infant). There was very long queue for tickets but we managed to get them within 5minutes with the help of an employee from 'Haritha APTDC hotel' which is right beside the enterance. December to January this place is Jam paked.Greenary and view around/before entering the caves is very pleasant.Inside the caves... It's all natural rock formation. Tourism department has made way to go through these rocks. There many steps inside, it could be difficult for elder citizens to walk around the entire place. Few places are highlighted by colorful focus lights for attracting visitors. Tollywood fans can correlate few movie scenes shooted there.APTDC hotel was very crowded. There were many stalls across the road between parking place to Borra caves, selling coconut water, sugar cane, bamboo chicken, herbs, toys, etc. So we chose to eat bongu lo chicken (bamboo chicken) in one of the stalls.All stalls have same and fixed price, 280₹/500gm Taste wise it was like a regular chicken masala fry. They make it spicy upon request. Definitely not worth the cost for people from Andhrapradesh and Telangana. Non locals might find it different from regular."
Marvellous Creation,I went to Borra Caves. Borra Caves are deemed to be one of the largest in the country and are perched at a whopping elevation of about 705 metres. They are basically karstic limestone structures extending to a depth of 80 m and are considered to be the deepest cave in India. It is great place to go.
Nice natural place,"This was a nice place created by nature and maintained well by humans. However, it can be marketed much more to attract even higher crowd."
Natural caves for natural bliss,Though r very crowded on holidays and weekends but what a place to be. These  are naturally formed caves and really put  you in awe of nature. One can only stand in appreciation and respect of mother nature.
Beautiful exotic caves..,A must visit for anyone touring to vizag... These exotic gigantic stalactites and stalagmites are a treat for the eyes... One of it's kind in India... The place is on the way to Araku from vizag..
Borra caves,"We had a very good day there ....it was not much far away from Visakhapatnam .one can find no difficulty to reach there....but I recommend you to travel in a tree it would be an ausowme journey we never had before.....burra caves is very old and u find very interesting .don't miss any chance to visit burra caves ...because if u miss it ,surely u  will miss a lot of fun and knowledge"
Borra caves,The place is for a one time visit. Clean and well organised. You have options of getting photo clicked and printed by professionals inside these caves for around Rs40. Kindly note that it may get a bit cold in the caves. Useful to carry a thin Jacket during the winter season. Not very suitable for aged people as there are many steps to climb and a lot to walk. Essentials include selfie stick as well🤓
Wonderful surprise,"Whilst I enjoyed the trip up to the Borra caves, the caves themselves were outstanding and left one in awe of such a magnificent work of nature over thousands of years. The coloured lighting in the caves made for some excellent photos giving different impressions with each change of the light and its colour. On exploring the caves, it gives one the feel of fasination as each turn of a corner opens up something more of the mistery that awaits the intrepid venturer as you become lost in the magnificence of this attraction."
Best place and a must visit ,One must visit this place if in vishakapatnam. Beautiful caves. Best to start early from Vizag as it takes 2-3 hrs to reach.
A visit to an ancient caves.,Borra Caves is an unique place to visit while traveling to Vizag and Araku.It is a very old caves with its natural beauty and man made decoration.It is situated on the way from Vizag to Araku.Nice stairs are made inside of the caves for getting down easier.The decoration of colourful lighting made it more beautiful.It takes at least one hour to make full visit of the caves which is not easy for the aged persons.At season times there is a long queue for buying tickets.Plese go earlier to visit this amazing place.
Nice underground caces,"managed by APTDC, underground stalactite and stalagmite formations which are lighted up artificially to produce beautiful views.Hygiene and parking is a bit of problem, carry your own food if you are picky"
City View Park,"Vuda Kailasagiri is one of the best tourist places of vizag. Best time to visit this place is the evening. One can watch the whole city from the view points all around the hill.

Borra cave- family spot,Borra caves is near arakku valley and here you will find many tourists people.It is a one time experience.It is big cave which is founded naturally in the early 90's.
Natural caves and a man made beauty,"14km from Jungle Bells (APTDC), TYDA, this place is a must visit for any traveler to Vizag/Araku. Naturally formed cave consisting of Stalactites and Stalagmites, beautified by using multi-colour lights. It would take around 1hr to completely navigate through it although the natural ShivLing has a long queue, especially during peak season. ShivLing darshan is not recommended for old people or people with knee problem as the stairs are pretty steep and narrow. Overall, an awesome experience.Note: This place comes under probable Naxalite activities. You will find armed personnel patrolling the entry gate, dont get afraid by the guns. Before planning a visit, please check out with your tour operator if it is open."
Excellent caves be physically fit,"Naturality is gone with lots of development activities, but still a good place to visit, be physically fit to visit this place as there are lots of steps to take. Good for photography too. Beware of monkeys"
Millions years old naturally made palaeolithic caves,These caves are said to be millions-years old. These are vast palaeolithic structure made up of limestone. The cave is so big & that also naturally made which I never imagined. Its a beautiful deep cave full of stalactites & stalagmites. The cave has been beautified with the help of colourful lightings. The surroundings outside cave provide a scenic view as well.Note: Your cab will leave you at a certain distance from cave & from there you have to walk to reach the caves. For entering inside you have to walk downstairs. For entering into the deepest parts you have to walk more downstairs.
Must visit place,"Borra caves is naturally formed caves and they are very huge, must see in life time, better to travel thru train to enjoy tunnels"
Only place worth visiting in Araku valley,This is a natural wonder in araku valley. Well connected by road as well as rail. Try to reach here early morning as place become crowded later. It takes more than 2-3 hours to explore the cave. Though the cave is very much safe and secure but aged people may face some difficulty as there are many steps  inside the cave. However many old person and young ones were seen very excited and didn't reflect any tiredness
Worth the trip to see,Borra Caves are very well maintained and very interesting. Expect long line ups at the ticket counter but we visited over the holidays.
Great place..must visit,This place is very beautiful and every one should visit. You may reach early as late on there is huge rush. Caves are very beautiful.
amazing scenery,"The caves, one of the largest in the country are at an elevation of about 700 m and distinctly exhibit a variety of structures ranging in size and irregular shapes"
Adventures,"Superb place to visit, by visiting this place we know the greatness of Indian history and this place someway related to mythology"
Heavily crowded but One time visit,If you were there already once you don't have to go there again.But it is a good tourist attraction in  Araku Valley
Amazing. Dont miss it,Totally loved the Nidra caves. They are breathtakingly beautiful. Suggestion would be to book the tour by APRTC tourism. We went on christmas day and the number of people were staggering. Due to traffic etc we reached at 6.15pm.  Though the closing time was 5.30pm the caves were kept open for us as APRTC people spoke to them..we were allowed to explore till 7.30pm. so if u decide to visit them.on some holiday try to take the APRTC tour.Small children can go too . It's a bit of a walk about 400 steps and a kilometer walk but if you have time u can certainly go.Overall highly recommended.
Visit with my family ,The place is really nice. It's a big cave with stalagmites & stalagtites. Inside you have to be really careful as there are many stairs and few are steep too. But overall it's an experience worth getting. Really like this place.
Naturally formed caves,"Borra caves are naturally formed, in my childhood these caves were not electrified but now, these are electrified and beautified too. These caves are formed by the natural flow of river gosthani. One can find himself very cool inside the caves. It would be a thrilling experience to visit Borra caves and araku"
Decent place and well lit place,It is a must see place if you have not seen caves in other parts of the country or world. It is well lit and has staircases to walk around the caves. It gets quite crowdy
A remarkable beauty on our earth. ,Truly appreciable. Never miss a chance while visiting Visakhapatnam. Natural structures by Limestone deposition.
One of the best caves in INDIA,The Borra caves located in hill station. I visited somany times from Visakhapatnam. The location  is very  heart  touching. I loved so much.
Cave,It is a place where different types of caves available. This place is famous for Borra caves. It is a tourist attraction.
Into the caves,A good place to visit particularly Young to view  the interior of the caves. For old it may difficult to see the entire cave. But can descend few steps to see the entrance.
Must visit if interested in Natural places,Naturally formed cave(Biggest in India).Nicely maintained and accessible to everyone.Not recommended for physically challenged.
Natural caves,Hundreds of years of old Staligmite(linestone) caves first identified in British time BORRA caves are very famous in Andhra Pradesh. Authorised guides are available on payment who explains better.very good canteens are present for different food options.best for day trip.
Worth visiting at least for once !,"A natural wonder believed to be 150 million year old, Borra Caves takes you through an amazing experience. Well maintained with all basic facilities for tourists not suggested for elderly people who have issues with their knee joints.Crowd here are too loud.A discipline to put some silence will improve the ambiance for sure"
Best of entire AAraku trip.,Go in evening times. Resound and depth of cave is highlight.Different colors will attract everyone .
Beautiful place,Good experience to visit borra caves it is around 90 kms distance from vizag.. the best time to visit in the day time..
Awesome Place,One Of The Best Place To Visit in Araku.... Caves are great to Visit but if you want to enjoy then visit there with You friends. and if you are photography lover then photographer also available in borra caves so need to carry camera etc.. But cave has its real beauty so if you are visiting araku you need to visit borra caves
great place to visit,visited borra cave and enjoyed a lot. Please please hire guide to take you and show you properly. It's great to know the history and details of the cave.
An attractive cave,Borra Caves are basically a blind ended cavernous hollow in the rock. It has three natural sky lights. The bags are not allowed inside. There are artificial coloured lights which makes the place very attractive. The place is always very crowded as it is quite famous.
Largest and the deepest caves in the country,"From Vizag it took nearly four hours to reach Borra Caves, they are  in the Ananthagiri hills of Araku Valley. We went there on Sunday, there were thousands of visitor, so not advisable to visit on Sunday or on Public holiday. It was over crowded. Also not advisable to visit in the evening as it gets dark there, although artificial lights of different colors are provided to illuminate."
Caves with a difference !!!,Borra Caves are nearly a 90 km drive  from Visakhapatnam in Ananthagiri Hill ranges of Eastern Ghats which were discovered by a British Geologist and its believed that they were formed naturally and are nearly 150 year old. Now they are attracting a lot of tourists.
Very nice giant cave,"We booked the package from APTDC website which combined the visit of Arakku valley and this cave. One word, it’s a beautiful place. A very giant cave. Lit in the evening. There is a goddess resides in the cave. You must climb up to see that goddess. There are more than 500 stairs to be climbed. So not a good place for the heart patients and elders. Still you should not underestimate their willpower.The Borra caves is pretty good. And a nice place to visit."
"More Hype, Less Attractive When visited","Borra Caves should be covered during daytime. Visiting Borra caves  after sunset is waste of time. We visited through APTDC package and they Borra caves at 6 pm. So we were unable to enjoy. But I stayed for 1 hour inside the cave, it is nothing as great as heard from various sources."
Nice place,"If you are a nature lover, you should visit this place. Naturally formed, these caves are great way to explore the rock formation. If you are asthama patient, please do not go deep inside as the oxygen level drops and fatigue kicks in."
tunnels,"Vizag is one of the best coastal cities-well organised, well maintained, people are tourist friendly, accommodation & fòod are good, transport is also good. Most importantly the journey by Kirundul Exp train to Araku valley passing through 52 tunnels is a life time experience"
Araku Bora Caves,"The Lighting arrangement, installed by Railway Authority has added a mystic atmosphere inside the Cave. There is lots of ascending and descending of stairs from the entry of the Cave. One has to be fit and agile to enjoy the beauty of this Cave through the stairs"
AWESOME,A great experience. A natural formation and worth a visit atleast once. Takes about 1-2 hours for entire visit inside.
Naturally Carved Limestone Cave,The cave is unbelievably beautiful and its in-fact the first time I have seen such big naturally carved cave. The cave is deep but has safe passage for the tourist and managed by AP government. One beautiful attraction on the way to scenic mountains of Aruku Valley.
The buzzing Borra,"One of the best caves formed with stalagmites and stalactites , that you may probably find in the world. The expanse is daunting and it's a wonderful geological experience.However , we went in November which is Karthik masam . This month is supposedly the month of picnics in AP . It was overcrowded with school & college kids. The pandemonium created was not just because of the number of people but the heart wrenching cries & shouts that these visitors were emitting . They may be doing it in sheer joy of shouting but the effect that it created was quite horrific. The entire beauty of the caves were completely undermined by these cries , shouts which is sufficient to make a weak heart die. I somehow did not like the melodramatic lighting . It would have been nice if a more suitable colour hue were chosen rather than shades of pink , red , green etc . It made it look like puja pandal in a crowded Kolkata streets. Inspite of the artificial ness , the caves are beautiful . The stairs are also nice in most of the places . Without the religion flavour also , it can be a beautiful place to visit.The river Gosthani.flows out from these caves. Spend a good time in the surrounding as well. Do not miss the bamboo chicken if you are a non veg."
Borra caves,Beautiful place in vizag.The train ride from vizag is an excellent journey.The bus route remembers the tirumala ghats.
A million year old cave,Little did I know that we had such fantastic natural treasure such as the Borra Caves. I was in awe and thankful that I had an opportunity to visit it over the weekend during my Business Trip at Vizag.
Wow place and experience,This is another amazing place. Too long a queue for tickets but whatta place tol be. Dont at all miss a guided tour else you miss entire fun. Paid some 100-150 rs for 30-45 tour guide but he was extremely knowledgeable. Must visit
Nothing much to see. just an cave,dont waste much time. its just like any other caves. unnecessarily hyped. its one of the places to visit to Araku valley. please take guide if you want to understand little else its an wastage of time.
Borra caves visit,"An awesome place to visit.. i would have given a 5 rating, if it wasn't for the way it's managed by AP tourism.. The entry closes between 1 to 2 pm and hundreds of people are left stranded in the hot sun waiting, while the officials eat and take a siesta for one hour.The caves are big and wonderful.. the lighting works just right.. be prepared to walk a lot"
Amazing Place,"It is a amazing place to visit with family and friends, can spend a day or two for visit near by places."
"Amazing stalactites, stalagmite formations","The humongous caves with the little rickety stairs covering every corner is a sight to behold.You will witness some amazing rock formations and stalactites, stalagmite.However on weekends and holidays it can get very crowded and the whole path are narrow stairways and between rocks so would not recommend to anyone with knee problems. Lighting is dim although the formations are impressively highlighted so it is easy to wander off but otherwise, one of the best sights in the region."
Borra caves,Borra caves is a must visit attraction on your way to Araku valley but plz avoid weekends and holidays as it is too crowded.. senior citizen with knee problem and with kids it is difficult to climb. They charge tckt for mobile phone camera also and no bags are allowed inside. Keep it in the locker or in your car
Must visit place in araku trip ,"Borra caves are the special attraction in araku trip. To reach borra caves one has to travel on road or the other way which is best is going by rail road...where you can enjoy your trip...that journey will be more memorable in life time 😍 and should reach to borra caves station.From railway station to borra caves it’s walkable distance Borra caves looks like a lion den 😜 which is so dark...don’t dare to enter borra caves without a guide....you must hire a guide to know each and every shape of the cave if not you can’t understand what is the shapes are of!Borra caves has shiv Bhagavan mandir., which is little bit hard to reach that point but it’s still fine.All the caves are with colourful lighting and many shooting were done in this place itself..lot of history is there for this caves which you can get to know by your guide when u visit 🙌"
Probably the most popular destination in vizag,"Vizag is known for the famous borra caves discovered long back when the British government ruled India. It is indeed something to see. The cave is 92kms from vizag. We booked a cab from MakeMyTrip and reached the spot. They charge 60 rupees entry fee for an adult and 25 for each mobile phone having a camera. Parking is a little weird. There was parking space just outside the cave gates but we were stopped at a check post quite a distance from the ticket cointers. Although some vehicles did reach till the top. I don't know on what basis they allow parking. Anyway, the cave itself is beautiful, with artificial lighting inside. It however involves long stretches of walking and my old parents did have a tough time with all those climbings up and down. However I'd still recommend this for everyone."
Lovely place to visit,"We spent a good half day here with our family. We went down the stairs till the end. Had a very good view of the caves. Very good displace of lights, looked very enthralling."
Most worthy to visit,"Probably the largest. Cave in India.Made of stalagmites and stalactites, nature created itself in different shapes. Take a guide charge is nominal."
Must visit place near VSKP,Better to reach before 11 AM and enjoy inside .Visit this place slowly other will miss the beauty of this place
