Himalayan Climbing and Mountaineering Aficionado.,"Worth a visit to learn about the epic history of Himalayan mountaineering. If you have an interest, in particular, of the famous sherpas of Everest, then this is a must-see."
Definitely worth a visit,"The zoo and Himalayan Mountaineering institute are definitely worth a visit.   We're not fans of zoos, but this is senstively done and it was very special seeing the red panda.  The mountaineering institute also good."
Worth visiting ,"This institute gives you so much knowledge..It’s a must visit place with children. Tenzing,s statue is there along with lots of information s about heights of the mountains. Survival kits are also kept in the museum..you can get a clear idea of equipment s to be carried with you if you want to be adventurous."
In Tribute to Sherpa Tenzing Norgay,I was not aware that Tenzing Norgay was a resident of Darjeeling before my visit here; always believing that he was a native of Nepal. This Institute is an active training establishment for mountaineering and a museum of Himalayan expeditions with displays of equipment through the ages. A must for climbers of all persuasions.
See Tenzing's equipment on the day Man first reached the summit of Everest,"Anybody interested in adventure should find time to visit HMI, Darjeeling. The present Curator is doing a wonderful job of maintaining and adding new exhibits to the HMI Museum. Apart from equipment used by notable climbers there are chronological displays showing the development and improvement of the equipment that mountaineers use to climb from Peak to Peak. A special exhibit that is still in the process of final completion is a model of the entire Himalayan range, where laser beams are used to identify the peak by just pressing the corresponding button.. Wonderful exhibit. And the walk to the HMI via the Birch Hill Road is simply fantastic."
Physical activity ,Teenagers and younger people were enjoying the outdoors physical challenges.   Opportunities to learn mountaineering Skills etc
Great 1/2 day activity!,It was a perfect half day activity to visit the mountaineering Institute and the zoo.  There were plenty of things to see and do.  It was also near some lookout points so we were able to combine a walk to the zoo with some views of the Himalayas. Well worth it.
Mueseum,A lot to learn about mountaineeering from this museum and the landmark of tenzing norgay still acts as a inspiration.
Fun,Its seem quiet good unlike the unusual zoo which we find in cities. The museum has quite a things to learn also some activities are available on the way to the museum.
Great futuristic view by the then Indian government.,"It's really great to have insight on Mountaineering especially anyone planning for Everest Summit. This institute has all the areas covered from history to tools used for summit, list of expedition. Plant specimens and birds and animals found in Everest. Kind of rocks. This really helps in expanding our view on Himalayan range. Must visit."
Took my BMC here,"Totally worth it. With such a friendly principal and staffs, one of the best places for adventure courses. Make sure you get to be with Pawal sir's rope! He is just amazing when it comes to teaching."
For Mountaineering Students But..,"Just at the end of the zoo, one can find the HMI Darjeeling and there is no entry fee for this. You will find a statue of Tenzing Norge and a Museum. This place is mainly for aspiring Students interested in Mountaineering and we found a group of young boys and girls just completed a training and waiting for their certificate. Tourists can try four types of adventure games for total Rs 100/- which we did and it was great. There is a eating place inside to have food which is quite good. We had Darjeeling tea with French fries which was fantastic considering the chill outside.Altogether, you will love this."
Loved the history,"Loved staring at all the artefacts of famous mountaineers, also saw the movie. Its attached to the zoo."
Informative film ,I visited the Mountaineering institute whilst here in Darjeeling and found it excellent the exhibits and information are very good and I also watched a short film in the cinema as well which was well presented. There is also a small climbing wall and rope walkway at a small extra charge.Definitely worth the visit.
Visit with family,Visited with family. Exhibits especially the equipments used by Hillary and Tenzing were interesting. Lots of history in the pictures. It is also having the cremation place of Tenzing Norgay. There is a show every hour ( with tickets ) which we did not see. Threre is a childrens' place of climbing etc.Nice place
Good ,It's a part of zoological park and entrance fee is same for both. Nice experience altogether. Activities for children are also there
A pilgrimage for trekker-climbers,"A notable & oldest mountaineering institution which produced renowned Mountaineers. Nowadays it's getting very difficult to get the enrollment to courses as the waiting period is high. The museum is worthwhile to visit and could easily be considered as a pilgrimage for trekkers and mountaineers, climbers."
Wonderful visit to Himalayan Mountaineering Institute,"This institute is inside Darjeeling zoo campus. Founded in the time of Nehru, it is a very old institute. It offers mountaineering courses. The museum is full of valuable items used by expeditions. It was a great learning experience."
A great place to get educated regarding Mountaineering ,A great place to get oneself educated regarding mountaineering. They also have vast collection of mountaineering equipments which were once used by great mountaineers one of them being Tenzing Norgay.
"A venerable institution since 1954, with a rich museum","Established soon after the first ascent of Everest, this is one of the world's venerable institutes for mountaineering, and has trained many. The museum is very interesting and rich, conveying the incredible challenges these high mountains pose to climbers."
Back in time of climbing history,"Mostly about the attempts and history of climbing Everest, although it puts you in the mood and tragedy of all those times... Mostly about the gear from various eras..."
HMI,"If you love maountaniaring too, must visit this place. Historical museum and Audio-Visual show one should not miss here.."
Insightful and Educational,The museum is fantastic and highly educational. It talks about various individuals who've climbed the Everest and shares details that I didn't know before. I learned a good amount here - definitely worth it.
Surprisingly effective,"We were completely inspired by this wonderful museum, much to our surprise.  Mountaineering has never been a great interest of our's, but the exhibits here entranced us.  Laid out cleverly, the artefacts from some of the exhibitions make you realise just what courage/effort was required; models, such as the relief model of the Himalayan chain, bought the mountains to us.  You should go."
"Must visit, one of kind, seen nowhere else in India","Must visit place, humbling and inspiring, the place itself is part of the biological park. One may spend a full day here. They are setting up some mini adventure activities next to the HMI compound, believe it will make the experience more engaging"
Must Visit,I have already written about this place in my review of Darjeeling Zoo. This is a mountaineering institute which runs short mountaineering courses for interested personnel. The institute is professionally run and it's certificates are valid in Europe as well (not sure of US). One can see the Mountaineering Museum as well as a short movie during the visit to this place
museum,"Within the zoo precinct, the prestigious HMI was founded in 1954 and has provided training for some of India’s leading mountaineers. Its fascinating Mountaineering Museum exhibits evocative memorabilia from the 1922 and 1924 Everest expeditions, which set off from Darjeeling, as well as more-recent summit attempts – including the successful 1953 climb. Just outside the museum are Tenzing Norgay's samadhi (cremation spot) and a Tenzing statue. The intrepid Everest summiteer was a director and adviser at the institute for many years. An odd curiosity of the museum is the Carl Zeiss telescope presented by Adolf Hitler to the head of the Nepali Army.The HMI also runs 28-day basic and advanced mountaineering courses from March to May and September to December."
Walking down the memory lane ,I did my BMC from HMI Darjeeling . Visited it after 4 years . Bought back all the memories. Wonderful place to visit . Highly recommended for all nature lovers and outdoor activity people
A centre for knowledge and greater understanding,"The Institute is well laid out with very informative displays and labelling. It really illustrates the perils and challenges of mountain climbing, and how the clothes and technical equipment for climbing have changed over the years. The photos of the various ascents on the highest mountains is a fitting celebration and marker of their achievements."
Well maintained and interestinf,"This is well worth a visit. There are lots of interesting exhibits, especially Sherpa Tenzing’s Everest summit equipment."
Small but unlike any other,This specialty museum on sight concentrates on Tenzing Norgay. He was cremated there and was the first director of training there. It gives a good idea of the equipment used at the time of the first climb and how much it has improved.The school is also used for high school student for whom mountain survival ranks as vital. Sort of like swimming training for coastal students
Museum worth remembering ,Visited many museums but this is a different one. Have never visited such a museum where you will find substance of great valour and pride. A salute to all the mountaineers.
Worth a visit,"I enjoyed my visit, it was amazing to see the equipment the early explorers used. a good presentation of how difficult climbing mountains can be."
HMI- Good place to visit in Darjeeling,If you are interested to know about mountaineering in detail then this is the best place to visit. We visited this place along with family and kids...Onviously we were curious to know about the highest peaks in Himalsyas..who all tried to expedite those...what are the tools used etc...Make sure to take a guide alongwith you during visit to HMI. Authorised HMI guide charge 300 rs however worth getting as the guide will give you the detail information about HMI and Tenzing Sherpa(First Indian Everest climber). All our curious queries were resolved.Nice place and Worth visiting during Darjeeling trip.
Interesting on a small scale.,We were unlucky to visit as refurbishment was taking p!ace and the paint smell was suffocating. The exhibits we saw were interesting and would have liked to see more.
Interesting and can be done at same time as the Zoo,This is a small museum dealing with mountaineering which this region is famous for. Probably its most famous employee Tensing Norgay is buried in the courtyard. Good to get an overview of mountaineering and the tremendous risks but also to get an overview of the many local people who make up the area
Okay place,"I am not much into trekking and all that stuff but people who like adventure stuff will find it interesting, it also has cafe and one can sit for a while and enjoy local snacks..!"
Feeling Proud to be an Indian,"HMI - A dream journey for those who take interest regarding rock climbing or trekking. There is a Museum inside it. It is really a great place. You can see the accessories, Flag etc which was used to concur the Mt. Everest. You also see the pictures and details of several Mt. Everest Expedition. Additional Attraction of this place   is Zoo which is adjoined to this place. You can see different types of Rare Himalayan Beer, Woolf etc..Do not miss this place in Darjeeling Tour."
Excellent,"This is a must visit place for people who have interest in mountaineering. The museum is very rich. However, people who are not interested in mountaineering can visit the zoo."
Excellent,The main attraction is the museum. It's a must visit especially for children as well as grown ups. The museum displays the original equipments used by Tenzing Norgay while climbing the Mount Everest in 1953 as well as by Sir Edmund Hillary and other noted climbers. Must visit in
Interesting! ,Some nice climbing materials on display from previous expeditions. Enjoyed learning about the famous sherpas who climbed Everest. Was a small bit annoyed that the film show was not on as there were no signs saying it was cancelled for the day & I ended up wasting an hour as a…
Dashing Darjeeling,"I visited here as part of my visit to the Zoo, i was amazed with set up and also how well it was organized, it gave us good understanding of how difficult it's up there when climbing mountains.it has decent gift shop to buy souvenirs."
"Loved it, great museum !",It has a great collection of all major historical mountain climbs. My kid and I loved it. Definetely recommend. This place is next to the zoo.
Museum,A must visit place...history unfolds the mystery on how the first expedition to Everest and other Himalayan mountains were conquered... They will also show u movie... 
Visit of Himalayan Mountering Institute,Great place for Mountaineers learning in very good environment. Great things for knowing before going to climb.
HMI- Wonderful place to visit,Wonderful place which all must see. Wide display of Himalayan expeditions and much informative. Kids will enjoy Himalayan Zoo too.
Lot of information,Display is very interesting and lot of photos available as well as details of various summits undertaken
Not worth : entry fee is to high ,The charges are too high and when we go inside there are few activities for which you new to pay again. On that there are museums where you can't even take photos. So why did we paid outside for the camera. Everywhere there are restrictions in this area. Not worth at all. Charges are high and things are not good at all.
To witness a culture of climbing mountains,"I wasn't sure what to expect, but landed up here because it's highly recommended. The beauty of the museum is not in what it contains, but how they feel about their climbing. I didn't realize how much value the people of Darjeeling placed on their climbers. The busts, the big statue of Norgay, the dedicated portion for Everest all point to their reverence to the men and women who have scaled the peaks. In itself, it's a way to celebrate the extraordinary feats of humans."
Fairly unique museum and an institute with a history ,"Mountaineering in the Himalayas, I learnt after a visit to the institute, is like the Holy Grail of mountaineering. The museum was very informative in its chronicling of how mountaineering has evolved over the past many decades. Early tools used by the mountaineers ole in comparison to what is available today. One appreciates the ardour of the early mountaineers after a visit to the institute The institute is still very much up and running and mountaineering enthusiasts from around the world train here to this day."
