"Great architecture, beautifully ornate and I suggest going with a guide","While I know little about architecture I love the angles and arches of it, this place fit right into that!  There are so many beautiful spots I could have spent way longer just walking around soaking it in and taking pictures.  I suggest a guide as they know all the interesting angles to take great pictures of you! We also learned quite a bit from out guide, making the palace and it's history more interesting.  If for no other reason I recommend stopping here for the sheer beauty it provides!"
Beautiful building,"Sheesh Mahal is beautifully ornamental and is testament of the enormous talents of the Indian craftsmen, who built it."
A great tribute to artisans and visionaries,I am only sorry that we were not able to see this building after dark when it would have been illuminated by candlelight.  It is nevertheless a sight to behold in daytime too and to be able to marvel at the skill of the craftsmen and the imagination of the designer.  Make sure you don’t miss it.
Wonderful piece of art,Beautifully crafted. The walls and ceilings are stuffed with mirrors and the total attire is splendid. The Taj Mahal can be seen from the windows.
"Mirror, mirror","Located in Agra Fort, it is so called because of the mirrors embedded in the ceiling and walls. This was the royal bath. You can see it from the outside and maybe peep through the opening in the door if you are lucky as the place is out of bounds and has been closed for a long time now. If you can get close, and it is possible as this is India and who you know or how much you can pay someone, will open door. No one knows why it is closed."
Not able to see it fully,"Not able to see it fully, as seems it opens on very few days now. Heard from others a nice place. But was not able to see myself :-("
"Currently can only look inside, but not enter","As of December 2019 you can only look inside through the door. When I visited the site was mostly unlit, so you do not really get the effect of the mirror decorations."
Bummed,I wanted to see the inside but they closed it down.  I was only able to look in from the door.  Bummed
Impressive ...,"If you are visiting Red Fort in Agra, you will definitely see this part of it. The decoration is extensive and very ornate. The mirror decoration bounces even a small amount of light around, brightening the space."
Lovely part of the Amber Fort,"My wife was particularly interested in seeing this and she was right to be so!Beautiful and intricate decorations, inlaid semi precious stones and a nice historical story attached to it.  I've attached a photograph (probably only the 3rd or 4th time ever) to show the mirror effectsWorth a visit as part of the Amber Fort"
Refreshing Mogle aazam..,"In the middle of upper floor of Red fort, classic setup of Glass(sheesh) Mahal & just nearly staying can watch beautiful view of Taz Mahal.."
good for visit,"this place is located in agra, nice place to see, if you are going to agra than try to see this place and enjoy"
Breath taking,"Our Mysteries of India tour guide and driver took us to this amazing fort, told us all about it then stood back while we wallowed in its beauty and the skill of the craftsmen"
different,this monument and tourist atrraction attracts a lot of tourists but not as much as the taj mahal. I liked its gardens
Stunning piece of architecture,Beautiful palace within the fort. Shish or Sheesh Mahal is beautiful but we weren't able to get inside for a proper view sadly.
A Historical Touch,As the title suggest Visiting Sheesh Mahal give you a different outfit and makes the tourist attraction towards it. Traveling such places you may feel the historical touch in you. This historical monument which was built during the Mughals Period has an amazing historical background.
interesting,this is a very artistic building built by mughals. visit it early in the morning for the best views.
The detail here is amazing,"This is one to add to the list. However, you will need to pay a little bit more than the local like most places but if you are in Agra, why not? Good experience as I went early when it was not busy"
Agra Fort,Really spectacular room but the views of the Taj are worthwhile. All tours to the Taj insist you come here but it is worth it.
Star attraction of Agra Fort,"The 'mirror' room is certainly one of the highlights of Agra Fort - even with the wear and tear of the years, you can just imagine how magnificent it must have looked like in its time with all the related colours and candle lights."
A must see place,This is a must visit place in Agra fort... The architecture is mesmerising and place has an eternal beauty... Extreme delight to watch the place surrounded by so many mirrors...
Difficult to see,It's hard to look inside and get a feel for the Sheesh Mahal. There are a number of these throughout India and this was probably the hardest to see and appreciate.
Be sure to have a knowledgable guide,We were so lucky to have a great guide. Walking through the Fort stopping at the amazing interior Palace rooms was really enhanced by our guide. Having him point out how they carved the marble and then inlaid with the semi-precious stones was great. The combination of the wonderful workmanship and a detailed history of India during this timeframe really enhanced our visit.
Agra Fort,Part of Agra Fort and the Taj  Mahal story.  Knowing the story will  enhance your experience immensly. Some sort of information guide should be  used to help you as there are not many storyboards.
Stunning,Feast for the eyes well worth a visit  stunning place .Cameras at the ready .Go early to enjoy peace
Elegance in Rustic Amber Fort,"Sheesh Mahal is a touch of elegance within the palace courtyard. Exoctic artful masterly detailed mirror & glass mosaic pattern inlay surface finish. Elegant, exquisite & affluent."
Fine glass mosaics as a change,In Rajasthan you might become a bit spoiled by all fantastic pietra dura mosaics. These glittering glass mosaics are a nice change. Must have looked magic during festive nights lighted by candles.
Beautiful Glass and Architecture,This Palace inside Agra Fort is stunning. The Palace was built by Mughal Shahjahan between 1631-40. The stunning glass was imported from Syria to make a high mirror effect and it is beautiful giving a high light quality. Beautiful inlaid work in marble too.Great architecture too. Do not miss.
Beautiful Glass Structure inside Agra Fort,The Sheesh Mahal is a beautiful palace located inside Agra Fort. I think this the most beautiful one in side the Agra Fort. Now-a-days none can go in inside to see it's beauty but you can see from outside through the grilled gate.
stunning architecture,"we were told by our guide that the ceiling was made up of special curved glass brought all the way from Belgium, the only place producing glass like that at that time.  I think the 16 century.  the light reflecting off the glass would cast different hues around the room at different times of day."
Amazing...,"Wondering to see the Sheesh Mahal, it is great architectural work. This is main attraction of Agra fort. I was amazed to this beautiful creativity."
A wonderful experience to visit this place.,You need to have special permission to visit this attraction from inside. Fortunately I could go there courtesy local administration. It’s was really a fascinating experience to see the glass work. A must visit place to get the required permission.Amolak Rattan Kohli Former Governor Of Mizoram
So impressive,A fascinating structure in a fascinating fort.  The detail in the decoration is stunning.  One of the highlights of Agra Fort.
Sheesh Mahal,Unfortunately this location in the fort is closed for tourists. But its nice to see it from outside to relive the history
execellent view,most amazing part of the Agra fort to visit. Glass are imported from Syria. and they are very much sparklinig. Must visit.
Stunning,"This is inside Agra Fort, in what were the living quarters of Shah Jahan, who also built the Taj Mahal for his favourite wife.The walls and ceilings are decorated in tiny mirrored tiles. We were advised by our guide to switch on the torches on our mobile phones, and this made it glitter beautifully, perfect for lovely photos. I share this tip for anyone else who wants to take arty pictures."
Mirror mirror on the wall- everywhere!,Stunning part of the Amber Fort complex.  Later afternoon seemed to be quieter.  Have your camera or phone ready.
Great and detailed work,Is great to see and its history of where gold was before it was stripped out. A smallarea has be pinted with gold to reperesnt its former glory.
I enjoyed the tour,"Well worth your time to go although its showing its age.  Take LOTS of photos (I did), it is so pretty."
fabulous place,Loved visiting this place - across the Yamuna River looking at the Taj Mahal. The story behind it was so sad and the beauty of the place was amazing
Unbelievable creativity,This is a place cannot be missed.  it was created hundreds of years ago and its still standing and the beauty of it is beyond description
wonderful,an absolutely fascinating place to visit and appreciate the workmanship that has gone into creating this wonderful place.
An Engineering Marvel worth seeing.,An engineering marvel amazing structure it will captivate the visitors a good guide will explain to you the finer aspect of this great place
Mirrors everywhere,Every surface is intricately decorated and stunning to look at. Mirrors everywhere alond with painted ceilings and carved pillars. Gorgeous
Inside Agra fort ,An insight in to the way mirrors were used in architecture in that era . When you are in the fort its well worth visiting .
Fabulous,Very very attractive and astonishing concept of mirrors and the lights getting multiplied due to their reflections.
Seesh Mahal in Agra Fort,"The seeshmahal is closed and no one can visit inside. One has to see from outside through a grilled gate - which is not sufficient. This time I have observed that all the places of interest in Agra & Delhi is cordoned and you can not go inside most of the places. This may have been done for the security of visitors. But when I visited the places during my childhood, everything was approachable - so I am not disappointed knowing fully well that this for security purpose of both upkeep of monuments and for the he public c visiting them."
Agra/amber  fort,This was my favourite fort that we visited whilst in India. It is highly decoarated and the mirrored room and ceiling is stunning.  It’s well worth a visit.
good place to visit,Very attractive place but nowadays it is closed because it steadily losing beauty.It is one of the best sheesh Mahal of India
Gem in Agra Fort ,This is a truly a gem inside Agra Fort.  Great example of Mughal architecture and a showcase of how we Indians believe in preserving the historical monuments.... Do not miss it.
A little piece of royalty!,although what remains is only a portion of its former glory...but it is still a beautiful sight. Walking around the Agra fort you really do feel as if you have travelled back in time.
Shows the lavish lifestyle of the Maharajas,Just one reason to visit the Agra Fort. Very ornate and you can take your picture in the mirror on the far wall. Way cool.
Excellent,One of the very good place in the Fort. we spent quite good time in the fort to visit all the places.
Mahal of Glasses,It is little difficult to reach this place as it is closed most of time. You must request the authorities if they open for you.
Sheesh Mahal,it is located inside the fort and is a must see. the guide tells the history in detail and one is awed by the beauty
stunning work of art,Breath taking mirror like mosaic!  It is one of the most beautiful palaces to visit in Agra.Unfortunately you can't get inside because there are bars guarding it.
"Sheesh Mahal, Amber Fort ",This is a Mahal inside the Amber Fort and decorated with small pieces of mirror.... A must visit. Intricate mirror work and silvery hue makes the place unearthly and extremely photogenic. The local guides will let you know about the particular points from where you can have genuine good photos.It is recommended to visit the place during winter  for comfortable viewing. Summers should be avoided.
The Real wonder Inside Taj Mahal,The masterpiece art work is just Jaw Dropping I would recommend to take tour guide to take more details.

Amazing,Great Sheesh Mahal - what an artistry and truly an awesome piece of creativity in teh way it has been done
400 Year Old Palace with Jacuzzi,"It is a closed place you can watch it from distance. Sheesh Mahal or the Palace of Mirrors was built by Shah Jahan in 1631. It has bathtubs made of marble with a fountain jet in the centre, a Jacuzzi built 400 years ago!Entire ceiling is covered with thousands of tiny mirrors imported from Syria .If you move lit up candles, it creates amazing visuals of twinkling lights on the ceiling. The walls are full of beautiful carvings & paintings.Even the walls were designed to produce sounds when tapped at few places."
inside jem of agra fort,located inside agra fort. unique and wort see. u dont need to buy an extra ticket for it. its created in a unique manner and still has a lot of charm left. u get amused by the creation of architects who made it 500 yrs before with such beauty.
sheesh mahal,nice place and recommended to visit with family and friends. can discover the architectural beauty here.
Inside the Agra fort,This is situated inside the UNESCO site Agra Fort. This is hall of colorful mirrors mostly used by the queen. Now it is closed and you can only see this from outside the doors.
Gives a sneak peak into the lives of Maharanis,Sheesh mahal or the room of mirrors is a part of Agra Fort. The room was built for the Maharanis. The mirrors give an illusion of thousands of stars shining at night.
Hall of mirrors,"During my vacation in Agra, I had visited the iconic Agra Fort which is a UNESCO World Heritage site and Sheesh Mahal or the Palace of mirrors is located inside this fort complex. This palace is locked up and tourists can see it only from outside. Our guide said that we can see this palace from inside if we pay 1500 rupees but we decided not to since there were so many other attractions inside the fort. The guide told us that a mesmerizing effect is produced by lightning a single candle inside the Sheesh Mahal."
The mirror room!!,So many rooms and place to explore here. My favorite was the mirror room. Such detail was put into this.
Wow,"With some of the places damaged, one can still enjoy the beauty of that the glasses created in here. I can think back in time to think of the beauty created by the lights. Wow! Do remember to visit this wonderful place."

A rich suprise!,I wasn't  expecting to see this while on my vist to the Agra fort and wow what a treat.You can easily spend a few hours in the fort alone and then you come upon The Sheesh Mahal. It's incredible how beautiful it looks after so much time.
Fabulous Interiors...true to name,Sheesh Mahal is located inside Agra Fort. The interior decorations are mesmerizing. Ideal place to click pics.
Had to visit. ,It was imp to visit sheesh mahal part of heritage. Good place. Since the city isSmall not much to do. Has toVisit few heritage places.
Gorgeous Design,"The Sheesh Mahal is really beautiful with a lot of intricate designs. One really wonders how this was made back then, without the modern day tools."
Beautiful Buiding Sheesh Mahal,This place inside Agra Fort. and the building like diamond so beautiful. even small design but look so perfect and details. cannot imagine how can they building like this hehhe. this building different with other building.
AMAZING,"which is located inside Red Fort was used by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan for domestic government business, and features a throne room where the emperor listened to petitioners. A large courtyard is there. Good place to take few snaps."
part of Fort,its a small module of marble monument. But nicely decorated walls and roof. not to be missed while visiting Agra fort.
Fantastic stucco and mirror work,The Glass  Palace this is something different with the fantastic mirrored ceiling and walls (disco from the past ?) Interesting water works to supply the fountains almost on par with the Romans
It's amazing,At first I would like to admire the artist who made it. It's really awesome design. Made of whole glass. This is amazing. Great place. Recommended.
Amazing art,It is difficult to describe it as it has amazing art filled with small mirrors. Don't forget to take a picture while you are looking into the mirrors when you visit it in Agra.
famous for awesome glass-mosaic work,"Sheesh Mahal situated within the Agra Fort was built by the Mughal King Shahjahan as a Summer Palace. It has two tanks with fountains, interconnected by a canal, and a water fall(Abshar). These water-devices were provided to keep it cool and comfortable in the scorching heat of Agra. The distinctive feature of this palace is the glass-mosaic work which has been done, on a wide variety of stucco designs, on all its walls and ceilings. Glass-pieces have high mirror quality. As the building is made up of thick walls with only a few openings, the semi-dark interior required artificial light, which glittered and twinkled in thousand ways through this glass-work."
Former Bathing Rooms of the Rulers and Their Ladies,"The Sheesh Mahal is like a huge bathing area with concaved glass mirrors inset into the walls and ceilings all around. So, when candles were lit the whole room sparkled like stars. Magnificent!Sadly, like so much of Agra Fort, over the years unchecked visitors have stolen precious artifacts, engraved the 500-year-old walls and have generally desecrated this wonderful heritage site and so it may now only be viewed through bars on a heavy, padlocked door."
Beautiful,Beautiful marble. Clean and well kept. Nice place to visit. Tourist attraction. Make sure to take lots of photos.
Closed for repairs,WE have been to the Agra fort three times in two years and the Sheesh Mahal has been closed each time.  What we were able to see gave the impression that it was not a parch on the Amer Fort in Jaipur.
Stunning,"A well preserved, stunning hall of mirrors which is part of the Red Fort.  Marvel at the craftsmanship, well worth a visit."
How unfortunate,Unfortunately this room was mainly closed off during my visit although I could see the mirror work from the doorway which is similar to other mirror rooms in other India palaces.
Stunningly beautiful,Inside the fort is this most beautiful palace with the most amazing ceiling. So blessed to see this one preserved.
Beautiful work of mirror and jewels,"Sheesh Mahal is located inside the Agra Fort, like any other fort in northern India have similar rooms (Sheesh Mahal), It is well decorated with the fine glass work so that once the light enters into the room it will reflect on the mirrors and the whole room just lights up. It was used by the queens of the Royal families to live in, It is said that in their times the walls were actually decorated with the precious gems and diamonds, but once it was occupied by the British they took it all, you can still see the marks on the walls where these gems were taken out. For sure one of the highlight of Agra fort."
Beautiful,One of the areas inside Agra fort. The intricacy of the mirrors in the ceiling and walls is amazing. One of many beautiful places.
Wow!!!,A beautiful site inside Agra Fort.The detail is incredible.Don't miss this site when you are in Agra for the Taj Mahal.
Shine a light on the mirrors....,Look carefully to see your reflection in many mirrors. Shine a light on the ceiling and see it twinkle. Must have been amazing in evening lamplight.
Awesome place to see in Agra Fort,The Sheesh Mahal was where the queens used to live inside the fort but the room was locked up and could see it only through the grills. The details of the walls were just magnificent sight in itself and told a lot about how detailed the architecture could've been those times.
if only you could go in,"this is inside the fort and it is locked up, but you can see through the grills how wonderful if must look.  I wish the small water bath had water in it as then the many mirrors would have reflected light like they are supposed to"
Locked. You can only see from outside.,It is inside Agra Fort. But Locked. You can only see from outside. Even though one can imagine the glory it has.
Quite wondrous,No photos can do this place justice. It is quite mesmerisingly beautiful and involves humbly admirable artistry.
Stunning,"Monday 12th February and we were on a tour of the amazing Agra Fort, one of the highlights was a visit to the incredible Sheesh Mahal, the Hall of Mirrors.We could not access the Hall, it was closed, this a measure taken by the Indian Archeology Society to stop the site being vandalised by visitors. What a sad thing thing that people would want to deface or destroy something so beautiful.We did get a brief glimpses of the wonderful glasswork."
Nice Place,Nice place to see when you visit Agra fort. Must see this place for its art. excellent work of glass and amazing view....
Amazing,Such fine architecture. Sends one off to a different time zone of the Moghuls. Definitely not to be missed.
Mirror,It is an integral part of Agra fort. Fully covered wit mirrors. Ladies used these mirrors. Very beautiful and ancient.
Breathtaking,I loved the Agra Fort but the Sheesha Mahal is stunning. You can’t believ3 the opulence and luxury with rugs and hangings it would of looked even more beautiful
Sheesh Mahal,It's an integral part of Agra fort built for meeting purpose in old times it has good shining view..
Beautiful decor,"Again,  this is a part of the Agra Fort visit and not exactly a different place of attraction. Quite beautiful."
Big and Beautiful and I am so glad I saw this place,"from the elephant ride up the hill to the courtyard I was awed by thes structure.  some of teh highlights1 you are mombarded with people trying to take your picture as you climb up the hill.  The vendors will try to sell you the book of pictures.  It was my most uncomfortable ride yet.  you sit sideways and it feels weird nit being able to get a good feel in the chair.then you are helped off and welcomed by wonderful music and 5 million ( exaggeration) vendors selling pictures of elephants painted on silk, quilts that look quite charming but too big to carry home, marble carvings, and wooden carvings and who knows what else....If you look around there are many tour groups up there and  a few darling school kids on field trips The Fort is a Mugal structure and has many sections.  The open spaces and the  columns holding up teh buildng are beautiful.  The walls of the corridors shine as they are made from some sort of marble paste.  They also reflect light and they also are cool to the touch.  I loved some of the paintings high on the walls of the womans section.  They depicted daily life and even some Kama Sutra images.  you need to look carefully.  The room of mirrors was breathtaking!  the inlay work was intricate and beautiful.  The skill adn craftmanshhip was like none I had ever experienced.  The stone steps in the hallways are uneven.  be careful.You overlook the valley and so you can see amazing secenery from the roof patios.  This structure is huge.  It is at least a 2 hour comitment.I would retrun there is a heartbeat."
Sheesh mahal,Sheesh Mahal is very very nice place.in that most people would you like the perfect place. I am going to the next day or night at our place.
An amazing piece of art work,It is an excellent piece of art work.Guide explained us it's historical importance and aslo how has been shown in different bollywood movies. I would suggest to get a good guide it is worth.
Glass Palace - needs maintenance,We were here during our Agra tour. Quick visit was enjoyable. The grand glass works talked about the history of past.
beautiful,"unique work. in this modern world of technologies, a second sheesh mahal cannot be built. My family had memorable photographs in the mirrors of sheesh mahal , thanks to our competent tour guide, Sharick Sir."
locked up beauty,i went to visit this place but authorities has locked this place due to some technical reasons so i will try my luck next time. i heard a lot about this place so i will try
Beautiful and full of history,I was so happy to tour Agra Fort before I went to the Taj Mahal. I had a personal tour guide and he was able to give me a very detailed explaination of the history of Agra Fort. It's so beautiful and the precursor to the Taj Mahal being built.
Agra Tour,Wow ....how were these places built all those years ago. The Sheesh Mahal will take your breath away I was mesmerised. Do not miss this trip.
Part of Tour,"Has to be seen to be believed. Incredible workmanship from                           so long ago, amazing quality and beauty. Photos do not do it justice."
Beautiful,"The Sheesh Mahal is beautiful, I would suggest you hire a guide so that you can learn all about the history.  Entry into the sheesh mahal is included with your entry into the fort."
Closed for visitors,"This place is closed by authorities for regular visitors to Agra Fort.Our guide informed us that this decision was taken as tourists were damaging the structures and pulling out glass pieces from the place. Was very disappointed to not able to visit the place.But whatever we could see from a small opening, the place did look great. I wish if I could have seen it from inside."
GLASS PALACE,I have raed of it a lot but while i visited the place couldnt go in as the authorities have closed it down
Sheesh mahal,Sheesh Mahal is made...old people..this building are made by mugal...very glass use for this make.. thanks
Beautiful Glass work,"Please do not miss this wonderful piece of modern thinking in ancient times by the ever creative Shahjahan, who had this great thought to import Syrian Glass to create this wonderful structure. Of course, when we saw, it was not well lit, however being a sunny day, we had a good view. It is a structure created interspersed with small glass pieces across the room. We were not allowed to go inside and hence could see and admire this piece of art only from outside"
Breathtaking structure and design in Agra Fort,The Sheesh Mahal is a magnificent building within Agra fort that will leave you spell bound with the beauty of the design and use of mirrors and art that everyone should see and admire. A must see.
Great yet tragic stories could be told through the mirrors,I think we take a mirror granite. So many beautiful things can be done with them besides stare at oneself.  It must of been very magical back in the days with the candles make them all a glow.
"Good place, with limited way to experience","Good mirrors place, but not entirely accessible. That limits its overall potential. Otherwise, a good sight."
Beauty set in stone ...,Sheesh Mahal is part of the Agra Fort complex so you will definitely want to have a look during your visit there. I didn't think it was as grand as another Palace of mirrors that we visited but still extremely beautiful. The carved stonework and gem encrusted marble is lovely. It was built as part of a Summer palace in 1631 and its easy to imagine all the glass sparkling in the sun.
Amazing place,"Sheesh Mahal, Agra is a great place in india eally beautiful but it is usually very busy  avery time Sheesh Mahal is simply stunning."
Okay,"Another Palace of Mirrors. Just about worth a look as you are there, but it is far from opulent. Looking through a wired grid is not the best."
Amazing Mirror Art,Agra Fort is so huge that it has so many stunning places which you can't even imagine. Sheesh Mahal or Mirror Palace is a live example of such an art work & architecture. It was built centuries ago without using any modern day technique. Great!!
Worth a visit when you're at the Agra Fort,This is absolutely stunning! Part of the Agra Fort so of you visit one yiunget the other too! It's not easily accessible for those who find walking difficult but most of the Fort does have ramps except for the top.
Beautiful!!,"Beautiful part of the fort.Covered in tiny mirrors, use a guide and he will show you the best place to stand to get the ultimate never-ending photo."
"Amazing, just old works of art.","Goodbye to Europe, India has the actual artworks that we want to see.  So simple and yet so beautiful.  Totally enjoyed the walk, a bit hot and busy but well worth the effort."
A marvel in Agra fort...,This is a piece of ancient marvel situated inside the agra fort... This chamber is covered all around with mirrors and provide a unique optical illusion to the tourist... A must visit
Truly Amazing,"I was humbled by the history, respect and beauty of this structure. It truly leaves one speechless and is yet another jewel in incredible, colourful India"
Overpowering in its beauty,One cannot adequately describe the beauty of the Sheesh Mahal with its incredible artwork.  This is a must see in the Agra Fort.
Open place,A very large and open place to visit . One can enhance one knowledge by visiting this place . Overall a very nice place
Within the Moghul masterpiece – Agra Fort,"We were thrilled at finding the mirror Palace – Sheesh Mahal within Agra fort. Our 1st date, nearly 50 years ago was at the eponymous Glasgow restaurant which is still our favourite.Its mirrored walls, perfect materials and stunning inlays added to the poignancy of our visit."
Within the fort,Located within the Agra fort. Sheesh is the Hindi word for mirror. The walls with mirror could reflect candle light in historic times and illuminate the room.
An amazing place!,This is another must see while in Agra. Truly a stunning place. We highly recommend it! Could have stayed longer but our two young kids were tired.
A hugely impressive fort complex,"If you visit Agra, don't miss the opportunity to visit this fort (as well as the (Taj Mahal).  It is an extensive complex of palaces and courtyards with outstanding carvings and decoration.  Very well preserved, it offers an insight into the luxurious lifestyles of the Moguls in Agra."
Stunning,... which is a word I shall be using a lot with my Indian reviews - we were all surprised at the intricacy of the paintings & carvings - well worth a visit.
Beautiful,"The Sheesh Mahal is a section in the Agra Fort unlike its name which signifies it being a palace. It is a section in the Agra Fort which has all mirror work. The work is beautiful, worth seeing and spending some time with.This place is good for photos"
Beautiful,This hall shines and reflects the light. Great detail in the patterns of carvings and mirrors. Its very crowded with tourists but well worth a visit.
Beautiful decorative area inside Agra Fort.,Beautifully skilled craftsmanship and detail. Take a little extra time to really look at the detail. The highlight of the visit to this fort.
Best part of Agra Fort,Best part of Agra Fort. The fort is big but you can skip a lot and see sheesh mahal. Good place for pictures and history.
The most beutiful attraction inside Agra Fort,"well decorated with colorful and shining tiles and with semi precious jewels carving Works like those in Taj Mahal. It is as beautiful as the most famous Sheesh Mahal in Amber fort , Jaipur."
Fabulous Mahal,Sheesh Mahal is one of the best place in Agra with beautiful lighting and more it's have a great history
Amazing beauty at Agra Fort,"I cold spend all day watching the amazing building structure!!!!History from another time with such perfection and planning :) If you get a guide, you get more out of the tour"
Closed for public now,"This is a beautiful room/hall with mirror work all around the walls and ceiling. It is situated within the Agra Fort. Unfortunately, it is closed for public now and people can only see this room from a small door."
Jaw Dropping,Your jaw will drop by the thought of the sheer opulence. The fact that every thing has been robbed off saddened us so much.
Old relics missing the old glory,Sheesh Mahal is the old bedroom of Mughal Emporer Shahjahan when he was captured in his own fort by his own son. The room was then decorated with mirrors & precious stones which glitterd and reflected the image of Taj Mahal through its east side windows. All the mirrors have now been removed. A couple of guides carry one or two small mirrors to entertain tourists. Shouldn't spend much time here..
Beautiful,A real surprise so do not miss this. Check out the fine mosaic mirrored walls and ceilings. Our guide was informative and this made it an interesting experience.
Beautiful,Absolutely stunning area of the Agra Fort. So beautiful in sunny weather and is equally as beautiful from a distance and up-close!
Mirror everywhere,"A bathroom with infinite mirrors, truly a n awesome experience if allowed to visit inside. It was locked during my visit though."
Sheesh Mahal at the Agra Fort,Sheesh Mahal or the room of mirrors is perhaps the most important part of the Agra ra Fort. Originally supposed to have precious stones embedded in the walls. In the mirrors one can see the Taj Mahal.
Closed to the public,This is a chamber is the Agra Fort. Said to be of great beauty as it was made from several reflecting pieces fo glass. We had only a glimpse through the closed grill and therefore can not vouch for its original beauty.
CLOSED FOR PUBLIC,I was told by the guide that it has been closed for public. I fail to understand why it has been closed. Atleast they may have restricted entry- like entry up to certain point or visitors should be strictly prohibited from touching the wall or glass work etc. I regret.
Mirror Palace of Agra ,"Sheesh Mahal or Mirror Palace is a royal dressing room located inside the Agra Fort, on the western side below the Diwan-I-Khas Hall. It has tiny mirror-like glass-mosaic decorations, and drums built into the interior walls. This Palace was built by Shah Jehan as a summer palace and was used for royal bathing. The palace has two tanks with fountains interconnected by a channel and a waterfall."
Glass,As the name suggest it is made mostly out of sheesha(glass). It is very beautiful to look at and offers a great view.
A mirror for each of us,The Sheesh Mahal or the Palace of the mirrors is a 'room'. The wall decorations  is an example of what makes India unique: walls full of concave mirrors. We took the best pictures !
Details worth gold,"These details are what makes India so beautiful and fascinating, so many contrast and the history... This fort is very different to others and it has a delicate feminine classy  touch to it..."
Wonderful Mahal!!!,The Sheesh Mahal is full of Mirrors which was imported from Syria. It was built by Shahjahan. Beautiful place.

Well worth a visit,This fort is not as well preserved as some but is still well worth a visit. A fascinating history and an insight into the rulers of Agra and this part of India. Very busy and people push and shove on the way in. Once inside things become calmer.
Beautiful stone work in the Red fort,"Part of theimmense red fort complex, probably the most beautiful and ornamental building there... Shah Jehan built it between 1631-40, possibly for it to be used as imperial baths. The palace consists of two large chambers which are connected through a wide arched opening in the center and two narrow passages on the sides. The rooms cannot be accessed but the detail of them is fully visable"
All that glitters...are charming!,"A gem within the Agra Fort, you can look at it for a long while...Mirror making must have developed a great lot at the time of the construction of the palace."
Good palace but not maintained well,Agra fort is verg big fort and in that too seesh mahal is good place but not maintained well. must place to visit in agra
Inside Agra Fort,"Well you can see Sheesh Mahal from a single door, its nicely preserved, but cant able to see the real beauty from inside"
Pictures cannot portray how good the craftsmanship is.,"As yet another building on the trail you could easily become numb to a lot of the beauty about. However, this place demands your attention. You cannot fathom how such intricate work could be done now far less 500 + years ago. Fabulous."
Simply Beautiful!!!,"If you go to the Agra Fort, then you'll see the Sheesh Mahal.  We could not go inside because it appears to be under restoration, but just peeking through the windows was enough to awe one's senses."
sheesh mahal,"Sheesh mahal, you can see from outside only with one small window which have lots of mirrors.. special made for Mumtaj.."
Beautiful sight,The mirrored hall is amazingly beautiful. The designs are outstanding.

It is a wonderful place to visit.
Amazing,"This is a must see, really beautiful. Mirrors everywhere and there is an inner part with jewels that they were restoring when we were there."
Sheesh Mahal,Sheesh Mahal or the Hall of Mirrors in the Agra fort is one of the many well preserved buildings in the fort. The intricate design of mirrors inlaid among the marble work on the walls is truly opulent and reflective of the life style of the Mughal kings.
My highlight of Agra Fort,This mirrored hall and gallery rivals if not betters its main rival in Jaipur with its unique oriental architecture which must be dazzling n moon or candle light.
What a spectacular place,It's better with less visitors because you get a chance to stand and appreciate the wonderful mirrors inlaid into the plaster. Just imagine what it must have been like at night with lit candles and moonlight reflecting around the place.
best part of fort,This is the best part of the fort.The way mosaic are tessellate is great and you have an atmosphere of orient
The Hall of Mirrors,I was surprised by the opulence and the excellent condition of preservation of the Sheesh Mahal.  I could picture royal court life there from a very different era.  Great place for pictures.
Not as spectacular as in Jaipur,The Agra Fort is and interesting destination - another amazing set up - the highlight is the Shah Jahan's quarters overlooking Yamuna river and Taj Mahal.
mirror bonanza,"a must see you will be fascinated by the mirror facade on all the walls and what the reflection does , it is a sight to see to believe"
Outstanding,Sheesh mahal - purely difining the magic of historical indian architects.. the place is just magical when you see this...
Incredible beauty,The sights at the Agra Fort are almost limitless.  Perhaps the most beautiful and sparkling is the Sheesh Mahal.  Inlaid with mirrors and mother-of-pearl the area abounds in reflections and detail.
Beautiful and incredibly ornate detail in Agra Fort.,Definitely didn't expect this kind of place within Agra Fort. The ornate details were amazing with incredible marble and gemstone unlays. One of the many spots that came as a pleasant surprise within Agra Fort.
Golden Triangle,Trip was just awesome they arranged everything very nicely thankyou abhishak and team. Will defnetly plan a trip again with your travels again soon.

Playing with light,"These walls and ceilings covered with mirrors increases the light and, at the same time, gives you a sense of moving paintings as the images change constantly while people are passing."
Marvelous,A must see place in Jaipur.The architecture is mind blowing. The place is always crowded. Take time and go through the place.
Amazing art,"Truely known as baby taj, becase of great art work in the building,builder architectures worked on it like a miniature."
Limited access,One of the many very interesting rooms to visit within the Fort. The archways are fully symmetrical and offer views of great carvings.
Emperors dwelling,"Sheesh mahal is the living quarters of Mugal emperor situated inside the agra fort. Its fully decorated with gems, mirrors and gold worthy of the great indian emperor"
Good place,"The Sheesh Mahal (The Palace of Mirrors; Urdu: شیش محل‎) is located within the Shah Burj block in northern-western corner of Lahore Fort. It was constructed under the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in 1631-32. The ornate white marble pavilion is inlaid with pietra dura and complex mirror-work of the finest quality. The hall was reserved for personal use by the imperial family and close aides. It is among the 21 monuments that were built by successive Mughal emperors inside Lahore Fort, and forms the jewel in the Fort’s crown.[1] As part of the larger Lahore Fort Complex, it has been inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1981."
The name suggests it all….,A palace of Mirrors….  A palace which will not be remembered because of its size but for the craftsmanship.. Millions of minute glass pieces fixed one after the other is absolute symmetry.. Reminds me of a grand bridal lehenga.. a little light and all sparkles together to create magic.BAD NEWS – This is a World heritage site so Government is getting this renovated. This is closed for Public at the moment.Good NEWS – Your guide can get this opened for you to glimpse for a nominal charge. Then if he lights a candle – you will see the magic !You will hardly understand anything standing outside and peeping from the closed doors..
Mesmerising...,"Splendid, and really glad to see it being restored. The best part of the Amber Fort. Although the main room was cordoned off to do up the mirror work, still it was stunning."
A spectacular vision of a time in India when wealth and stature was on show,A  supreme example of craftsmanship in the finer arts using natural stone and materials.  This gives a true insight into the wealth and power of the past and showed and extreme ways in which it was showcased.
Must have been magical back in the Day,The amount of detail and work that went into the architecture is unbelievable.The way our guide dscribed how it would have been back in the to using the reflecton of candlelight to illuminate the rooms. Very Beautiful.
Very impressive,"Beautiful paintings, great history, wonderful views.  Well persevered architecture. I highly recommend visiting this site!"
Great mirrored hall inside of the Red Agra Fort,"This hall was in my book of things to not miss in Agra, it took me a while to realize that this place is inside of the Agra Fort. It is a mirrored area in the Fort, with great inlays and  walls and even ceilings.  I could only imagine being there at night with a candle, it would have been so cool.  This place (the Fort) is part of a World Heritage Site and this is perhaps the most pinnacle place of the entire Fort.Not to be missed."

A fantastic feature of our visit to Agra Fort,During our visit in Agras Fort we got the opportunity to view the Sheesh Mahal which is a fantastically ornate feature of this World Heritage site and certainly enhanced our visit
A true work of art,"Just like the Sheesh Mahal in Jaipur, that is part of the Amber fort, this is one of the most impressive places in the Red Fort. Oh how I would love to spend a night here with only the flicker of a candle to ignite the place with light. Pure beauty and magic!"
Must see,perception of fineness in Art during the Mughal empire is worth seeing. You get a glimpse into the grandiosity of the kings of the time and understand why the British wanted it all. I don't blame them for this..... anybody could want it if he had the power.
Made of many mirrors,"This is a beautiful hall in Agra fort, which is supposed to be used by the king for entertainment purposes. When i visited Agra Fort, it was forbidden for general public to go inside. So, we could only see this hall from outside."
Palace of mirrors; can only be seen from outside,"The Sheesh Mahal is small, but one of the most eye catching buildings inside the Agra Fort. Its interior is currently closed to the public, unfortunately, but one can and should take a peek inside. A large number of beautiful mirrors on all sides line the walls and even the doors.
