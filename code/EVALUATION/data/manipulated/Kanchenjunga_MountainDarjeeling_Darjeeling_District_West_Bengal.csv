The Kanchenjunga mountain is the most famous and attractive place of Darjeeling. It is foggy even in summer. The mountain is magnificent to view on a clear day. Trekking will be of great fun. The whole place is mesmerizing and very peaceful.
Kanchenjunga is the third highest mountain in the world. The view of this mountain is clearly seen from the Tiger Hills view point in Darjeeling. Visited Darjeeling in the third week of March 2017. The scintillating view was fantastic. The snow on top was visible and it was an exciting view. Enjoyed with family and friends.
Darjeeling famous for Mt. Kanchenjunga. If you are in Darjeeling you have to witness the majestic Himalayan mountain of Mt. Kanchenjunga.
"Darjeeling offers unparalleled view of Mount Kanchenjunga , the highest peak in India and third highest in the world. view from near Railway station is beautiful ."
The famous Kanchenjunga mountain is visible from anywhere on this road. Unfortunately we could not witness the Kanchenjunga because of cloudy weather for all three days of our stay. Avoid going to Darjeeling in June and July.
"The highest mountain peak in India, Kanchenjunga and 3rd highest in the world is surely a delight to watch. We were not lucky to get the view from Gangtok due to bad weather and fog. But we got lucky in Darjeeling and had a clear view of the Himalayan range with Kanchenjunga standing tall. Darjeeling station offers a great view of the peak and you can also go to Batasia loop to get an amazing view. We took a steam train ride from Darjeeling station to Ghum which stops at Batasia loop for 10 mins. There are telescopes to watch the range and it is totally mesmerizing. No pictures will do justice to the view that you see."
The third highest peak in the world is on display in all it’s grandeur from Darjeeling. We were there late November and it was clear every morning til about 11am when the clouds start rolling in.  The view is then obscured until the next morning.  Take the pedestrian loop leading to the mall at sunrise. The peaks are revealed to u in a magical way. A better view than Tiger Hill without the crowds and pickpockets. U just st don’t get to see both the sun and the peak together like u do at Tiger Hill.
We were fortunate to see the mountain from Gangtok and Darjeeling. Lovely and majestic. Had nice weather blessed us Both hotels we were able to see the mountain from of hotel bed. It is a must see.
"Darjeeling the queen of mountains . But the queen of queens is the Kanchenjuga . You can look at her beauty , her curve , the secret in her eyes . This mountain has a magic , a charm ."
"I have seen Kanchenjunga mountain on tiger hill it was a nice view. Loved the scenery, must watch places."
"Viewing the Kanchenjunga can be a matter of luck when in Darjeeling. On our first and third day the weather was great and we enjoyed the view of the mountain, however the second day was cloudy, rainy and windy and visibility was down.Darjeeling is one of the prettiest places that I had been to in my lifetime."
view from this mountain from all the sikkim is very great. want to go nearby and spent some time over there.
Got up at 4.30 AM to go to Tiger Hill to see the sun rise over the Kanchenjunga.Actually the sun rose over an adjacent peak but the sun lit the Kanchenjunga much before the sun rise over the adjacent peak. A crowd gathered there watched in awe as the Kanchenjunga went from dim to pale to pinkish and then the sun was glimpsed over the adjacent peak as we watched mesmerized! Beautiful and breathtaking nature--- a truly humbling experience!
"Rose at 4am to watch the sun rise over Sikkim, Nepal and Bhutan from Tiger mountain in Darjeeling. A truely memorable experience including a ten minute glimpse of Kanchenjunga Mountain. Being January they're was a sharp frost but only a few thousand tourists. The 5,000 seater observatory should be fun when finished."
ow my god this was a amazing experience of mine to see kanchenjungha from tiger hill..as well as sun rising..its can't b explained by words... I was just speechless.. evry one should visit this placw
The best attraction here. 3d highest peak. seeing it early morning is fascinating with sun light on the mountain snow.
Being on the hill top and getting a clear view of range of snow covered mountains is also a luck. Stunning views and natural beauty will fill every heart.
Saw it from Phalut after Sandakphu on the Sandakphu trek. Quite distant but impressive.Then saw it from Darleeling.The saw it from Goechala Viewpoint 1 at sunset with the sun shining on it. Best.This is the nearest one can get to Kanchenjunga from the Indian side since beyond it is prohibited
"After staying a night in Darjeeling we got up very early for the trip you Tiger Hill, I was sceptical of the idea and wasn't impressed by the 3:00 am wake up call! But the moment the sun began to rise over the mountains I knew this was something special. Seeing the black sky slowly reveal the mountains is something I will never forget. I was in awe of the magnitude and clarity of the mountain, with photos doing no justice to the view! To add to the most magical experience of my life we were able to see Everest off in the distance."
"Saw it from various points. From Sandakpu was the best. Sleeping Buddha-- Kumbhakaran as nose and face, Kanchenjunga as body. Understand not been climbed to summit (but only to 5 ft. below summit) to respect religious sentiments since treated as a sacred mountain. Said to be ven more difficult to climb than Everest. On a clear day can pan left to see Everest, Lhotse and Makalu too"
"What a gorgeous and heavenly mountain range. Is it a silver lining? or gold lining? when the first Sun rays fall on it and lines the entire range.Our father said, it is can be described as mighty and most beautiful white snow-laden {section of Himalayan} mountain range, and golden mountains with silver lining! depending on the time of the day one sees it.The view is worth perhaps heaven on Earth! and Sikkim with it's clean surroundings and majestic trees, hills and valleys adds more to the experience like nowhere visible perhaps."
"This was about 3 mins walking distance from Mayfair hotel. Seeing this mountain depends on the weather. More often than not it is clouds, fog or mist which covers this snow capped mountains. We did a bit of this view..however we saw it very clearly from Gangtok..on the way to Tsomgo lake."
"We had nice view of Kanchenjunga, Good time to visit is April to June. Had good time with family in the snow."
"Only got to see the views of this beautiful mountain, but oh what is she a beauty. Best seen from my experience from the gondolier lift near gangtok. Do give her a visit, she is worth it."
"This mountain is unique in the type of views it provides. Truly breathtaking. Standing up, as if floating in the sky, so majestic, one could just sit all day taking in the sight and still not have had enough of it. You just cant turn your back to it."
Travelled the tough terrain to Sandhakpu by the British Era Range Rover and what a memorable ride it was. Saw the Kanchenjunga in all its glory at 530am in biting cold conditions.
Just hope for good weather. Although Darjeeling itself is still very nice in the mist. Take a trip to Tiger hill to see the mountain.
"Saw the sunrise from Tiger Hills and the reflection on the snowy peaks changing colour. Awesome. The peaks were also visible from the resort's dining hall and there was also a view=point from which we could observe them. Everywhere we went, it was as if the peaks were following us."
Saw it from my room in Lepchajagat. It's outright heavenly and out of this world. Please try and visit in seasons other than summer because the extreme heat in the plains causes the hills to be densely foggy which could obstruct your view of this peak for days.
See the incredible view  sunrise falling on snow mountains . Never imagine a morning with beautiful sunrise
Feel like god is sleeping. Sleeping Buddha. Awesome sunrise and sunset view from different places. Specially at moonlit night. View from rin-chen-pong is superb. The peak is very closed to phalut and the view from sandakhphu and phalut is awesome.
Nothing is as breathtaking as watching ng the sunrise turn the mountains pink then gold! Rising at 5.30 became a habit when we stayed in Darjeeling so we could catch the sunrise. Some days it will be misty but if you catch that magic moment it will live with you forever.
"Book into the Lunar Hotel and enjoy the awesome sight of the snow-covered Kanchen junga Mountain, the third highest mountain on earth! Climb Tiger Hill very early in the morning to take in the sunrise over the mountains and feel the vibes of the thousand or so fellow climbers who welcome the tip of the rising sun with a welcoming roar, and you can experience the same emotions of what the people living millennia ago felt what it was like to be alive in this astounding universe and to greet the sun without which we cannot live!"
"Majestic, grand and awe inspiring. It was winter and the view was clear. I have been to Europe also and seen Mt Titlis and Jungfrau but I always find the Himalayas astounding. Kanchendzonga is the main attraction of Darjeeling. Hope the people of Darjeeling realize this and stop unauthorised construction of houses, shops, hotels, restaurants etc which are blocking the view from many places. At an approximate distance of 73 Kms from Darjeeling, its towering presence makes Darjeeling what it is. Don't miss the first rays of the Sun falling on the peak, a sight to behold."
Seeing the sunrise kissing the peak of the mountain is a must if you can bear the pain of getting up early at 4 AM to be able to reach the tiger point to catch a glimpse of the sunray bursting out over horizon setting the peak literally on fire with all visitors across furiously clicking to capture the savoury moment for posterity . It is one feeling that lingers on in some dingy corner of your brain and your mind will scream for more.
