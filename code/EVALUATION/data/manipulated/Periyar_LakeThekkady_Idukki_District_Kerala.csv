Periyar lake provides stunning views of the surrounding forests as you take a boat ride on the lake. One can spot a few animals if you take a boat ride at the right time. Booking process needs to be improved a lot though. Beware of monkeys and do not feed them. 
"Huge lake surrounded by forests on all sides. A must visit for all tourists visiting Thekkady. Had a good time in the boat, saw some of the wild animals like elephants and deers roaming around the lakeside. "
Beautiful lake surrounded by forest and very very exciting atmosphere. Best place to visit in kerala. If you go early morning you will find many different birds and small animals. Loved and place.
"If at Thekkady as it is famous for the forest activities, Boating at Periyar lake is worth visiting. Kids might feel exhausted as it goes very slowly. Getting tickets would be a difficult task as most of the tourist target this activity. Better to get the tickets booked online. "
"When in Kerala, I recommend a visit to Periyar lake.The lake is beautiful and the  surroundings are lovely. I would recommend booking the boat ride well in advance at the Government's website to avoid disappointment. Book the first morning boat ride. It will entail waking up early but it is worth taking this trouble."
Boating at this lake would be a life time experience if someone gets to see wild life. I have not seen anything apart from eagles and cows.
A boat ride in Periyar Lake is among the must do things for tourists in Thekkady. The boat house is usually crowded so you can book the tickets online though there is a service charge. The boat ride in the Periyar Lake is a wonderful experience as you get to see birds nesting and if you are lucky (we weren't) you can spot wildlife - elephants mostly that come to the lake in the morning and evening to drink water. Preferably take the early morning or last ride in the evening. Do not carry any eatables as there are lot of monkeys near the boat house.
It is not a good choice to spend day for this lake unless you have love for wild life. Siting is not very easy but the ride is soothing.   The wait for the boat and bus is painful. 
"A must see place. Great variety of birds and also larger animals like wild elephants and buffalo along the surrounding land. Very relaxing and serene. Be careful of the monkeys though when you wait to board the boat. The cheeky rascals grab any oportunity to snatch and run off with your food, bottle or other small items.You can hire binoculars from the port too."
"We took the evening boat ride .It was very nice experience to observe the deep forest on the banks. Watched many Deer , Bisons & lots of birds. "
"Went for the first trip. Although its a nice scenic tour, if you are expecting to see elephants, you have to be very lucky. We managed to spot a few otters, wild boars and bisons. And of course, a lot many birds. Overall, an uneventful ride"
"A boat trip on overcrowded boats !  Supposed to be a park with wildlife, you will not see anything from the boat. Really do avoid it !"
Great Lake with lush green surroundings. Have to be careful of the monkeys at the gate they will go for the bags and purses.   For boat ride recommend to book tickets with Right side of the boat at that’s where the shore is and one will be able to see animals and birds
"This  artificial lake in Thekkady is one of the main attractions of the destination. Boating in Periyar is the main activity loved by most tourists visiting the place. The 100 year old lake set in thickly forested Western Ghats won't disappoint nature enthusiasts. There may not be much of wild life spotting but boating in this lake with dense forest all around is an experience worth-it that draws scores of tourists to Thekkady through out the year.Tickets can be booked at the counter of pre booked online through Periyar reserve's website. It is better to book the tickets for your preferred slot beforehand as the tickets get sold out very fast. Best time to experience the boating is early morning. 7.30 am slots are the best as the surroundings are serene during that time and there are chances of spotting some rare species of birds too during that time. If you are visiting Thekkady from Munnar or Alleppey, best is to book it for day 2 of your stay in Thekkady."
"Boating at the lake did not justify its purpose. First of all you need to take 65 rs ticket to reach the boating point. Later you discover that another 255 rs per person to be paid for boating. Even if you make your mind to pay and explore the sanctuary via boat in the lake, you…"
"Going by boat in periyar lake was like a dream . The beauty and cleanliness  looked like some European destination. Being born and brought up in india we are used to see garbage on all tourist places.but this was so clean virgin beauty,so soothing to the soul. The transfers were smooth .beware of monkeys at boating point."
" The endless lake is just nestled between the hills, it’s breathtaking view to see the thick forest and lush green patches. Boating in the lake is an excellent experience where one see different type of birds, bisons, hordes of wild pigs. We could also see a family of Elephants…"
"nice relaxing boat ride. lucky enough to see a few wild animals including deer, buffalo and elephants. went on last ride at 15:30 - first and last rides supposedly best ones to spot wildlife"
"It was fun to spot wildlife while on our boat ride. we initially thought it is a small boat ride however this was a boat with large group and they took us around the lake while spotting wildlife. spotted gavi, elephants, bison, birds etc. Be aware about the monkeys in the suurounding ;)"
Really  relaxing.   amazing view from the  top. Boating was the best part . it was the new Exeperiance for me and my wife.
"Clean environment. Well organised.  Did see Sambar, Bison, wild pig and many birds perched on tree stumps on the lake."
"You need to book this online to avoid queues. The boat ride is pretty well organised. The government bus will take you inside the reserved forest. The landscape is very different from what you would have seen. Carry a 500mm glass with your camera, you will find lot of birds in…"
Awesome location with fresh air. Good to Spend time with family. we need luck to see the animals. Find room near boating to avoid bus charges
Beautiful  scenic  boat  ride. Worthwhile  a trip. Do  not  carry  any  food   or  eat  in  frount  of  monkeys   as  they  will  snatch  it  away in the  waiting  area  before  boarding  the  boat. Ladies  do  not  stand  alone. Saw   very few  elephants.  Not  much  other …
"Nice boat ride, however very little animals to be seen. do not expect an experience like an African safari."
We were lucky to see the lake in full bloom. Boating experience was fabulous and spotted a few wildlife as well.
Go with less expectations    We went to Peryar Tiger Reserve or sanctuary in the morning. Theie official bus will pick you up from picking point. The bus ticket is for Rs 65 per individual. The bus drops you at the boating point. The ticket of the boat is fir Rs 255 per…
"Did the one and half hour boat ride at 9.30. Very peaceful and relaxing, beautiful scenery, but quite cold.  Saw one wild pig and a few deer, I wouldn’t really expect to see anything else, certainly not a tiger.  If you go early morning-7.00 there is a possibility of seeing…"
For boating only 25 tickets are sold online.   And you have to book a day before in online.  Be there before an hour since your vehicle can not go close to the lake and you have to travel 4 km in the forest department vehicle.  The place is crowded in weekends and in holidays so…
"We took a cruise on the lake on a rainy windswept day and managed to sight several bison, deer, egrets and cormorants on well run and life raft equipped passenger ferry boats. Well worth the time and the money. Sitting on the side seats makes photography easier"
"I tried to visit this place twice. The information center told me to come 1 hr before the boat ride which starts from 7.30am onwards till 5.30pm and each ride is of 1.30 hr. As of now ,there process is first purchase bus ticket from Jungle information centre ,stand in queue for bus for your turn. Go inside the jungle and again stand in queue to buy boat ticket at boating place. Then wait till your turn come to on-board the boat in which along with you almost 100 people will be there jam packed to see animals on the lake shore while doing boat ride. My experience i visited 6.30 AM to buy bus ticket, boarded the bus at 7.00 as was standing in queue, then went inside the jungle in bus till the boating starting point ,waited in queue and tickets were sold out for 7.30 boat ride. Next slot was of 9.30 AM and we have to wait in queue for 2 hr again with infants in queue as well. No facility of water also. Pathetic / worst management, they should sell all tickets at 1 point only, and that is bus boarding point. Better avoid it, not worth the time wasted there. You can better see animals in zoo as no grantee you will see animals in lake."
"Beautiful scenery. Beware of monkeys, do not take any etables as they tend to get notorious. While booking a boat ride ask for the upper deck seat for a better view. Animals are not sighted well as boat goes only from the center of the river not close to the land, but great scenic beauty. Must see"
"“Pleasure trip around lake” would be a better description for this outing.   Compared to a river safari trip in Borneo we experienced,this was more like a ferry ride foe 200 people around a man made park.  Cold sunny morning and pretty views.  "
Get the best out of Periyar and do a trek in the morning and a boat ride in the afternoon (if you visit Periyar in the dry season). Then you get to see the forest from within in the morning and get a good chance of spotting elephants by the lake in the afternoon. 
We did the Bamboo Rafting. This included apprx 3 hours of walking. Enjoyed it the most ... fresh and fragrant air !!! The birds give company with their own music during the walk. No Animal sighting though... thankfully the tour operators too did not make false claim about the…
