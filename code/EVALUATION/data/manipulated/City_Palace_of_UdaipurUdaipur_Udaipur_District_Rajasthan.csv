"One of the major attraction of Udaipur is city palace, located in center of city and close to Jagdish temple. You can drive your car in narrow street to reach to palace. Parking charge is 350 apart from entry ticket. Walkthrough visit will take ~1.5h."
Best place to visit in udaipur. Amazed to see such a huge creation and history related to it. A must visit place in udaipur
"Udaipur isn't just the city of lakes but also home to one of the most amazing palaces in the country. The City Palace is a spectacular piece of architecture and has stood the test of time since it's origins in the 16th century. It's surprisingly well maintained, but I guess it probably has to be when you have the direct descendant and the current King of Udaipur living in the palace next door. It's best to take a guided tour of the palace as there are so many things to learn about which you risk missing out on should you go solo. Be prepared to spend between 2 to 3 hours here if you're stopping to take plenty of photographs which I highly recommend. Point to note - it's not ideal for individuals with injuries or mobility problems as there are a lot of stairs and no wheelchair access."
"Udaipur City Palace is one of the architectural marvels of Rajasthan, located peacefully on the banks of Lake Pichola. Undoubdetdly, this is MUST to visit place in Udaipur.  Timings & Fees:  930 AM - 5:3 PM Adults : Rs 30 Child : Rs 15  Important Points :  1.  Duration 2.5 hrs - 3hrs 2. 3-4 important Udaipur tourist points are adjacent to the City Palace. So, if you start early, you can cover most of the places. 3. Near By attraction ( walking distance) - Jagdish Temple, Lake Pichola, Bagore Ki Haveli ( 7 PM dance show- details in my other review), Gangaur Ghat etc. 4. IMP: Guide is my strong recommendation. You will get them just before the main entrance of the palace will show themselves busy; however, if you reach early they will take your group alone.* Do not rely 100% on guide for information, do ask questions and history. They add a lot of spicy flavours and keep you engaged. * Guide's help you in taking the picture and getting you best picture spots. Check with them.* Keep your kids in front of the guide to listen about the history, they will really enjoy and feel proud about Indian rulers.* They help you in skipping the long queues by taking you from the short cut.*Don't pay the guide fees in advance. 5. If you reach early, you should be able to get good pictures. By 11 -2 PM the sun will be on TOP and make your pics dull. Again - start early. 6. You can start with Jagdish Temple in the morning and then reach to City palace by 9 PM ( 200 steps away). 7. If you are able to cover the City palace by 1 PM, plan your lunch at NATRAJ. BIG Auto will charge Rs 80-100. 8. If you plan to cover the CP in the second half of the day, then you can visit Bagore Ki Haveli ( MUST- MUST) show at 7 PM. Book your tickets online and read my review.  ** If this review is useful for you, please do hit the ""Helpful"" thumb below.

Visiting Udaipur city palace comes first in the sightseeing places and it’s worth the visit . It takes min 1 hr to quickly finish the tour and for a time is a good experience . 
"Visited the Udaipur City Palace and loved the history and architecture.  Beautiful separate palaces for the King and Queen.  The City Palace, Udaipur is a palace complex Situated in the city of Udaipur in the Indian state of Rajasthan. It was built over a period of nearly 400…"
This is a must visit place for the people loving great architecture. Recommend this place for students 
"City palace is a Historical site depicting Rajput kings and their hierarchy. Old artefacts kept and rich piece of sculpture with preserved walls of skilled art work is seen at this site. Overlooking the Pichhola lake and surrounded by beautiful scenic beauty, this palace stands…"
A fascinating showcase of life of Majarajahs from years back and very educational. Taking a guide is to be recommended as they give great insights
"Probably the most iconic of the sites in Udaipur and well worth a visit. Crammed full of amazing buildings, artwork and artefacts. Highly recommended."
"A must see place for everyone. Takes at least 3 hours .Blend of Rajput and Mughal architecture. Beautiful  pieces of civil , glass , marble ,wood crafts .Avoid the shops in palace - unreasonable prices."
"Visited the beautiful City Palace of Udaipur. Teeming with tourists, but able to spend quality time learning about history and culture. Well maintained palace complex."
This is a huge fort/palace with some interesting rooms and history. Worth a visit and worth taking a guide for £5 or less. Make sure you also visit the Crystal Gallery which is extraordinary and has the smartest loos in India!
City palace is located right in the center of the city on a high ground from where you can have a majestic view of the whole city and Lake Pichola.But to reach the city palace needs a great effort as the lanes leading to palace are narrow and crowded. Taking your car is almost impossible. Best is to hire a Three wheeler Auto Rickshaw or go walking enjoying the market in the narrow lanes selling local Arti facts and street food.There is a nice cafe with a Bar inside the city palace.Nice food and drinks.
The best and number tourist attraction spot.  Its located near Lake Pichola and palace has beautiful painting and Murals.   Come early before its really crowded. Check the rates and guides in the photos.   A must visit! 
Loved it. Very rich heritage and lot of historic facts well preserved. Best to visit with guide or take audio tour. It will take 2-3 hrs. Not advisable for elderly with some limitations for walking and climbing stairs. 
"Appreciated the historical site, art and the elements of the palace, with breathtaking views of the city and lake. Tour guide helped take some artistic pictures using the mirrors in the palace. The palace can use restoration to bring up the true nature of the marble! Never the less it was worth the visit."
Beautiful indian history....mesmerizing. amazed to know that Mewar is the world longest serving  dynasty.
It is very beautiful . If you are in Udaipur this place should be in top of the list . Enjoyed my visit here with my family .
My trip to India was just an experience to remember . We visited city palace my husband and I.  Enjoyed all the site seeing.snd Rajastan as a whole. Jaipur was also interesting.
"City Palace is an Amazing place, the Grandauer it has is unmatched.It takes half a day to see the palace and appreciate its beauty.  The marvel of articians and the taste of Kings & Queens are uncomparable. Appreciate every room tastefully decorated with different glass, tiles, semi precious stones,  colour combinations and the marble & granite used to bring out the best result.Location is also admirable.  Nothing but the best was available to the Royals. Rich History and Royal ambiance is something to treasure. A must visit place for all."
Lovely palace in Lake Pichola  Well worth having a guide as it is huge. Takes a few hours but lots of history and architecture 
Amazing place. Take a guide to listen to all history with palace. Will definitely make you awe. Scenic views. Well maintained heritage.
All the magic of this Palace is on the external facade and views over lake Pichola so you really don’t need to get a museum pass (300 bucks) unless you plan for spend 2 hours wondering the museum and studying the artifacts. Remember you can always buy additional passes once you are in the grounds with the common pass.
"Got mesmerized by seeing grandness and royal heritage of Maharana's. Lifetime experience, it's a must visit place. Keep wallet pretty heavvy, by the end of the tour u will feel wallet turned feather lite."
Well worth a stroll around. Get in early as it gets really busy. Beautiful rooms and exhibits etc. Good views across the city and lake.
Excellently preserved palace right in the middle of town. Need a guide or an audio guide. We got a guide who was very good as it keeps a local employed.
"It is a must visit place in Udaipur for any tourist. Take a cab to the palace. If you take the back entrance,  there is an additional charge of Rs. 30/-. Plus,  you may have to take a golf cart to reach the palace as it is a 700 metre inclined walk.  If you take the front entrace,  you are saved both. Pl take a guide,  it helps understand the whole place. It will take you around 2 hours to complete the tour. If you have someone elderly who can't climb stairs,  then there is a lift/elevator available for that person but then that person will miss visiting 70% of the palace.  Totally,  one has to climb around 200/250 steps while navigating through the palace.  There is a boat ride available @Rs.300/400 per head (Rs. 800 per head) after 2 pm which lasts for 1 hour. It takes you to a place called jagmandir- an island housing a temple,  park and a restaurant. I did not take the boat ride so can't comment on its worth. Also the charges indicated for the boat ride may have a margin of error of 15% as i wasn't paying attention since i did not want to do the boat ride. The ticket for entering the Palace is Rs. 300 per head.  But it is totally worth it. There is a souvenir shop located at the end of the palace where you get local stuff like sarees,  dress material,  kurta material,  scarfs etc which is exceptionally good.  The charges may be a bit higher as most of the foreigners buy stuff from the shop. But i think it is worth it. Photography is allowed inside the palace and the palace is an outstanding piece of art. In the evening there is a light and sound show and the ticket bought in the morning is valid in the evening too.  Of course you can't enter the palace but the show is conducted outside thr maim palace,  on the palace lawns. I heard that it isca nice show. I did not attend it though. Toilet facility is available at two places - that is at both ends of the palace. It is a big thumbs up from tourist's perspective. You get an insight into the kives of the kings who have stayed there."
We visited on month of November 2019. The city palace is not pocket friendly. Various entry fees for various things inside palace. If roughly calculated each adult person expense would be around ₹2500-₹3000 ( Indian Nationals). I would suggest just take the outside tour that’s more than enough. Attaching the price list of various activities and events inside the palace.
This is well worth the visit in Udaipur. Get a guide or the recorded tour. Also include the boat out to the Jag Mandir very relaxing and you get a different view of the Palace from the water.
"A day trip to city palace will require two to three hours. Palace is huge and has to be covered on foot. There are battery operated vehicles available at entrance gate which takes you upto main building but after that one has to travel on foot, this comes with an extra charge. There is an eatery in the premises which offers food and drinks, its good but very expensive. Palace is well kept though at some places it requires maintenance. One has to carry plenty of water. Guides are available and will be helpful if one wants to understand history this place carried. Helping Staff and security staff is too rude. View from palace windows of Udaipur is beautiful along with lake Pichola on other side. Audio tour is also available. Over all a nice place and a good time can be spent there and after that boating in lake Pichola will be an added attraction."
If you have seen the fort of Jaipur than its not that great. But for architecture it's great. If you want to know the history and have a interest in it than its good to go. Its just one portion is open for public and royal family is residing in other part. It's not a govt. Heritage but a private property of royal family. View of city from the city palace is amazing from different areas so don't miss viewing that.Crystal gallery is only for those who are serious of crystal stuff but for the price ticket of RS. 700 I don't think it's worth the price. You can't take pictures of the crystal stuff as cameras are not allowed.For my take. Go see the city palace and skip the crystal gallery.
Enjoyed coffee & cake in place cafe...quick & excellent service by staff @ cafe   Place is also clean and well maintained.  I  love to visit every year.
"Nice palace a bit overrun by selfie taking tourists. Located nicely in the center of town. Overall, I would do it again."
If you are visiting Udaipur then this a must visit. Try to do a guide there since you will get to know about the history.
