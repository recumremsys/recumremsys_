"The base has many areas to view pandas. Do plan to arrive early (might want to Didi right to the gate) as the panda areas can get quite crowded and pushy as the day goes on. There are many opportunities to take photos around the pandas and not all stations are busy so it is easy to avoid the crowds. We did visit all the stations and would recommend bringing good shoes and be prepared for the weather. The start feeding around 7 am so you will see lots of pandas munching on bamboo around this time. Around 9 am most pandas were sleeping and we left the park after 4 hours. Getting in early was ok but leaving was a nightmare with so much congestion on the road that leads to the area. We walked down the street to catch our Didi so we did not have to spend so much time in traffic.In addition to the pandas there are a few red pandas here that are worth seeing and a museum that contains all kinds of information on conservation, panda facts, weird taxidermy and panda themed art. The souvenirs and beverages inside the park can be on the more expensive side so we would recommend buying snacks before coming and negotiate with the sellers outside to get a good price for panda ears and souvenirs. Outside there is a pavilion where we grabbed lunch and there are some fairly inexpensive options but you do not get the best quality. We also spent some time in the post office areas as there are many options for cards to send home or keep."
"A MUST DO in Chengdu and one of my top 2 reasons for visiting this city (second to eating).  As it is summer, going in morning is better suited weather wise for both humans and pandas.  You can spend all day walking among the different areas and watch pandas feast on bamboo, climb around and we even got to see a 3 day old panda in the nursery.  Make sure to visit the donation center, donate to the research base and take home a stuffed panda among other smaller donation gifts.  Better way for your dollars to go than the gift shop."
"My wife and I booked a 3 day private tour to the Giant Panda Reserve, Leshan Giant Buddha, and Mount Emei.  Our guide Lisa and driver Hu were exceptional and amazing.  Lisa spoke English perfectly and the Hu was a very considerate and calm driver. Lisa was very knowledgeable and engaging the whole time. We could not have asked for a better guide.Let me preface below, we went to Chengdu during the Mid Autumn Festival or National Day Holiday and was not thinking about the crowds.The first day was the Giant Panda Reserve and we were picked up at our hotel promptly and drove to the Panda reserve.  The crowd was pretty big but we were able to get into the preserve within 10 minutes.  Once into the preserve the Panda's were very active and we saw lots of them including the Red Panda.  We also were able to see some babies about 2 months old.  This was a life long bucket list visit for my wife and I and we were not disappointed.  Again Lisa was very engaging and answered all of our questions. We then went to the Wide and Narrow Alley and again this was very crowded but my wife was able to get what she wanted and we say lots of scenery.  We then decided to skip the Museum and go to lunch and then back to our hotel.  It was a great day.Day two we drove to Leshan to see the Giant Leshan Buddha.  You can't order or buy tickets in advance for the boats, which is the the best way to see the entire Buddha. Lisa went to get tickets for the boat and this was a very big ordeal.  She was in line for an hour, along with many others and then found out you could have purchased on line which seriously upset the people on line.  Once we received the tickets we got in line for the boats and  it appeared to be total chaos as everyone ahead of us was pushing and yelling.  This again was due to the crowds and it being the holiday.  Then the Boat tour operator said that instead of 10 minutes between boats it would be an hour.  Needless to say this did not go over well and it was even more chaotic.  At that point we decided that it was not a good idea to stay in this line and we gave up in seeing the Buddha.  Through all of this Lisa was calm and professional.  We decided to go to a site on the river we could see the Buddha just not up close as we wanted.  We then went to lunch and then headed out for Mt. Emei.  Again Hu was courteous and a good driver.  Well Murphy's Law kicked in again and when we got to Emei the locals police or officials put in a Traffic Control  period (no private cars could go into the town during the traffic control period)  so we could not get to our hotel for another 3-4 hours and we would miss our dinner reservation and Chinese Opera reservation.  We called the hotel and they were just given the word about the traffic control and had no idea it was coming.  At that point we decided to just go back to Chengdu that night.Again Lisa being true to form said she would plan a day for us in Chengdu the next day.  The drive back to Chengdu took 2 extra hours due to the traffic because of the holiday.  Hu again did amazing in the bumper to bumper traffic and we made it back safe.  Lisa scheduled us a tour of a Monastery and the Poet Du Fu's Cottage.  It was beautiful and very interesting.   Lisa was very knowledgeable about both locations and we had a great time.  We then had lunch at a local small restaurant that was great.  We then came back to the hotel and said good bye to Lisa and Hu.We scheduled this trip during the Mid Autumn/National Day holiday and we now know we should not have done this.  Given this and the hiccups involved The  Travel China Guide service could not have been better, they could not have  foreseen the problems we had.  It is to their credit to have Lisa and Hu working for them and be able to handle these types of issues when they arise."
