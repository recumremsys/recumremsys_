Wonderful guided tour of the back to back houses. Gave you a real insight of times gone by brought to life by Jeff the excellent guide.
Book in advance. The kids loved it. Very good look in local Birmingham history and the way of life. Great guides. 5 stars!!!
"Very interesting. Took me back to my grandmas house. Good funny guide, who really knew his stuff. Need to be fit as lots of stairs, some very steep."
"An excellent few hours learning about the lives of people who lived in these historic houses. Our small group were led through each room by our very knowledgeable guide, Jean, who could draw from stories told by her own ancestors. Fabulous that these houses were saved from the destructive town planners of the 1970s and 1980s and then restored by the National Trust for the benefit of us all and future generations. Book ahead to be sure of getting to see these next time you are in Birmingham. Thoroughly recommend to everyone"
Been past heremany times and unaware it was here. Great piece of social history and well worth a visit
Visited today Brum Back to Backs.. city central .. Easy to get to from train stations . Tour guide John  full of knowledge and made the tour so enjoyable. Booking essential as tours only and you can do this on National Trust website or APP..Takes about 1.5hrs..Very steep  spiral stairs so not suitable for wheelchairs as no lifts  .. Would recommend if you go to Brum to relive days gone by .. loved it .. Don’t forget to visit the little sweet shop there ..
"Took an elderly friend that was born and lived in a back to back in Hurst Street. That plus an excellent guide made for a very special day. Visitors from all over the globe seemed enthralled with the stories, a must see for anyone visiting Birmingham, great trip for locals too."
"Well worth the visit to this slice of life in Birmingham from the Victorian era to the 1970s. Our tour guide was Ross, who filled the tour with facts and anecdotes, really bringing it all to life. From the Levi’s to Mrs. Mekin and George Saunders... I could picture them all. The only thing I would say is think twice if you’re not good with stairs, or at least wear comfortable shoes. Loved it!!!"
Really interesting from local guide who really knows his stuff. Excellent gave insight into how people lived and worked. Keep up the good work NT volunteers. We really appreciate it.
Amazed at how people lived in the not so distant past. My father lived in one of these with 8 brothers and sisters. How they survived I don't know. Tour led by a very knowledgeable lady who answered all our questions with such passion. Our next visitors to Birmingham will certainly be taken on the tour. Well with it.
"Many of the historical places you can visit  are stately homes and castles. However,  instead of learning how Lords and Ladies spent their hours of leisure, here you gain an insight into the lives of every day, skilled working class people. These are the people who made Birmingham one of the most important industrial centres of the world.Our tour leader, Di, was excellent. A local woman with local knowledge, she was very engaging. You are allowed to handle objects, which is unusual for a NT property.Wear sturdy footwear as there are many steep spiral staircases to climb. Don’t forget that tours need to be booked in advance. Our tour took about 1 hour 45 minutes."
An amazing day with so much history. Great guide “Des” had some many stories. Makes you realise the every day luxuries we take for granted. So close on your doorstep and easily overlooked but a must see place. A lot of steep steps but good handrails around the properties which have been loving recreated. Central Birmingham with lots to see and do. Well done national trust.
Visited here with friends. We had a marvellous guide called Pat who took us through the history of 200 years. The national trust have done a fantastic renovation of this property. Highly recommend this attraction.
Great few hours spent on the back to back tour. Tour guides really informative and lots to see. Staff very friendly and helpful. Really good place to find out about life in the back to backs and Birmingham. The attraction is centrally located - 5 minutes walk from the main stations or park in the Arcadian car park. You have to book on a tour in advance. Don’t miss the sweet shop after your tour!
"Visited this National Trust property and both myself and my 12 year old daughter loved the walk through time. Enjoyed leaning about the history of the buildings and of how Birmingham grew and the stroke of luck an how the buildings were saved. Our tour guide (Jane) was very friendly and very knowledgeable. Highly recommend a visit, just make sure you book ahead of time."
"Visited in non stop rain , Jeff was a superb guide , he gave us a very informative tour of the houses , we really enjoyed his extensive knowledge of life over the years . Thank goodness these houses have been preserved, well worth a visit , thank you ."
"Amazing look back in time to how people who came to Birmingham looking for work in this growing industrial city lived. The site is delicately and superbly restored. And our tour guide, Jeff (with a J!) told the stories of the actual families who lived there with such brilliant color that I felt we were there with them. Any history buff would love this tour. And if you’re looking for how the Peaky Blinders might have lived, you won’t be disappointed. So happy we did this tour!!"
Had an excellent visit our tour guide Wes was brilliant and he had also lived in the back to back houses when he was growing up so made the tour even better. there are a lot of stairs to climb but its worth it but also a ground floor tour as well. Hard to believe people had to live like that plenty of facts and interesting things to look at. If you are interested in Victorian Birmingham this tour is for you. you can also book a room and stay there but there is a six months waiting list.
"Been planning to see this gem since the popular Peaky Blinders, it brings such an incredible insight you feel like your going back in time. We will be back"
"Visited this week and found it incredibly interesting, our tour guide Ross was brilliant, he succeeded in making the history interesting and thought provoking. This was despite the best efforts of 2 young boys on the tour to disrupt things! Definitely recommended."
"I visited the Back to Backs with my daughter this week as my birthday treat. Our tour guide was Jennifer who was very good. Jennifer made the tour for us, lots of information in a very interesting way and the tour flowed through the rooms/years. The houses had been furnished to different periods and had lots of artefacts which we were able to handle. Great value for money and although my (adult) daughter only went to accompany me she thoroughly enjoyed it. Thank you."
"Our guide,John made this a most entertaining as well as informative visit. The lives of the families that lived in these cramped houses were really brought to life as we clambered up and down narrow staircases. Having visited many grand National Trust halls and manor houses and experienced many excellent tours I can honestly say that the tour of these humble dwellings was the best!"
Great visit.  Guides very informative.  Would highly recommend.  Was very cold day which gave a better idea of what conditions would have been like in the 19th century.
Having lived in Birmingham all my life surprisingly only just visited this historic site. Guess it's true not knowing what is on your own doorstep sometimes! This is a place well worth visiting if you like history and how people used to live....it really gives you an insight in how things used to be. On arrival we were greeted by our tour guide Ann who lived herself in back to back houses....some of her stories were very enlightening. She made the tour really interesting and answered any questions we had with real enthusiasm and a bit of humour! The tour itself lasts approx an hour and a half but it goes so quickly as you seem to travel through time! The houses are small and there are a lot of steep spiral stairs to climb up and down.....but sufficient handles/bannisters to hold onto so no problem if you take it slowly. However probably not suitable for people with severe mobility problems. I loved every part of this experience and would happily visit again as would probably learn something new that I missed this time round! Booking is essential as otherwise you may be disappointed. Would highly recommend a visit .
"if you are  spending time in Birmingham, the Back to Backs has to be your No1 priority.  An amazing walk back in time with such amazing and interesting guides. We were fortunate to be hosted by Carl (or even Karl - apologies) who was such an informative and amusing host.  Just have to take my sons and grandson!!  Thank you National Trust."
"Visited a while back but enticed to do a review. Considering my folks first house in the 1960s was a back to back in Small Heath, this brings back real memories. The outside toilet with a pull chain,imagine in winter, the front bay window and door, just the small feel of it.the tin bath, and the yard in front used to be called ""the entry"".industrial workers had it tough in the victorian times, and it was not till 1970s that the back to backs started to vanish as they were regarded slum standard. I think they are rather cosy, but give me a modern house with a garden anyday. Still worth a visit, you will feel very lucky to be living now not then."
"Visiting The National Trust back to backs is like walking into a time capsule and was a really interesting experience. Our guide Jeff was BRILLIANT, he told us all about it and transported us through the decades by telling us stories about the people who had lived there. Definitely recommend if you like social history"
"A very enjoyable and interesting visit - lots of facts , both educational and humorous. Jeff made it entertaining for all ages and was a great tour guide. Our family ages ranged from 9 to 70 and Jeff Williams did a brilliant job of maintaining our attention the whole time. Thank you"
"Had a great time at Birmingham Back to Backs with friends.Booking was easy - emailed when we were free and got a confirmation by telephone (voicemail, because I missed it!). Signed in on the day to get our tickets and pay/show our membership cards and then got some sweets from the shop next door before our tour. The sweet shop was great, big selection of old favourites sold by the quart.We met our tour guide, Des, outside the shop. He was wonderful - friendly and chatty - full of facts. He really tailored the tour to our group and where our questions led.You are taken through several of the houses, with stories in each room and clambering up and down steep steps. You're allowed to touch a lot of the objects in the rooms and sit on chairs and beds which really gives it a homely and relaxed feel. You can also hear the movement and mumbles from other tours, which adds to the atmosphere, as that's how it would have been in the past! People telling from Windows down to the court below.This was a highlight of our weekend in the city, with a really great insight into the highs and lows of life for ordinary people in the past."
"Birmingham back to backs were a national trust destination we had been planning to go to for a while. What out us off was that you have to book in advance.  Do not let this out you off. The tour lasts around 90 minutes and covers the history of the last back to back houses in the country. There is a fascinating history starting around 1840 and working to the 2000’s that is well presented in a true time travel experience. Coupled with knowledgeable tour guides to explain the stories and point out key exhibits, the time flew by. We will definitely be making a return visit to one of the smallest but interesting National Trust places we have been to. Sadly, you are not allowed to take photos on the tour."
"We visited 7th Sept for treat for hubbys birthday. Our guide, Jeff was fantastic. Involved the kids on the tour and was very informative. Was great to hear the stories and see some of the stuff that my dad and grandad did/used back in the day. Would highly recommend."
Saw this tour when searching for things to do on our trip to Birmingham. Sooo glad I booked it .Love social history and often visit Beamish museum in County Durham .we went round in small groups at regular intervals.Our guide told us interesting stories about who used to live there as well as sharing his own memories of living in a back to back .Yes a few steep spiral wooden stairs to go up and down so not good if you're not physically fit .We were warned the houses didn't smell great but I actually love those old smells .We kept close to the fires as a wee bit nippy when visiting in the winter .Highly recommend
"We hear it has good reviews and what this little outing packs is a big punch. Informative, funny, sad, nostalgic all at once. To think some council might have knocked this piece of history down. The national trust has done an amazing job. If you live in the Midlands or need a Birmingham activity 15 minutes from the Bull ring visit here. It's a timed guided tour with plenty of time at the end on your own. Note not all lavatorys are for the public so Jeff or Geoff says. Very good visit not suitable to little children I would say."
"My husband grew up in a Back to back house in Birmingham. Visiting the Birmingham Back to Backs took him back to his childhood reviving mixed memories. The restoration/conservation that has been carried out is remarkable and whilst II grew up in a very different environment there were many sights and smells that reminded me of my own childhood.Our guide, Jeff was extremely knowledgeable and talked with humour and respect about life in areas of Birmingham over 150 years ago right through to the 1970s.This is a small NT property but absolutely worth visiting. Jeff talked about real families who lived in these properties bringing their histories to life and reminding us of a bygone age. We thoroughly enjoyed the hour and a half tour and would highly recommend a visit. (Booking required)"
"Fascinating trip back in time, and a comprehensive overview given by our friendly guide Jeff. You start the tour off in 1870s and then move forward through time through another 2 properties to reach the 1930's. You then step through another of the many ""secret doors"" into the final property, a tailors shop. Our children loved the twisty route around the properties and really enjoyed the way that the experiences of the past residents were brought back to life through the descriptions and items around the houses. Well worth the visit, a ground floor tour is available to those that can't manage the stairs. Book well in advance so as to avoid disappointment!"
