Enjoyed a lot amidst of drizzling.Good scenic view. Better to visit in toy train.surrounding views are picturesque.
One of the better spots to see in Darjeeling. Beautiful and well maintained. Beautiful view of the Kanchenjunga. Don’t bother using the binoculars. Tried it and didn’t think it was worth it. Looks beautiful to the naked eye from this spot. You can also dress up in the local attire for a reasonable price and take photographs.
"had fun there, went in steam engine. nice place to take pictures among flowers and mountains. also try binoculars to view the hills"
Must visit place in Darjeeling. The war memorial and walk around it is good. Do plan to visit in morning when there is clear sky and good weather. The toy train also makes a stop here.
A very well maintained place where you can see dargeeling through binoculars and dress up in tea garden attire and even. Pick up tea in some bushes planted there. Can do marketing and buy gift  items from nearby shops.
By toy train we reached. Visited the park. Nicely decorated. Toy train experience was awesome through this park
"Great short trip along narrow guage railway. Travelled past many dwellings, crossed several roads and waved to countless bystanders taking photos of the little train. Stopped at the loop for a while to take pictures. Enjoyable experience."
"Don't go as an outsider tourist. I understand it's all business and being a tourist spot Darjeeling has all of these, everywhere. You spend 20 bucks for ticket and then you see the same mountains and same flowers that you can see anywhere in Darjeeling. There's a monument to celebrate Gorkha fighters. You can take photos of yourself in local costumes by paying 70 rs. The best way to visit here is by toy train where the entrance fee is covered with the ticket price"
Very foggy day so didn't see much . Will be beautiful when all the seedlings are  flowering . Relaxing area. Historic interest
You can watch views from top and there are Binoculars at Rs.30/- per person where they will zoom each place and explain you everything. Don't go by Toy Train and visit separately so that you can enjoy the views by spending ample time.
Visited this place two times; once as part of 3 point tour in the morning. It was crowded and people selling items. There were multiple options of pakodas and tea in the morning for light snacks. Second time was when we were having the ride in the toy train. Trains stops for almost 10 mins here. At this time it was very less crowded and you can appreciate the beauty of the gardens and the majestic Panoramic views of the valley. Views are fantastic as you can view Darjeeling town with Kanchenjunga in the backdrop.
Had different expectations before visiting this place. Not sure why they take entrance fees for this place. There is no information provided about the significance of the place. One can just play around on the rail tracks. It also has a war memorial but again not much information about it is provided
"The heritage train has a 10-min halt here and we explored this place. Saw the staff stoking the engine. The view from here is excellent. However, due to cold, the grass had died."
Nothing special barring a great viewpoint of darjeeling town. Located in between darjeeling and ghum. The steam engine joyride will stop here for 10 minutes. A round area with gardens and an army monument in the centre of it. Could skip if time is not available.
an engineering marvel by which the Himalayan Railway descends steeply or climbs up in short distance. Has entry ticket and a sort of garden.
"Visited it as a part of joyride in the toytrain with a 10min stop at this place. There is a Gurkha war memorial at the centre with well maintsined garden. The trains chugging in and out of course is the chief attraction. However, according yo people who have visited before, the developmental activities have taken out part of the thrill."
Batasia loop has a train track and a garden offering great views of the Kanchenjunga. The day we went there was bright sunshine and we got brilliant views of the mountain to take photos for a lifetime !! There will be option to try the local dresses for taking pics as well. It also is a army memorial and is a salute to the martyrdom of Indian Armed Forces. Do visit during your travels to Darjeeling !!
if you have planned taking a toy/joy train ride then there is no need to visit this place separately. very clean and well maintained. does not look like you are in Darjeeling compared to the litter and dirt outside we see. Trains stops there for approx. 10 min and you get good time to click photos in front of train and along the park.
"Nice place to get down when the toy train halts. Memorial park is good one to visit. Do read the roll of honour slab in the park. As such there is nothing to do here, other than walk around till the toy train starts it journey back."
"This is a stop on the incredibly disappointing 'toy' train.  There is nothing of interest here and the view is often obscured by mist, pollution or both. Of course, the pollution is partially created by the train itself which belches smoke as it carts tourists around at ripoff prices. Avoid unless you're really desperate to find something to do in Darjeeling (which you might be!)"
almost everything in these 2 states lean on the mountain Range Kanchanjunga to make an otherwise average trip excellent ... everywhere you go this is thrust on you like there is nothing else to showcase ...Even in this famous loop where you have now a garden and a gorka memorial ...the main highlight is the view from powerful binoculars on rent of the famous Kanchanjunga.. Salute to the majestic range …!!!
"Located approximately 4 km from taxi stand, this place has historic importance . However there nothing more to explore this place . Better skip this place and take rest from travelling."
You can see the Mt Kanchenjunga range from the place. The toy train halts at the place and takes a loop. A very beautiful and picturesque location. Do try momos there.
Situated on the way from Ghoom railway station to Darjeeling..The toy train turns around the park . Quite fascinating to be a part of the journey.It hardly takes 10 minutes  to reach it from Ghoom railway station. Garden is nicely maintained.There is a war memorial created in the memory of Gorkha soldiers who have lost their lives while fighting for the motherland.The entry fee is very nominal.
Take a joy ride and visit the Batasia Loop. Though this time (I have visited many times in my childhood - typical Bengali summer vacation trip) I found it to be dirty.
Its a memorial for our soldiers. Good to visit pay our respects to our brave soldiers. Take a few photos and proceed to next point.Jai Hind!.
"We went to the Batasia loop in the joy ride toy train. The train stops here for 10 minutes for us to enjoy the beautiful view from this little garden and appreciate the awesome train route loop. Loved the place, so clean"
Visited Batasia with family and its a great tribute to the martyrs of our country. A must visit place when in Darjeeling.
"We went in the toy train around the batasia loop. There's some old world charm in this. Loved it. We had booked the tickets online before reaching Darjeeling. Almost a month ahead. You can.opt for the diesel trains or steam engine trains. Steam engine trains are costlier but they are the original ones. We finished the train rides, came walking to our hotel. There were lots of little shops on the streets where you can.buy woollens at a very cheap price. For personal use or for gifts."
"Book a toy train online a month before form irctc website. Choose station codes DJ(Darjeeling) to DJRZ(darjeeling) coz its a loop train. Darjeeling to Darjeeling back form Batasia loop. Train passes form different small villages, roads and take U turn from Batasia loop which is a must sight seeing place"
"Hving seen millions of snaps already, it is a bit of a deja vu. Best done by the DHR. Stay within the complex as outside etc is not very well maintained. During monsoons, the view consisted only of clouds so the basic of the loop doesn't come across.The DHR tho is worth every penny."
"Perhaps one of the most picturesque train routes in all of Darjeeling, the Batasia Loop is a lush green toy train pathway that is meant to minimise the elevation of the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway. The unique design of this magnificent attraction allows the track to wrap around itself through a hilltop tunnel. One of the most enchanting aspects of the Batasia Loop is its unmatched natural beauty which is a wonderful sight to behold. Located on Hill Cart Road (NH 55), you can enjoy a panoramic view of the Darjeeling in all its verdant glory. Situated in Ghum which is about 5 kilometres from Darjeeling, the Batasia Loop was commissioned for construction in the year 1919. A memorial dedicated to the Gorkha soldiers of the Indian Army who laid down their lives during the war of Indian independence is situated close by as well. Batasia Loop rises from the midst of emerald carpets of mountain vegetation and overlooks the snowy peaks of Kanchenjungha on one side as well. Endearing flowers line the way, which makes a trip through this attraction a must after you have witnessed the fascinating sunrise of Tiger Hill. The view of the train tearing past the white of the clouds and deeper into the green beauty of the terrain is a refreshing and enchanting expedition which should not be missed."
"Visited after taking Re.15 ticket, realized later no need to take ticket, the same would be covered in toy train rideJust a round park, well maintained. witness kanchanjunga from here. and whole darjeelingenjoy hot pakodas outside to quench your cold."
"This place is built for our soldiers who martyred during wars or any relief work for country.. Behind the war memorial you can see the mountains.. You can feel the emotions in the statues who is paying tribute, May our all soldiers live long and get all the happiness.  Salute to all the soldiers."
"I went to Batasia Loop. Located around 5 km from Darjeeling, Batasia loop is a spiral railway track where the toy train takes a complete 360 degree turn. The toy train descends by 1,000 ft. as it completes the loop through a large circular area. It is great place to go."
