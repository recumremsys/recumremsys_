"Looks very new, was a wonderful place to visit.  So many fish to view over 2 levels.  Very impressed - a great place to take your children to."
"Have some good sea life and reptiles for the kids to view. Some big tanks but do not expect massive or large sharks etc. This is not a large place but if you take your time you can spend two hours looking at everything from rays, to spiders, lizards and snakes. Worth taking the kids."
"Took 3 annual trips to Cairns to finally visit this amazing venue.  Really impressive displays of all forms of fish and aquatic life, with emphasis on the tropical species. Some of the tanks and displays were massive, with divers swimming with the sharks, rays etc., hand feeding as the opportunity arose.  Knowledgible staff were keen to describe unique species and in some cases allow people to touch and handle some of them.  Must have spent 4 hours there.  World class."
Buy tickets online to save money. It's very informative and interesting. Many fish and creatures to see. The cafe is good too.
Was great to see lots of the different species of fish...big and small and other animals too. Loved the shark feeding.
Loved this. Great variety and selection. Loved the display of different colour reef fish. Never seen a shark egg before.
"Good views of many types of fish and interesting educational talks. Make sure you go to the talks as they help with knowledge. Lots of other creatures such as turtles, frogs, and snakes also to look at. Good family day out."
Beautiful new building and friendly and staff. The exhibits are very well done. Don't miss the living reef exhibit. Was amazing to see up close the live coral
"A wonderful collection of sea critters and lots of talks for those interested in learning more about specific animals like the sawfish or ecosystems like the Great Barrier Reef.  Walking through the tunnels was fun, especially when the huge 'smiling' stingrays glide over your head!  The  feeding sessions were fascinating too."
spent a few hours walking through the displays. loved the shark tank where they swim above you and the two level coral reef was mesmerising. the staff were helpful and as my partner is not mobile we took a wheel chair through. a nice touch which made it better for him. oh and the adjacent restaurant looked great...next time
Really enjoyed our visit to this aquarium. Very interactive with lots of displays onsite! Great shop to buy your gifts & souvenirs from! Was quite surprised on the size of the place not what we were expecting in Cairns. Loved watching the divers feed the massive grouper.
New and worth seeing. Be sure to catch the talk on sharks! Lovely to walk under sharks and stingrays gliding overhead. Many presentations allowing for touching and feeling. Info about the Reef.
"Nicely set up, all clean and very accessible, Great displays with interactions as well. Recommended for young and old."
"Enjoyed the tunnels in particular and having the manta rays float inches above overhead.  Informative, educational, well laid out. Not too long, not too short."
"What a well laid out and expansive aquarium. The reptiles and other creatures are so well looked after and thrive in that environment, Photography turned out just beautiful. Take your time and wonder through."
"Managed to spend most of the day here, the live shows and talks were highly educational. The feeding of the reef fish was great to watch, and it was good to see that it was not just saltwater/tropical animals which were on display- plenty of freshwater turtles and crays,the endangered sawfish was my definite highlight. Plenty to see for all ages, wheelchair accessible also."
Very informative about reef ecosystems and other important Australian sealife. Guided talks flowed naturally from one to another and were both entertaining and informative. Absolutely a must for anyone intending to see the reef.
Had a wonderful informative morning at the new Cairns Aquarium. Shark and Ray feeding time was interesting and the guide had interesting information to share about the sharks and rays. Loved seeing them swim so gracefully. Would recommend visiting.
"We loved our time here. Lots to see and do. Attended several of the informative talks. Only wish there were a few more benches to sit on, especially upstairs"
"This was a great place to visit, packed full of vast variety of marine species. Follow the trail slowly and identify the fish and other marine creatures. Very well labelled. Allow a minimum of 2 hours for this fascinating self tour."
Nice place to visit but a little expensive for family’s. Have been to a few aquariums with kids and it is good but can be hard at the moment with the covid situation as there is no social distancing and you feel rushed. With the current COVID situation I believe they try their best to instruct everyone about social distancing but this is it. Other than a couple of announcements on the speakers it’s not really controlled.
We loved our visit to the aquarium in Cairns.  We were amazed at the size and number of sea life on show.  Was a perfect day out on a warm Cairns day and was so peaceful watching the fish.  All the staff we met were very informed and had a lot of passion for their jobs.  Would recommend a visit to the Cairns Aquarium for people of all ages.
Only open 5 hours but SO worth a visit. Staff are well informed and happy to chat about the hundreds of different types of marine life plus the few reptiles. We spend 2 hours and loved every bit of it. Walking through the glass tunnel and watching the sting rays swing over the top was just incredible. If you can go you won't be disappointed.
"This is a beautiful, tranquil aquarium well worth some of your time. It wasn’t too busy like other aquariums which meant it was a relaxing place for a visit. The enclosures appear well-kept, and the animals healthy and seemingly happy. The sea creatures here are the kind you see when visiting FNQ so after a visit to the reef it was nice to identify some of the same creatures at the aquarium and read a bit about them. My young child really enjoyed our visit and liked using the rocky frames around the tanks to get in for a closer look. Friendly service also. Thank you Cairns Aquarium!"
"Had a great morning exploring the Cairns Aquarium, headlined by getting to watch three divers feed the sharks and rays in the large aquarium tank. It’s not the biggest aquariums but one of the best for the range of exhibits and fish life. It was very clean, modern and well kept. We went on a busy morning, with lots of families and a school group, but it never felt too hectic. Would recommend to families and those interested in the underwater world. The photo is just the top of the aquarium’s 10m deep tank!"
"This is a brilliant aquarium! Loved it! The cleanest and best presented wildlife attraction I have been to in Cairns. I would highly recommend anyone to visit, great for all ages."
Needing to fill in time before our flight we ventured into the aquarium. This is a good aquarium and well laid out. I enjoyed it more than my teenagers but even they liked some of the fish on display. Good way to spend a couple of hours and smaller kids will have a blast as will older folk like me who appreciate what's in our oceans.
"during our trip in cairns we visited the aquarium and found it was your typical level aquarium. Had everything you would expect and was large enough. As 2 adults, we spent about 1 hour 15 working our way through, it was very enjoyable!"
"What a fantastic night, worth every cent. When everyone goes home the lights are dimmed and the nocturnal fish and reptiles come to life. We had an enthusiastic guide, who knew every fish, snake, eel ect by name. After going through 4 habitats we sat down to a yummy 5 star 2 course dinner. Loved every minute."
"The new Aquarium is worth a visit for a chance to see The Great Barrier Reef marine life that you may not get a chance to see in the wild. The Aquarium is designed to show you how rain starts its journey from the mountain ranges, joins creeks, streams and flooded billabongs, travels through the Rainforest, past the Mangroves, through the Great Barrier Reef and finally into the Coral Sea. They have scheduled talks and feedings, but get in quick as there is limited seating. The displays are well set up and very colourful. For an extra $20 each adult you can add a back tour to see how Turtles are cared for and rehabilitated then see all the work that goes on behind the scene to keep the Marine World going. Check to see if they have any Turtles being rehabilitated first, not worth doing overwise. You will also see how the Aquarium is growing its own Coral to go into their tanks and hopefully other Aquariums.The Aquarium is a great place to take the kids to get out of the heat. There is food and souvenirs on sale. You can also add a special lunch to your ticket price."
"We spent a most enjoyable visit to this superb Cairns Aquarium which showcases all the teaming colourful and beautiful shore and sea-life in and around Cairns. So much to see and enjoy all superbly explained.. Thank you very much indeed.Pauline Alexander, Violeta and Alan Courtney"
The aquarium is really nicely done and very informative. Had a lovely morning strolling about. Not enough there to last more than 90 mins and 5D experience wasn’t great. Overall worth a visit.
"A fun place to visit. Following the set route (some people through they would do it backwards lol) there are scores of fish in tanks, plus displays with snakes, frogs and even stick insects. We especially liked the various turtles. The crocodiles were very small. We expected larger crocs given that we were in cairns. The final area has a huge wraparound tank with many different types of fish, rays and sharks, very interesting to sit and watch."
"Spent a very enjoyable half day here and and despite it not being school holidays its was very popular with visitors of all ages.The talks presented by the very friendly and professional staff were very informative and well presented- just enough detail and not too long but you need to be there early to have the opportunity to listen to all the talks. The exhibits are excellent and can be easily watched for extended periods of time, especially those in the large tanks. The day I visited they were doing the weekly cleaning of one of the tanks and this was also very interesting - underwater vacuuming.The admission charge may seem a little high but it represents excellent value for  money."
The facility is clean and bright but a bit costly for the number of exhibits. Made it through in about an hour. Did watch a nice presentation on sharks but a very bright gentleman.
