"Had I known it was going to be Spring Break here I wouldn’t have booked coming here at this time. My review is not a fair review because of that. The streets are crowded with teenagers and the ocean front restaurants are overcrowded with teenagers too. There are police and security people everywhere. Having said that, we found a great restaurant called Casablaca which we highly recommend. This restaurant is more popular with non-teenagers and the food and service is wonderful!!!Coconuts Restaurant tonight which was recommended to us. Also our accommodation at the Marriott Park Place is outstanding!"
"As a south Florida native, I’ve been coming here my entire life. It’s a great beach with lots of nightlife, restaurants, shops, water activities, and more. Lifeguards are always staffed, the beach is clean, and the water is nice. Over the last decade we’ve been hit by some serious hurricanes, and sadly, the city has not been restoring the beach to the length it once was, so were rapidly losing sand. This doesn’t stop the fun or the people from coming. Driving down a1a in this area is a must."
"I highly recommend this activity in Fort Lauderdale. The stretch of beach is just out of this world and large enough to accommodate a ton of people without ever feeling crammed or pushed. The beach is very organized with life guards all over the place. Before arriving at the beach, you have the accommodation of public toilets and showers along with restaurants providing great beach food (burgers, hot dogs, refreshments, etc.)The sands are perfect, and the water is wonderful. The place is very accommodating of kids.I highly recommend going there equipped with your own umbrellas, beach chairs and coolers filled with snacks and refreshments. Spend north of two hours and just enjoy it. It is a great experience ***Please like this review if you find it helpful.

"Fort Lauderdale beach nerwwen 17th St and Sunrise is busier, the parking isn't easy, but there is shade, The beach north of Sunrise is easier in all ways, though the meters are watching guard here. too. Bring refreshments because crossing A!A ro get somerging can be a nightmare in each direction.If you are at the beautiful Hugh Taylor Birch park there is an underpass, grossly smelly, to the beach."
It’s always clean!  Not overly crowded !  Just a beautiful beach!  Fort Lauderdale is my favorite place!!  The restaurants are wonderful!  Walk every morning!  Path all along the ocean is my favorites!!
We love our time in Ft Lauderdale. The beach is great - except when it’s spring break!   Beware end of February and Month of March!!!!  Hundreds of drunk/high college students.
"Ft Lauderdale Beach is delightful. It’s October and so fewer people, but what a great place! The boardwalk is simply divine. Walking at night is safe and friendly. One of my favorite places!"
The beach was just dirty. The area itself isn’t well Kept and the beach is most certainly not. Go elsewhere.
"Not much to do. Food establishments are narrow on choice and less than average. The area is worn on many spots and everything needs a coat of paint. Come on, Florida, acquire sone culture. There is nothing of significance to do. I will not be returning to this dull area."
"I love the beach.It was just great. A place that has something for everyone. Swiming, playing in the sand, relaxing and much more."
"The beach was a little difficult to get to from our hotel as all the hotels on the beach did not allow access through their property. Once we got there it was stunning,  white sand that was respectfully clean. Visiting the beach is a must regardless of location."
White powdery sand and warm clear water. Had a great time with my family. Different restaurants in walking distance.
Laying in the sun in October when back home has bear freezing temperatures!  Duh! Who wouldn’t give 5 stars?
I usually have a smoothie for breakfast but I didn't see a smoothie listed on the breakfast menu at the Hilton Fort Lauderdale Beach Resort. I asked Angel if he would prepare one for me and he was happy to accommodate. Angel is friendly and professional and full of great personality. He is always super friendly and made our stay at the hotel that much more enjoyable. Angel is an outstanding employee. Give him a raise!
enjoyed our week stay in Fort Lauderdale ... Visiting the beach was great. Nice and clean and enjoyed our walks.
"I understand that this is a popular beach. But I have to review what I experienced.  We were there on two pretty windy days. The surf was rough and the trash was everywhere.  We saw multiple syringes in the sand. Made for walking around a bit concerning.  The purple flag was out and we found tons of jellyfish beached. I'm sure this is a normally nice beach, but not on the days we were there."
We stayed at the Sonesta right across from the beach..just want to say Rafael and Jaxon were so accommodating and so pleasant. Took care of us every time we came to beach! Made our experience here memorable. Thx guys! Def will back.
Traffic is too close to this beach and the seaweed is out of control. Heaven help us if one of those cargo ships would have an accident on the lineup to docks. Seeing them so close to shore interrupts the view.
The beach was clean and we felt safe.  Spent the day riding waves and soaking up the sun.  Perfect way to end our trip to Ft Lauderdale
Very cool place to hang out. Loved the shopping and food. Cars cruising the strip are neat also. Go for and visit.
"Beach was super clean! Safe distancing was taking place. Note, there are a few homeless people hanging around, but they are few and far between. Nothing like similar beaches in Southern California. I would choose SOFLO over SOCAL for a day at the beach anytime."
Went here to kill an afternoon. The road that runs against the water is a bit busy so if you want something less vehicular go to Hollywood beach. Nice sand and lots of restaurant options
Visited just before Dorian. It was quiet. Very pleasant beach though with good transport links. Limited choice of budget food. Interesting to see the turtle nests marked off.
Showed up early and no one was there. Walked the beach for a while. Took pictures. Basically just hung out.
"What can I say, it's home.  Grew up there and make sure we take all relatives and friend who come to town to visit.  No matter what time of the year."
"Stopped by here for the afternoon. Big, clean beach. Has a lot of restaurants and shops along the strip."
Really nice beach and fun environment that’s not near as crazy as some places (PCB). Nice area with locals who are friendly. Watch for sea turtle beds!
This is a beautiful beach. Relaxing and very calm during the week. Lots of restaurants and entertainment around.
My daughter and I agreed this is now going to an annual visit for us!!! Thank you Fort Lauderdale! So much fun.
"Best service! Had a great time with Claudia as our server!!!! She’s helped us pick the best food, loved it!"
Waves were wonderful in Sept. Beach and traffic was empty in Sept. Plenty of parking and beach space. Loved it.
"Visiting this beach on a Sunday afternoon or evening is not recommended. Monday morning, however, brings an entirely more pleasant experience."
"Ft. Lauderdale beach is a long stretch of beach area with many amenities on it. There's a big parking lot close by, reasonably priced.The beach is not so wide like the South Beach in Miami, which I like and has nice decorated entrances to it. You can find volleyball courts, kids playground, feet washing and restrooms. There are lifeguards stations along the beach. Renting chairs was pricey for a two hours stay so we found some tree shade.Many cafes and restaurants on the promenade."
"Thank goodness our beach is open again!  Have traveled to 45 nations on 5 continents and still find our Fort Lauderdale Beach to be one of the best in the world. If you are visiting and driving, park right along the beach just north of Sunrise Boulevard along A1A. Parking is reasonable, there are showers at every entrance to the beach and 20 lifeguard stations. The beach is clean, the surrounds well maintained, and the locals and tourists are friendly and helpful. Our very own Fort Lauderdale Mounted Police are often seen riding their beautiful horses along the sidewalk, interacting with visitors and locals and ensuring that our beaches are safe and fun. You will find our beach to be family friendly and simply beautiful!  Come join us and bring your snorkeling and diving gear, or rent from one of the many shops in the vicinity. Parasailing and jet skiing opportunities are available, reasonable and great fun!"
"Just a few blocks north of Las Olas Blvd., you’ll have plenty of social distanced beach and ocean fun. The weekend was bit more crowded, but still lots of space on the beach to stay away from other beach goers. Enjoy."
