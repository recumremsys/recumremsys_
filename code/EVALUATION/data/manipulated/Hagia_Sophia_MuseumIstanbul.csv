"Beautiful mosque (converted from museum). Very busy and full of tourists. Organised when clearing visitors out prior to prayer times so people can worship. There are social distancing measures during prayers, police also guarding outside and letting people in batches.We attended here a few time’s and actually in the middle of the night it is near empty and best time to take in the beautiful interior and enjoy time there. Jummah prayer is very busy here. We arrived over 1 hour before prayer time and still only managed to get a praying space outdoors in Sultanhamet park."
"Felt so peaceful when you enter. Architecture is stunning. Stayed during afternoon prayers which gave me goosebumps, wonderfully serene atmosphere. Be warned though there is restoration work so parts are closed off."
Beautiful stunning peaceful. Spiritual. Filled with character. Huge building  can spend hours hereOpen 24 hours
"Historical place and located just next to Blue Mosque in Sultanahmet area. I paid around 100 Lira for the entrance fee, but this Hagia Sophia is worth to visit. You will know the story of its existence. It was a church turned to a mosque. Come and experience the paintings and the story behind it."
"really enjoyed this, found it more interesting than the blue mosque. Fastinating history and beautiful mosaics."
"Do not miss Hagia Sophia. Cathedral, then Mosque, now museum, the building has seen centuries of struggles, religion shifts, and invasions.  Do not forget visiting 2nd floor."
"This stunning, originally Christian Church, then Islamic Mosque and now Museum is an architectural wonder that gets far less notoriety than it deserves. Starting life as the Capital of the Roman Empire in 330 AD this magnificent building has interesting stories to tell from the ancient world to the current day.This is the very spot the Roman Empire ended and Istanbul was born and the Ottoman Empire fornd immortality. The battle of the Sultan to finally take what was then called Constantinople is well worth researching before you visit to help appreciate the enormity of the building and city in the ancient and modern world.The battle and subsequent victory of the Sultan changed history as we know it and was also the first time WMD was used in warfare. The tactical game of war chess that unfolded here is testimony to the young Sultans tactical genius and was a huge loss to Rome who took far too long to come to Constantinople's aid and lost this part of the world forever to the Turks.You can simply wander around and enjoy the space and the wonderful mix of Christian and Islamic artwork or you can deep dive into learning about it's origins and how the Sultan removed all Christian artifacts and plastered over all Christian artworks to replace them is Islamic art and symbols. The plaster has been painstaking removed but this is why you can still see traces of it today.Don't miss the walkway up to the upper level on your immediate left as you enter as the upper level has stunning views and yet more secrets to reveal.Keep an eye out for the Viking graffiti and slow yourself pause for thought as you walk past the doors to heaven and hell. If you prefer not to research before hand It's well worth considering hiring a guide on the day to talk you through this magnificent monument."
"The Hague Sophia is an amazing building. We visited in February which is low season. Arrived for 9 am opening and quickly entered. Even in low season it does get busy so recommend going early. Plus leß crowded inside and beats the large coach tour groups that were soon filling the place.  Make the effort to take the route up to the upper gallery's. Not easy to find but it is the corner of the building nearing the weeping column.  Within easy walking distance is the cistern, blue mosque and hippodrome where museum of Turkish and Islamic arts are which are all worth seeing. So a full day in a small area."
The mosque is obv. free of charge where you can make your prayers and experience the history behind it. Recommend everyone who visits Istanbul
"It was an amazing experience. We went in the evening as it can get crowded or closed after prayers for cleaning. It is so grad and very special. Now that it’s back to being a mosque it is an experience not to be missed. Full of history, from the 6th Century, I wanted to check every space, nook and cranny, but again as some refurbishing work is taking place you only see the main area. Women have their own prayer section which overlooks the men’s section. In the evening and certain times in the day, you’re free to visit both. They sometimes offer women blue scarves to cover modestly, otherwise do bring your own. I visited it several times and couldn’t get enough. A must see. Have to keep mask on at all times and take shoes off at entrance."
As Hagia Sophia is not a museum anymore and it’s a mosque now. The experience was quite good and amazing as the history surrounds all around you. Wearing a mask is a must for everyone entering the premises and security measures were quite good.
Read our first prayers here after arriving in Istanbul. What an amazing place and great energy. At the moment still a museum.
"Beautiful monuments on the skyline. Close up they need some love. Our guide told us that the scaffolding in the Hagia had been there for thirty years. All the entrance money is being used for Turkeys war effort. Built almost 1500 years ago this is a beautiful building and the template for many of the cathedrals built subsequently. The mosaics, marvel jars and frescos are exquisite. Please save this wonderful monument?"
"Best shared with someone, brilliant history. Gardens are stunning, architecture mind blowing and People are helpful. Take a tram in and walk the areas."
"Mrs and I visited this mosque on a Sunday around 3pm, it was fairly busy but the inside was absolutely stunning.Overall this was my favourite mosque out of the 6/7 mosques I visited during my stay in Istanbul. Make sure not to go during prayer times as the mosque will remain shut to tourists during those times of the day."
This is a seriously impressive mosque. Photographers delight. Don't miss the two massive jars at the back and take in the size of the doors!
Amazing place... I love Istanbul... I will come again with my family. Cause ı wanna show them too this beautiful city
"One of the most iconic buildings in Istanbul. Was initially a church built around 500 years after Jesus's crucifixion, so there is a lot of biblical references. Many modifications to the structure due to natural disasters and fire. Later converted to a mosque with four large oval wooden boards holsted high in the massive dome, inscribed with Arabic verses from the Quoran. I think this spoilt the whole architecture and aesthetic of the dome, but it's good to have both religions represented in the same building. It is now a museum.One of the internal pillars is currently covered up and under restoration.When you get up to the upper gallery, you can see more restoration and the back of the four oval wooden boards and you will agree with me that it looks awful.Cost is 72 lira for entrance to all areas. First go and watch a 30 minute video of the museum. It is located on the left immediately on entering the entrance. Don't waste your money paying extra for the many guides available to show you round."
"Loved it, visited at midnight was one of the only people in the place. No fee to enter now as it is now a mosque."
"This whole area is loaded with things you must do on a visit to Istanbul. The site is  inscribed on Unesco’s World Heritage list, which recognises the “architectural masterpieces” of Istanbul.Be aware that it needs to be seen NOW as it is in the middle of a controversy. Islamists have long prayed for the Hagia Sophia to reopen as a mosque, arguing that its neutral status is an affront to the Ottoman caliph’s decrees forbidding other uses. The Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan has pledged to revert the 6th century Hagia Sophia, once an important Greek Orthodox Christian cathedral, into a mosque from its current status as a museum. It has been a museum for almost 85 years, which is widely regarded as a compromise between Christians and Muslims who both claim the space as hallowed ground.A Christian group is arguing for a return to it being a  Greek Orthodox Christian cathedral.Either way, see it now and be amazed at the elements of both religions on view. PS: It cost $15 to get in. There can be long lines. I am disabled and I went to the front of the line and showed my Social Security card. They waved me in for no cost. Be aware,there is almost no place to sit and there are some steps - some too high for me. There also is an upstairs that I was unable to get to. There is a movie to see that explains a lot. There are some sets there."
"Incredible, truly impressive! This mosque is famous for its massive dome and the world’s largest building of its kind during its time. Built around 360 and know it took over 200 years to build, Sophia, aka Sofya was the first imperial mosque of Istanbul. The building served different purpose as originally it served as an Orthodox Cathedral, then a Roman Catholic cathedral under the Latin Empire and then a mosque and now to be a museum. I have seen structures like this in Delhi, the Qutub Minar where it was a Hindu structure, then due to power grabbing, became a mosque. You can tell the difference because a mosque cannot have any images like flowers, people or statues, only calligraphy. At QM, you can see some of the structures were still left with the Hindu remnants. In this place, the guide was narrating the story and I noticed the same where images of the Virgin Mary, the cross and Jesus were still visible on the dome. I mentioned to the guide and asked why it was not covered by the Muslims. He said it was actually covered (not destroyed) and now it is revealed again. So if you look on the dome, there are images of the Virgin Mary All etched in gold. Ahhh history."
"The Hagia Sofia is always awe-inspiring. Be sure to sit and watch the brief film, for lots of great information about this historic location. Take the stairs up to the gallery, and try to find the angels in the eaves. Take photos that will never do that place justice. But don't try to sing in there... lol"
"Unfortunately the Muslims vandalized the church so do not get your hopes up as so many people have hyped this building.  In my opinion the Ottoman architecture simply dwarfs this basilica and inside nothing remains except two images of Jesus one mosaic in which he is making a Buddhist mudra sign with his hand and another but both of them only partially remain as the conqueres literally tore the images off the walls and graffitied the entire ceiling in Arabic.  It is quite depressing.  However the Blue Mosque is absolutely gorgeous and is right next door.  There were some interesting elements including tombs outside the church and the ancient walkways leading to the second level of the church with the lovely partial mosaic mentioned upstairs but the church is a trashed relic and not the incredible splendor that so many make it out ot be.,  It was probably gorgeous in 400 AD however it has been completely trashed and little remains I was extremely dissapointed in it as I am from a Christian Background.  At the same time I appreciate fine architecture and realize that the Hagia Sophia cannot compete with the aesthetic of the Ottoman.  Ottoman architecture is astounding and much more impressive than any other architecture in Europe(Istanbul is Europe). Be warned if you are expecting to see a beautiful in tact church.  This should be labeled a ruin as that is what it is.  From the outside it is impressive but it is an eyesore inside for aesthetes.  If you are an historian or a very religious Christian without a great aesthetic perhaps you'll like it. I took many more photos of The Blue Mosque.  I found this place depressing but I guess Erdogan's regime is not going to put money into restoring a Christian monument-Obviously not."
"This monument is an architectural site not to miss. It is now a national site, and not a religious site any more.  Unfortunately when we were there (some of the areas were shrouded by drapery and scaffolding b/c the art work (frescoes?) were being restored). Check with your travel agent to learn if this is still the case.  Ditto for the Blue Mosque."
"wonderful time in Turkey, a definite must while in Istanbul. Wear comfortable shoes, and bring a good camera."
"very impressive even though there's still ongoing renovation works. was planning to visit it around noon, reached to see snaking queues all the way outside. a local told me the crowd thins out at 3pm. the queue was definitely shorter. a must visit!"
Highly recommend a visit. Early morning before larger tour groups is recommended. Suggest a private guide to explain all the beauty of the site and the important history that is part of the Hagia Sophia Museum
Much better than Blue Mosgue. More character. While there were some renovations to one wall the rest is beautiful. Take binoculars to see the Virgin Mary in her detail.
"The Hagia Sophia Museum is a mesmerizing piece of historical architecture with an enchanting mix of Christian and Muslim religious symbols, relics and art. Being a history student, I would place this monument high up there. Amazing rich history - Built in the 6th century (by the Byzantine emperor Justinina I) to be a Greek Orthodox Christian patriarchal cathedral and functioned that way for 900+ years. Later, in 15th century,  under the Ottoman empire, transitioned into an imperial mosque and functioned that way for c. 400+ yrs. And now a museum. Amazing ! How historical can a monument be !! When walking inside this monument, one can't help wishing for a time machine, that can take you back in the times when this monument was under construction, used for religious events, etc.  On a trip to Istanbul, this is a highly recommended monument to visit."
See title! This is a really beautiful building and well worth spending time in. Even the ramps to the higher levels are interesting
"Touring the Hagia Sophia is an amazing experience.  It is hard to think that the building is over 1,500 years old and was the first place visited by Mehmet II when he captured Constantinople in 1453.  The architecture is amazing and the images dating back over 500 years are very impressive.  Since it is a museum and is no long a Mosque you do not have to remove your shoes.  I would consider a visit to this site a must for anyone visiting Istanbul."
"Stunning.  The architecture, history and detail is just out of this world.  Dress modestly and make sure your head is covered.  Go early to avoid the crowds and appreciate the beauty.  Suggest taking a guide.  This was my fourth visit but my first time with a guide and I learnt so much."
"Once you walk in, you feel like you have gone back in time. The architecture and the Islamic arts around the whole place is amazing. Makes you wonder how on earth did they build this place. Hagia Sophia is the 10th Wonder of the World for a reason! and must be visited if your in Turkey."
Turn it back into a museum. Changed back again into a mosque. History being rewritten in stone. Scraped off Byzantine Icons.
What a beautiful monument this is! Don’t even think about going to Istanbul without visiting this incredible building.
