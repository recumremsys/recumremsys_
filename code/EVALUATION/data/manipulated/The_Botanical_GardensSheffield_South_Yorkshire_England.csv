We visited here at the end of September.  Wow the gardenersdo an excellent job here.  So many flowers and plants and so much colour.  Took a photo of the map at the entrance to find our way around.  Considering this garden  is free to visit I would recommend anyone coming to Sheffield to pay a visit.  It is as good as Kew Gardens just smaller
The garden is simply awesome. Some lovely hardwotking staff have maintained it pretty well. Was able to see some plants and trees from around the world under one roof which was spectacular. Especially my 6 year old enjoyed being there.Highly recommend for families to visit with their kids. Thank you
"We were looking forward to our first visit but were sorely disappointed.  The plants in the pretty glass pavilions are uncared for and looking very sad.  One of the large beds in the garden is infested with Equisetum and a gardener was just chopping it off on the surface which is a completely ineffectual remedy.  Weeds abound.  Four men were casually working on one small bed putting in bedding plants when two would have been sufficient.  This place needs a proper professional head gardener.  Award winning gardens like Renishaw can deliver perfection with just four gardeners.  Come on Sheffield, get your act together!"
Hadn‚Äôt visited for years. The gardens are just so lovely. Plenty of quiet places to sit. Had a scone and cup of tea at the cafe which was very pleasant and the scone was delicious üòã would highly recommend a visit.
We brought a dog here and had a nice walk through lovely gardens. Parked at bottom of hill (Tesco parking lot). We came to the gates at the top of the park next to the tea shop and some other store. Tea shop was dog friendly but the store owner is not. I would not give her any business.
I remember when the place had an Avery and tropical fish ‚Äò I remember the parrots outside. The place is ok but not the same. Less is not the best. Bring back the best
"Took a walk round here after dropping off our son at university. Very beautiful, nicely laid out, great variety of plants and trees. Didn‚Äôt use the cafe so no idea about that. Will definitely go again when we visit him. I think dogs are allowed but on leads."
"Have visited the gardens on numerous occasions and always admire the high level of maintenance and care for them. Even in the winter there‚Äôs always birds, squirrels and a few plants to see. It is so relaxing to walk around the gardens, head to the cafe for a hot drink and some lovely pastries. Well worth a visit. Highly recommended"
"Loved this place. Recommended to us by my daughter. Great service, great food, reasonable prices. Lovely clean restaurant. It has a garden/fairy lights theme which makes a lovely setting. Cocktails available. Children allowed."
"Went to visit the Botanical Gardens and was bowled over by the size. There are acres of it. Ple ry of disabled parking and everywhere we went my mobility scooter could travel easily even in the Tropical Pavilion that held plants from all over the world. There was a lovely little gift shop and a wonderful cafe which catered for everyone. It is well worth a look, don't forget your walking shoes."
"Stunning gardens, and so peaceful.  Don't miss the 'greenhouse' with it's exotic collection of plants.  Also there''s a great 'treasure hunt' using clues to take you around all the most interesting parts. Lovely cafe there. Often have music on in the summer months too. One of Sheffield's little treasures."
Loved it here. Came on a sunny day and it was quite busy. Parking was a bit of a struggle but we found a space on a side road not too far.Lovely areas to sit in the sun.
"Enjoyed every visit, very calm and you just have to love the trees, flowers and their designs :) feeling quite relaxed when I‚Äôm walking around there. Take your young kids to learn about the nature and spend quality time with them!"
Visited on a gloomy wet October day but we were blown away by these beautiful gardens. We would have happily paid to walk round. The people of Sheffield are so lucky to have this amazing place. We will definitely be back hopefully on a sunny day.
"Had a lovely walk around the gardens whilst my daughter went for uni interview. Lovely place, tranquil and worth a visit"
"Loved exploring this botanical garden during a hot day. When I arrived at around lunch time most facilities were unfortunately closed, we thought the only cafe on site would serve food but their kitchen was down for maintenance which was quite frustrating because we had to go out of the gardens and go to the KFC across the street then come back.  We went into green house section and that was good but most plants were either dead or so over grown that you had no choice but to stand on them just to get through and see all the planets. However, seeing all the different variations of plants from all around the world was fantastic to see and was highly impressive. There was so much to see during the day, the bear cage was really intriguing and glad it was kind of hidden away and a secret so when I came across it, it was amazing to see.  Highly recommend this place for photographers but definitely recommend you bring your own food if you plan to have lunch here."
"Have a good look round the place & if you can Go to the Art in the Gardens when Artists show off their work. Also, Music in the Gardens, Last year featured The Proclaimers & this year 10cc al in the open air. Cant wait for next year!"
Spontaneous visit since it's not too far from York. Really loved the place on a sunny day at least. Hoping to go back again soon this summer with my picnic gear this time.
Beautiful huge gardens full of colour and amazing landscape. Recommended to everyone for a day of relaxation outdoors
Spent an hour wandering round and enjoying the piece and quiet while admiring the flowering plants. It‚Äôs not Kew but it was relaxing and clean.
"Wonderful park area to walk through.  Water features,  benches, trees and flowers. Sitting there in good weather any time of year is sheer tranquillity.  Any gardener will be sent into ecstasy with all the wonderful flowers and shrubs."
This is a great place to spend a little time in a great part of the city.  Combine the gardens with a meal in one of the excellent restaurants at Hunters bar.
Actually had after wedding photos taken in and around gardens. Had never been before. Taking kids there soon.
"Went on a sunny winter's day. Nice gardens and nice hothouse.Quite small, but worth a visit if you have some time to spare in Sheffield."
Had the pleasure of attending my nieces wedding in July. The wedding ceremony took place in the actual greenhouse and the guests all watched from outside. The atmosphere was brilliant and I would recommend this great venue all day long if you were considering it for a wedding. The wedding breakfast was served in the greenhouses and although not much space worked really well. We were allowed to bring our own alcohol to drink after the service and eating and drinking in the fantastic surrounding of the botanical gardens made for a fantastic and thoroughly enjoyable wedding.
"Great day out, but get there early. Not only does it get busy getting in, the place is huge. Lots to look at and some quirky works of art too. Recommend for adults and children alike."
"No matter what time of year you go this place is always stunning. Been a biology student in the city for just over two years now and have spent days in the Botanical Gardens.I'm currently carrying out a level 3 project and the Garden's staff are being very very helpful and supportive in this.As a photographer, there are no places inside the city that is rather be! And the very very inquisitive squirrels (stand still for a while and one'll jump on your leg! Overall a fantastic place for a day out as friends, family, or even alone for some peace. In summer, the Gardens are unmissable!"
"Took our own picnic and found a lovely quiet spot for our lunch, then further explorations. Spent most of the day here."
Being local to town and Brocco bank but just as local to the Botanical gardens i am very lucky to enjoy a walk in the surrounding area particularly the wonderful Botanical gardens which is always full of people just having fun and enjoying their well kept naturalistic surroundings.why not walk from one end of the gardens to the other?or just pop inside and sit on a bench admiring the view and simply getting close to nature in all it's beauty and splendour!!if you feel like a stroll for some cleaner air amidst the  trees and plants and foliage come on along and enjoy your visit?!I'm sure you'll be back again before you know itüòâüåªüíê‚öò
"Had a lovely coffee at the tea rooms, followed by a walk around the botanical gardens - beautiful large park with a glass house for more tropical plants and trees. Perfect time to visit as all the begonias were still in bloom and the park looked lovely. There was on street parking nearby, some of it with pay meters"
Garden ok. Hot house bit dissappointing - maybe time of year but lot of plants looked less than prime.Made mistake of ordering food. Food ok but under-staffed so took 30 mins for a small coffee and tea and another 20 for food to arrive. Not sure why we waited - used half our ¬£1:40 on road parking fee waiting. Guess we kept thinking it can't possibly be much longer - it was.
"Visited with husband and daughter (7). Pleasurable afternoon, had a nice walk, enjoy the flowers and wildlife, daughter had lots of fun exploring. Overall a very nice afternoon."
"Tucked away between the hospital and the shopping square . This green oasis of conservation offers a lovely place to have a picnic and a leg stretch. It's a little hilly, so be prepared to work for your tea and üç∞. Squirrels jump from tree to tree. Plants are marked for the botanically minded. Paths are tarmacked for easy travel, but have an uphill theme.Great piece of greenery and glasshouses for education and peace. Lovely place to eat your sandwiches on a bench and watch the world and nature pass you by. The toilets aren't brilliant, but , importantly ...they are there ! Worth a visit. Not posh like London or Glasgow but nice and relaxing."
"On a sunny day you will not find a better place. Chilled out, relaxed, visually pleasing. Fantastic plant life. A must visit for those fond of a walk. Cool vibes."
Having been less than impressed with Sheffield last autumn it was refreshing to explore the local parks and gardens this weekend and find a free green and tranquil side to the City. We really enjoyed wandering around the roses and sunken garden and discovering hidden places like the bear pit. The hot house could have been much better looked after and sadly there were some dead and diseased plants which spoit the overall experience. The surrounding roads were tranquil and leafy and I hope the chain saws stay well away!
