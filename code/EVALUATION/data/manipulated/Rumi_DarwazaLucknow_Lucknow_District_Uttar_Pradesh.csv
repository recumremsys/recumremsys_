"A symbol of Lucknow! A gateway made in a beautiful Awadhi style is a must visit place when you are in Lucknow. Situated in between Bada Imambara and Chhota Imambara, it takes you to 19 th century charm. If you have affinity for old culture you will live this place."
Ancient place of historic importance. Architecture is good and it’s part of heritage of the city of Lucknow. Take a few snaps there and move on. Nothing much special for common people but for history lovers it’s important place.
"Fumigate or Rumidarwaja known as the entrance gate of old Lucknow city. Built with magnificent design is must watch for city tourists. It,s a landmark piece of architecture providing entrance to famous Bhul bhulaiya (Labyrinth) of Lucknow"
Rumi darwaza us near imambada. Its design is suite unique. A symbol of lucknow. Give time to appreciate the intricate architecture.
The Rumi Darwaza is the gateway to Old Lucknow. Mostly ill maintained and one may just miss it in the firt glance. Need to rely on  local guide
A beautiful gateway. On the road. Could be better preserved like most sites in lucknow. Walking distance from most major attractions.
Signature place of Lucknow. Must see the gargantuan towers and huge pillars as viaducts of traffic. Symbolising great architectural mastery of old rulers.
Very impressive example of Awadh architecture. Built by Nawab Asaf ud Doula in 1784.The height of the gate is about 60 feet and designed beautifully. Thousands of people pass through this gate daily.
a 4 view Gate to see ....very elegant design must visit place. create the feel of lucknow....Rumi Darwaza
Built about 250 years ago this was the gate to the old Lucknow city.... Located near the Bara Imambara.... The roads are laid with cobblestones.... This huge gate is beautiful in design and architecture
"Visited the Rumi Darwaza with my family, it's a beautiful place and a must visit whenever someone coming to Lucknow. Although it's good looking during the day but it looks marvellous at night. Lovely gate made by nawab of Awadh."
"Located near Imambada and bhulbhulaiya, it symbolizes old Lucknow and entry point to chowk for the people coming from Sitapur and other districts. it has a grand architecture and vehicles pass through it . made if red stone and having traditional nawabi style."
built in memory of spiritual person/poet. Excellent architecture. good view. recommended to visit this place
Built by asfa ud daula tp generate employment in the famine .. this monument was built.. it is known as turkey gate as its design is like the gate in turkey.. very good place to visit ... Enjoyed a lot..
Situated near the imam-bara. Must spend some time to see this. Had seen many gates in various cities but architecture of this is very different.
"Visited the Rumi Darwaza during my trip to Lucknow, It is so beautiful, that I was truly amazed by it, from backside it looks as if 2- 3 floors, & from front it is 1 whole structure,It is near to many attractions too Bara Imambara, chota imambara, clocktower all are nearby from here, so if you want to visit all of them together you can come here, generally the auto people here take some 40 rs. to show you some 4-5 sculptures here also they will take you to the textile & shop of lucknowi embroidery clothes.One can plan for all the attractions here in one day, if you start in morning & come here.Coming Back Rumi Darwaza is one architectural marvel."
"Standing gracefully near the Bara Imambara, the Rumi darwaza, has a unique architecture. Give some time to appreciate its beauty!"
"Constructed by the nawab to give labour to his people during a famine. Both it's facades are different. On one side are 3 orifices while on the other is the famous single door.Made with lentil as one of the ingredients, it also has clove replicas all over the structure."
"Rumi Darwaza (Next to Bada Imambara  10-20meters you can easily visit & can't miss)   is well designed and constructed.  Beautiful Structure and maintained.  In the evening you will see lights  it look's awesome.   Need 15-20min to see both sides of the door. Tip : You will find some asking you for Horse ride,  Please decide they might charge you unreasonable.  Actually not needed."
"See the art and architecture of the building, mehrabs, stone used to built the gate.  It has three gates with such heights through which trucks could drive easily."
"Considering its age i.e. built in early eighteenth century, this sixty feet tall Gate is a marvelous piece of architecture. Its quite likely that this was probably one of the main entrance of the Old City when Nawabs were ruling this place. Architecture is a mix of Awadhi and Moghul style and it looks magnificent. If you are visiting Bada Imambaada, you will not miss it and you will go under this to reach Chhota Imambaada."
"Located between the Clock Tower and the Bara Imambara, it is architecturally beautiful.You can get a good view while walking or driving past from the Clock Tower to the Bara Imambara or vice versa.Do stop and have a good look to appreciate the architecture. It is a 2 minute attraction, and is also visible from the Clock Tower and from the Bara Imambara.The traffic is very chaotic and heavy in the evenings from 5 pm, and finding a parking spot is difficult."
"Located near immambara lost in the hustle and bustle of Lucknow city. Just have a glance by passing through it, nothing interesting"
Made to mark respect for famous persian poet Rumi. This is a faboulous structure with differen designs on both sides. An iconic structure in lucknow. This is located just next to Bara Imambara.
"Constructed in 1784 by Nawab Asaf ud daula, this landmark gives you goose bumps when you pass beneath it. Situated across Bada Imambaada, its architecture has a Turkish touch"
"very good architecture.  Crossed the Darwaza in a tonga and enjoyed the ride.  Also saw the Clock Tower, which was good too!!"
"Very attractively constructed and maintained. Draws the attention of the traveler from a distance. Located close to Imambara, and easily approachable. Better to see it on the way rather than making it a separate destination."
"Rumi Darwaza,Built by Nawab Asaf us daula in 1784, is a historical monument near Bada ImamBada, Lucknow. Takes you back in time showing the brilliance of awadhi architecture. It has a big lantern on top of it which lights this monument at night. Definitely a place to visit in Lucknow."
"Made on an unexpected road which is 24x7 open for people to use. This is a piece of architecture that revives the poems of Jalaluddin Rumi.If you've ever read and loved his writings this is the place to visit.Doesn't require any special entry fees or anything its just a beauty standing in the bustling roads of Lucknow.Surrounded by many street food stalls, so you can bite on some nice snacks when around.Overall it's a must visit for any tourist/visitors who finds themselves in Lucknow."
The whole area in & around is poorly maintained. Does not give a feeling of splendour it once was. Needs a major overhaul.
we drove past this both during the day and night and it is simply magnificent! loved the detailing and architecture! it has a lovely charm to itself.
Breathtaking beauty but amidst a busy roadside . Have to be careful regarding the traffic especially during rush hours
Situated near Bada imambara. Person going to chota imambara after visiting Bada imambara will pass under this gate.
"Visited this popular site during a business visit recently, as usual got disappointed with the way we treat our heritage and our tourist attractions! Due to which it is just a grand entrance gate; ofcourse it is magnificent and grand and worth seeing and all, but needs upkeep of area and this monument. In few years time it may be gone at this rate of traffic and abuse."
In every city a gateway. And this is a piece of Rome in India . Entering into the land of the nawabs
