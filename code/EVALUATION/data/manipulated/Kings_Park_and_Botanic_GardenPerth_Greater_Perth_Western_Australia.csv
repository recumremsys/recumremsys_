"I try to go each spring to look at the amazing wildflowers. If you don't have time to drive hundreds of km's to find them, just do a day trip to Kings Park! At other times of the year, I love to walk around, ride my bike around and the view never ceases to amaze. Take a picnic, take a book, definitely take your camera!"
"Every time you go to Kings Park, there are always new things to see, as far as new flowers blooming, the view of the City is forever changing, and there are different functions on for every season. Open Air Theatre. The ANZAC Dawn Service is always a very big attraction. Don't forget the Fuction Centre, my son had his wedding reception there, many years ago. I went up there in January just for a bucket of chips and a cup of coffee, a very relaxing place for the whole family, spend as little or as long as you like there?"
"There are lots of walking trails at Kings Park and Botanic Gardens.  As you walk you can learn about the flora and flowers as there are signs.  There is also an off leash area for the dogs.  Within the gardens there are also many other gardens to see.  Such as Water Garden, Roe Garden, and Banksia to name a few.  There is a walkway called the Lotterywest Federation Walkway.  It takes about 20 minutes to walk on the walkway each way.  The walkway is a pathway , elevated walkway and has a veiwing bridge.  Bring a hat and wear good shoes"
Don’t miss out on a chance to visit Kings Park and the Botanical Gardens - gorgeous native flowers and amazing views over Perth.  Such majestic tall trees and a really moving war memorial overlooking Perth.  Such a treat to have had the chance to visit  as the walks are really worth the trip.
"Spent a morning strolling around this beautiful park admiring the Perth skyline. It’s great for taking photos and enjoying the lovely plants, statues and views. The cafe is good for ice creams at the end of it, the salted caramel and macadamia nut Connoisseur choc bars are to die for!"
"Best view in town. Get exercise in the calm of nature. Free walking tours three times a day. Or lay on the lawn and do nothing. Even has had a place for a bit of shopping therapy ,great cafes and restaurants. And its free."
The gardens are beautiful and well worth the long walk around them. You can walk from the city but it can be strenuous. Taking the free bus (route 935) is the less adventurous option
"Had family over from Canada and spent the day walking around Kings park. Lots of fun, yabbies in the ponds, playground for the kids, great views from the whole site."
"Don't forget the excellent Botanical Garden, of the gift shop! You need at least half a day to appreciate this Park."
"Had a half day at the end of a vacation and decided to wander.  This is one of the most amazing city parks I have ever seen.  Even in the summer with over 37 degree temps and bright sun, it is amazing.  The views of Perth and Fremantle are incredible. Plant selection is perfect. There are plenty of water fountains to keep you hydrated in the summer, but wear sunscreen and a hat.Shop and Cafe were great little places.  Staff very helpful,  this is definitely a must do on any visit to Perth,  even if it’s your tenth time traveling here.  You will never tire of the beauty."
"Went for a long afternoon walk in Kings Park. Truly a tranquil experience. The park is beautifully done, with spectacular views of Perth. They truly pay proper homage to the veterans at the war memorial located in the park. In Perth this is a must see."
"Visited Kings Park and was not disappointed. The gardens were beautiful. The gift shop had lots of nice goodies to buy, which we did. Drove all around the entire park. It was on a Sunday and a perfect day had by all."
"Spent the morning looking around the park, unfortunately it to big to see it all in one day. It’s a must for anyone visiting Perth."
Walked a very small portion Kings Park Botanical Gardens. The walk ways are very excess-able for every one no matter your age. The views overlooking Perth's city skyline and beyond are stunning. The Swan river so beautiful.  Free walking tours with guides to explain the different flora. Loved the big Boab tree. Lots of rest areas to sit and relax. There is a walk bridge to see even more stunning views.
Great day on a Sunday in spring. There were lots of families everywhere. We walked around several areas of the park for an hour or two. There are bush trails for cycling and walking and then more curated areas typical of a botanical garden. The glass bridge is great and the ANZAC lawn has panoramic views of Perth and the swan river. A nice day out.We walked back to the mall in the city and it took about 30 mins. We also walked to the park earlier in the day from west Leederville station. Took about 30 mins but saved parking which looked a nightmare while wildflower festival was on.
Loved this park. So many gorgeous gardens and points of interest. Nice cafe. Would recommend for families couples or singles. It has stunning views over the river at several points.
"Whether you're looking to see Perth from a good angle, find a park to have a picnic or kick a ball with a kid, or go for a walk and read all the signs about the fauna and flaura, KP has it all. Enjoy. Free parking too. Also a number of restaurants to get something to eat or drink if necessary. Plenty of restrooms and shade too."
"Great views from Fraser Avenue over the City and Perth Water. Don’t miss it if you are visiting Perth - the locals already know how lovely it is. Walkable from the city ... just go up the hill westward on St George’s Terrace and turn left at the roundabout at the top. There are buses as well, of course, if the hill is too steep."
"It was great to walk through Kings park, kids running around all over the playground, birds flying around, overall was so amazing. Loved the restaurants and I thought everything was great. Definitly recommend for everyone to come down to this amazing enviroment."
"We came here in 2010 and I really loved the bush lands around and all the lovely local flowers which were so different from the term flowers is usually associated with. This time it was no different. Very well kept, very interesting place especially in the cool weather we had. Do take a walk around and spend time to view the many plants and flowers!"
"Walking in the shaded areas on a hot day , Fantastic. The views are spectacular , the grounds are clean, my kid of place."
Caught the free bus (excellent) to the park then spent several hours walking around this marvellous park and gardens. Great views out across Perth & river too. A brilliant introduction to the plants & birds of Western Australia.
A wonderful public space check out the amazing views and the amazing Botanical Gardens. Challenging but enjoyable climb up Jacobs Ladder.
"Have been to Kings Park numerous times, every time the Gardens are impeccable. The restaurant located at Kings Park is also a feature, over looking the gardens. But overall nice peaceful place to relax."
"What a great park. You have the plants, the views, the walkways, the visitors centre. So much to do. Well thought out and well maintained. Loved it. Make sure you get a map and work out where you want to explore, take your time."
"Visited on Sunday 17th November. We always enjoy visiting Kings Park, there is so much to see and do and the views of Perth CBD are great."
"I went to Kings Park to enjoy the view on Perth CBD but the park offers so much more than the view. It's an oasis in the city where people come to relax, have a picknick or a drink. The atmosphere is really relaxed.Next to King's Park, which also harbours an impressive war memorial, cafe and the visitor information, you'll find the Botanical Gardens. Yes, they are not as spectacular as other botanical gardens, but they're still worth seeing. Do not miss the Federation Walkway (open until 5 pm, free entrance).I would definitely recommend the park to everyone visiting Perth, as it's a place to relax and calm down."
Strolled here from our hotel and despite the overcast day the city views were great. Spent time looking at the various war memorials covering several conflicts which was moving. Had a fabulous lunch in the Botanical Cafe in the park. Well worth a visit and would be a lovely place for a picnic and chilling when the sun is out!
"Beautiful gardens but visited on a very very hot day.  Lovely views of the Swan River.Beautiful tourist shop with upmarket goods like glassware, plates etc.  Loved browsing all their stuff.Had to buy a bottle of ice cold water which was very expensive that the lady selling had to warn us of the price to ensure we really wanted it.Spent a couple of hours there and found it well worth it."
Took our pup to Kings Park on the lead and had a gr8 time exploring the grounds and seeing all the different flora and bird life. Nice cafe to stop and have refreshments and a light lunch..Great that you can take your dog on the lead
Walking take a picnic lunch and enjoy! So much to see and if you like walking you will enjoy. If you like to just sit and look at the. It’s you will enjoy!
"Indeed one of the most beautiful gardens in the world. The species, grass and plants are well taken care of. Thank you for remembering the soldiers that fought in the war. Indeed a touching moment! Peace and Tranquility is ever present."
"Perfect for families, couples, individuals and groups. Catch the sunset, go for a walk, take a picnic... perfect for most outdoor activities."
"Probably one of the top ten, if not top five, parks I have ever visited. The walkways, ponds, architectural features, and  grassy open spaces speckled with trees are beautifully paired with the bay view.  I wish I had known.  I would have planned a couple hours to bring a blanket, picnic, and frisbee.  Do try to carve some time out for you and nature at this park.  You will be well rewarded!"
Had a lovely walk around the park today.  Well worth a visit.  Lots to see.  Can spend an hour or a day.
