Enjoy beautiful place & its worth watching backwaters. I was amazed by its cleanliness. Golden coloured sand
"an Estuary where Arabian Sea, lake and river meets. Visited in evening and excellent location. The sea is very rough and not advisable to go near or swim at all."
"This is a beautiful place. Tranquil backwaters, mangrove forests, a clean river entering the sea on a wonderful beach.But you see all of it only a tiring and annoying negotiation with boat operators who quote you double or triple the actual price. Of course, all reviews here warn you about that and even advise you to negotiate - but it just leaves bad taste in your mouth and unable to appreciate the beauty around you.This was the only negative experience I had in Kerala. Try as I might, I just couldn't enjoy the backwaters with a surly boatman and after knowing that I had been duped. Enjoy the place, if you can."
"This is very beautiful and scenic place. Boat riding here is better then Alleppey (personal opinion). They claim that small part of movie Anaconda was shot here, without commenting on authenticity of the claim the place was awesome. on the way to beach (while in boat) there are couple of resorts from where boatman on special request gets a chilled beer ÔÅä. Floating restaurant serves decent food as well. The beach here is literally a virgin beach. Very clean and beautiful."
This place was amazing. Very calm and scenic. Beautiful place. Visited with my daughter for my bday and it was a perfect setting. Although kids are not allowed in the floating cottages but the land cottages are good enough. The property is lovely. Access is only through a boat. The ride on the back waters is great and Serene. We went on a back water cruise through the Mangrove Forests and backwaters. It was good. Also went to the beautiful kovalam beach which is just about 17kms from the resort. The food was good. I suggest you go in for the alacarte instead of the buffet. Buffet could be improved. The chef cooked some amazing butter garlic prawns.... Yummmmmm. Thank you chef! But quite dint like the buffet. Also the cocktails need to improve.The staff at the resort are very polite and helpful. Forever smiling üòä Special mention of Akash at the chayakadaüòä and Preetha from house keeping. Visit poovar island resort for a calm peaceful stay and a different experience. Please be warned of the floating restaurants outside the resort. They cheat you. We visited the Sea food floating restaurant outside.... They show you one fish and charge very exorbitant but when they come and get it is some other fish which is just not worth the money. I recommend you eat inside the resort. The chef will be glad to cook up to your taste üòä or visit the shacks on kovalam beach... They have some amazing food.
"Unique experience. The Floating Cottages gives and experience of sitting by the river side, view of the Golden Beach and the Arabian Sea at a distance and watch the world going by. Watching the sunset, sipping coffee and the cool river breeze feels like heaven. The property is huge with lot of greenery and birds. Can spend time with nature and quite walks. Yoga, Activity centre, Ayurvedic Spa and  evening entertainment are available. The boat ride on the backwaters is exciting with the birds and natural passages. The Floating Cottage room is compact with all modern facilities; the food is good and room service is available. The staff is very kind, helpful and service prompt. The Security and Boatmen at the jetty are welcoming. The Buggy drivers are very helpful. Dinesh from and Arun are very helpful. If you want to experience a calm and peaceful holiday with an unique experience then this is the place to visit.  Will definitely go back again!!!"
Can see the union of sea and backwaters across the beach. Amazing views. Located at junction of kerala and tamil nadu. Houseboats are available at poovar beach. 
"Great Place in the admist of Nature.Awesome Beauty in between Backwards!

"This island is very good and kid love this place. Lay over after a ride through mangrove forest, watching the migrating birds."
One of the great nature experiences we had in kerala visit. Boating through the backwaters till the gold sand beach was unforgettable experience. Would recommend everyone to pay a visit here if planning a trip to kerala.
I visited last week in Poovar. Boating is amazing. I never seen in India this type cleen beach. Boating charge is 4500 for two hours. Kumar  was our boat pilot. He is very fredly and good photographer.
Poovar is known for back waters and golden sand beach. Back waters are a different kind but not better than Allepey.. there are steamers those take you to beach and show mangrooves . Be careful while booking streamers . They are greedy people. Backwaters in Alleppey are much‚Ä¶
This is new attraction in Kerala. Backwaters are competing the Alleppey. Added advantage is the beach. The confluence of river with he sea is worth visiting. The boat ride though is very expensive.
"Poovar, a natural wonder in Kerala, is a small island with a gorgeous beach, lush exotic greenery, coconut groves, banana plantations and emerald backwaters. Have to stay there for a couple of days to experience its amazing backwater and beaches. Also a land of amazing resorts to stay in"
"It hardly takes an hour to reach Poovar. It's wonderful beach, backwaters, Poovar River boat cruise and the sea! A church is its landmark.Fun is to be on the beach sandwiched between Poovar river on one side and Indian Ocean on the other. Isn't it enchanting?"
"Has visited with family.. Fantastic experience staying there. From pick up to drop by poovar island resort representative was complementary. Family loves this place, children likes swimming in pool.. Fantastic ambience of rooms and island resort. Morning walk different experience. Resort has children play area and other exercise tool / area. Recommend to visit with family."
"First and fresh experience is reaching in this Island resort by boat. Boat cruises through Nayar river for twenty minutes providing you view of scenic mangroves and  back waters.We checked in the floating cottages just standing on the confluence of RIver, Lake ,Land,  Back water and beach. You are just out of this world view from floating cottages is awe aspiring. Greenish and huge resort on the back of floating hotel adds to the beauty of this place.  I would say one would like to see it before one dies.  My words can be judged by visiting that awesome and scenic island. Resort has all sorts of rooms, grand swimming pool,  restaurant with great ambiance, Gym, Massage center , place for DJ night. It offers many a thing to do and unwind. Just relax and immerse your self in the luxury of Island. Go for one hour boat ride of mangroves.     Mighty Arabian sea  hankering to kiss you. Beach is neat and clean as very few people visit there. Staff is courteous and  attentive ready to help you out. Food being served is extensive and wide spread, lot of choices to  make from.Yummy and delicious food make you night out a memorable life time experience."
Beautiful greenery throughout the journey in the boat. Disappointed that not much else to see. The golden beach is littered with plastics and broken sandals shoes etcand many vendors just trying to sell you something. Not value for money at ruppees 3500
I am a fan of beaches and greenery. Kerala can boast a lot about this. Poovar island was exceptional place for relaxation and food. Recommend them immensely.
A must visit place in trivandrum. Boating through the lake is awesome. A nature's gift. Stay in the resorts nearby is ali worth for money.  Aazhi mala temple  near poovar is also awesome. I strongly recommend this place
This place is beautiful. Amazing floating cottages. Services are too good. Food was amazing. They helped us in sightseeing and many other things in resort. They organise different activities daily.  Loved the stay. Thank you Poovar Island Resort for treating us so well‚ù§Ô∏è
"This is one of the most beautiful places in Trivandrum. There is Mangrove forest and this beach and can see river(lake) meeting sea. Sunset time will be best if you are staying there. Beware of the localites as they tried to loot me. Need to bargain as much as possible. Before you order food in any of the restaurants please check prices, also for the boating bargain as much as possible."
Poovar is 30km from Trivandrum and is known for its beach and backwaters. We stayed at the Club Mahindra resort in Poovar - it was lovely. The boating tour takes 1.5 hours and costs Rs.2000. It is something to be not missed as the views were excellent. Be sure to get on the boat‚Ä¶
"Poovar Island is in the southern tip of Kerala. We enjoyed the boating ride, you could see many birds, forest trees such as mango and pineapples. trip covers dense mangrove areas. Poovar Golden Beach, Elephant rock, Pieta Sculpture, Floating restaurant etc will be covered on your journey.We started our journey at 7:30 am and we were the first to take the journey, so the waters covered with withered flowers and fragrance were simply superb.We stayed in Kayaloram Resort and they them self offered boat rides at nominal price.Still I feel boat rides in Poovar area is much higher. The person was friendly and let us play in golden beach for 15-20 minutes. Would recommend Kayaloram boat club for others too.The only reason for reducing 1 start is the local people following you in bike to get people for boating. Its irritating to answer them. We were stopped in 2 to 3 junctions by these locals and were asked if we need boating. Seeing Boating price @ ~2000+ its better some corporate comes and take over. Prices needs to be controlled."
"Beautiful experience what I had here. Boating service is there in the backwater and it is beautiful. You will get the package for 1 hour to 2 hours. You can see the golden sand beach where the meeting point of the river and Sea. Package is start from 2500, though it is little expensive but if you are a Nature lover then you can do the complete justification with the amount."
Very nice island. I got tickets amount Rs 3000 for four adults and two kids. Please do bargain. Go and visit poovar island.
Enjoyed the very good boat ride in the back waters. Very Scenic and beautiful. Must for all visitors to experience this ride.
Enjoyed a lot. Good experience. Foods are testy and good. Can spend a time with this place. Princes also confertable comparing to other resorts.
I stayed in Poovar island resort.  Just on the backwaters. Enjoyed the views of the estuary.Not a beach for swimming
Experiencing backwaters of Kerala is totally divine! My husband and I booked a motor ride from Leela Backwaters and their hospitality won us! Although we realized we were charged exorbitantly by them but I would like to give that a miss here. We started our adventure with‚Ä¶
"Go with friends for a days stay, you will experience the godly nature of Kerala for sure. Simply awesome experience."
Totally worth spending a day here. Hire a shikara boat. They take you through the backwaters which even have narrow mangroves which adds to the charm. There are floating restaurants which serve acceptable food. You can place your order on the way to the golden sand beach and the food will be ready when you return to these floating restaurants. The golden sand beach is where the backwaters meet the sea and it is sooooo beautiful. The sand actually looks golden in sunlight and the sparkling sea water in its front will make you keep staring till your boat handler begs you to return.
Nice surroundings. Nice adventure... Good service. Good activity area. Enjoying and rest. Feeling calm..
"A remarkably innovative piece of architecture in a unique scenic space close to Trivandrum. Combines the beauty of a beach with the splendour of an estuary and backwaters. Built like a heritage property. The floating cottages, which rise during high tide and go down at low tide‚Ä¶"
"The motor boat ride on Poovar back water was an ecstatic experience. The greenery and the beauty of the place was spell binding. Extended rows of Palm, Coconut, Banana tress dispelled treat for every eye.The flora and fauna of the place was beyond words describe. The fish in the‚Ä¶"
