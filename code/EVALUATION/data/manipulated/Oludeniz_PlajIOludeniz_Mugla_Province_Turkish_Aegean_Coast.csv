Had a great day at the beach. Two sun beds around ¬£6 for the day.  Clean warm sea and fun to watch the paragliders coming in to land.  Plenty of excellent restaurants for food.
Love the blue lagoon. Ate at the first big restaurant on beach. Food excellent quality and really well priced.
"Had a recent day visit to the blue lagoon. It is a peaceful retreat perfect for a relaxing day! Beach is mainly pebbles, plenty of sun beds with the added opportunity to hire a pedalo. I would advise visiting one of the other beaches on the other side of the lagoon as they have bars, restaurants and WiFi!!"
"Loved the blue lagoon, relaxing atmosphere, lovely warm water, great views, sun trap. Cheap to get in and for food and drink."
"Billys Beach Bar on the lagoon, great position for sunbathing and a good restaurant. Having got married on the Blue Lagoon in 2016 it will always be a special place for us."
"Spent the whole day at the blue lagoon so relaxing, they also have toilets changing rooms, and showers, all are very clean. Cafe/bars very good food and service.You pay an entrance fee of about a pound, and just under six uk pounds for 2 sun beds and a parasol for the day."
"Takes place in a national park, nice and clean beach,the sea is super blue. Getting deep so suddenly!The cafes and restaurants are overpriced."
"Beautiful environment, very clean beach and lagoon. Enjoyed several days chilling in the sun and swimming in the clear water."
"Loved it here. 15tl for a sunbed and table, beautiful beach and the water is fairly warm and a clear turquoise.  Spent a lovely day here finished by a fab cocktail :)"
Lovely sea very clear and warm. The lagoon is breath taking my beautiful. Watching the gliders coming down of the mountains. Lots of boat trips available too. Expensive food but it is providing a service on a private beach area. Only disappointment was it's a stone beach rather than a sandy beach but you can't have everything for a relaxing breath taking view and day!
"lovely beach. recommend water shoes as the stones are hard to walk on. good price for sun beds. sea clear and calm, just a large drop to deep water. not great for kids as not sand and dangerous drop in the sea. hard to get out and defo recommend sea shoes so your feet don't hurt."
Spent the morning at the beach 45 tl for 2 beds and a sunshade. Sea can be a bit rough at times and I recommend wearing beach shoes as very stony...
Lovely sandy beach with fantastic views of hang gliders as they land on strip between beach and shops.Loungers to pay for here but reasonable. A walk to the blue lagoon where more loungers and cafes with showers changing rooms etc. is well worth it.
Paid 25TL to go on the beach and get a sunbed. Area very clean. Gently sloping into the sea. Loads of fish to see. Not too busy. Area roped off where it goes deep into the lagoon but you can go through.Surrounding scenery is stunning
Lovely chilled atmosphere. Stunning scenery. Billies Beach is definitely the best place to go to visit the lagoon. Take a pedal boat out and go turtle spotting üê¢ üòç
"Had a day here it was lovely, relaxing a very pleasant day.We had lunch in the restaurant which was very good. The lagoon is calm and warm for non swimmers, you would feel very safe"
Visited for one day to spend time swimming in the beautiful lagoon. Pebbly/stone beach (no sand) with the most gorgeous clear water to swim in. We paid 44TL for two sun beds & parasol & ¬£4 to paddle board for one hour. Plenty of little cafes & places to buy food/drink and lots of beach/sea activities too! Would highly recommend a visit!
There are s few beaches in the lagoon. Our favourite is the Seahorse. Comfy beds either on the sand or decking. Restaurant is good serving snacks or main meals and s selection of drinks or cocktails. You can hire a pedelo or just swim. Makes a change from sitting by the pool.
"Visited blue lagoon paying for the privilege then pay for sun beds.Sea full of rocks, couldn't see the attraction when the main beach is free to visit and closer to restaurants and bars. Definitely wouldn't go there again."
If your looking for golden sand then this beach is not it. Hot gravel stones as you get closer to the water which then becomes huge pebbles and finally razor-sharp stones in the water. It didn't stop others from enjoying the beach but was not what I was expecting. Plenty of sun lounger available. Try Billys Beach for soft sand.
"A beautiful place! It is not compeltely sandy but has gorgeous views! There are quite a few cigarette butts in the sand - the locals should consider putting ash trays on the unberellas pr something! Other than that, this place is lovely! 7TL to get in and 45TL for 2 beds and a brolly...you can't go wrong! Enjoy üôÇüôÇüôÇ"
"Clear water, friendly people. Paragliders landing in close distance. Went in june so not too busy, could stay there all day. Only thing is food and drink is slightly overpriced as it is on the beach. Beach has more pebbles than sand also. Still beautiful"
Omg went there today and I've never going again the water is not blue more like grey with suntan cream floating on the top like oil. Theres me and my husband and 2 little kids are swimming and a big brown floating turd come next to us well I've never jumped out so fast in all my life theres toilets 40 seconds away and no one came to clean it out discusting. The bar men where pissed they kept dropping classes tripping over spilling drinks. Shame if it was well looked after would be lovely just really run down. Needs help. To long on the coach 4 hours stuck in traffic. The market was lovely very friendly.
"Visited last year and kids wanted to go again. A lot busier this year, but still perfectly clean. Sea is warm, kids loved the peddle boat. Unfortunately didn‚Äôt see any turtles this year but lots of fish. Food good and everything priced well not the usual tourist rip off! Great day out!"
"It was our second time here, the beach is stunning.  Loved being able to have cocktails and food and watch the paragliders in the air.  Good vibes, great for families also."
Spent a lovely couple of days on the beach relaxing and playing in the sea with my daughter. It is well worth a visit if you are in the area. lots of food and drinks available near by for not much money.
Shingle beach with space to move. Be warned it shelves very steeply so probably isn't suitable for small children
Oh how much I love this place its just amazing. The waves sun blue green just wow. Bring suncream and enjoy your life!
Had a great day here 15 per lounger and 15 umbrella so 45 for the day 6.00 pound for both of us. Lovely clean place loads of eating places and toilets and water here is the sea not the lagoon side
"After being recommended we visit the lagoon we headed off. Charged to enter the area. One side is the sea the other side is the lagoon. The place is tiny, filthy and over crowded. There was rubbish all on the small beach and the water looked like bath water. It was quite unnerving when camps had been set up or families sitting in the bushes making mess everywhere. Definitely one to avoid. Stick to the sea side."
Worth a visit. Kept very clean and we had a lovely time exploring x it is worth investing in some water shoes as there are rocks and pebbles underfoot- which do hurt.
"Spent the day here and it was stunning. Very clean with lots of sunbeds available. Lovely cocktails served at the beach bar and the food was reasonably priced. Highly recommend this beach if you want stunning views, beautiful scenery and lots water sports on a very safe beach"
"Lovely day out, think the charge to come in, is not good and should be free, as you have to pay for Sunbed‚Äôs and parasols. We can‚Äôt thank the bar staff enough. It was the day of the storm and we had our 4month baby with us. They were so good and looked after us well, even getting us a car to get back to our hotel after the storm was not letting up. We had a brilliant time. Thank you"
Nice beach but spoilt by pebbles as you near the sea. Make sure u have beach shoes ouch ouch ouchThere are showers situated along the beach and plenty of bars. The boats that do the trips also moor up here.
Haven‚Äôt been to √ñl√ºdeniz Beach in three years and on this visit we were very disappointed. Rubbish everywhere and no attempt to clean it up just 50 Turkish Lira for two sun beds and a parasol. What a let down this used to be a beautiful area but they are just interested in taking as much money as they can without providing a service.
