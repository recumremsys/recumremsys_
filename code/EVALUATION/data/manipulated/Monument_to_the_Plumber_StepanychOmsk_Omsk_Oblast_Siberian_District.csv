"This is a small symbol of the city. Is on Lubinsky Avenue, where just a pleasant stroll. The statue itself - a plumber who comes out of the hatch. He can take a photo. Next to him there are other statues, such as Luba."
Found this amusing. A plumber coming out of a manhole in the middle of the street. Well done with something fun and surprising
