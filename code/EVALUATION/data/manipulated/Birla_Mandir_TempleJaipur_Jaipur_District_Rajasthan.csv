"Started this as our first tour one of the day.  The local was local and the temple was beautiful but very bare except main deities and lovely stain glass windows with images of all the hindu Gods.  The outside indicates three religious based domes - Hindu temple, Punjab gurudwala and Muslim dome (not sure what’s its actually called!) but inside area was empty. Good to see 3 different religions in same architecture.  Worth a visit"
very peaceful place.located in a good location. made up fully marble. must go and visit this temple.
"Beautiful temple. But the attitude of staffs in temple leaves bad impression. Temple with too many restrictions . (From my observation) - cannot take picture (even outside the temple)- cannot lean on the wall- cannot touch the wall inside the temple- cannot use the water apart of drinkingIf u do, the policeman/guard? will shout at you in front of everyone. End up, u would not feel the peacefulness and the serenity of temple. Not recommended. -may be just a one time visit-"
Nice place to visit and see  temple. On the mark. Entrance we had Pani Puri of 6 types and pandit ji pavbhaji. Tasty and licking hand delicious. Very crowdy place in evening. Buy traditional doll representing king queen hand made. Recommend
Very beautiful place. Whole temple is made by Sangmarmar. Loved it so much. Very clean place. If you love masterpiece then visit this place. On road situated temple. Outside park also there.
Note this mandir is closed 12 till 3. Lord knows why.  Big structure from outside but not missing much inside.  Guards have real attitude pushing everyone out on a rude manner at 5 to 12.  No courtesy for anyone coming to give 5 minutes extra or even wait to close on time.  Only…

"Made of pure white marble and full of intricate carving,this temple must be visited if you are in Jaipur. You feel at peace and tranquility in a very pious environment. In the evening you can experience lovely Aarti.Amolak Rattan Kohli Former Governor of Mizoram"
"Built in white marble and stone, this temple actually depicts fusion architecture, the stained glass paintings depicting Hindu deities can be considered similar to ones being seen in Churches. Its quite peaceful over here and one can sit and meditate for few minutes as well during the evening time."
been there dozen times with family. Whiter than the taj mahal i feel.  Located inside the city and very convenient to reach. 
"Situated atop on a small hillock this small beautiful temple is good to visit .  We could not visit the inside of the temple, due to over-crowding by the tourists on the eve of New Year."
Birla mandir jaipur is amazing it's look very beautiful. Made with white marble. Our guide told us there are 3-4 birla temple in India but this one is nice one. 
Looks nice in white marble and near to one palace of Rani which is closed. It is in posh area of Jaipur.
Outstanding temple on the outskirts of the city.  Set in gardens.  Overlooking the city.  Popular destination for both tourists and locals.  Nice place to take a little time out. 
Whilst I didn't venture inside the exterior looked amazing.  Gleaming in white marble it sits just below a large fort.
The temple architecture is ok but that's the only plus point. The temple was too noisy and no efforts made by priests or cops to maintain the decorum.  The aarti was made discordant and unsettling but the non rythmic banging of thal and ghanta by the priests. Did not feel iota of peace or spiritually at this temple. Extremely disappointing!!!
"I visited here with my family . Found so much peace and happiness here . It's a most visit Lakshmi Narayan temple.  There are several rules like we can't take selfie but it's ok , every place has some rules and regulations . But the temple is beautiful so if u visit Jaipur visit here ."
"This is a beautiful Hindu temple, highly regarded pilgrimage-place for the Hindus . All made of white marble with beautiful carvings . Surrounded by gardens ."
This is a nice temple well kept. Built out of white marble and dedicated  to Lord Krishna. Does not take lot of time to see this temple. You have to remove your shoes outside to visit this. Inside the temple is clean. Pictures are not allowed to be taken inside but outside it is…
Made welcome by the local members of this fantastic marble Hindu temple. A service was given and explained by our guide. Marble carvings showed respect for other religions and the people were very friendly
Very nicely maintained and manicured lawns. Spirituality in the air. Went with family and like it. Great
"I have been to Birla temples in Hyderabad, Delhi and Jaipur. They are all good. Maintained very well."
Soothing for the soul. Do attend the aarti to be able to get the essence of the place. Ignore the commercial establishments.
This Hindu temple is spectacular. Made from marble & has some very intricate designs & depictions of the gods. Very peaceful as well.
Very beautiful and clean Temple. Very beautiful sight. No pandas or any one asking you for money. Located in prime part of city
It is said that the work never stops in Birla temple and they keep on upgrading something or other. Located on JLN near Moti Dungari.
"Built in 1985, this is beautiful building which embraces Hindu, Christian and Islamic architecture.  No photography is permitted inside, but the exterior can be photographed.  Shoes must be removed prior to entering the Complex."
"As usual Birla temples are always maintained well, ensures good ambience and a big space with plush gardens. This was no different. I always appreciate the Murtikars (sculptors) of Birla temple God idols, they are so delicately carved. This one is Laxminarayan temple. Suggest to go there, spend some time with self. Photography not allowed inside."
Visited this temple and it was really amazing site. Fully marble temple. Lucky to see Birla family visiting the temple to pay their respect as well. Well truly preserved site in Jaipur.
Visited this temple many times. It's really beautiful. I feel so calm and peaceful here. A must visit place in jaipur.
Lakmi Narayan Temple is very famous in Jaipur .. it's made up with white marble .. Situated at JLN marg its location is easily approachable .. Moti Doongri Ganesha Mandir is also adjacent this temple ..
Been to this place before but it was a great experience this time too... the entire temple complex is made of marble and it give peace and tranquility being at this place.... It was maintained well by the society and one can relax and spend some time in meditation...
"Built out of white marble surrounded by lush gardens and situated at the foot of a fort, this exquisite temple is a must visit. Leave your shoes at the designated place to walk barefoot and take in its beauty."
Do take some time to just sit inside the temple on the marble floor. Gives a sense of peace and tranquility.
This temple of Lakshmi Narayan has lovely architecture made from white marble. Very beautiful. Loved the view also
