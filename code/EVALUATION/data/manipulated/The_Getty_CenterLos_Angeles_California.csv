"This is a huge museum with many sections. Each section with it's own theme. There is a lot to see here. A lot of exhibits. This is probably the best museum in the LA area. Parking here is expensive. You park your car and take a tram up to the museum. If you have a military ID (active, retired, ect) then when you are ready to leave the museum, go to the help deck and show them your ID. They will give you a voucher for free parking. It will save you $20."
"This place is a marvel. I have visited many museums, but this one really impressed me. I won't speak too much about the collection. You have the museum's webpage for that, but this one rivals the MET's or the any other European museum. Go!!!"
"Trying to explain what this amazing  complex you can imagine an Art Acropolis up on the LA's hills. It was carefully projected in 1997 by Richard Meier, arquitect who won the most important prize in the world. if it's possible combine another day with the Getty Villa."
"This museum complex is incredible. The buildings, the exhibits, and the gardens are inspirational. The cafe offers amazing food choices. Spend an enjoyable day admiring the exhibits and the magnificent overlook views."
"Beautiful diverse collection, in a spectacular environment. Enjoy the art and the architecture. Find a spot to sit in the sun and watch the city."
"This truly an exceptional attraction in LA. Wonderful architecture, exhibitions, views, smart transportation- full of harmony and relaxation. Entrance is fee, parking 20 dollars. Go see it!"
"The Getty, if you have not been a place of dreams. World renowned artist , displaying there talents. Talent is a gift , creation of dreams, A Must see in L a., You pay for parking , entrance is free. Food is available. Check schedule ,sometime in the summer evenings they have music preformances. Best go to  The Getty.com, where a hat, sunscreen sunglasses. Fun for all , Kids love it, plenty of walking, lots of seating areas.Its what I call mindless entertainment, just dream about what your seeing your , be carefree, relax enjoy the time there.It will be with you the remender of your life. Total distraction from our lifes , It so great the Getty s share the with the publicHard not to feel humble, inspired. I try to go every couple months. Read up on the artist prior to going. Ask at desk for free tours, headphones available. GO"
"The Getty Center & museum is amazing. The buildings and grounds are exquisite. At any given time there are several exhibits well worth seeing. The Manet exhibit (through 1/12/20) is extraordinary. Here is my useful tip for your visit. The museum opens at 10am. Get there by 9:30am so you can park easily and get the tram up to the museum before the crowds arrive. And they will arrive. Trust me you’ll thank me for this advice. Parking is $20., a bit steep. There is no additional admission fee beyond that. Car pool. Enjoy."
"This time we went in the early evening for a lecture. Go online to see exhibitions, they are mostly very impressive. Parking is excellent, especially during the week. I recommend going for lunch at the cafe and spend a few hours there until Sunset."
"The Getty is wonderful Museum/Gallery.  Go on the website to see what they offer.  We saw the Manet exhibit.  The entry is free, so if you get dropped off just enter the garage and take the elevator to the tram.  If you drive:  park your car in the Garage, pay $20 at one of the parking kiosks (You can pay before you take the tram up or after you come back,) then take the tram up to the best Art Museum you will ever see, and I have visited quite a few.  Reminder:  Check out the website before you go, and take several hours to enjoy.  They have some refreshments for sale in the courtyard.  Some folks took picnic lunches to enjoy on the expansive lawns."
"The location and view are extraordinary, as are the collections. Parking is very expensive, but entry is free. If you're in a hurry, don't go. Make it at least a half day thing."
Great day! Did the Garden tour and the Architecture tour. Both were great. The garden is truly an experience :)
"This is one of the best Attractions that Los Angeles has to offer.  Situated on a hilltop overlooking the ocean with spectacular views, the gardens and building of the Getty center are worth a visit on their own.  Within the galleries is an amazing variety of art work.  We particularly enjoyed the current large special exhibition of photographs from the Getty collection.  Plan to spend at least half a day.    Admission is free but parking down below is $20. Ride the tram to the hilltop."
"Having visited many art galleries/museums in Europe, I think that I would be very disappointing if I had payed to visit it.The architecture of the buildings is much more interesting than the interior.I really enjoyed the ""Monet"" collection and the old American pictures.The gardens are very well maintained and can catch your attention.Very nice spot to take good pictures of LA.(was it helpful? give your vote)"
Beautiful exhibits and excellent facilities and well kept garden . Look out for the hummingbirds at the cactus garden.  Free entrance only USD20 for car park . Impressive collection that you don’t get to see everyday . A must visit if you are in LA.
"After a short scenic route up the hill on their tram you reach this marvellous (free of charge) museum. Parking is available but I took a cab there. I would recommend that you make use of their self guide headsets as you can pick and choose the pieces which you want to learn more about (you will need to leave your ID with them as a deposit, if you are on holiday like I was they will just make note of your passport details and hotel contact information). I particularly enjoyed the garden and surrounding sculptures. They have an amazing view across LA. Thank goodness they provided umbrellas for shade as it was a baking hot day. Snacks are fairly expensive so bring enough cash, they also have a restaurant if you prefer a whole meal. The Getty is well worth a visit and you need about 3 hours to enjoy it."
"From the moment you enter the tram for your journey up the hill,  to the grounds, views and varying exhibits you will not be disappointed.   Enjoy the expansive views of the LA basin, enjoy a meal and spend time with the art world experience.  The Sunday summer concerts for kids is over the top fabulous"
Very nice trip and was really impressed. Visited  Hollywood and surrounding areas .went to shopping malls on 7th street tasted nice continental foods all was a great fun and a good experience. Took some ayurvedic medicine with me after consultation with an ayurvedic practitioner Naomi who was really nice and humble personally and helped me alot.
I'm not really into art galleries and only went because my wife wanted to go.However it is fantastic.Allow most of the day and have a leisurely lunch while you are there. Take your good camera for the views.
"The buildings, grounds, and views make this one of the most special places on the planet.  Tie in great art and some good restaurant choices, The Getty has to be the best place to spend a day anywhere!"
"This is truly a not miss site when visiting Los Angeles. The trees on the property were planted 10 years before the Getty Center was built, resulting in magnificent landscaping. Don't miss going to the Getty Center!"
"WOW!! From its stunning architecture to the impressive views of LA, from its beautiful gardens to the fresh/tasty food in its cafeteria, the Getty Center has it all...and we haven’t even touched on the art inside yet. Varied, extensive, and loaded with masterpieces of painting, sculpture, architecture, furniture and photography this museum is a highlight of any visit to LA. It’s easy to see why the Getty is the TripAdvisor #1 of ~2500 things to do in LA. I spent over 3 hours at the Getty and still could have used more time. If the Getty Center was a restaurant it be a Michelin 3* - “exceptional museum that is worth a special journey.”"
Loved our visit. Gorgeous view. Calm setting. Beautiful art collection.  Highly recommend a visit. Interesting information available and beautiful as well.
"The Getty Center is a must see - and admission to this amazing museum is free!  Parking when we were there was $19, and from the parking area, you get on a tram that takes you up to the museum.  An interesting orientation film about the museum started our visit. We didn't participate in any of the daily tours, but there were architecture and garden tours offered, as well as a number of tours about the Museum's art collections/exhibits. A schedule is provided when you arrive. The Getty Center's architecture is incredible, as are the collections of paintings, sculptures and decorative arts.  The gardens are beautiful, and the views from the Getty Center are spectacular; you can see the ocean, the city, and the mountains!"
"This is a world class museum, with absolutely no entrance fee.  There is a parking fee, $20 before 3pm, $15 after...so load up the car and go!Even if one does not love art there is so much to see:  gardens, beautiful outdoor architectural forms, views of LA and the ocean below.  Plenty of place to take little kids to run around while some of the adults visit the museum. The collection is amazing.  Truly amazing in its diversity.  One can always see something new. Go!  Go!  Go!"
"Enjoyed great view, impressionists’ works , wonderful lunch . Missed a tour because I didn’t realize it was limited to a certain number of people. I stayed about 3 1/2 hours and wanted 2 more hours."
"I can see why this is the #1 attraction in LA - this place is spectacular.  The architecture of the campus, the gardens and how it all ties in to the land on which it sits is simply amazing.  Adding a world class art collection and you have an unbeatable combination.  Sadly our architecture tour was not the best but one in our party was very familiar with the design process and was able to fill in the gaps.  Make sure to look for all the views framed by the structure.  Pay attention to reflections in the glass as they can be fascinating.  Take a few minutes to watch the hummingbirds.  Enjoy the gardens, the views of the city and the ocean. It is overwhelming.  I will definitely revisit this place again to soak it all in!"
"Restaurant (Café) is confusing. We wasted 1 hour in this maze of people. They have self-serve (cold sandwiches and drinks) to the left as you come in. If ordering hot food you get a tray on the right side as you come in. They have hot items behind the glass partitions (and different lines) not clearly marked for everything. Be careful you are not in a ""pick up"" line rather than an ordering line. The people outside the glass are just as confused as you are so don't ask them for any instructions. You can ask the cashiers (if they aren't too busy. The food was acceptable. Just could have used better instructions......I hope this helps who ever reads this."
"Beautiful architecture, art and garden. It’s just hard not to love the Getty. Visually stunning views. Really lovely garden. Water features are stunning. They have children activities which are very cute and interactive. There is so much knowledge to gain. People are helpful. Gets a little crowded. Overpriced food items. Bring snacks. Admission is free. You only have to pay for parking."
"The Getty Center has great views of the city and amazing artwork on display.  Although it was a rainy day, it did not spoil our visit because there is so much to see indoors.  The short tram ride from the parking area goes up the hill to the property but you can walk if you choose the challenge.  Lots of people from all over the world were visiting!  Don't miss the introductory movie in the visitor center."
"I highly recommend a visit to the Getty when in LA. It is located outside LA. You will see it from the highway. This was our 2nd visit. Admission is free but you pay for parking. The parking & trolly up to the Getty & back to the parking facility are well organized.  Take advantage of the many free guided tours that are offered as they enhance the experience. Enjoy the lovely grounds & views. It was a cool, sunny, but quite windy, day when we were there. I think the restaurant is certainly worth a try (although I liked my meal better the previous visit). One can easily spend the better part of a day here. Enjoy!"
"For a long time I have wanted to visit the Getty Center. My husband made my dream come true just last week. Having the opportunity to visit this architectural wonder in such a gorgeous setting made my whole year! The photographic exhibit, the gardens, and the incredible European paintings make it hard to decide where to go next. I have to admit that van Gogh’s Irises was my favorite, but in the same gallery are Monet, Manet, Pissarro.  It was hard to move away.Getting to the Getty means navigating Los Angeles traffic. It’s just a fact of life. But once you get off the 405 and enter the parking garage, you are in a different world. The tram ride to the top is scenic, quick and easy. Once there, you’re deposited in a beautiful courtyard with views of architecturally amazing buildings.  Grab a map to wander on your own, do an audio tour or take one of the frequently offered specific guided tours.  Nothing will disappoint.If you want a special meal, check out the Restaurant at the Getty Center — best to make lunch or dinner reservations ahead.  Otherwise, there is a great cafe with an extraordinary number and variety of options in a great setting.Enjoy the fountains, the views of the surrounding hills and the pacific as well as the outdoor relaxing spaces.  You will have a truly memorable experience."
Loved everything about the Getty Center.The permanent exhibits are first rate and I loved the featured Manet exhibition.The facilities are beyond first class. The admission and self guided audio tour are free. The only fee was $20 for parking.Food in the cafe was excellent and reasonably priced.My wife loved the museum shop.Just GO!
"Crowded but easy parking, efficient tram ride to spacious mountain top.  Large galleries, well-organized, and interesting special exhibits, . . .  art, furniture and photography  . . . . plus outdoor spaces are magnificent with great views.  Depending on your speed, it could be an all day activity, but an afternoon will"
"Went to The Getty today and had a great time. Amazing architecture and gardens stand out as soon as you arrive and get even better the further you go in. Some great art displayed inside and the view up there is certainly the highlight. We went with a 8mth old in a stroller and a 6yr old and certainly felt welcome and it was clear the place was designed for the very young to the very old. Children will love the steppingstones across the water feature in the plaza and a run, roll or crawl on the lawn in the garden. Certainly worth a visit and it’s free!"
