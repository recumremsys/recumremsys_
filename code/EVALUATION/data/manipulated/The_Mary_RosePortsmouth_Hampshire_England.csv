"This was our second visit to the Historic Dockyard and to the Mary Rose. The whole set up is just breathtaking. from the first explanation of the sinking through to seeing the ship in all its glory. It's stunning to image that this ""exhibit"" is almost 500 years old. Don't miss this it is worth every penny of your visit. The museum is easily navigated and with thousands of items fro the ship on display with stories attached to every object."
"Second time at visiting the dockyard and finally able to see the Mary Rose and museum, it was closed on our previous visit. Was unaware of the number of artefacts that were retrieved"
"A really worth while visit. Wonderful for adults and older children. Genuine artifacts. More so then the HMS Victory which I also recommend . One ticket of £18 will give you entry for 12 months. Don’t want to spoil the surprises in store when you do go there, but needless to say you will be taken back in time and pleasantly surprised. A great bit of history on our doorstep. Preserved and genuine by some very caring and dedicated staff."
"My wife and I visited the Mary Rose museum today having bought tickets in advance online for £14 each.The museum is absolutely amazing, so well put together with so much information, so many artefacts and of course half of the ship itself on display.The museum is very well laid out with information from the building of the ship, to its service to its raising.The thousands of items that survived enable the museum to tell a story of life on board. Who ever designed the museum had great vision as this is the most interesting museum we've been to. Added to this, there were so many helpful staff members on hand to add little snippets of information.We spent over 3 hours there and would highly recommend a visit."
A day trip out worth the kids for half-term. We were all really impressed with the layout and flow of the museum to link each level of the exhibits with the same level as the Mary Rose. Really clever and brought it all to life! The kids also got a chance to do some calligraphy and making lavender pouches (£2 each extra). Loved it!
"We visited the Mary Rose Museum during the autumn half-term holidays with our 9 year old.  ""Horrible Histories"" was there.  Two excellent actors, one as Henry VIII and one as a Tudor rat catcher certainly added a very vibrant dimension to our visit and brought the whole ""time capsule experience"" even more to life.  They were so entertaining and informative (and even funny too!).  Beware - don't get on the wrong side of them though, especially Henry VIII - his character is a 'dead ringer' for the original, you might lose your head!"
A stunning building housing a truly spectacular exhibit. Visiting the Mary Rose is a moving experience and one not to be missed.
Had a fantastic visit to the Mary Rose museum. It took us more than 2 hours to look at all the exhibits and we could have spent longer. Great to be able to visit again later in the year with the annual pass
We visited the Mary Rose not long after it had been lifted from the Solent and we viewed it through the mist designed to avoid the fragile timbers from drying out. What a transformation was in store! The ship (still in the same position) is now fully dried out and preserved and the way in which it is displayed is so informative and innovative. Being able to see the ship which sank in 1545 brought back to life is magical. Since the ship itself was brought up the divers have also found hundreds of items in amazing condition which bring to life the way in which the ship was manned and operated in its prime. We could almost appreciate the devastation that Henry VIII  must have felt when he saw his beautiful warship disappear beneath the waters of the Solent 500 years ago.
My friend and I spent nearly four hours at this spectacular museum . We are both dedicated Museum visitors ( I work in one) but this is really off the scale in comparison with the many museums around the world we have visited . The Mary Rose itself plus the story of recovering her are  equally compelling .All of the  people involved have created a truly memorable experience. Thank you.
"Visited the museum in May 2019, and looked at this fabulous British war ship. Its a stunning testament to the British Navy, plus the museum has painfully brought it back to life."
Very interesting on hearing the story of the Mary Rose . Displayed really well . Great to see what was retrieved and pains takin to get it to where it is now . Great job . Another part of history on show .
"Our Mary Rose Experience     5/5It was fun! Because we got to dress up as a Tudor there was a sad bit. There was a dog skeleton and I love dogs and I recommend you go there. When I was going to cafeteria, a storm hit and I got wet through.Magnificent Mary Rose!!!The trip was amazing! We saw the Mary Rose which was probably the bit. Whilst walking around the museum, we saw all the artefacts. We saw a skeleton dog which they called Hatch. Hatch’s job on the ship was to chase rats whilst being aboard the ship. Whilst having fun we learnt about the cook of the ship. His name was Ny you will find out more about him if you visit The Mary Rose Museum. The trip was the best one so far, so visit the museum for more facts. Promise you’ll have fun. I rate this museum 5/5.The Mary Rose museum 4/5This was an amazing trip I really loved it.We got to see the Mary Rose in personAnd we also got to see skeletons thatDied on the ship.

Be quick, there are people every day.The Mary Rose    5/5Walk around slowly so you don’t miss anything because it’s really cool! Also on our trip to the Mary Rose, there were lots of guns, knives and cannon’s. But the bad thing was you can’t hear the hologram. I suggest you go because it is cool. The Mary Rose Museum!!!!!    5/5*****I think it was an amazing sight standing in front of Henry VIII’s amazing ship. It was very interesting and it had lots of artefacts. I also saw Hatch the carpenters Dog. He is called Hatch because they found him in the hatch of the carpenter’s room. It was an amazing experience. I would check the weather before you go because when I went it was windy.

I would highly recommend this trip. It was lovely.THE BEST MUSEUMI give 5/5 from me. I love the facts we learnt and if you love history then go and you get to see what it was like. I would definitely say go. Also, there are more boats like the HMS victory and more and if you like clothes, it is near town and the spinnaker tower and a football stadium.Going to the Mary Rose museum  I would give it a 5/5 for our trip to the Mary Rose museum. The experience was great. We got to dress up as poor and wealthy people. I also enjoyed learning about all the artefacts. I would change it so that we had more time.

When I walked past the museum, I could just tell by the look of the it, that it was going to be amazing. Walking slowly past the Mary Rose, I could feel what it was like during the war. Due to all the staff of the museum, I had great fun and we saw the paw print of Hatch, the carpenters dog. I rate this trip a 5/5. Next time, I would want more time to experience what it was like to be on the Mary Rose. It’s a MUST go to the museum. Going to the Mary rose*****	5/5 On our trip, we went to the Mary rose museum. It was fun. We went to the window to see the Mary rose, then we went up to floor 2. It was high but not as high as floor 3 so we called the lift. While we were going up, it looked like the Mary rose was shrinking. At floor 3, we could see everything. We went on glass floor. Then we went to the café to have our lunch. Then we went to the workshop and the person’s name was mike. He was nice we wore old clothes. After, we walked back to the bus. Then we got back to the school.                                                                            I would recommend you going to the Mary rose museum.My Mary Rose tour.5/5I had a fantastic trip to the Mary Rose Museum. I like everything about it .Trying on the Tudor clothes was my favourite. I thought the Mary Rose was quite small but it’s not actually. Oh and just saying to the ones that want to try ship biscuits, do not because they’re rock hard. I would want more time at the Museum. So, I had an amazing time at the Mary Rose Museum and would really want to go again and I think you should too.Amazing Trip 5/5As we were walking in, I saw the times of how the Mary Rose sank and came back up. Going down the lift, I saw the three layers of the Mary Rose. As we walked out, I saw some artefacts in the café. I would rather have the Mary Rose closer. I loved the place so why don’t you visit.The Mary RoseI am giving this school trip a 5\5. It tells you about when the Mary Rose was lifted out of the sea. Also, we saw the skeleton of a dog called Hatch and how learnt how he died. I would want more time so I would go again.Mary Rose expedition 5/5On our amazing trip to the Mary Rose, the weather was so bad but when we got to the museum, we met our tour guide. It was nice to see the Mary Rose. Well, what’s left of it and seeing what Tudors wore and I wish we made more time to see everything. I recommend you should visit.A taste of the pastI give the Mary Rose trip 4 of 5 because I really liked the skeleton and the stuff from the Tudor times but I did not like that we did not have enough time to eat the ship biscuit. Also, it was cool to see the weapons. I liked wearing the Tudor clothes. I recommend you come to the Mary Rose museum!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Things about the Mary Rose.The best thing that I found out in the museum was seeing the Mary Rose inside.The 2nd best thing about the Trip was seeing all the objects in the Tudor times.I would Rate this 5/5.You better go and see the Mary Rose.HOW AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Our trip to the Mary RoseThe museum was great. I would give it 5/5. I liked when we got to dress up like poor and rich people. We also got to see half of the Mary Rose. I would improve having more time to see some more stuff as we had to rush to lunch. I hope you come and visit. I highly recommend going to visit."
"Very impressed with the Mary rose exhibit these days. Engaging for both young and old with all the artefacts, information and interactive screen. It really gives you and in-depth in sight into the goings on on the Mary rose and the people aboard her. Lift and stirs access to all levels so can be enjoyed by everyone."
Having watched the raising of the Mary Rose many years ago as a child I was keen to actually see this museum. It did not disappoint. The whole thing has been done superbly and so very informative. A really fabulous place to visit.
Visited the old museum a number of times. The new museum is absolutely world class and we are amazed it’s in the city we live in. Shame there isnt even one visit included in the all dockyard pass and that you have to pay a separate fee for the Mary rose. It’s a great place for all the family and a part of the city’s history. Fab!
Truly remarkable.  Be sure to allow enough time as the displays are very extraordinary. I was there on the beach when she was raised. The restoration is a remarkable feat of skill and imagination.
"History isn’t my thing but this museum was amazing. We spent nearly 4hours here. Helpful, friendly staff who are full of information. Carefully preserved ship and contents. The smell of the wood is evocative of her short life as King Henry’s flagship. Worth every penny of the entrance fee. Loved it."
"After a welter of interesting introductory features we went into the main museum area. I cannot remember another occasion when my breath was literally 'taken away' and I stood there transfixed. This is perhaps the most extrordinary place I have ever had the pleasure of visiting. You are taken back several centuries to learn and see how mariners lived and died in the sixteenth century. The detail is beyond belief.  Master gunners, master carpenters and master cooks are brought to life. The presentation is outstanding. This is a 'museum' that all others must live up to. Do not miss this amazing spectacle on any account. You will not be sorry you went."
"Loved this place!!We visited with our 9 and 11 year old, they loved the museum. My wife and I found the place very informative. We both remembered watching the Mary Rose being raised as kids, so to see it in person was great.4 floors of displays are in the museum all over looking the wreck of the ship. The displays are very informative and interesting. On each floor there is a museum staff member with a table full of artifacts to explain there uses to visitors."
"Third visit. Went to see the 'Many Faces of Tudor England' exhibition based on the recent television programme, which has excellent and popular.My overwhelming impression of the main museum however is that it is ridiculously dark, almost to the point of being unsafe on the walkways. It is difficult to see one's hand in front of one's face, and impossible to recognise the person one has gone with, such that you walk past them. It's so dark it's difficult to see the exhibits in the cases."
"Visited here yesterday with friends, an excellent exhibition, definitely worth a visit. The staff couldn't be more helpful, they were also extremely well informed about the ship and and it's history. It will appeal to all ages as there are activities for children as well.One of my friends had recently had a knee op, the staff couldn't have been kinder, finding her a wheelchair. So that she could enjoy the visit too, easy access if you are disabled!"
"Bought our tickets back in January and it has taken till now, October, to make our visit. The historic dockyard itself was really interesting to see on our way to the Mary Rose Museum.The museum itself was excellent. The introduction was very atmospheric but then turning a corner and seeing the wreck in front of us was awesome. Superbly laid out and even the walkway followed the slope of the ship's decks. The artefacts were displayed really well with explanations for everything and the whole experience was enhanced with lighting, sounds and the video projections.We spent several hours entranced by it all. Having watched the raising of it from the sea all those years ago I was more than excited to see it in life.Amazing visit!!"
"Arrived as it opened and saw both d day exhibition and the overlord tapestry. Outside to Southsea castle too. Great visit, parking paid for extra though. We came here first as had to pick up Portsmouth pass. Worked out far cheaper than separate. £10 for  d day £11.50 for spinnaker tower. £13.50 for Mary rose. Docks and victory £31.00. £65 and 49 on the Portsmouth pass."
We have been 3 times and never cease to be amazed by the exhibition. Fantastic layout and so much to absorb. Have recommended it several times to friends - and we are all grown-ups - for children it is awesome and cannot wait until the grandchildren are old enough as an excuse to go more often. Nice café too!
"I had never seen the Mary Rose and had no real expectation.  But - the exhibition was fantastic.  Brilliantly and creatively developed and exhibited, it had clearly taken lots of commitment and dedication, and money, to reveal this beautiful artefact and its 28,000 treasures so far brought to the surface and restored.  It's fascinating to see the evidence of advancing technology and the impact it has had on archelogical finds.  Ironically, the way the specialisation is going, digging up stuff is no longer favoured.  There are some very clever VR videos superimposed on the ship every few minutes:  it would be so different were the whole experience VR rather than the real thing !The displays are detailed and fascinating if sometimes a little excessive:  there is so much to take in at once.  Perhaps another visit soon would be the best option ?A curious fact recalled from the exhibits: there were the remains of only three rats found.  Was this because the Ship's Dog (his skeleton is on display) was superbly  effective ?"
"Having visited the Mary Rose years ago, it is nice to finally see it displayed and protected as it always should have been! The new museum is quite simply fantastic and a real gem when it comes to explaining the history of the ship, it’s life and also the lives of the crew that sailed on her! Using effective and sophisticated interactive technology along side costumes actors and informers, the museum brings to life what is otherwise quite a heavy subject and presents it in a way that is easy to digest and also understand. Exhibits and displays are a plenty but the real jewel is the ship itself which you have to see to believe, it is quite simply mesmerising and unbelievable. I didn’t take photos as I didn’t have time to and I was distracted you the scale of the thing! Also photos don’t do it justice, it’s one of those things you have that we with your own eyes! Highlights and plus points Perfect for anyone interested in history Interactive and never dull Informers and staff and amazing and well informed Good shop The ship itself Negative points I imagine in peak season it will get busy and some if the rooms could crowd up quickly Overall, You have to see this to believe it, and for anyone who has a smidgen of interest in English or nautical history should come and see it!"
So much here to see you will need to return. Loved the ‘people’ exhibits which showed items relating to various people on the ship. Amazing remains considering the years under the sea. Would liked to have had more seats around just to sit and soak in the atmosphere and rest ‘older’ legs. Will certainly return.
"This has to be one of the best presented exhibitions in the world. The story of the Mary Rose, it’s place in history, it’s location and recovery are all beautifully told. The shear amount and variety of artefacts that were found and preserved is incredible. Do your self a favour and pay a tenner to have someone like Barry guide you through the whole story. Thanks Barry."
"There is so much to see at the Portsmouth Historic Dockyards. There are two things not to miss. Start with the Mary Rose Museum. She was a warship of the English Tudor navy of King Henry VIII and sank in 1545. What you see are the remains of the ship as it was raised in 1982. Well done with holograms and interesting artifacts. Not as well lighted a I would have preferred, but they are trying to protect the items from light (I think). It was BIG.Then take in the HMS Victory but know that it is not/NOT recommended for those with walking limitations. Your tour takes you up and down narrow stairs and over obstacles. She was Lord Nelson's flagship at the Battle of Trafalgar on in 1805, where the French were defeated. Nothing but a ship to see, but well maintained and large enough for 850 offiers and men. She was the only ship to fight in the Napoleonic Wars, the French Revolutionary War and the American War of Independence. There are probably 4-6 other areas to visit within the Portsmouth Historic Dockyards. Take your pick. All good. We paid around $63 for two. Entering the place was confusing, because there was separate admissions for the Mary Rose and another for the Royal Navy piece. I never really understood which paid for what."
Loads to see and read. Spent a great couple of hours in this attraction. Staff we knowledgable and helpful.
"This is an iconic ship that the staff and facilities have brought back to life.  This is history as it was, laid bare in front of you.  The exhibits and how it is told are 1st class.  Our 3 year old son enjoyed the hands on parts of the tour and the interactive screens.  Where as the wife and myself enjoyed reading the stories.  Our son was fascinated with the staff showing the doctors instruments.  Make sure you do the top level and experience the open air part of the museum.  Pay the money it is very worth it."
Third visit. Went to see the Many Faces of Tudor England. Walkways in main museum are pitch black so it is impossible to see who you have gone with and seem to me to be unsafe. Also difficult to see exhibits due to light levels.
"Fantastic. Thank you to the staff. We were very lucky to be the first in on the 1st November. We had period dressed guides, explaining everything about the Mary Rose. My daughter has recently seen Six the musical. Great fun sharing the music with guides. I’ve now visited the Mary Rose 3 times since it went on show. By far this is the best visit I’ve had. Brilliant keep history alive."
Visited the Mary rose during half term with the family - 3 children aged 4 to 9 years old. It’s a separate ticket compared to the rest of the dockyard but is very much worth the visit. A treasure trove of 16th century history with modern exhibits and a well laid out route to follow.As it was half term- there was an activity trail for the kids and a Henry VII actor giving a 30min talk.The talk and the actor were excellent.Cafe was a bit small - so was full so we had to go elsewhere.
