"Wow it's very NYC to visit this monument. It is great monument by muslim builder.....,..... Enjoy the great evening here......."
This place is simply marvellous. Very beautiful and historic place. Many things to see inside. Perfect example of ancient architecture. Recommended to visit with authorized tour guide. You will enjoy more by knowing history related to each and every part of the place.
What a place is this !!The imagination of the creator of Qutub Minar is totally different. Built to superbly a standalone structure standing still even after centuries just as it was. This is really superb !!For travellers there is a big parking space just opposite to the entrance.For Indian nationals the entry is INR 40 and for Foreign nationals it is about INR 550.One can spend about 2 hours to gaze and understand this monument.Entry is available untill 10pm but should one wish to enter the Minar structure the entry closes by 5pm.
Do find time to visit the monument ! The lighting is beautiful and the monuments and itâ€™s surrounding is kept very clean ! The signages can be improved.
Visited this place as a part of our India Tour. A historical place to visit. Beautiful place Very crowded as it it is one of the most tourist attractions in Delhi.
"One of the important historical monuments in India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ and one which I was waiting to see from my school days. Has an amazing history regarding the building, renovations. Interestingly this one is built after destroying some 27 hindu and Jain temples. This was built to mark the beginning of Delhi sulatanate Mode of transport - there is a bus stop right in front of the compound. however we went there by a cab as we don't understand hindi and it's easy to manage a cab driver with English. Best time to visit : winter season. We made the mistake of visiting there in May month. ðŸ˜­ Scorching heat literally kills you. Couldn't stay there for more than 10 minutes. Attraction: the complex has multiple small buildings which we didn't bother about much. We just took photograph in front of the main Minar. If its a cool climate, we can surely  go and roam around much Must -Water bottles and sun glasses. Irony - people are not allowed inside the minar as in olden days due to some freak accidents in the past And the ticket counter guys are not so well versed In English. Govt needs to take care of this. Ticket prices are cheaper online. 35rs per person. Once you come outside, you can see people thronging for something cool as the weather is too hot."
Visited this on some holiday and it was really crowded. The main minar is worth seeing. The surroundings give a pretty fair idea of history though a bit more of description wouldn't have hurt. The washrooms r there but because of the crowd they were very dirty and unhygienic. Good to visit on a winter afternoon.
Qutub monster as a very old good monument. This is very nice piler in mehroli area. Built by qutub don't Ahmed
Awe inspiring construction and so close to lotus temple. Don't leave it out you will not be disappointed
Impressive monument of Indian history marking a start of new era in Indian rulers. Line for tickets were quite long but I was orient and did not buy the express tickets. Carry cash as Eftpos machines donâ€™t work very well. Will take 30 mins to visit the site.
Constructed in old times with perfection in architecture and design. A 5 storey round structure.It is much better than the leaning tower in Italy. I felt very ashamed that our country is not able to attract tourism even though our art and culture is far better than other developed countries.
"Historic place w some of the oldest architectural monuments in Delhi.  Learnt a lot about the history, the minaret itself was fascinating design up close. definitely worth the visit even if it was primarily because of protests in old Delhi that day."
Although been here many times but the first time i visited this place with kids and they loved it. The architecture is fascinating and the location is prime. Had a sub just outside at a local subway after. Overall a good place for a day out.
"it is the tallest minar. going inside the minar is not allowed i think , there is a beautiful garden outside the minar"
Beautiful ruins. Don't miss the 22 foot high iron pillar with no rust.  Not crowded and easy walking.
"Had visited this historic minaret in New Delhi a long back ago. This minaret is a popular tourist attraction and is visited by tourists.This minaret is located inside the Qutub complex. It was built by Qutubuddin Aibak in 1193 to celebrate the Muslim dominance in Delhi. The architectural style of this 73 metre high minaret is Indo-Islamic. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This minaret is a famous landmark in Delhi. It was opened to the public long ago. But due to a stampede, it was closed to the public in 1981. It is the highest tower in India, complete with 5 storeys and projecting balconies. Inside the Qutub complex, one can visit the ruins of Quwwat ul Islam Mosque, Iron Pillar, Tomb of Iltutmish, Alai Darwaza and Alai Minar. One has to pay an entrance fee to visit this place. There are vendors selling lemon juice outside the Qutub complex. Had admired the ruins, the Iron Pillar as well as the Qutub Minar as a school going child.This minaret is an ideal place for families, history lovers as well as architectural buffs. It is a must visit place and should not be missed when in New Delhi."
This site was one of my favorite places in Delhi. An impressive structure with abundant photo-taking opportunities. Put this at the top of your list.
Went to see it again after nearly 20 years. What a change. It is really worth seeing it. Impressing ruins in a well kept place.
"The Qutub Minar is a ""must see"" highlight of Delhi to go and marvel at how something so colossal was constructed using the technology of hundreds of years ago. Built largely from the remains of demolished temples of other faiths, the Qutub complex is today just a shell of its former structure (other than the Minor itself) but is still a fascinating view. Be sure to see the Iron Pillar there as well, a mysterious obelisk over 1600 years old that's another trophy of war brought to grace the Mughal capital. There's plenty of good historical signage there for a self guided tour or a guide may be worth it depending on your interest level."
"The main attraction is the Tower. If you are interested in Islamic motifs and designs, this is one the finest there is. The intricate and delicate designs are just amazing. Take your time and take in the atmosphere of that place."
Beautiful Architecture and the facts our guide told us were astonishing. Loved visiting it. Thanks to Target Tours India for adding this into our itinerary. I was not keen on visiting this but Glad I did.
"When you visit this, it seems to be visiting an era. A monument close to 1000 years old. The hight and the work on stones is amazing. Salute to the art of that time."
I came here with my friends. Enjoyed a lot! A must visit place. Do come with your friends & family. Especially the archeological park was astonishing.
"I always to see this place since I was a kid. Nice place to visit clean and easy to spend couple of hours. Line took a while as system was down amd then they ran out of tokens. Reading history of the place made me sad that Hindu amd Jain temples destroyed to make this place. But then I reflected how great country India is that despite this they have allowed this structure to be preserved however in other countries they would have destroyed places like this ie. Pakistan, etc. I wish there was a big Indian flag on top of the tower .. or somewhere in the vicinity as the history of it and how the people built it was disrespectful to Hindus and Jains by destroying their place of worship and using the materials disrespectfully to create this place."
Thank you to tuk tuk driver Sunil Peter in Delhi..find him on fb or on fb as bess tuk tuk driver This is a great stop reminding you of India's vast history. We have spent 3 years on the ground in India ... and yep if you have time make this stop.
"This is a historical place. I was there on a weekend day and it was very crowded. Very long queues to buy a ticket. But for foreigner they have a seperate ticket booth where the queue isn't too long. The fee for foreigner is much higher than for Indian. Inside it was busy, but not too crowded. Walk around and explore the places of this Unesco world heritage site. From far you can see the tower of Qutab Minar, but inside there is much more to see. Walkin around will take you one to one and a half hour."
Went to see qutub minar with family and kids. Nice tourist attraction. Half day trip can be done here. Photographs were good here
"Worth a visit when in Delhi and exploring the heritage structure in the city. Indian nationals and foreigners have different queues for purchasing tickets at the entrance. Remember to retain the token given as it needs to be returned back on exit. The experience inside is quite nice, plenty of greenery around, reasonably clean wash rooms and the monuments / points of interest are well explained in Hindi and English. You'd require about 2 hours inside to explore it comfortably. If you're taking a tuktuk / auto rickshaw from outside the venue, remember to bargain the cost before sitting (cardinal rule for rickshaws in Delhi)"
A 70m tall majestic tower stands upright in middle of Delhi. Built in 1190s it never fails to fascinate any visitor. It is a world heritage site and is a must visit for all those who has a keen interest in History.
"Ahhh the memories, went there after 17 years. Great to see that it's being maintained so well. Loeved being back there after so long. Although now, it really is a task to get inside owning to so many people visiting place but it is well worth it once you're inside.Beautiful."
"Lovely park and historic buildings. Well worth a visit. Remember to find the Neem tree with 200 medicinal properties ( so they say!) beware the security guards offering to take pictures. They will set up well, just be aware they expect a tip."
"Qutub minar is a great place to visit. Easy to get to it from aerocity (near airport) in south Delhi. Buying tickets is easy, especially for non-Indians. You can walk around without a guide and get a great experience. Be firm to ward off the guides if you donâ€™t want them. The security guards seem overly friendly to take your pictures but they will ask for money in the end, so just be aware of that (just annoying thatâ€™s all). Otherwise, the complex is a beautiful place to spend a couple of hours and get a glimpse of the rich history of Delhi. Oh, the bathrooms are at the opposite end of the complex (when you look at google maps)."
"Continuing on our guided tour of India, my wife and I visited the Qutub Minar. Looks like this place is always busy, with an equal mix of Indians and foreigners crowding around the highlight spots. I noticed lots of people were trying to take a photo of somewhere that is empty of tourists, but during the morning it proved almost impossible. This is a major Islamic construction in India built in the 12th Century AD and took about 8 years to complete. The main minaret is 73 metre high made of red sandstone and surrounded by intricately carved stone mausoleums and tombs in the complex. This is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, so it is an important historical monument. Check out the parking areas around the site for the number of Tour Coaches and you will be able to gauge how busy it is. Toilet facilities are available, but not like we are used to. The site is open every day and entry costs 600 INR for foreigners and an extra 25 INR for using a still camera. Another one of the more important historical sites to visit in New Delhi."
"Was intrigued by the monument, and the near by unfinished Khilji monument, where in the ruler tried to match if not beat this structure. Also tells of the plunder of local temples and the purpose of the monument to showcase a battle victory."
"I enjoyed my visit there because of the beautiful sculptures, many many on the roof, on the surfaces of historical remains. Some of them kept in good condition and not so many people there so you may walk and see slowly. Recommended as a half day outdoor sightseeing trip."
