unique view to towers and great feeling of Shanghai. try it morning and night. easy to reach by train or taxi.
"Is the most European place  in Shanghai, is really beautiful and have a lot of Fun there, is really full of high level brands and shops. Really interesting the street market"
"This is certainly a must see in Shanghai. Nice area, very crowded, plenty to do and see. Enjoy the views of Shanghai skyline with all the 3 “kitchen tools” towers and the pearl. Best views in the afternoon with the sun lighting the scene."
The bund is by far one of the best scenic things in Shanghai. See the old buildings with the view across the river of Pudong. The lights at night light up the buildings and on holidays they have light shows.
Have to do Bund on trip to Shanghai!  Must see as it offers amazing view of Pudong! Close proximity to East Nanjing Road for shopping and French Concession.
"There is good reason people recommend visiting the Bund. Lit up at night it is one of the greatest city skylines. It was stunning to see these towering giants cast their color upon the water. Each building a separate work of art. There are plenty of places to eat or grab a snack/drink, and makes for a great night out"
"Stop here.. great arciteghture and good place to get those ""postcard"" pictures. Many tourists so be careful for teahouse and massage scams!"
"Very beautiful skyline.  Very cool walk.  Crowded but worth it.  Especially if you're doing Nanjing pedestrian road, it's so close.  And best of all...  free!"
"The views at the Bund are amazing, worth visiting both day and night. The city lit up at night is beautiful and stunning. The lights are on only from 19:00 to 23:00 in summer and from 18:00 to 22:00 in winter. It is clean and the pathway is wide. There are also benches, which you can sit on. Gets very busy at night after 6pm. The Spectacular architecture along with ferry’s passing by on the river makes for great photos."
"Great lights along the cold breezy walk. Its a must try and visit when in China Shanghai. Try to do it during Spring/ before Falls, and try to be there to witness both sunset and nightfall. Beautiful."
Lovely views over the river and great atmosphere.  Go in the evening to see the lights. We sent just before dusk so saw views both day time and evening
Walking distance from the nearest Metro. Nice view of the city's skyscrapers. Light show from the buildings in the evening.
"One of the best views on the Lujiazui skyline. Furthermore, many historical buildings that once housed numerous banks and trading houses. Less know to most tourists is the Wall Street Charging Bull's brother, designed by same artist Arturo Ugo Di Medica. Typically very crowded during day and evening. Around 10 minutes walk from line 2 station east nanjing road. Best time to visit: Just after sundown when all the buildings including Pearl tower and Shanghai tower (2nd highest building in the world) are illuminated. Going there for sunrise also very nice, much less crowded and one can experience locals engaged in activities such as taichi and flying kites."
Watch the glimmering skyline of the new Shanghai day and night. The boardwalk is amazing allows you to walk along the river.
Walk the Bund & go to a restaurant to enjoy the view. Loved it all. Best place to see the river & all the action around that area.
"reminiscent of Chicago. Beautiful part of the city, on the river. The wall is made of flowers and you get an incredible view across the river. Crowded but friendly, definitely worth stopping by."
"Really pretty views at night and worth the long walk to see it from the nearest metro station. Do be aware that a large portion of the lights will switch off at 10pm. We were unfortunate to have only arrived at 10.02pm and to our misfortune, everything on the shanghai tower switched off."
Visiting Shanghai without visiting its symbol is IMPOSSIBLE! So it is a must see when you are in Shanghai. You should be there both in day and night and enjoy the spectacular landscape in day light and of course fabulous lighting at nights. But to see all building full of lights you should be there before 10pm.Spending approximately 1 hour to promenade and enjoying the perspectives is completely worthy.
"Extraordinary views of the Pudong skyline.  Very busy on a nice Saturday but absolutely the highlight of visiting Shanghai.  The light show at night is definitely worth seeing but don’t worry about getting there at 6:30PM when the music is coordinated.  Suggest going a bit later when the crowds thin; the lights will still be doing their thing.  During the day, make sure to spend time walking along the street and checking out the classic Western-style buildings from the ‘30’s."
"Old Shanghai one side, modern Shanghai across the river, best at night when it’s spectacular! Check out Indigo hotel on the river (old side) which has an amazing roof top bar."
Beautiful views of the Skyline by night. We had a great time in the area. Be sure to book a hotel well in advance as Hotels are fully booked most of the time.
Spend a couple of minutes to visit this famous attraction The Bund 外滩⋯⋯older days called 上海滩！It was not so crowded when we get there by 5 pm and I think it is better to go there when it is completely sunset cause you can see the light sparkling. I still find the night scenery in HK Victoria harbour is better.
"This is indeed a must visit place in Shanghai.The skyline is beautiful no matter what time of the day you visit. Overlooking from the Bund side, it is beautiful landscape of modern skyscrapers and latest technology billboards. Between the Oriental Pearl tower and the Shanghai Financial Center, you have a wonderful backdrop for a postcard that will be the envy of many.The bund is also a good place for a casual stroll as the walking pavements are very wide and there is so much view to take in on this boulevard that stretches for a couple of kilometers."
"Where old Colonial China meets new Modern China. The lights! The view! Cross the street with 100,000 of your new friends on a warm, weekend evening. Stop at an old hotel for a drink. Enjoy the crowds on the river walk. I've been many, many places, and there's nothing like it!"
"It is a must place to visit if you are there in Shanghai. I must say, it's the first place to see in Shanghai specially in evening. Don't miss to wait and watch the sudden lighting at 6 p.m. Must visit place"
"Very nice especially in the evenings.  The buildings across the river are all lit up.  Good photo opportunities.  Take the ""psychedelic "" tunnel ride under the river.  Very different and cheap.  Along the Bund,  most of the buildings have a very ""European "" feel.  For a second you might think you are walking in Europe somewhere.  Worth a visit."
An evening walk. Magnificent evolving light show on the shoreline of the river. Lighted boats pass on the river as the towers change colours and dance on the buildings
Crowded but definitely worth checking this place out esp at night where the buildings light up. Stroll along the bund to catch different views from different angle. Be sure to check this place out when you are in Shanghai!
This is one of the most incredible views in Asia. Make sure you there after 6:00 PM to see the light show!
"We had a lovely walk along the Bund taking in the sights and sounds of the place, very busy with tourists. was a pleasant hour or so but nothing special."
Loved walking along the Bund and looking across the river towards the city skyline. The beautiful view of Shanghai is something I will never forget. I did a night cruise with The Huangpu River tours which was a bit tacky but worth it to see the city from the water.
"I loved the view, this place is usually packed in the evenings but the view is amazing. You get to experience the beauty of the Oriental Pearl tower at night. Take your camera, snap a couple of shots!"
A must go visit .. especially at night. See how Shanghai turns into a city of “gold” ... it’s so nostalgic & mesmerising.
Did a walking tour through the BUND.  It was clean and safe.  Interesting to see the history of the location.  The old city next to the BUND was incredible
The Bund runs along the water front with distinctly with European and American architecture. Make sure you have your walking shoes as it is a long walk but worth it. The river front as many terminals for ferry and cruises.
