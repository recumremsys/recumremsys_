"Calangute is another popular and crowded beach with numerous shacks that offers various cuisines and drinks, the prices are by and large same at the shack.  The beach is big with water sports options such as boating, water skiing & parasailing etc. Be it day or night, the beach is always crowded and lively, good place for enjoyment and hangout."
"Located in heart of North Goa, the beach houses lots of shacks and restaurants to feed ur hunger n thirst. The beach is clean but is overcrowded with people. There are lots of unpopulated beaches in Goa besides this. Don't forget the watersports"
Lovely beach with lots of sun beds and food shacks. Serving lots of different cuisine which you can eat inside or even have bought to your sunbed!!!!
One of the most popular beach. Sand is great. Shacks have continous music playing and it seems every Shack is competing against other one on Music Volume..!!  Great place to hang out though ..!!  Finding a peaceful place on Beach will be challenge with lot of people around ..!! Beach to go to have fun n chill !!
This beach is amaazingly wonderful. Equipped with a number of shacks beautiful breeze and music. A perfect getaway from normal life
"Nicely developed beach in North Goa and one of the most popular ones. Lots of crowd and water sport activities. Long beach and in fact is in continuity to another popular beach of Goa i.e. Baga beach. Reclining beach beds are in plenty but if you want to use one, you are expected to buy some drinks or food. The beach is children friendly and can be visited with families."
"Good beach views , small beach near the ibis styles. Lots more visitors at evening through out the night. Beach side affordable liquor, beers and food is available. Enjoyed a lot"
"This is an excellent beach only if you are found of shopping, good local food and can handle crowd. 'cause this beach and it's surrounding has all of it in abundance. In season days big buses are stopped about 3 kms before and you have to cover the distance walking but you don't feel it as the street is full of shopping and eating options. Beach is really very nice and tides are beautiful."
As Goan beaches go Calangute Beach is not on of the better ones. Over populated and full of litter. Head further north or south for a better beach experience.
It's an average beach. It's crowded with more Indians. There are lot of shack options on the beach. Paid car parking is at walkable distance.
Central Goa is not for beaches but for clubs or good food.If one want to experience a serene Eve at beach go to extreme north or south. Beaches are full of tourist who keep spoiling your pictures. Avoid them if your priorities are peaceful walk on beach
"It's a very crowded beach, lot of shacks & loud music. Didn't enjoy the beach but sunset was beautiful."
"Cool beach with all necessary requirements. restras on beach, near by markets, hotels etc. enjoys alot."
"The beach is ok, decent sand if you can avoid the dog poo. There are literally hundreds of dogs along this and every other beach we went to, mostly friendly but also mostly stray. The beach is lined with very average bars and restaurant shacks, all endlessly trying to get your business. There is rubbish strewn around the place, but there is everywhere. The worst part of this place is the lechy locals, who barely try to conceal taking photos and videos of young girls and boys. Disgusting. Do yourself a favour and head to Candolim, it’s marginally better and quieter. If you’re not a local, avoid the beach area near town, full of local men and very intimidating for my wife and kids. Never again"
"Calangute beach is best place for enjoy in goa. Calangute beach and baga beach is twins beaches. Hear you can come with your family. But this is open for all, so you know all types of peoples come here. So just be aware.... But yes this is best place in goa"
Visited to witness sunset with a toddler. It attracts huge crowd all the time! Water sports are available in this beach! I was impressed with the beach authorities that they were making sure everyone is out of water by 6pm! Huge waves were there.. so i recommend those who know swimming should swim.. kids should enjoy water in presence of their parents..There are lot of shacks available for foodies! Although we are vegetarians so we tried 'Sagar pure veg restaurant' just outside the beach...I must say food was delicious!! Beware of parking area.. we noticed they were trying to fool people by charging them extra! There are all types of hop on shops around the beach for shopaholics!! Good beach!! Those who wants to purchase beach wear or cloths suitable for goa should purchase them in and around the beaches.. u can get good cloths for reasonable prices! Bargaining is the key!
Just ok beach . Only to be used for water activities. Rest hugely crowd always. So not suggestive for peace loving people.
Loved the sand and the cleanliness of the beach. There are relaxing benches on the beach where one could chill but these benches are encroaching on beach. Lots of eating and drinking places on the beach!
"Arrived Dec2 2018  the dirtiest beach I've ever seen , it's used by domestic tourist as a place to abuse , broken bottles , dirty nappies ! food cartons , worst of all the contents of there stomach , disgusting . Things changed after many complaints in early Jan2019 , police on the beach, cleaners on the beach , threat of fines for the people responsible for the decline of genuine tourist , May this long continue , KEEP ABUSE OFF THE BEACHES ."
Its the most dirty and crowded beach in north goa. Avoid it if you want to have some peaceful time near the sea. Go for candolim.
A very good  flat beach but draws huge crowd. Guess everyone who makes a trip to Goa ends up at this beach. They have a lot of water sports at this beach. Large number of beach shacks around. Very touristic place so if you are looking for a quiet place to laze around this is definitely not the place. They do have place to changeover and bath nearby. There are lifeguards at this beach.
This is a very  crowded beach with lots of activities which will keep you entertained. Would suggest to visit in the evening as can enjoy and same time do shopping. It is a perfect place for dinner but the prices look bit on the expensive side. Don't forget to bargain while shopping.
Avoid. It's one of the most popular beaches in Goa and most of the 1st timers end up here. It's too commercial and there is simply no vacant spot available.Shacks are a bit over prised.Explore other beaches.
Crowded all the time as it is adjacent to famous Baga beach. But still better here than Baga. Very near to shacks and also some good food joints in Calangute market.
One of the most popular and well known beaches in Goa. Went there on a weekday evening. The road leading upto it is very crowded with tons of shops and restaurants of all varieties. Some of the shacks on the beach have bad bollywood music blaring at unacceptably high volumes and distortion--but the dancing public dont seem to be sensitive to this. Worth giving it a miss
We have been visiting Calangute beach every year on our holidays in goa. The beach is always the best place to go round the clock as it is very safe for families and couples.  Life guards and police are always available for the protection and help. Consuming Alcohol is strictly prohibited on the beach in open. You can go at any nearby shacka and restaurants to quench your thirst for a beer or anything else.
"Goa is certainly avery lush, progressive and beautiful area to visit. If you want a quieter more secluded area to visit than Bagu Beach then Calangute Beach might fill the bill. There were certainly quite a few domestic tourists staying at the time I was there. It was the wet season and it did rain for most of the morning when we arrived. The beach is easily accessible from any of the accommodation in the area. Because of the time of year the beach was very rough and closed to swimming. To go in the water would have been extremely dangerous. A lifesaver tower had been knocked down by the waves during the previous night. I was disappointed with the beach although, if I had of been in Goa for longer I would have gone for a long walk along the beach. Don't know that it would be a good idea to walk alone at the time of the year and especially not for women. Besides not being able to get in the water the beach was extremely dirty with rubbish that had been washed up by the waves. It was easy to see the large amount of rubbish in the water. By comparison, when at Bagu Beach later in the day, it was extremely clean. I can only speculate that the beach there is cleaned."
"I have visited this beach few times. Looks like now it's overcrowded. Very difficult to get a place for a family. I find South Goa beaches are much better with clean white sand and less crowd. Also, during season too much space is occupied by restaurants and water activities guys in Calangute beach, leaving only small area for people to enjoy the beach. In addition, Life Guards were over controlling, if an adult is not allowed to go to knee length water, I think there is no point of visiting a beach for swimming. Also, many times water activities guys encroach space marked for people to swim."
Calangute beach at Goa is a public beach and maintained by Government of Goa for public use. The beach is clean and awesome. Very crowded almost all the times. We did water sports there. Rode that high speed Yamaha water scooter and also went for Para gliding. Paragliding is INR 1000 per person without any negotiation.
"Despite the fact being in India, the Calangute Beach on New Years Eve an Day needs to be seen to be believed! Having said that, just take a few step behind to a beachshack, and its all fine and relatively relaxed."
didn't like the beach so much.crowd is not good. Shacks serve pretty average food. Shops at the entrance of the main beach are OK. Very crowdy.
"Overpriced sea front cafés and far too crowded, will never return to Calangute beach ever! Unlike the actual town, which was full of character and interesting shops that didn’t overcharge!"
Had a wonderful time ..beach was busy but very clean Enjoyed the watersports. Had a great experience
"planing to visit goa then this beach has to be the first priority for you. The most happening beaches, you can stay till midnight 3 and 4 am."
"Not worth spending more than 5 minutes there. Attracts all road-side Romeo's who, just by their leering, can make any woman uncomfortable. Very very crowded and dirty."
