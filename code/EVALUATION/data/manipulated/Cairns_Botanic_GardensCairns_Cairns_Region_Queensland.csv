"We visited these botanical gardens several times during our stay in Cairns. Fantastic paradise, with lots to see but the reason we went back and back were the volunteer talks - birds and botanicals! So much to hear about & so different to the rest of the world! Go and enjoy.... the cafes are good too!JW"
One of our hilights during our Cairns stay.Was very lush on a rainy day and all the family enjoyed it. Take an umbrella each.
"A well spent visit. So many beautiful plants. You will have green-envy! Be sure to visit the cafe, gift shop and Tank Gallery."
Great way to experience local flora for free. Rainforest part when you walk in it - was the best! Don't miss the smaller part of the park - it is really beautiful too!
"Visited Carins Botanic Gardens recently and just loved it. Also had lunch at the cafe. Before we realised, we spent hours at this place."
We learned a lot here from our volunteer guide who pointed out many things about the plants and the garden. Itâ€™s on the spectacular side and easy to reach from town. Find the jade vine and go inside the conservatory.
Spent a couple of hours walking the gardens-very enjoyable. Make sure you grab a map to guide you. Lunch at the cafe also enjoyable.
Spent the day wandering around the beautiful Botanic Gardens. The flowers are just stunning! A must see if travelling through.
"This was a quick walk from The Lakes Resort, where we stayed. Lovely walk past Bamboo and other plants and trees. It's a paved trail, no worries.  The tanks are repurposed from WWII oil storage. Now they operate as various venues for art and music. One services as a cafe and outdoor space for the Botanical Gardens. Enjoy a coffee, breakfast other meals after you challenge yourself to the adjoining land conservancy, which takes you up, up, and up to the top of the mountain for a look over Cairns."
"Our family of 4 (2 teenage daughters) went to the botanical gardens when we had a couple of hours in the morning before our flight out. It was a little tricky getting here, as we originally got on the wrong bus, but the bus driver called ahead to the correct bus and took us to a bus stop to transfer.  Make sure to take the SunBus and it will take you to the entrance. The bus ride was only $ 2-3 AUD from our hotel. The botanical gardens are free. There is an information center where you can get a map. You can spend several hours here, but we could only spend an hour, which was OK because our feet were tired from several days of walking. We tried to take the bus back, but it never came to the bus stop (construction going on), so the information/gift shop lady called a taxi for us and it was just a couple of more dollars for the 4 of us than the bus. I would recommend coming here if you have time."
"Great free thing to do with the family. We spotted two varieties of frogs (watch out for the grassed areas near the lakes as there are hundreds of miniature frogs there and they are easy to squash if you're not careful), heaps of interesting caterpillars, insects and birds. The tropical plants are amazing and it's all well presented. Centenary Lakes play area is on one side of it and this is great for kids. Bring the Aerogard, but other than that this is a great place to visit."
"Unlike most other botanic gardens, this one is informal and tropical. There's lots to see, so plan to stay for at least a couple of hours. Walking tracks provide additional routes for those keen on a challenge. Check out the Watkins Munro Martin Conservatory to see cycads and local butterflies. This is a relaxing day out, but bring the insect repellent, as the mosquitoes are hungry."
"Loved the Cairns botanical gardens.  We saw the Tank art exhibit as we entered which was quite interesting but unstaffed it seems, so we werenâ€™t sure who to talk to. The gardens were beautiful - a fair bit to see and read, making it quite an informative place. They did seem to be small though - considering the variety of tropical flora and fauna, as well as, what we can learn from the native aborigines - there is plenty more that can be added to the place."
"Lovely grounds, great for a walk, picnic, lunch at the cafe, walk through the butterfly home. Went there went the tanks markets were on and there were a lot of stall holders, this is a must if you market stalls."
Stopped by the Botanic gardens and just did a short walk thru. Fun to see plants and just slow down.
These gardens may not be the biggest but absolutely worth a visit. Has a nice cafe located in the grounds. Really nice spot for families to picnic and admire all the beautiful tropical plants at there best.
The botanical gardens are beautiful. They are so big so allow plenty of time. So many birds and butterflies. Loved the gift shop to.
We walked from downtown out to the gardens. It was a long walk. But were greeted by some truly spectacular plant life. Just amazing. Do get a map when you arrive from the shop (free at the desk). You will want to make sure you donâ€™t miss anything.
"Cairns is a subtropical climate so naturally their Botanical Gardens are going to be representative of that.  Our bus tour guide was not particularly great so she wasnâ€™t too clear as to what was best to do & had trouble finding the garden maps (which were by the Cafeâ€™s counter).  It would have been nice to have had more time to explore.  Be aware if you have allergies, the damp environment & flora will impact you."
"Went here in the morning to enjoy the coolness produced by the plants ,for me the amazing part was that plants we grow as indoor specimens are growing in the wild as in some cases beautiful trees. The conservatory had a terrific array of unusual plants. We finished our exploring with coffee and cake at the cafe which was also delightful. Would recommend a visit here for some cool relaxation."
Lovely spot even in the rain. Was nice to get out and have s wander through the gardens- lots in flower. Easy to get around.
"We spent a Sunday morning at the Botanic Gardens walking through to the TANKs at the top. There are a number of different elements to the Gardens, a rainforest walk, an aboriginal plant section and the Flecker Gardens to name but a few. Oh, and, importantly, a coffee shop! Open every day and free entry."
"Loved our time at the gardens. Is it a credit to the city of Cairns, so many great species of plants, and so many in flower when we visited."
"Absolutely loved these gardens, we were staying close by in Edge Hill and could easily walk there so we went every afternoon and did different areas. Loved all of it, but if you only go there once then do the rainforest boardwalk, you feel like you are far away from any city..."
"Went through the gardens as part of a Segway tour, was great to see the gardens this way. Beautiful place, does not compare to anything back home. Recommended."
Worth a visit if you are in Cairns. The gardens are easy to navigate your way around and has a diverse range of plants and historical interests. Walk around to the Tanks Arts precinct next door while you are there and see this fantastic conversion of old oil tanks.
"This place clearly is the best kept secret in cairns!  I come here nearly everyday to do the hiking trails.  There are numerous hiking trails for all levels.  I would encourage everyone to go to the visitor center to get maps of the entire garden and walking trails and cites, along with the separate ,map for hiking.  Everything is free here and there is a small cafe to purchase food and beverages.  I would encourage hikers to start off by doing the red and yellow arrow trails.  When you are ready for the real challenge you have to do the massive and challenging blue arrow trail!  Do not do the challenging green arrow trail because it leaves you in the middle of  a suburban district far away from the main entrance of the garden with no transportation options but walking.  I was so exhaulsted from the very long hiking trail only to have to walk a couple of miles more just to get back to the starting point.  You must wear comfortable shoes, bring plenty of water, insect repellent, and the entire gardens is very safe in all aspects. There are some splendid views from the mountain tops and you need to be able to take photos, as well!"
We by accident parked b the childrenâ€™s play area which has just been revamped.  What a lovely way to enter the gardens.  Amasing play area wish I was a child again or had children with us.  Loved the walk along the boardwalks towards the visitor centre. Butterflies ðŸ¦‹ tall trees and ferns.  Really enjoyed walking under the canopy of the trees.  Big lake area with ducks and pelicans.  Very relaxing.
Walked around the Rainforest boardwalk and then back via the Bamboo forest - highly recommended. There is plenty of parking
"Had a lovely afternoon wandering around the Cairns Botanic Gardens before my flight.  It's well layed out, easy to navigate, and there are a massive range of stunning tropical plants. Free entry but there is a cafe/toilets if you need them."
The Botanical Gardens were sensational. The variety of plants and little critters were very friendly. Loved the icolours and symphony of sounds as we walked around the trails. So stunning with some natural history  included.
"I always visit Botanic Gardens in places I visit.The  Cairns Gardens collection is a MUST SEE .Spice gardens, Aboriginal Plant use, Rainforest Gully, enormous rainforest trees, colourful collections of beautiful plants in the conservatory & a great cafe/visitor centre. Over the road is centenery lakes, pristine rainforest with boardwalks and separate freshwater & saltwater lakes. Need a FULL day to appreciate everything, and then some more time."
"Obviously tropical based, these Cairns Botanical gardens are a treat. Beautifully coloured plants and exhibits.  Loved the Butterfly enclosure and the landscaping. Also enjoyed the boadwalks too, & the coffee at the end of our visit."
Well worth a visit. Schedule one to have a tour with the volunteer guide. Netted butterfly and other tropical exotic plants enclosure is interesting.
A visit to the Cairns Botanical Gardens is well worthwhile. The tropical garden is beautiful & well maintained. Enjoyed the butterfly sanctuary & orchids too. We had lunch at the the cafe & the gluten free carrot cake & waffles were delicious ðŸ˜‹ Highly recommend for a relaxing well shaded morning or afternoon.
