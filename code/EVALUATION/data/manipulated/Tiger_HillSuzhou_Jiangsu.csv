"Another attraction that one should visit.  Of course, lots of tourists but not an issue.  Prepare for a short hike to reach the top but nothing straneous.  I recommend going EARLY to avoid the crowd, heat and more time to enjoy the hike, nature in the early hours and better photo ops.Bring water if you do not want to buy.  There plenty of vendors along the path so not to worry about if you forget to bring them."
This is a good place to learn the local culture. Need a guide to explain. I was lucky to catch a good season where there were not too many tourists and the flowers were in full bloom. The weather is great at about 13C with no rain.
Nice to walk the grounds and see some history. Must see in Suzhou. Take the boat ride around the tower. Sometimes a bit crowded.
"If you are adventurous, have the stamina and want to explore, this is the place you should visit. As you enter the attraction, you can proceed to the bridge and go straight hiking up the steep stairway towards the leaning Pagoda. You can easily spend more than 2 hours if you want to explore all the area. If you are exhausted or do not want to walk, you can take either the buggy or the cart pulled by a horse to go around the compound. We were lucky that the place was not crowded when we visited immediately after their 3-day public holidays on 31-May. You can also take a boat to tour the canal/river and surrounding area. Nice place for a half day hike/tour. Do remember to wear comfortable clothing and sport shoes for quite an extensive hours of walking."
Nice to see! Some nice pictures! Go outside and enjoy the garden! Chinese Touristen are not interested in!
"After lunch and a short rest, we took the bus Y1 to visit Tiger Hill. The entrance fee is now 80RMB. The impressive attractions on the hill is Pagoda of the Yunyan Temple and Sword Pool. Pagoda of the Yunyan Temple, also known as Tiger Hill Pagoda, is seen as the leaning tower in China. According to the historical legend, Sword Pool is said to bury about 1000 precious swords. It is worth time and money to visit Tiger Hill. The tour guide give very detailed and interesting explanation and we learned a lot about the history of hill and some other customs of Suzhou."
One of the places you have to visit. Beautiful and full of history. Very nice walk. Go in the morning and take boat ride to other place.
"It's a must do item on your Suzhou trip. Beautiful gardens , the leaning tower , the horse drawn carriage, don't forget to ring the bell(a lot more fun than expected ) . Go late in the day to avoid the crowds . You can see everything in about 2 hours"
Visited Tiger Hill last week with some buisness friends. We went there by taxi. The fair to visit is about 80 RMB not too much. Spend a half day over there and got some nice impressions.
"We entered via the north gate which is quieter. It is possible to take a boat ride on a circular route arounf the island the pagoda stands on. having looked at the map we decided to go all the way round and then walk in and exit via the south gate.It got busy very quickly.Unfortunatley the pagoda was covered from top to bottom with scaffolding so it was difficult to see the ""lean"" which it is famous for.The toilets at the south gate are awful."
Be ready to climb a few stairs to reach the pagoda. Similar to the Humble Administrators Garden - signs introducing key areas are in English and Chinese. Enjoyable visit but I would recommend the Humble Administrators Garden over Tiger Hill if you are short on time.
Tiger Hill was very interesting. Best part was walking Shantang St to get there. Really got a chance to see old Suzhou. You miss so much with the boat or bus trip. Walking helps you experience the people.
Entry fees was around 70 Yuan. Good to visit once. easily takes around 4-5 hours. Lot of stairs in some places so it will be easy on your feet if your fitness levels are good or can become quite exhausting by the end of it. Special cultural performances by locals is a highlight of this place and must see. Shows are around 3 times a day so plan your trip accordingly.
This is basically a giant outdoor museum with lots of beautiful wildlife. You have to walk a lot so be prepared. We happened to go when it was pouring so plan ahead because it rains a lot in Suzhou. There are great photo spots as well. Specifically in front of the Yun Yan Pagoda (A.k.a Leaning tower of China). And each sign has an accurate English translation for tourists. They have this horse too. He‚Äôs pretty cool. Rocking that Asian bowl cut dude!ü§òüèª
Definately worth the effort to visit. Parking facilities are good and the entire area is very peaceful and beautiful. Not too overrun yet - and the drive from the center city is not too long either. A must-see if you happen to spend time in Suzhou!
This is the worst place I ever go . Don't hope to get free explanatory service at there even though was label as free. not baby friendly as well
"Nice scenic spot outside of Suzhou. Took a cab from town up to tiger hill and loved all the plants and old pagodas and buildings. It's a nice easy hike that kids can do and lots of places to explore. The moat around is pretty and the boat ride is fun. The bamboo forest and tea field is so beautiful and all of the foliage feels very peaceful. If you go out the south exit, walk towards the river and hop on a tour boat! Such a cool ride watching the locals use the river and looking at all the old buildings. It will drop you off amongst red lanterns and restaurants and street food stalls. A great experience. Boys ages 3 and 6 loved it."
"There is so much to explore and see here from the tower itself to the various buildings housing rock sculptures and bonsai to the bonsai gardens and the water features. Bring walking shoes, or have a horse drawn carriage or electric tram cart you around. There is a lot to see."
"Had an interesting afternoon here, very busy on New Year‚Äôs Day. Took the electric bus ride to upper level before climbing the last section to see the tower at the top. Lots of snacks for lunch on the way back down. Plenty of walks and places to amble around."
This is good place to spend few hours. Slightly away from city. Had few hours with me and could see a sneak preview of china culture and past. Well maintained and has a few good photo spots. You can a good walk in serene nature and enjoy couple of waterfalls too.
visited Tiger hill from Shanghai as a day visit to Suzhou in our 10 day trip in China. It is not really a hill. You can go closer to the attraction by bus. Then walk . nice with flowers of different varieties. Best season to visit is April - May. during the period place is pretty crowded. When we go there this April The leaning Pagoda was under repair and couldn't see well. Nice to go
"Visit it, and you will not be disappointed. Early in the morning, still quiet and not crowded. Take a look at the Pagoda, enjoy the lakes, river, paths, grass, trees, flowers. Find a peace within yourself."
This is among the better choices for water  and garden type visit. Has historical value as well. Provides for a nice walk among the greens. Keep 1-2 hrs if you have time. Wear comfortable shoes
"Absolutely enjoyed my visit to tiger hill today. If you are into ancient Chinese history and mythical stories, a visit to this ancient garden is a must. I highly recommend hiring an official guide from the tiger hill garden tour office once you entered the garden. One hour approx personal guide was 100 yuan total, our pretty guide had explained really well of the ancient history of the garden and the interesting mythical stories associated with emperor's under water tomb, magical stones, wells and pagoda etc. Strolling with a guide makes the visit more interesting and entertaining. Tiger hill is not far from suzhou train station, last stop on bus route #2, approx 15 minutes."
Wow! What a sunrise! I was more stunned about the mountain tips seen through the clouded skies! With a little TLC this will be beautiful. It has a lot of potential. Get there at 5.30 so you have time to watch the glow emerging from the horizon! We loved it. On the left will find the colours of the mountain and the right I‚Äôll be the sunrise itself. A little disappointed by the street vendor who sold water for double the MRP! This needs to be addressed. It was for my brother who was vomiting and I didn‚Äôt need to scavenge around for More money. Things to improve: the rubbish is disguisting! Bins are there and clearly not used. We had a smoker standing amongst hundreds of people. This should not be tolerated. These non smokers should be able to stand and watch the sunrise without inhaling their disgusting habit. This should be a 500 rupee fine along with littering. It‚Äôs a public space. It should be clean and pleasant.
Stayed close to famous Pingjiang Road in Suzhou we took a public bus to pagoda park. Entrance is for season and non season. Even in December‚Äôs colder time the park and pagoda was nicelyüëç crowded. Slight hiking ü•æ on the top. No so nice view but definitely nice park to stay for some hours. Recommend
"This is a beautiful park and historic area in Suzhou. Went on a sunny Sunday and took a boat ride, climbed the hill to the tower (stairs), and learned about the site. Recommended!"
"Built on a hill, this park contains many gardens and walkways. Probably crowded in the high season but certainly worth visiting. Plan to spend time just wandering around. There is a tea house in the park (which is quite large) and many other things to see. Very well maintained from the flowers and bamboo forest to the unique tower and architecture. This is one of the great places to visit while in Suzhou."
I have been going to Tiger Hill for Years. Having lived in Suzhou I would seek out the solitude and tranquility that this ancient yet beautiful spot would give me. Stressed from the office I would go mid week when few crowds were there. Wander the ancient buildings and places. Imagine standing where Marco Polo and Kublai Khan would chat. Sends goose bumps up my next. I would leave a very calm and different man then when I entered. So many photo opportunities I cannot count!
"We took a taxi from the old Suzhou to reach this place. We eventually found the ticket office when just walking towards the main entrance.. it was on the left-hand side. Not too much English info, but we managed to get the tickets alright. One of us was worried about the hike up the hill, so we ended up taking the tram. Turns out, the hill wasn't actually very high - around 35 meters according to the info text. But the tram ride anyways provided some nice views around the hill/island. For most people, the walk up is definitely doable. There were also some horse rides available, but the horses looked really sad and not too healthy. There are interesting spots around the Tiger Hill area (pagoda on top, pretty buildings, bonsai garden...). For us, the highlight was the beautiful flower fields on the sides of the hill. The smaller paths down the hill were less crowded than the main path. We spent around 2 h here, taking our time to enjoy the main sights and nature."
"It takes 30 mins out of the city and our guide (QuinQuin booked through Trip advisor) brought us here, as my husband had a list of places that he believed we would be most interested and she confirmed that they were of merit.  We visited the Humble Administrators Garden first about 10 minutes away in this ancient city.  As you walk through there are vendors and then you walk up this ancient cobbled path that is just as you hope it will be, lined with hundred of flowers, tulips surprisingly amid other plants, vibrant and well kept..  You walk through an arch with two statues of ancient warrior who protect the monument and into the great cobbled area, up each one of the huge wide step, past monuments to maiden with sad histories, a wonderful shop that sell old fashioned souvenirs not to be missed at old fashioned prices, statues and onto the monument and the death of the 1000 peasants who made the monument for the Emporer and the burial under the moat.  Carry on walking to the top to Tiger Hill and the Pagoda of fantastic proportions built when it seemed impossible to managed this and into a museum of about the heritage of the pagoda and its history.  Gently wander along to an amazing view and panorama and then down the other side of the hill and to the Buddha's and then to the Bonsai Gardens.  Really quite wonderful.. If you would like to there are horse and carriage rides that take you from one side of the monument to the other.....  This was fabulous, and wear your walking shoes!"
"Go, it's really interesting but try and go when it's quiet as otherwise the crowd pushes you along. Can be very busy but worth the effort."
Visited there and it is a hill with a lot of visitors. Quite difficult to walk with kind trolleys. Of course place to visit with quests. Some one recommended a boat trip from Tiger Hill to SIP. Next time we will try that one.
"This is the first time we were visiting this hill.We were here in November and the weather was comfortable. The fall color just emerging and a little fog on the day we were there. We had hired a tour guide, speaking Mandarin, and took the tram up to the hill and walk from the top to bottom with the tour guide. It will be a long walk or climb to walk up to the top of the hill. Do use the tram service!!!This site does have a lot of history and many stories if you are interested. I would really like to come back here and takes a lot of photos. The site is huge and will takes some time to see every corner of it. I would come back again if I have a chance to visit again."
"We neither saw the tiger nor the hill! Our taxi driver indicated that the pagoda is under construction and then proceeded along the road and dropped us off at the entrance to a classical garden which was NOT part of Tiger Hill. We only realised that later. What we saw was the Calm Garden, quite beautiful, but with lots of tour groups and guides with loudspeakers, not even a Unesco heritage site and quite pricey at 70 RMB entrance fee. Afterwards we struggled to find the start to Shantang Street, a walk that is highly recommended in Tripadvisor reviews. Because we were in the wrong place, we had to walk through a very rundown area and lonely back roads which made us feel really uncomfortable. Apparently the silk museum is also closed for renovations and tourists are being misled to another destination where the emphasis is only on selling you silk products. Be careful!"
