Pandavleni the great historical place since pandavas living here. Having great budhas statues. Also having old satatues. In one mountain lot of things are there
"Located close to Nashik and a wonderful trek leads you to this Buddhist marvel. Set of 24 caves. Not very far off from city, it is still a very peaceful place and gives a very beautiful panoramic  view of the city. Morning visit is good as compared to evening and during monsoon the trek is wonderful. Very similar to Elephant caves which the Mumbaikars have for their visits."
"The Pandavleni Caves are located besides the Mumbai – Nashik Freeway and it is in the Buddha Vihar Complex on the right side of the Freeway, 3 km before reaching Pathardi Phata, and 8 km before Nashik. The Dada Saheb Phalke Smarak and the Trirashmi Buddha Smarak are also located in this compound. There is sufficient free parking space nearby. We had a stiff climb of about 200 hundred steps, and had to pay an entry fee of Rs.15 per person. The historic archaeological site is managed by the ASI. There are 24 caves cut into the hillside, with carvings of various Buddhist monks, although the carvings of the Buddha himself were later additions by the devotees of the Mahayana faith between 4th to 6th centuries CE. The original cave excavations date back to between the 1st to 4th century CE. The interior of the caves have simple carvings whereas the exteriors are more elaborately and intricately carved. Cave numbers 3, 8, 10, and 23 are bigger, more well planned and better than the rest of them.The beauty of these caves lies in their dignified façade. These caves are not at all connected to the five Pandava brothers of the Mahabharata, as the name may imply.Visiting hours are from 8 am to 5.30 pm. It is a good place to visit for history and archaeology buffs. Situated about 300 feet above the ground level we got an excellent bird’s eye view of the entire city of Nashik. It will look even better in the months of July and August after some more rains helping to cover the land with a carpet of emerald green."
"Situated near the highway, it’s a nice landmark to visit considering it has some interesting and mysterious caves uphill. Steps aren’t too much and can be done easily in 15 mins. Total around 20 caves small ones. Caves are good but other than 2 of them others won’t leave you with awe. But the place is clean and well maintained.Great city views from the top"
"These are one of the oldest caves in maharashtra. Can be seen in around 3hrs. Have steps so please wear waliking or racing shoes.Have some water bottles with you above there is no stalls or hotels.Will recommend to visit in day light. Place is really quit and peacful. You can see major part of nashik from top of caves.At the base of caves there is one garden called phalke smarak, you can also visit this."
India is amazing and a monument 2 BC old right in the hills of Nashik city. Mind it the timings are strict and start climbing before 5 in evening. Not many stairs for youngsters but may be a small mother for elderly.... Buddhist architecture will leave u amazed in the same scale as Ajanta caves..... pl do visit.... keep it clean
"Pandavleni Caves are a group of twenty four, 1200 years old Hinayana Buddhist caves located about 8kms south of Nashik. Nashik is one of the world’s holiest Hindu cities. The Kumbh Mela is held here once in 12 years along with Ujjain, Allahabad and Haridwar.Leni in Marathi (the local language) means caves.Although these caves are located near one of the holiest Hindu sites and have a name of Hindu deity, these rock-cut temples initially were started by Jains and later turned into rather significant centre of Buddhism.Caves are located midway up the Trirashmi Hill, some 100 m above the surroundings, facing north-east. Climb to caves is not too hard and the atmosphere around the caves is peaceful and - how agreeable - free of annoying monkeys!Cave complex has additional amazing feature - stone-cut steps leading from the base of the hill to caves and from one cave to another. Stone steps lead also to the summit of Trivashmi Hill but this path is considered to be dangerous.Site contains also several carved water tanks and overall good water management system.The cave has idols of Buddha, Jain Teerthankara Vrishabhdeo, and the icons of Bodhisatva, Veer Manibhadraji and Ambikadevi. These caves are popular meeting places for the disciples as well. There are also attractive water tanks that are very skillfully chiseled into the rock.Nashik is well connected by road and rail with all the major places within and outside the state."
"PANDAVLENI Caves are located just at the outer boundaries of Nasik city. These caves are carved in a small rocky hill . These caves are Bhudhist caves built starting from possibly 2 /3 rd century BC onwards over a Period of possibly 600 years . Supposed to be one of the National heritage ..We visited on a rainy day ..slushy , no proper path ..ill designed railings to go up the hill..Managed it was worth the effort. Amazing to see the Kind Of work done 1500-2000 years ago..Inspiring .Aesthetically no comparison to Ajantha or Ellora caves.We can't make comparisons and look at the Monument for It's worth keeping in Mind the period during which they were developed ..2 investment maximum..Be prepared for zero public conveniences.."
"Pandavleni caves are a set of about two dozen caves situated atop hills on the outskirts of Nashik city.Also known as the Trirashmi Buddhist caves, these are believed to be carved between 3 century BC to 2 century AD. Most of these caves were used by Buddhist disciples as a meeting/ prayer hall (Viharas).One can take their car upto a point and then need to climb uphill, the walk being slightly tricky specially if visiting during the rainy season. Visiting the whole place will take better part of the morning"
"Pandavleni caves situated on a small hill 8 kms off Nashik city centre, is a set of Buddhist Viharas & one Chaitya. sculpted out of the rocks.Though not having the grandeur of the caves at Ajanta or Ellora, the caves are quite impressive in both its architectural construct and beautiful sculptures. Apart from the beauty of these structures, one also gets a beautiful panoramic view of the Nashik city from the hill top. Reaching the top involves climbing up a flight of stairs & took us about 10-12 minutes."
Its a good place where you can enjoy a small hike to the mountain and also see the ancient caves which are said to be carved by the Pandavas many years ago.The view from the top is also great! Consider this place as a short picnic cum hike!
"Very close to Nashik highway, the Pandavleni caves was a brilliant discover, thanks to Google. It took more than half an hour to climb up to the caves. Carry water and wear keds. The caves have beautiful idols of Buddha and other deitys. The view of Nashik from above was breathtaking."
It is a set of 24 caves mainly of Buddha carvings. Set on top of the hill with almost 200 steps to climb. Really enjoyed the view of Nashik city from the top.
Perfect place for history lover. Very old caves and well maintained place. Many tourists came here for visit. Build in old time.

"Wonderful bunch of caves created for Budhist monks. Involves a climb of moderate difficulty. We went in the peak of summer, in the afternoon and so was tougher. But youngsters and middle-aged people should be able to handle it. Caves are kept clean."
Had visited in last month during my maharastra visit. the really very nice historical place. lost of visitor comes here.
"The best time to enjoy the Pandavleni caves in early morning. Take a walk upto the caves before the sunrise and view the sunrise from the top. Sit on one of the pedestals at the entrance, take a deeeep breath, listen to the birds chirping and feel the fresh air. Its ecstatic, that's one word I have got to say about Pandavleni...."
Ensure you reach here early morning. This offers you not only heritage caves but a beautiful view of Nashik city. You need to climb more than 200 stairs to reach at the top. There is an entry charge for you. Worth a visit so don’t stop in middle. It’s very charming at the top.
This is nice place to visit . Good caves . Just note you need to walk or wouls say climb 2 km to reach the place . Avoid it during hot summer. You wont get anything at the top.

"First let's get the meaning right. Pandavleni Caves are nothing to do with Pandavas of Hindu epic Mahabharata. ""Leni"" in local language Marati  means Caves.Built between 3rd century BC and 2nd century AD by ancient  Satavahana and Kashtrap Kings, these caves showcases a lot about life of Buddhist Monks. Popularity of Buddhism during early period is depicted beautifully in these caves and sculptures. Leave alone Kings and riches, even commoners such as merchants and fishermen built caves for Buddhist Monks. The rise  of Buddhism in India post Asoka, faith of public on the religion and wide spread adoption  is evident in these Caves. Large Buddha statues and stupas are must see. Liked Cave number 10, 18 and 20. It is some kind of place for Monks to live and mediate ( ""Viharas"") There many small rooms with place to sleep and mediate. Cave number 18 is the only ""Chaitra"" or prayer room. There are totally 24 caves , small and big.The caves are situated on top of Trirshmi hills. Be ready to climb at least few hundred steps  though  you will enjoy the journey. Carry your own water. You may have to spend anything between 1.5 to 2 hrs here. The place is just 3 to 4 kms away from popular Hotels in Nashik such as Taj Gateways, Express Inn.Entey fee is Rs 15 for Indians and Rs 200 or 3 USD for foreign nationals. Entry is Free for children below 12 years. Though maintained by Archeological Society of India, the site could have been tourist friendly with tourist guides, booklets etc.After seeing some of these Buddhist caves , one wonder how such a religion could not sustain its popularity in India. Is it only because later Hinduism was supported by Kings or was it something else.. Time to ponder and learn about ride and fall of religions."
"Visited the caves after so many years. The trek up feels do good and the streams at the site are so cold. The marvellous architecture makes you wonder about the capacity of those people. We found some baby crabs, and oh there were so pinchy. Don't handle them though."
"Pandavleni caves are 2000-year-old, and it was built by the Jain Kings. It is a group of 24 Hinayana Buddhist Caves, which date back between 1st century BC and 2nd century AD. These caves are at a distance of 8 km from Nashik.Caves are located midway up the Trirashmi Hill, some 100 m above the surroundings, facing north-east. Climb to caves is not too hard and the atmosphere around the caves is very peaceful. Avoid going there in hot weather as you have to climb few stairs to reach to the caves. It is a must visit place if you are in and around Nashik."
"You could take a state transport bus from Mumbai naka or dwarka circle in Nasik for this place. The caves can be reached after climbing up several steps. Wished the caves had been maintained better than they are. Also more information displayed would have also added value to the visit. A must visit place near the base of the hill is Dadasaheb Phalke Smarak. The complex contains a park, meditation spaces, a conference hall and an exhibition center."
"Being in Nasik for more than 35 years, we often used to visit this place.Its a beautiful monument and said to be built by the Pandavas during their exile; but this is not correct. It has nothing to do with them.Once at the top, you can view the panoramic view of Nasik city.Over the years, this place has turned more of a joggers park. In the early morning, you will find many people coming here for exercise and fitness.Unmarried couples should avoid visiting this place at all costs to avoid harassment from local police and unwanted people. Even married couples should avoid visiting this place in search of isolation & privacy. Better come with group or try to remain with a group of people.Incidents like thefts, eve teasing and rapes have been reported. Safety & security should be your top most concern."
These were some of the best and most well preserved buddhist caves in Maharashtra. Prayers are still given in many of the temple complexs here. Infact a huge gathering of buddhist was taking place on the day we were there. There are about 24 caves with a lot of well preserved sculptures and pali enscripts with details of the donation given. It's a long way up though. Be prepared for some climbing.
"One of the fine sightseeing in nasik. Need to cover steps to reach..but accessible, not much tiring. Enjoyable either in morning time or post lunch."
Beautiful temple carved into the stone of the mountain.  Be sure to see it if you're in town!!!!!!!!!
"situated within the city limits, its a nice place for early morning short trek!! You can get the landscape view of the nashik city from the top which is amazing."
This is an interesting site and includes both Hindu and Buddhist artifacts.  Be prepared for a substantial climb on steps to get to the caves.  This was one of the few sites with armed military guards present.  As you climb you'll have several places where you can see all of Nashik and it is much larger than you'd think from city level. This was one of the few places that charged for entry.  Still worth it.
"This place is just before u hit the nasik city if u travelling from Mumbai. A superb place to visit. Involves a climb of 20-30 minutes but absolutely worth it. There are some 18 caves and though not the best preserved, they are quite a sight. Some of the caves you need to remove ur shoes and enter since they are considered to be holy. The view from the top is also worth the climb definitely.. the cool breeze and the Green mountain and the City view is what you see. The caves ate circular and you end up going a full circle from where u get these views. Entry price is only 15rs and definitely worth it.  Must visit"
Lovely caves. Loved them.  Lots to climb - but with many trees can be really nice weather.  Avoided Steps and climbed the mountainside was fun
