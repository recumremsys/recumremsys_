This museum was visited by Charles and Camilla apparently and i can see why it would have been on their itinerary. Stuffed full of interesting artefacts and wonderful ceilings. Lots of religious items.
"The artifacts on display is simply great. Was told that one person has collected all these huge number of artifacts, displayed in three stories of the building. The guide explained in detail about each artifact. Must visit if interested in history of the South India."
Situated right next to our hotel we spent two lovely hour browsing through the museum. So much to see what an amazing collection. The staff where helpful and informative. A delightful stroll in the history of Indian artefacts and other eclectic stuff. The building is also fabulous.
Been here during the noon time. Must visit if you are interested in knowing historical artefacts of south india. 3 floors. Wooden steps. Takes about 45mins for total tour. 100 rs entry fee. Visit this place if you stay at kochi for 1 day.
"The museum is packed with so much to see. U will only find a small path cleared to walk through. It was mix of ancient and few mid times antiques for us to see. Based on crafts & Folk art, there is a variety of artifacts to get mesmerized. The architecture of this authentic Kerala style building keeps it in flavour. The building itself speaks on realistic wooden carpentry of Kerala. A must visit spot learn about the various ancient art forms of Kerala."
"Was not overly impressed with most of the museums we saw in Kochi, but this was a pleasant exception.  The building was jam packed with artifacts that brought much of the history and culture we heard about to life.  The first floor hostess did a marvelous job explaining the…"
"Considering that the Museum's collection is private, my family was astounded by its breadth and depth. It feels like a large museum has been packed with considerable forethought toward display and design into a temple. I can not help but feel that I could have easily spent…"
"It as not a planned visit, kind of popped in to check what it is about. Was delighted to see the Artifacts collection here. Happened to speak to one of the partners of this place-Mrs George if I am not mistaken, she explained their 30 years journey of collating these Antique…"
An amazing collection of relics amassed by one man over a 40 year period. Displayed over 3 floors. Not too crowded.
"It is so fascinating,interesting muesum ..One can't miss this if you are interested to know abt art&culture of southern states...Kerala in particular.Staff is v.co.operative,ever ready to clear our queries.what ever we see here are collected by a single person,from last 30 yrs.. Including doors, staircases, Ceilings!!Passion behind this,can be seen."
"My visit here was with family and they are a child friendly place-staff are extremely helpful and nice. Just keep an eye on the kids as there are many small items all over which they could easily reach and grab. The collection displayed was simply amazing, and to learn that it was all from a private collector makes it an even more magical experience. The building itself has fantastic architecture and the beauty of the displayed items is something you would not want to miss. Take your time in viewing the displayed items as they are really unique. Definitely a place worth visiting."
"Was expecting exhibits behind glass and something quite formal...Oh what a surprise. It was like an ""Aladdins cave"" of artefacts all grouped together on 3 floors. Very little was behind glass as it was open to view behind unobtrusive barriers. The staff were friendly and…"
this is such an amazing collection. Full credit to the owners.  Do not miss miss this cultural site. 10/10 for me .... loved the experience
"This museum has comparatively a very expensive entrance fee, but the collection inside is so rich it is quite astonishing. The amassed folk art, the puppets, masks, gods, ceramics, furniture, lamps, altars etc. is speaks for such immense riches of human imagination and the…"
"Highly recommend stopping to have a look. Don’t expect an organised display, however it was fascinating to see the many bits that George had collected during his life.   There are over 20,000 artefacts within the museum and the building itself is an amazing piece of…"
"Instead of waiting at airport, I chose to spend time here. Three story museum, private collection of articles from mostly 18th and 19th century. 100 per person ticket. Appears to be tourists trap."
What an amazing collection of around 25000 artefacts collected over many years by Mr George and his family. Unfortunately Mr George passed away recently but his wife and his son are fully in charge. Set on 3 floors in a beautiful building with amazing ceilings and wooden floors.…
Amazing place with air conditioning. The museum is packed full of wonderful interesting pieces. The display is over three floors with many pieces for sale.  Allow a couple of hours to try to see everything. 
"Great place. Choc a bloc with artefacts, well maintained, very neat and clean. The wooden building itself is extremely interesting. Over priced, but being a private institution maybe required. Worth a visit."
like walking into a garage sale.  not much explained but i was told they were all for sale.  a few display items captured my attention but again no one was available to tell me their stories.  charging inr200 entrance and this encounter felt like an amateurish attempt of a…
"We reached the museus by taxi, but I believe it will be easy to get there by bus or bicycle.  We left the shoes at the entry and there is a free entry and another fee for pictures.  Beautiful collection inside and staff and very informative.  Beware you will need to climb…"
Amazing to see one man's effort in conserving the heritage. I would recommend to add it in a Kochi trip. The four storied building itself is quire impressive. Do not miss the ceiling at the top floor. Only wish they could allow free entry of cameras.
"Packed full of exhibits in a building made with with wonderful ceilings from long demolished houses, the highlight was the explanation by the curators. Ria was so knowledgeable in good English that the culture came alive."
Privately owned. All tour operators want to take you there as they get commissions. Save yourself the effort 
An enormous private collection of Indian and local artefacts displayed over several floors. Take your time as there is so much to see. No inside photography allowed.
"Don't expect a typical museum. There are cupboards of coins and palm frond texts that seem like a display of curios in a home, but at the same time, there are larger pieces with more information than some government museums provide. The design of the home built exclusively to…"
"Every visitor to Kochi or Fort Kochi should visit this Museum. Take your time! The building, a beauty in itself, is loaded with the most interesting pieces of art. The passion of the man who put this art collection together is noticeable allover. I am glad I read about him upon leaving. It explained the uniqueness of it all!"
"Just outside Fort Kochi, is this private collection of a family. Founded by George Thaliath and his wife Annie George, this museum has an unbelievable collection of artefacts and paintings from various parts of Kerala. George is no more but his wife and young son Jacob manages…"
"It was amazing to be in a museum loaded with artefacts and relics many many centuries old.Due to the vast collection, space appears overloaded,needs patient walk,and every step will offer atleast 5-10 artefacts to see,read and experience.   Saw a pair of metal Boomerangs from…"
Was really interesting and varied.  So much to see. Think entrance fee was 200 rupees.  Have to oay to use camera.  On 4th floor there is a little cafe where a lovely lady made me a cup of tea.  Some items available to buy
A very good collection of 5000+ artefacts from various places of south India including my native Chettinad. One family of antique collectors preserving so many artefacts is simply amazing and hats off to Mr. George and his family. I had a short interaction with his son Mr.Jacob George and understood their passion to bring back tradition and preserving our culture. I think government should provide financial aid for such noble cause. Let's bring back our tradition.
"Several floors full of exhibits and friendly staff happy to explain every piece. Come with  lot of time, there is much to see."
it is a small museum of the king who lived and a must see place. shows a way of ancient life that too this part of life and how it was difficult
"The museum contains many interesting artefacts and it is placed in a very beautiful building. The staff were very informative and helpful, especially lady called Maria and her colleagues who helped us to organize a taxi. Thank you for your kindness and friendliness."
"Is bigger than it looks. Has 3 floors in total. Privately run museum with lots of antiques . Kudos to the curator for the variety of collection here. Maintained well . Lot of temple pieces, idols, furniture, urns and what not."
