The Mysore Palace is a must see for every visitor to the city. It‚Äôs well maintained and I particularly enjoyed the family portraits. Some of the paintings were originals by Raja Ravi Varma! The whole tour will take approximately 1 hour since only a small portion of the palace is open to public. Try going on a weekday as early as possible to avoid crowd.
Great place to visit with temple nearby on site. Huge building with great architecture.  What luxury for the king to have lived in and green gardens add to splendour. Believe family still live in some part of palace but it's simply beautiful and my second visit in a few years.
"The good part about Mysuru is its simplicity, cleanliness and preservation.The palace is worth visiting. Go around sunset so you can see it in day light and stay back for the light and sound show."
"One must visit and enjoy the beauty of Mysore Palace. I rate this Palace as best in the world and the palace of Glory. Looks stunning when the palace lights are on. The lights are illuminated during weekends, Public holidays and during Navarathri. I am fortunate to be a mysorian who could enjoy it's beauty during different seasons and climatic conditions and looks awesome each time."
"This palace must be seen if you visit Mysore.  I have visited other palaces in Europe and Asia, but this is the best.  Well preserved and maintained.  Get there early due to the large crowds of visitors.  Very exquisite at night with all of the lights!"
"Happened to be there on 1st January. Enjoyed new year eve at the Palace. Wonderful palace, beautiful flower decorations. Must visit during day as well as evening to see the illuminated palace."
"Nice historical place with intricate design and artifacts. There should be a sign board or some literature detailing historic importance etc. BEWARE of touts and pick pocketers. It will take about 1:30-2 hours to see the place , I'll suggest have a meal and then enter as there nothing much inside for refreshments."
"A friend and I visited the Mysore Palace recently, without any expectations or any idea of what the palace looked like in advance. I have travelled A LOT and have seen beautiful architecture all over the world and expected 'just another palace' before we arrived. I have to say, the inside of the palace took my breath away!This building is something very unique and overwhelmingly magical, completely different to anything I'd ever seen before. Do not miss Mysore or this beautiful example of architecture on your trip to India! ‚ù§"
The best attraction while at Mysore... everything is spic and span...well laid out and maintained. Visited during Dushera and New year..üëåüëåüëçüëç
"Came all the way from Bangalore to get to know the palace and it was better than I expected! The palace is just marvelous, even though it was very crowded (as almost everywhere in India) Take your time and visit all the allowed areas, you'll definitely love it"
"Great palace. A must visit. The court area, the ornaments, the thrones, the paintings and the construction itself all worth viewing and appreciating. There was also a beautiful temporary garden set for the winter season. Being school holidays, many school teams were also there, very crowded."
"Worth a a visit for two-three hours. Extensive site. We missed seeing palace lit up which happens during festivals and Sundays. Would like to have seen this.Some very interesting artefacts. Doesn‚Äôt cost very much to enter grounds, but had to pay a little extra to look at private quarters."
Visited Mysore palace with my husband to celebrate our first year wedding anniversary. It is a very beautiful palace with a royal heritage historical background. It is one of the most fanous tourist spot in India. I went there to be the queen and my husband to be the king. It feels like we are also from the royal entity. Must visit place in Mysore. A trip to Mysuru never be completed without visiting the palace.The entry fee is very reasonable. There are some temples in the behind the palace. There is a golden chariot for the Devi Sri Chamundeshwari.
Seeing the Mysuru Palace lit up at night is well worth a visit.  This includes  all the buildings in the courtyard and the gates.  There was also a small band  playing in front of the palace which added to the atmosphere.
"Nice historic place where one would probably like to spend some time and see things. However, the experience is more like buying a ticket and getting pushed along by a moving crowd. Take pictures as you walk and exit with the crowd.I appreciate that it is not advisable to keep entry-rates high as this would deter a large population.I know that the rich and political classes can visit this place at any odd time when the palace is empty due to their political clout. But what about the middle class??I feel the entry-fees can be in three slots. One of them free, one priced moderately and the other priced very high. This would spread the crowd and allow people the choice of paying higher to avoid getting pushed from behind by the crowds. In other words ... if you need a better experience, pay more and subsidise the fees for those who find it difficult to pay."
"Don't miss if in Mysore or near, truly spectacular, and then while in Mysore visit the market. Spices, perfumes etc. and with less hassle than many other Indian markets. We thoroughly enjoyed. A fine place to visit eg from Bangalore."
Historical place. Architecture is excellent. Takes 2 hours . Kitchen wing also eye catching. Portraits of  royal family is awesome. Must visit on weekends or national holidays as the lighting is marvelous
Sorry to see the state it is in.A lot of restoration needed. There in pinakin app but no wifi to listen into the audio guide. Added to no mobile signal inside.This magnificent palace had seen some good days but now it has to be present even better. Lot of broken tiles and platforms.
Huge palace and very famous one. Takes 2-3 hours if you are not in hurry. Is very crowded during weekends. There are some temples in the campus. You cannot enter the palace with chappels or shoes. So keep them at the shoe counter. Ticket price is 50 per head and photography is free.
"Mysore palace, constructed in the ancient fort area, is one of the sought after destination in India and official residence of Wadiyar clan. Existed since 14th century but the current palace was built in early 20th century. Architecturally it amalgamates major Indian styles like Mughal and Rajput along with temples design with Gothic structures. Pink marble domes with shinning brass sits on top of a three storied greyish granite stone structure, is coupled with a Hugh tower. Surrounded by a large garden and three main gates and only the southern gate is used by tourists. Eastern gate is used only for especial occasions. Emblem and coat of arms of Wadiyar dynasty is coupled with ‚ÄòNever Terrified‚Äô motif in Sanskrit. A sculpture of Gajalakshmi surrounded by elephants to indicate the wealth, prosperity and abundance. Several temples were built inside the original fort area. Durbar halls are used during Dashara festivities. The clan is devotee of ‚ÄòChamundi Devi‚Äô and not surprising the palaces faces Chamundi hills.The main audience hall‚Äôs passageway are beautifully decorated with artistic designed roof ceiling(s). At the start of the entrance passageway one can view the figures used during ‚ÄòDashara Festival‚Äô which are adorned by elephants at the entrance. A small courtyard is graced by two ferocious tigers. Many paintings can be found inside the enclosure. The royal wedding hall has walls outlining the royal Dashara festival of 1930‚Äôs in large oil paintings. The hall itself has Belgian glasses and chandeliers along with iron pillars. Massive public durbar hall views all across the main gate and the parade ground.Must visit on Sunday nights to admire the well-lighted palace with thousands of light bulbs gives it a dreamy view? The palace is open from 10am to 5pm."
"I visited the palace and surrounding grounds one Sunday recently - the first weekend after the famous Dasara celebrations. My colleague and I soon realised that our choice of weekend to visit was not ideal. The place was packed with local visitors. In visiting the main part of the palace we found ourselves shuffling among a multitude of families - I was grateful that I am a good heads height taller than the average Indian, thus ensuring some fresh air. Negotiating the narrow stairs to the first floor was a particular challenge, especially in bare feet (you have to leave your shoes at the entrance area). All in all, the grandeur of the palace and surrounding buldings is magnificent. It's true that, close up, you can see that the years have taken their toll and certainly some maintenance is needed. As for the expansive grounds, we took a long, leisurely stroll around, admiring the views and enjoying the balmy warm, sunny weather. It's a pity that we couldn't stay long enough to see the place all lit up with the 100.000 bulbs that adorn the facade. Maybe next time - at a quieter time of the year."
"We travelled to Mysore primarily to see the Mysuru Palace.  We were not disappointed!  All of us in our party commented that it is as beautiful as the Taj Mahal.  The history of the building is well-documented with text and photos through-out the palace.  I highly recommend a trip to Mysore to see the Palace.  Mysore itself has a different ""vibe"" to many Indian cities, and an appeal all its own.  Highly recommended."
"visited this stunning palace with my sister on route to Ooty, last winter, stayed here for like 2-3 hours and took some great shots. Its an amazing place and as per me, the best tourist site in whole India."
"Visited the palace at night when it was lit up - breathtakingly beautiful. I have not seen anything like it in Europe or elsewhere. The interiors are really nice as well. You can imagine how grandiose it looked back in the day. If in mysore, its an absolute must. I would recommend visiting even if you have seen the palaces in rajasthan."
"Mysore Palace is one of the top attractions of Mysuru. We were there to experience the famous light and sound show actually. But we missed it as birth centenary of Maharaja Jaya Chamaraja was celebrated on same day and  the light and sound show was cancelled for that day. The palace is beautiful. It is very well maintained and clean. The big flower garden and the Shweta Baraha Temple right at the entrance surely catch your eyes. The temple represents the typical South Indian temple architecture. Both are very well maintained. An evening walk in the palace lawn will be a memorable experience for everyone.If you want to enter the palace museum, you have to remove your footwear and have to enter the palace barefoot. There are lots of shoe-counter for keeping your shoes, so you don't need to worry. Just take the queue and enjoy the beautiful interior.Inside the palace, royal touches are preserved well. The beautiful wooden doors, the endless corridors, the colourful roof decors, each and everything the maharajas used are well kept and are very very attractive. You don't need to take a guide here as every information regarding each of them are written with. Though it is a crowded place, but don't worry, everything is very systematic here. So, take your time and observe everything, don't hurry. Don't miss the light decoration of the palace at evening."
Get a look at how the kings of Mysore lived. Well preserved and beautiful. Recommend going with a guide because there isn‚Äôt a lot of information on site.
Fabulous building to wander round and enjoyed light and sound show in English on a Friday night. Leave enough time to be able to appreciate all this building has to offer and check the website for days of English speaking light and sound. Be aware you have to leave the grounds for an hour between 6 and 7.
Go to see the lighted palace in the evening. Try to attend the lecture. It‚Äôs really a great spectacle and not expensive.
"This is the official residence of the royal family of Mysore and is surrounded by a large garden - set in the centre of town.  It is a blend of Hindu, Muslim, Rajput and gothic architectural styles.  Expect to see cows wandering through the main concourse during your visit.The interior has some grand columns and paintings all well worth the visit.There are crowds of locals also visiting so expect to be crushed by the sheer volume of people.  Shoes are left outside with a guard for a small fee.On Sunday nights the palace is illuminated, something we had travelled thousands of miles to see......it was not to be, unfotunately some dignitary had died that day and the palace was not lit up !"
Good and worth of visit. Good for photography. Avoid visit on Holidays due to rush. Good place to visit
"Even in the off season, there are quite a few visitors going through the palace but we were still able to feel comfortable and take all of the pictures we desired.  Note that no shoes are allowed but there is an effective system for keeping your shoes safe while you tour (for 2 INR per pair).  The palace itself is very impressive‚Äînot just big, but quite ornate, especially considering that most of the palace is open to the environment.  It‚Äôs an all day trip from Bangalore to see the palace and get back to Bangalore but it‚Äôs a very worthwhile day trip.  Highly recommended."
Great place to visit must go. Be ready to walk. Govt rules are little mess for process for keeping shoes.
Nicely maintainedPalatial beautyCrowded on holidays & weekends. Takes almost 4-5 hrs for full tour.
"History in full glory. Shoes need to be removed so wear accordingly. Avoid holidays as it becomes extremely crowded. And, lighting happens every Sunday from 7 to 7:45 pm. Must see."
Mysore is an ideal stop over for many trips staring from Bangalore ending in southern hills. On one of your trips when you are in Mysore do visit the Royal Palace once in day time and once in the evening. It's a DIY tour but you can hire a guide if you wish. The main Palace is majority about court rooms and assembly halls. The Residential annex is at back side of main palace and displays Royal lifestyle. Both the buildings are to be seen bear foot. Refreshments  washrooms and shopping centred are available on premises.Visit to Main Palace costs  Rs 70 per adult and to Residential annex it takes additional  Rs 45. Footware to be left for Rs 2 per pair.  Tendering exact change is suggested for less hassle.
