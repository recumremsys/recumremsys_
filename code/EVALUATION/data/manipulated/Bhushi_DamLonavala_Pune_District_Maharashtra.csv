This place is situated on the way to Lion point. To enjoy the beauty of this place you must visit only during rainy season. Bhusi dam overflows during rains and forms sort of water fall. You need to park your vehicle on roadside and walk through narrow lane of road side dhabas and small souvenirs shop through uneven stones. Be careful while walking . 10-15 walk through water and mud will take you to Bhusi dam. Sit for some time with your feet dipped in water and enjoy. you may like to carry extra clothes in case you get wet. Avoid visit to this place other then rainy season else you will not be able to appreciate  this place. It is l;located just on the road. During heavy rains water overflows and people from all nearby places visit this place making it huge crowd.
"Ideal time to visit this place is during the monsoon. You reach this place after crossing 2 small knee-deep water patches.  The site is breath-taking!! Keep a change of clothes in hand or nearby.  You will definitely need it when you sit in the water flowing through the steps, coming from the Dam.  The noise of the water is always above the noise of the people enjoying around!  From the top of the steps, you can see the majestic dam. A definite inclusion in the trip to Khandala/Lonavala!!"
"This place is a Unique spot located at the backdrop of bhushi dam wall. Quite popular during monsoons as excess water floods over the dam wall and makes a fun location with water flowing over the steps and giving an amazing experience. But it is not being maintained properly, so its risky compromising safety concerns during heavy rainfalls. Being in limits and not acting oversmart is key to happy & safe enjoyment.Parking might be a bit problem and costly but thats one tough thing to manage here. Also food you will find bit overpriced but thats the only source and season of income for locals and place being such remote one can understand. But its worth to have a hot plate of bhajjiya's/ vadapav with Tea/Coffee or hot bowl of Maggi. Even you can try some local stuff like corn, boiled shenga.Imp TIPS : Try not to go too much in middle, do not forget to carry mobile or wallets/money coverd in plastic and also wear comfortable and tight footwear(As it might get washed away in strong current)"
This is the most visited place during rainy season in lonavala... The most fun and enjoying place ... The people gi there to take a bath outside the dam.. the overflow of water goes via stairs outside.. this gives a beutifull waterflow... Enjoying place....
"Hey guys, this dam is the best to visit during monsoon and winter season. The driveway from Mumbai to Lonavala during rainy season gets very foggy, beautiful and then visiting Bhushi Dam makes it a complete package of fun. Do remember to carry extra pair of clothes..."
"Visited this during December and understand from the rainy day pic that the place is totally different. We could walk up the the stairs (through which normally water gushes down), go to the other side, sit on the banks of the water body etc. It was relaxing and green all around. Probably need to be visited when you have enough water to have fun in water."
"Its a wooden dam constructed on a Bhushi lake. The dam views are pleasant to watch out for. Reaching to the dam gives you feel of little bit tracking. But after reaching at destination its worthy. The stepped spillway is the attraction of the dam. I have visited just after monsoon and still it was humid and sometimes rainy at lonavala. So the atmosphere was pleasant for the visit. Rather than other lakes at Lonavala, visiting  this lake is worthy."
Hugely visited and one of the most popular tourist spot in monsoon. Beware of revellers and avoid visiting the place on weekends during monnsoon as you may find a huge traffic jam and big chaos near the spot
The dam is very famous in the surrounding areas of Mumbai and Pune. It is ideal for water lovers. Ease of access with cheap eating joints makes it preferred picnic spot.
It is ultimate location to enjoy the water fall of Bushy dam in rainy season. Family will really enjoy sitting in gushing water. Take care while going through deep water & slippery rocks. Enjoy Bhutta.
Enjoy rainy seasons with nice weather amid nature. Boon for nature lovers from Pune & Mumbai..on weekends..
"The dam is preferred picnic spot among youngsters. It is very crowded, especially on weekends. Parking space and eating joints are available."
Bhushi dam steps are ultimate. Overflow water coming down from steps are so amazing. Just ensure to visit the place in monsoon. Keep shoes in ur vehicle before going there. better to take slippers of ur own & a plastic cover for keeping mobile although u take slippers on rent.
Always crowded on weekends. Avoid during monsoons because it becomes slippery and you lose the fun of the scenic beauty and the charm of taking bath in summers. Lots of eating joints and paid parking is availabile.
Visited during wrong season. It is a seasonal place. It's like a adventure to reach the spot. Nice spot.
Visited in October but there is no water overflow so not enjoyed much. Best time to visit Bushi dam is in Aug-Sep.
Crowded place in the monsoon and dirty also. enjoy a lot in waterfalls. Nice place to visit. Extremely crowded with so many people coming and parking their cars on the sides of the road and just crowding the place.
The location is good for visit only during rainfalls. Avoid visiting it during dry season as its quite dirty and smells a lot during dry times.
Heard lot about lonavala and bhushi dam...though scenic place has nothing except memories of great rainy season. Little tough for elderly to trek.
Relaxing and refreshing water flow which will make your day . You can spend quality time and will have some memorable moments
This place is hugely overrated. Always crowded in monsoon season. Surrounding is nit clean and it will be difficult to get vehicles parking. Have limited parking place and road side parking cause always a huge jams. When the dam overflows it will be a huge crowd gathers there so it will be total mash and surrounded with many make shifts stalls and hawkersWe even didnâ€™t get down from car and moved ahead to some less crowded place towards lions point
"We enjoyed it. You will have to pass through knee deep water to reach there. There you can view dam , and sit on steps where water flows gently. Get ready to drench in water , and so  dress appropriately. Better to wear slippers and have umbrella in rainy season. Corn/Hot Vadapanv were delicious. Area is bit slippery. Overall, worth a visit."
"Must visit to visitors during monsoon period especially in Late July, August and September. Flowing water over the steps is the real beauty of the dam. Never miss an opportunity to visit."
"It is a big fraud , showing pictures of Bhushi Dam with water where people can enjoy themselves . Tourists are unaware and anticipate by seeing photographs . Went today 30/9/2018 . there is no water and u just waste your time. Whoever is managing the place should inform the public that there is nothing to see and do there is no water as well.Drop this from your itinerary and better spend time in hotel if nothing else to do."
Visit during rainy season. It's great if you love playing in water... Try and reach the dam early around 930am. The crowd is less during early hours which would allow uninterrupted fun.There is a waterfall as well for which you have to climb the dam stairs to the top and then follow the track beyond. The path which goes from the parking ground is not advisable. This is because there is a lot of glass litter there and sharp fragments. If you are wearing footwear with thin sole then it can easily penetrate the  material. Rest the choice is yours.There's Sunil's wax museum nearby and it's worth visiting.
This is a fun activity involving some climbing and some more water fun. They have made few steps on which the dam water overflows especially during monsoons. It is highly recommended for every Lonavala visitor . Be careful as water can be dangerous if not respected. On Fridays and weekends it will become heavily crowded like the day I visited (you can observe in photos.Be careful and all the best
"The beauty of the bushi dam, is only when it rains heavily. Go in groups and a shower. Most interesting is that you get a free fish massage here."
Worth going only in rainy season. Be careful with the water flow. Many places to eat around and park vehicle. Can visit during rainy season.
we loved the water flowing on steps and get wet. it was very nice experience to have. there is Bhushi dam above and water flows from it on steps. take bath and get wet. be careful of slippery stones.
Had to walk through knee deep waters across sort of 2 mini lakes with rocky bed which get formed during the rainy season. The water flow across the steps of the dam was quite forceful and it was difficult to keep standing amidst the flow.The dam reservoir was full to the brim because of heavy rains and it was a pleasant view at the top of the dam.
The place attracts tourists but the maintenance is poor. so many dirty water pools in the way to dam. The premises is not maintained and is with foul smell. The dam water was oozing out slowly since there was no rains when we went. Recommend not to spend more than 15min. Water fall much better can be felt in Mahabaleshwar trip.
don't just sit near the steps but trek further and you can experience the waterfalls.Never go barefoot because there is moss which makes the stones slippery and also there are pieces of glass everywhere from the broken bottles thrown by drunkards . Not recommended for seniors as they may find it tiring.
"Dam is bice, but the way to the dam and place nearby is stinky. U can see the dam from its main wall which is fenced, while there are places on its side where fence is broken, so u can go to water. Beware it may be steep so watch ur steps."
"Nice place, water Overflowing from Dam and flowing over the steps of stone create beautiful atmosphere, walk in water or bathe in the same. Enjoy hot corns and vadapav. Slightly downward the steps, small pools of water are there you can have fun or bathe there. Do get yourself clicked, nice photos."
"Place for monsoon only. This place offers lots in monsoon, but i visited it in wrong month. Located in lonavala, it is a place surrounded by nature and offers a small lake that gets over filled in monsoon and offers a place of fund and excitement."
