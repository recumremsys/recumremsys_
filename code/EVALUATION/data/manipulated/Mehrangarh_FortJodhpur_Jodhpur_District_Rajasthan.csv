Mehrangarh Fort is special. Last visited 14 years ago and lot of places are now out of bound for visitors. Enjoyed my visit as expected.
A must visit place in Jodhpur. Try to keep a day separately to visit this magnificent fort along with Jaswant Thada.
This fort is the epicentre of Jodhpur city. Prefect place to stroll and enjoy your day in winters. Great rajput architecture and zip line for adventure makes this an excellent spot. Enjoy
"Mehrangarh is the pride of place in Jodhpur because of its splendid architecture and the diverse history associated with it.  Mehrangarh fort was built by Rao Jodha in the year 1459. The fort is spread over an area of 5 km and is built on 125 m high hill in the outskirts of Jodhpur city. It is considered as one of the most formidable and magnificent forts of Rajasthan,There are seven gates.  These 7 gates are made by different rulers over the time to represent the valor over their enemies .The main palaces located in the Mehrangarh Fort are Moti Mahal, Phool Mahal, Sheesh Mahal, Zenana Dude, Takht Vilas and Jhanki Mahal. There are also two temples located inside the fort - Chamundi Devi Mandir and Nagnechiaji Mandir, dedicated to Goddess Durga and the Kuldevi respectively.There is also a museum within the Mehrangarh fort, which exhibits a rich collection of palanquins, musical instruments, royal cradles, costumes, arms, furniture and paintings.One can see the panoramic view of the Jodhpur city from this fort . 2 hours is required to visit this fort completely .  It is always recommended to take the guided tour. Entry time is 9AM to 5 PM all 7 days . Small cafe is there inside the fort and memorabilia are sold , but costly . Advised to wear comfortable light dress and comfortable walking shoe . Carry bottle of water .    Though Jodhpur is called Blue City , I had found very little tinge of blue from the top of the fort . Another attraction near this fort is flying fox zip lining ."
"Jodhpur is a most interesting city, known as the Blue City – you can appreciate that especially in the late afternoon from the top of the expansive famous Mehrangarh Fort. This is a must to visit – we took the audio tour which leads you around the major buildings of this Fort which goes back to the mid-1400s. It is divided into a number of stages which are well marked and numbered so that the self-guided tour works very well. There are a number of museum area with beautifully preserved and displayed features – weapons, carriages, and clothing. You certainly get a feeling of what life was like in this part of India over the centuries. There are plenty of viewing areas to photograph the fort and the views over Jodhpur. Allow at least 2 hours. There is a very good souvenir shop with books and items of clothing and also a fine café to rest. The views from the roof gardens and main restaurant at sunset are amazing and well worth booking a meal. As darkness falls the Fort is progressively lit and beautifully displayed.…"
The best visited place in Jodhpur. Fort with audio guide. Audio guide in multiple languages helps a lot and must be used. Entry fee 120 . 60 for senior citizen. Audio guide RS 120. There is lift for RS 50 for each way. Otherwise there is a huge slope across first 4 Gates of fort. Very nice place. Few paintings by British painter are excellent. Typical rajsthani culture and history at display. There is a souvenir shop at the end. Find out at least 120 minutes for this fort. Too good. Charges and timings in attached photos
Very interesting and big fort. Like other forts you can know the life of the rulers. Do not miss the ZIP line activity. The charge approx. 2k for 6 lines and takes around 1 to 1.5 hours.
Should watch as this is one of the main spots in Jodhpur.  Take lift from down otherwise u will get tired.
"Wow, it is the premiere fort in all of India in my opinion.  I have visited the four times in the last 25 years and I am still impressed.  Don’t miss the classical Indian music that is free towards the end of the tour. It was excellent. "
The fort has a history that is interesting. The fort is also preserved well. Overlooks the blue city and give a panoramic view. The original paintings are interesting.
Beautiful fort with a lot to see. Go with ample time. The fort has beautiful intricacies and excellent architectures. 
A must visit spot in Jodhpur. Jaw dropping architecture. Need to walk quite a bit. Lift facility is available but they charge for it. The sound of the nagara creates a fantastic atmosphere.
Undoubtedly this is the best Fort in India. Huge and beautiful. And so very well maintained. One can easily spend 3-4 hrs here. The climb is little tiring for the elderly though you can chose to take lift going up. Pick an audio guide to get insights into the various aspects.
Spectacular fort over Jodphur.  Audio guide interesting and well paced.  Mix of indoor and outdoor locations.  Well maintained. 
"The fort would be worth visiting for a tourist! Dive into the history of Jodhpur by visiting it! The view from the top is amazing! Try spotting the blue houses!Tip- Use the elevator to climb up and come down by foot,won't be tiring!"
"Its an imposing fort visible from far distances and  one of the largest forts in India, it undoubtedly a must visit. A visit to the fort will make you realize the foresight and the attention to detail that was envisaged even during those times. Built by Rao Jodha in the 1400's  the fort is located some 400 feet above the city and is enclosed by thick walls. Inside the fort  there are several palaces known for their intricate carvings and expansive courtyards. The museum inside the fort is fully stocked with items used by the royals of that era and is definitely not to be missed. Also inside the fort are several brilliantly crafted and decorated palaces which include include  Moti Mahal (Pearl Palace), Phool Mahal (Flower Palace), Sheesha Mahal (Mirror Palace) etc. There are galleries displaying a rare collection of armour from every period in Jodhpur, Palquins, Paintings, Turbans and a lot more. Also donning the top are cannons which protected the fort during times of war.What is amazing is the view that one witnesses from the top of the fort. You can see the entire city from up there and also the Umed Palace across the town. Sunsets are beautiful so be there during that period; its amazing.There are some shops selling souveriers and other local stuff and cafeteria inside the fort if you are in for it. There is a lot of distance to be covered walking once you are inside so keep yourself liquidated and make sure you go in with a lot of time you sure will need it."
"We have been to amber fort, red fort and agra fort and personally this one is my favourite . This never ending walk up to the castle and its grounds can get quite tiring in the heat of sun city .The battlements and ornate design make this piece of architecture artistically Marwar. Offering great views of the Blue City, lovers of India should not miss it."
So well maintained place. A tour of the place shows the royalty of the maharajas. Had a complete tour of th fort accompanied by my guide Kishen Singh who gave me adequate information.A must visit to this place if you are in jodhpur.
This is a beautiful old fort that could be viewed from our hotel. Takes a while to wander around even catching the lift up but definitely worth a visit. Of all the forts we visited in last 8 days this is my favourite. Up the top you get a great view of the blue city. 
"I will not go to the historical part of this magnificent structure as plenty is available about the fort in the web world. One must visit the fort to appreciate its sheer grandeur & architectural splendour. Built in the year 1459, the three tier entrance gates of fort were designed with sharp 90 degree short turns to make it impregnable.The museum is well maintained for the visitors to appreciate glory of the bygone era. The fort is illuminated at night till 9pm."
"Overlooking Jodhpur, this Fort is a monumental, impressive structure. Expansive and magnificent, this was one of the more impressive Forts I’ve seen in India, surpasses, perhaps, by only the Fort in Agra."
"Loved the experience. Good view of the Blue City. It is Huge and well maintained. Best time to visit is between October to February. Knowing its history is interesting. The Museum is great. Gift shop has variety of collections to keep. Cafeteria. You can spend half a day here, so arriving here by afternoon would be better. Guided tour was helpful. Mr. Lobo guided us through, without missing any important things. Nicely planned. He explained well about the history and have very good knowledge about this place."
"This is one of the must visit in Jodhpur if you like historical structures. Entry is chargeable. Parking is available. It is a big impressive palace of Marwar royalty which displays their history and lifestyle in different sections like palanquins, weapons,dresses, etc. From the top, the blue  city can be seen. Cafeteria,shop,toilets, etc.everything is there inside the fort. U cn also do zipline. There is an escalator to take guests to display area, but wld suggest walking instead to get a feel and soak in the grandeur. Hire a guide or audio guide or read the boards about various displays. Could be very crowded on holidays. Infact, royals are smart enough to make money out of such palaces by displaying their wealth and lifestyle to make more wealth. Need around 3 hours to see the whole palace. Must visit in Jodhpur."
"Wonderful palace to explore, has one temple and the roof has lot of canons with a beautiful view of blue city. Do visit the fort and Jaswant thada nearby. One can also experience local musicians with their instrument at the entrance along with shops selling beautiful Rajasthani Artifact."
"I find both the Amber Fort in Jaipur and this palace equally impressive but for different reasons. Whilst the Amber Fort is large, in all proportions, this palace has smaller proportioned living/entertaining areas but the sheer size and height of the walls and it’s layout really are something else.Built in 1459 it’s built on a 125m high hill and uses every bit of its position to dominate the landscape. If possible I’d suggest that you walk up through the series of gates to gain access to the main part of the complex but for those who might find this something of a challenge there is a lift (for an extra charge).It’s an impressive Rajasthan structure but the rooms are surprisingly ‘human sized’. (Curious Fact: Swings were an entertainment for those in power.)The shop there is also worth a visit and represents pretty good value (containing all sorts of offerings from Jodhpur Flying polo shirts at IRS1300 to Christmas decorations at IRS250). However the painter near the cash desk has an unusual take on salesmanship demanding why you aren’t buying his works of art whilst you queue up to pay.Overall a great place to visit. Allow plenty of time."
It is a great fort. Looks imposing from all side. Too crowded during the early time and closing time. You may visit the same during the lunch time where the queue for the elevator is less. Elevator costs Rs. 50 per person. It is only for going up. 
Easily one of the best forts in country. Very well maintained. But going there without guide is criminal. Lighting in night is breathtaking. Sitting in terrace restaurant and enjoying Rajasthani hospitality was unique experience.
Amazing fort and beautifully maintained by the current Maharajah of Jodhpur. Take your time and notice the exquisite detail in the stonework and other artefacts.
"The Fort is a ""must see"". Fantastic. Massive. Majestic. There is an elevator which is a blessing for senior citizens.  The upper floors in the Palace are not to be missed as they have rooms which are amazingly beautiful. Recommend to avail a guide. Rates are fixed and receipts…"
The fort is free and worth the visit. The museum has a small charge and was very interesting. There are many rooms of the maharaja completely furnished. This is the best palace museum we have visited in India (of many). Money and taste have been deployed well. There is a massive museum shop with beautiful reproductions available. An extension of the museum for the jewellery. Access the fort through the main entrance a 300m walk up steps from below for great views. But leave by the back entrance which allows you to stroll in the gardens and pause for a cold beer and lunch in the fort before the gate. The path is cordoned off with a guard. Say you're  going to the restaurant and he'll wave you through. It's also the way to the zip wire run by flying fox. An amazing experience if 1.4km zip wire in six sections across battlements and lakes. Safe and well run.
"Founded in 1459AD the Fort is breathtakingly stunning. It houses a museum, Arms, Costumes, Paintings, Elephant Howda’s, Palanquins, and the most stunning architecture from the medieval period of Indian history. 600 rupees entry, includes audio guide. If visiting Jodhpur this is…"
Had been here with family n friends and really happy to spend my time exploring this beautiful and huge architectural historical fort. It is spread in a huge area and one needs atleat 3-4 hours to completely and deeply seeing the fort. the Architecture is marvellous and well…
"The Blue City is all about this fort! It’s on top of the city so wherever you staying, whether in the heart of the city or farther away in Umaid Bhawan Palace, you get to see the fort.  Getting to it, it’s better to reach by a car or a tuk tuk rather than walking as it’s a bit…"
I never tire of visiting Forts in India and this one was superb - the perfect view down into the old city (and the blue that gives Jodhpur its title of the Blue City).  There was so much to see with every section getting more and more Wow!  Don't miss this when you are in Jodhpur!
"The fort was amazing and really historical. One of the best views of the Blue City. I really enjoyed it and gave a great scope of the city. When I was walking down, I met a really nice guide by name of Ritesh. He just started guiding and is trying to gain experience. He showed me the local areas that I saw from the fort but now I was able to see them up close. Took great photos and was a good way to see the area around the fort! A very fair rate was well. The fort was amazing, one of the best things on my trip. And if you’re interested in a guide for the local parts of the blue city, I can recommend Ritesh. His phone number/whats app is +91 7976202392"
