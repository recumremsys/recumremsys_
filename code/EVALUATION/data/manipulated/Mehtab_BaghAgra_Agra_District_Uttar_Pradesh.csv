Viewing the Taj Mahal at sunset from across the river provides a different sensation than viewing it from the actual site. There is a mystical sense of peace and majesty- and quiet... This definitely gives you a full circle experience of the Taj Mahal - don’t miss it!
Seeing the Taj Mahal from here was so amazing as you can see the truth symmetry. Parts of the garden are maintained but the original site is kept as is.  Very peaceful.
Well worth visiting to get a different view of the Taj Mahal in a more relaxed atmosphere. Recommend going for sunrise or sunset.
A lesser known spot to quietly contemplate the majestic site of the Taj Mahal. Follow the road past the fort and find a haven of peace away from the trippers and hustlers.It is almost the extended gardens but across the other side of the river which depending on the season can give a different perspective.
"Translating to moonlight garden, Mehtab Bagh is the perfect spot for admiring the beauty of the Taj Mahal. Built by Babur, it is a square garden that was once resplendent with pools, fountains and trees. Today, it makes for a recreational tourist spot. A Mughal garden, it is perfectly aligned with the Taj Mahal along the Yamuna River and was described by Shah Jahan as the ideal spot for viewing the Taj Mahal.Due to frequent floods and extraction of building material by the villagers, the garden lay in ruins by the ‘90s. However, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) intervened and started work to restore the garden to its original state. They even made sure that the plants used in Mehtab Bagh were ones that were originally a part of Mughal gardens. These included guava, Ashoka, jamun, neem, hibiscus, etc. There were four sandstone towers too in the garden at its four corners, however, only one remains now. During the restoration, other structures were added to Mehtab Bagh that were not originally a part of it. Some of these include a statue of BR Ambedkar holding the constitution of India, a temple and nurseries. Visit Mehtab Bagh between 6 am to 7 pm, it is open on all days of the week."
"is an alternative place to enjoy the beauty of the Taj Mahal from the other side. We can enjoy the beauty of the Taj Mahal from the edge of the Yamuna river. although the river is not drained, the bird's activities provide an amazing view especially when the sun sets. Entrance tickets are also subject to cameras and camera tripods are prohibited"
The only reason to visit this location is for the spectacular view of the Taj across the river. Be prepared to climb a small stone wall to get the best pictures.
Try visiting this beautiful place. This is near to the Taj Mahal and gives you complete view of the monument without getting into the crowd.  Also if the monument is officially closed you can get to see it from here
"The gardens are nothing to remember but the view on the Taj from this side of the river  is worth the small detour, especially if you have your own mean of transportation as you can’t really go there easily. Given that they ask for an entrance fee, they could finish the small platform over the river....  but this is apparently not condidered a priority. Strange. In summary, not essential but nice to do if you have the time"
Visited here on our trip to Agra after already visiting the Taj Mahal in the early morning.   Set across the river from the Taj it gives you an alternative view of the building and without the massive crowds.  The garden itself was really quiet and peaceful when we visited and we enjoyed uninterrupted views of the rear of the Taj.  I think that the normal entrance fee for foreigners is about 400 rupees but as we visited on World Heritage Day it was free to get in.  I would have happily have paid tho.
Have to pay 300 rupis to see the same of what you see in the view point just next to the garden for 200 rupis. In the moment of sunset the security man came to tell us to leave the garden...
This is what you do at sunset on day before you visit the Taj. See it from across the river. Well recommended. Get there around 4.30-5pm. It costs 200 rupees to enter. Great views of Taj Mahal
"This is the rear view of the taj garden is across the river yamuna , some excavation sites along with a garden with lovely flowers . If you want to take pictures without having people walking into your frame it is advisable to come at dusk or dawn to get some mesmerizing views of the Taj Mahal with reflected sunlight splitting into the visual spectrum. This was the place where Yanni's music concert was held with the Taj lit in the backdrop during the night. Definitely worth a visit as this place makes you realize the massiveness and beauty of this monument remains flawless and unchanged from every angle. Mind you all these pics have been taken from an iphone 7 only not any professional or DSLR camera"
Went here to just see the backside of the Taj Mahal.  If you like to take pictures this is a great place as the view of the Taj is stunning.  Would recommend to just see the backside of the Taj Mahal.
"From what the guide told me, someday the government will build a viewing platform for the Taj here.  When they do, this will be a must-see stop.  However, until then it's really nothing more than a grove of trees with a decent view.  Don't get your hopes up.  Supposedly this is where they were going to build Shah Jahan's tomb--an equal to the Taj across the river.  However that never happened.  Instead it's a park area and not nearly as well tended as the gardens of the Taj or Agra Fort."
Overpriced. For just a view on the Taj Mahal over the river you have to pay an entryfee of Inr 300 per person. The so called garden is 't worth the money. People only visite this garden for a distant glance at the famous tombe.
Try to go during sunset. The photos you will take of Taj Mahal would by magnificent. 200 INR for the entrance. Nothing to see or do except the view.
This is a wonderful place to visit in the evening. Go at about 4pm to view the Black mausoleum and see the Taj Mahal at sunset when it changes to a pink hue. The gardens are great with an orchard and well worth looking about. There is a long wall where you sit and view the Taj Mahal. You can also view the remains of the early mausoleum. Good bird life and see bullocks being led to the river Yamon. Pretty expensive for what it is as a foreigner. Cheap for Indians.
"According to our guide, this was the site where the Emperor planned to build a matching black Taj as his own tomb, complementing the white Taj built for is wife.  He never got to build it.  The site is a garden area (not very ornate by Western standards), just across the river from the Taj Mahal.  Worth a visit but you will not need to stay long unless you simply want to relax in the gardens."
"Go for the garden, stay for the view. This is the spot where Shah Jahan wanted to build a Black Taj Mahal, as his own mausoleum. Now it has been converted to a garden with a low priced ticket, go just before the sunset to get stunning views of the Taj."
"The gardens themselves are nothing special but 100% worth it for the amazing view of the Taj. Now costs 300 rupees for foreigners (250 if you get online ticket). Make sure you arrive in plenty of time for sunset (around 4pm) to get a front row seat on the wall and the best photos. You can’t watch the full sunset as the gardens close at 5pm and the guards come round and kick you out, but still worth it nonetheless."
"Went here the night before we went to see the Taj Mahal just to get our fist glimpses of it. What views we got and really whetted our appetite for going the next day.The gardens themselves were pretty spectacular and all in all can highly recommend an hour or so here prior to visiting the Taj Mahal, if you have time..."
"Worth a visit any time of day for the spectacular views of the Taj Mahal as well as a quiet walk in calm gardens with very few people to bother you. Described as the ""Backsid"" of the Taj Mahal, the gardens are said to contain the foundations of the planned Black Taj Mahal Intended to be the mausoleum for Shah Jahan, creator of the white Taj Mahal for his wife, the black Taj Mahal never made it much past the foundation state it is in now due to Shah Jahan being overthrown and imprisoned by his evil son Aurangzeb. We went on a grey but warm day with occasional flurries of rain but it filled us with wonder again after spending yesterday on the other side of the river at the white Taj Mahal. If you want to visit but hate crowds go to the ""Backside"" of the Taj Mahal! If you get there early morning or late afternoon for sunrise or sunset it is said to be even more spectacular."
"Offers good views of the Taj Mahal, but there isn’t much to do here. Recommend going here in the evening. Tip - sale of tickets stops 30 minutes before sunset. And this varies based on whether it’s summer or winters so be careful of the timings."
Fantastic view of the Taj. Reaching here is slightly a challenge. Normally this a place to be visited during sun set. That gives a good orange colour shade of sun on the Taj. Take a cab on return basis or book the cab (Ola)  immediately after sun set as very few cabs in this area.
Visited this garden which has great views of the Taj from across the river. I interesting as well to see the foundations of the unfinished Black Taj. Well worth the trip.
"Located on the opposite side of the river, Mehtab Bagh or Moonight Garden is an ideal place to see the sunset at the Taj Mahal. There are also architectural ruins of a building originally designed to complement the Taj Mahal, but was never completed. The gardens themselves aren’t especially interesting."
This place is great to see the Taj at Sunset. Be aware to check the time of Sunset because the entrance closes about 1h prior to. It is not crowded and does offer great views. Best time to go is after the rainy season as the Taj then reflect into the river along with the sunset. Obviously we went during the dry season ie grass instead of reflection
Gives a nice view of Taj mahal from other side. Picturesque. Prominent for Sun set and Moonlight views. There was also a story that Shahjahan tried to build Black Taj Mahal after completion of the Taj and was over thrown by his son Aurangzeb. The remains of the structures can be seen in the moon garden. This site needs maintenance and bit of security.
"Not to be missed at all. Make sure you visit Mehtab Bagh at sunrise to have that serene view of the Taj. Especially the first time you come in direct line of sight with massive monument, its so surreal! No crowd here, so you'll have that silent morning taking in the view of the Taj, with river Yamuna at the forefront."
The only nice thing about this place is a hazy picture across the Taj. The price is 300 IR for foreigners. Security at the gate are very rude. They wouldn't let us bring in a cold drink that we bought at the gate. But they let Indians carry in water bottles and they just throw the bottles in the garden. When we left we picked up 10 empty bottles and left them with security. The policy seems to be take the foreigners for as much money as possible. They have no respect for us and little respect for their own country. Don't waste your money here!
This was a peaceful walk in the park amongst the trees just before sunset. Saw women balancing and carrying bowls of hand mixed cement on their heads for restoration work in the area. Saw ladies with baskets on their heads who had just finished weeding the park in their colourful sari's. Children and families were enjoying picnics in the park. It was nice to enjoy the serenity of the park rather than the streets of Agra.
"It's a very good place to see the Taj Mahal but you have to pay 300Rs. Would be better if they take care of it. Apparently, was an amazing garden until some Indian people start to take part of the ruins to build other things. Looks like now they have started to plant new trees. Hopefully in a few years will look beutiful"
A good place to view Taj from. Has a lot of good locations to click  your pics. Had visited Agra many times but view from this Garden is something different and for  sure is one to be cherished
"Great spot for viewing the Taj Mahal. Does not cost anything which is great on the pocket. Nice little park area with plenty of grass to picnic on. Heavy security presence so you feel secure. No bathrooms, so go before you get there.  Very busy at sunset. Highly recommend! We visited the evening before our Taj Mahal tour."
