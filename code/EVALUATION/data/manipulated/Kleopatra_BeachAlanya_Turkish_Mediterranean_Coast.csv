This is a beautiful place too visit.The sand is golden and we went at a nice time and got to walk along the beach. Think it's the best ever beach I've ever been too
Stayed Alanya in October. Weather still over 30 c.Went beach every afternoon. We chose beach 3 because it was closest to hotel.Didnt bother renting a sun lounger .Just put a towel on the sand. You can get right down to the sea with a towel.Sun beds are set well back.Great location. Very clean.Just a warning as you get into the water for about 10 foot sea has smooth very slippery rocks.If your not expecting it you will take a fall.Once you clear the rocks it goes deep quickly. Same problem getting out very slippery. But its a great beach. Highly recommended. We spent every afternoon at kleopatra beach.
"Excellent beach, gorgeous sunsets. Really well kept and clean. Visited in December and water temperatures were lovely and not at all crowded. Would like to go back when not working to really enjoy it."
We loved this beach as it was part of Cooks Corner hotel so the access to it was easy. Lots to see while you are lay on your sun bed. At one point seven ships must of been on the water. Paragliding going on above . Lots of families out for the day This beach had a lovely relaxed atmosphere and no lucky lucky men are allowed so you can relax in peace This beach is perfect to watch the sunset
"Love this beach!!! Been here so many times, only problem is there’s lots of pebbles, and you can’t really walk with out something on your feet But a really nice and relaxing"
"the beach here is gorgeous but beware as you walk into the sea as there are shelves of sand then deep then shallow again. parts of this beach can get quite rough waves, but for me it just added to the enjoyment of the sea. sit close to a bar if you want waiter service. 30 Turkish lira for 2 sunbed and 1 umbrella."
"There is good sea on Kleopatra Beach. Not good for children, because it is deeply in two steps. Be attention, there is shark rocks! You can go to Šatal kale (castle), it is very nice and cheap by taxi."
"Visited this stunning beach a few days ago and it was lovely, one of the cleanest beaches I’ve been on! The sea was a nice temperature and I’d highly recommend a day on the beach as lots of bars and restaurants close by!"
Beautiful beach with castle views . Crystal clear waters with great surf waves. Watch the pirate boats come round into the bay.
"Hot sand. Remember shoes. Beautiful water. Soft sand in the water. My daughter and I rented two sun chair. We Lay at nr 16. Super service and there is toilet and a place to wash sea salt of your body. You can buy icecreame, Coffee, soft drinks. And if you stay at Kleopatra beach hotel you have free wifi. Not the fastest one."
Perfect beach for holiday. It was the best part of my holiday. Had a great time. Alanya is amazing place. The right place for holiday
Nice beach but to much big stones under water. Tried one time just for swim and go back :D So could be better.
Visited this beach on the 3rd of June at around 2pm and couldn’t find a single sun bed or even a little space to sit down as it was so overcrowded! Only way to get a spot here is to come as early as possible or book your spot via your hotel. Apart from that the beach and it’s surroundings are absolutely beautiful and it has some real nice bars and restaurants. If your visiting or staying in the area of Alanya then visiting Kleopatra beach is a must but do remember to try arriving as early as possible to avoid any disappointments.
"I loved everything about this wonderful place : the landscape consisting of green mountains that surround all Alanya, the palms which gave the exotic vibe, the Teleferik lifting people to castle just by the side of the beach. Being in the salty warm water made me feel as if I'm not only having the best holiday but also having a little therapeutic session because I could hear my neck and joints cracking. The sunbeds and umbrellas are a must because the sand is as hot as lava especially in the middle of the day. There are showers and changing cabins, toilets and bars so that every wish is catered. Probably one of the best beaches there are."
Visited the beach every day for a week - always clean and tidy but sea was abit rough in occasion. Easily accessed and made easier by the numbers on the prom
There is no sand on this beach and you need to pay for sun beds. Was terrible for children I'd never return. Very busy also.
Make sure to go at beach no.1 because the water there is more clear than at the other beaches. It gets deeps soon so watch out. Other than that one of the cleanest beaches Ive been
Very beautiful and clean sandy beach. I had a good time with good food and drinks. Def. come back again.
"Very nice beach with alot of watersports. Parachuting, bananaboat and so on. Good food and very nice staff. Especially on ""beach 14"". But extremely hot in the sand so beachshoes is highly recomended. Also for going into the water. No fine sand and Big rocks when going into the water"
"Great views and very clean water. I think the best spot is Alaaddin Beach .. the beds are comfortable and cheapest on the beach and of you're eating of drinking then they are free. Not to mention you can charge your phone and rinse off from a nice beach shower.  It's the part of the beach where the beds are yellow.  The Beach Boys there that will look after you are Sado and Serkan. Great guys, that really enjoy their jobs and taking care of guests.  It's an excellent walking beach as well. Enjoy your holiday"
"The beach was a nice spot to catch the sun. We paid around 20 lira a day to hire a couple of sun loungers from a lovely chap called Hassan. He would stop by every now and again asking if we needed any drinks or some shade which was nice. The beach itself is extremely crowded and you can almost always hear somebody’s music blaring from somewhere so it wasn’t the most relaxing beach I’ve ever been to! The sand gets unbelievably hot in the middle of the day so be aware of this. The sea is stunning here. Cristal clear and so warm! Some days it was beautifully calm and flat and others it was huge, crashing waves which made for a lot of fun. Take inflatables to the beach, it’s fun! Parking near by and easily accessible."
"Wonderful beach!  Clear, refreshing water, spectacular view, waves not too big, sand ranges from fine to course to literally bigger pebbles (closer to the mountain).  Did some snorkeling, not much to see for underwater adventures! Walked up and down this beach enjoying the perfect temperature water and sunshine.  Also walked the sidewalk near the beach. Both are awesome.  During the day there are beach volleyball courts, basketball courts, tennis courts and of course nearer the mountain the gondola taking you up to the Castle!  When laying on the beach enjoying the sun, a wonderful breeze carries off the water making tanning enjoyable (I do not particularly like just laying in the sun - but the breeze was fantastic making it very relaxing, just make sure to wear sunscreen and have a timer so you don't burn!  I literally dozed off it was so relaxing). The mountains on either side frame the ocean view, with Gulets (ships) of all sizes travelling through the bay regularly that are quite interesting in their design. I've been to beaches in Dominican, Mexico, Belize, and this ranks as one of the best in my opinion!"
Extremely lovely part of the beach. Friendly attentive bar/beach staff. Loved that they played reggae. Loved the beds to sunbath on even though we didn't use one. Beach 22 check it out you won't be disappointed...
Very nice beach with quite clear warm water (depends on weather). Mix of sand and gravel. Not to big. Little bit crowdy at high season.
It's so beautiful.  Make sure you be there when the sun goes down. The beach is surrounded with beautiful parks and nice cafes.
Visited cleopatara beach whilst in alanya. Lovely sandy beach with cafes and restaurants dotted along it. Definitely worth a visit sunbed hire very reasonable
"Kleopatra Beach has different sections - some with cliff as ground, others the whitest sand. Depends on who you are, and what you preferences are (mine’s sand), but both are options. Along the beach are small restaurants, some better than others, and at a reasonable price-point. Note that most beachchairs belong to the hotels along the city, so you either have to buy from the restaurant located close by, or stay at either hotel."
Arrived for Easter break with friends across road from our hotel. Very clean. Beach bars not open yet. Even loungers just arrived. Lots of hotel bars and facilities open to use. Highly recommend this beach. Walking along leads to many locations in area. Lovely views. Sea still cool. Can’t wait to return.
Don’t miss the opportunity to go here when in alanya . Great beach and good facilities. Enjoy it and let’s not forget the weather and very cheap places to eat
"My son and I had an amazing time in Alanya, we had a great stay at the Kleopatra Atlas Hotel, the rooms where very clean and comfortable. The staff where very nice and helpful the food was ok but we were out of season so the hotel was quiet, so I felt the breakfast was quite poor for choice and evening meals were repetitive. I have visited Alanya a number of times and always have time to go have my hair done when I have time to spare and have had no complaints in fact always say how the hairdressers seem to give me a better cut. BUT I popped into CONSTANTINES hairdressers as they had a tattoo shop next door that my son was interested in having a look so I thought I would kill 2 birds one stone! I made an appointment was asked for a £20 deposit which I found a bit weird! As I had never been asked in 6 years for a deposit before? Anyway I say d I'm looking for a colour and cut and was told it would be £40 and would I pay 50% I said ok. I went back the next day and had 2 young lads apply my colour then another cut my hair then dried it, there where puffs of smoke coming of my hair! Soon it was all over I went to pay and was told that will be £100!! I didn't pay it of course! Anyway we settled the price at £50 which I was still not happy with! But NEXT DAY I washed my hair and couldn't brush it, it was a tangled mess as these idiots had completely fried my hair! I have to pack it with serum or it looks like someone is holding balloons all round it! Totally static all the time! ITS A TOTAL MESS! PLEASE PLEASE DONT BE FOOLED BY THESE RIP OFF ARTISTS THAT DESTROYED MY HAIR! GO TO ONE OF THE SMALLER MORE RELIABLE HAIR SALONS!"
"Having read the reviews on Tripadvisor, we went to Cleopatra beach, thinking that it's a sandy beach. There are NO sandy beaches in Alanya and in places around it. It's covered with fine shingles but not sand. So, bear that in mind. It is clean but you have to pay for sunbeds and parasoles. 10 TL per sunbed and 10 for a parasole. It can be pretty windy and the waves can be pretty strong, so if you are not a good swimmer, be prepared to end up on your bottom😀. All in all, not so impressed."
"We accessed this via beach '6' was affiliated with our hotel. Rented the sunbeds and sunshade.The sand is very loose and course, yet comfortable to walk bare foot on. Swimming in the warm Mediterranean sea is a lovely experience. Getting out however is less so! There is a sharp shelf and with the strong waves hitting you it can be a struggle.To describe my exit from the sea would be more 'beached sealion' than anything else!Facilities to wash feet are available and plenty of places to eat and drink.Exceptionally clean and free from litter."
Visited kleopatra beach with my friend omg was clean and beautiful service on beach was amazzing the sea was crystal clear absolutly stunning !!!!♥️
"Beautiful blue flag beach.  Sand is amazing. History behind the beach. And so much to do.  I’ve cream brought near by. So tasty, cheap and man so friendly and made the kids laugh. Lovely castle, lot of steep walking. Cable car to the top. Beautiful views. No need to go right at the top, can enjoy the views from the end of cable cars 🚠 if have difficulty walking. Beautiful gardens and seating area. Definitely visit it is so worth it.  Take time and enjoy the waves and the breeze and the noise of the waves.  Never enough time. Just to beautiful."
We found two sides of Alanya - the beach or the harbour. The harbour takes you to boattrips to see fish or places to dive. The beach is nice. Do make a visit to Alanya Gardens. You must see the blue bridge over the waterpond. Nice! Every pier has a small bar/restaurant too. And free wi-fi.
