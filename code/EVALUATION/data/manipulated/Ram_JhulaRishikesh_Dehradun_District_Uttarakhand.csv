Surrounded by mountain. And water is cold and clean. You can cross the river by jhula I liked the laxman jhula area more then ram jhula .
A suspension bridge to cross the mighty Ganges. The whole area is a beauty to experience. Do spare your evenings for a stroll and a bit of shopping may be...
Place has a certain serenity with river flowing underneath a mildly shaking suspension bridge. Enjoy the breeze
Take a walk on this bridge to experience the view on both sides and the Ganga river below. The other parallel bridge is Ram Jhula which is about 2KM away.
Ram Jhula is the new bridge (compared to Lakshman) which gives an amazing view of the Ganga ghats of Rishikesh connecting Muni Ki Reti. It's quite crowded at regular hours with two wheelers coming from both directions. Come early morning or late nights. Tip : Come here in the evening and also at night. Both views are amazing.
As you walk across the bridge it shakes and so the name is given jhula n not bridge... Loved walking through it as no photography was allowed on the bridge as it is the peak season there was too much rush on the Ram jhula so for maintaining traffic such notices were written
Visited this place with friends and family.Hanging jhula connecting 2 village over the Ganges.Good walking experience but undone by traffic?? Yes ...2 whellers are also allowed on this.......Making it not only unpleasant but also unsafe.
I will say better than Laxman Jhula as it is more wider and less crowded. Walk on this bridge from west to east to reach Swargashram Not to be missed
be care from the monkies they are thief and can bite you. the bridge is very intersting you can pass the town from side to side. it is most beutiful in the evening when sunset
Hanging bridge on top of Ganga river for walkers and two wheelers to cross. Amazing views and fresh air. You can walk by and across is 30 mins or so. But this bridge can get crowded
"Visited Feb 5 and 6. Beautiful views of the Ganga.  Interesting experince- motor scooters, tourists, locals, monkeys. Lots of stalls with shopping on either side.  Great experience."
Take a stroll over the bridge and admire the Ganges below. Just be careful as some time there are motorcyclist who use the bridge too.
"Slightly undulated ancient bridge which helps people, cattle and two wheelers to cross. Saves lot of miles of travel and connects North Hrishikesh to south. South of the Hrishikesh is known as tapobhoomi, as many sadhakas were doing Japa, Tapa and various sadhanas right from the ancient time as this place was untouched by outsiders. A nice place for selfie!! :)"
It's a historic slightly swinging jhula connecting one end of the holy river Ganga to another. Provides great view of river Ganga and scenic beauty around.
This is the 2nd Jhula of Rishikesh. This is basically a hanging bridge ove the river Ganga. The view is awesome. Be aware of monkeys.
Ram jhula is one of the suspension bridges in india. Standing here you get the full view of river Ganga. Very beautiful sight. The jhula is wide enough and has lot of space. There are various water sports around and Beatles ashram is also nearby. A must visit place if visisiting rishikesh.
You can see the river ganga flowing below the bridge. good to walk early morning & evening. Beware of cycles & scooters on the bridge.
It is fun going over this bridge which is open to humans and two wheelers. Did not see any cows crossing but can not rule out that either! There are nice shops on both sides which sell lot of stuff required for anyone living in Rishikesh. Not necessarily gift articles though there are several shops here for that. Better ones are near Laxman Jhula.
Try a 360 degree view when you are river rafting in the serene Ganga Ji. Amidst mountains this is a fabulous point.
Itâ€™s a suspension bridge said to be iconic of Rishikesh. Was a little crowded and motorbikes kept crisscrossing as we walked. The views are pretty. Not wheelchair friendly.
What an experience The is a place where you will see India coming together. Culture and people from around India along with a lot of foreigners. This is a must visit place when going to Rishikesh. Try to avoid taking your vehicles and visit cafes in this area for the great food they serve very Holy place itâ€™s true after been feel change of life
Ram jhula a wonderful bridge over the river Ganges. Walk over the bridge is very nice looking to the bottom of river Ganges
"An impressive Bridge (longer than Laxman Jhula), full of life, walking people,motorbikes, cows, monkeys, colours, wonderful view over the Holly Ganga river under your feets, but also an interesting area for a walk, litle shopping or for a coffee, lunch etc.!! Don't miss to return/ cross the other side, by the small boat! It takes only 3-5 min. (and only 10 Rs), but it's a beautiful experience..!!"
Both the Sivananda and Swarg sides of the bridge are filled with interesting shops and restaurants. It is definitely worth a visit.  Walks a bridge one-way dodging scooters and take the Riverferry the other way for a nice round-trip
Visited during the evening time. Very very scenic and much longer bridge than the Lakshman Jhula. Two wheelers are allowed on this bridge which is not a very nice situation as have to constantly keep a look out for the vehicles going through. The banks of the river are very serendipities and peaceful. A Must visit place but would be much better without the two wheelers on the bridge
You can ride your bike on this bridge to reach other side of the River. Too crowded in the evenings. Looks wonderful in the dark because of the way it is lit
This is near laksham jhula. Good place to see if you are in the twin city of haridwar and rishikesh. Avoid going on 1st monday of Shrawan. There will be too much crowd.
The location is great. But what I enjoyed most was the journey of walking by the bridge and the crowd. Being able to immerse yourself with the surrounding is really all about the culture and the people. Feel the colours and the friendliness of the people in India through the booths you'd pass by and the streets where they'd chat you up and share their insights with you (if you're willing to stop by). For those cultural spirits!
Always a pleasure to walk over this... Try walking around when the water level is low you will be amazed by looking at the size and numbers of fishes eating food in running water.. It is a treat for eyes along with blast of fresh air.
"This is my fav spot of my month in Rishikesh, ashrams, Ganga river, mountains, monkies and the beautiful market.We attended the Ganga Arti here, close to Shiva statue. Don't miss it!"
"Imagine this - second day in India, first time crossing the narrow bridge to find accommodation on foot thinking this is simply a foot bridge across the Ganga.. you then find yourself wedged between an oncoming two-wheeler, people and a cow. Carrying all your worldly possessions, the cow takes a shine to you and drops its head (with horns) and picks up pace coming towards you - what do you do?Luckily a more experienced local moved me out of the way and I was able to continue crossing the bridge. - what a way to land in Rishikesh.Two days later whilst crossing in the heat of the midday sun, I decide to pick up an ice lolly before crossing the bridge. My extremely wise girlfriend advised 'I wouldn't eat that going across here' thinking she was joking, I ignored here advise - how wrong I could have been.  with around 10 meters remaining on the bridge I was surrounded by around 10 monkeys who took a fancy to the ice lolly. Initially I froze, then tried to ignore them. It was at this point they smelt weakness. One hairy monkey grabbed hold of my arm, I screamed, threw the ice lolly and ran - much to my girlfriends amusement.There you go - one very eventful bridge.. would recommend."
"This is one of those places where you feel calm and happy. Cool breeze from the river will play with your hair. This is a heart warming experience. Beware there can be a bit of a traffic during the day. Sometimes cows also congest the jhula. Go for a walk in the night, that'd be a great experience."
Beautiful view from the bridge ðŸŒ‰. While you are in Rishikesh do visit the place with fail. Thank you
"The walk on jhoola was not so exciting because of two wheelers and traffic. However, found sitting on the ghats near the ram jhoola was nice. Enjoyed taking bath too."
"The walk on & around Ram jhula is beautiful, Lovely small shops, small lanes, lots of chaat stalls around, even came across a bakery on wheels, which served freshly baked nankhatia (sweet biscuits) on the streets. Tried the Ramphal fruit which was very unique.Visited the Parmarth Niketan for the evening Arti."
