A must see. Very interesting to see inventions of years ago. Reasonable entry fee. Takes about an hour to view.
World Heritage Site. Your tour wont get complete without visit to JANTAR MAHAR. about 300 Years old Observatory. Created by Royals of JAIPUR
A must see for anyone who loves science and art.  Built in 1726 this is a beautiful display of both abstract  sculpture and accurate astronomy measuring devices.  A remarkable synthesis of art and science
Very cool museum that focuses on astronomical instruments. Go when the sun creates shadows. Hire a guide as they’ll give you stories behind each instrument.
Incredible sundials and quite a Park. Well worth a visit. Loved all the cool displays   Early science is fascinating for sure
If you are a science student its a must to visit place in Jaipur. Quite informative and really amazing science. Take a guide to understand.
Loved the place. It is well maintained and beautiful. You can actually check current time. This surprised me most
Very impressive. Do take a guided tour to truly understand how incredible this place really is. The sundial and various other instruments that were built centuries ago and work with accuracy will date. A delight for science and astronomy enthusiasts.  It is within walking…
"Go there around mid day to see the solar clock. Other instruments look fascinating but nothing is explained here. Solar clock’s working can be understood, but rest of the devices are not explained at all.Clean restrooms. Having a guide helps but they also do not know too much."
One of the amazing place. remind us the way earlier people used to have a glimpse of our time and solar system without the current technology. how intelligent the people were at that time. A must visit place in jaipur
A fantastic site that explains the historical study of time and the stars. Take time to read all of the explanations - and maybe do some homework first. :-)  Really fascinating!
"Is not great tbh, Probably can look around in 10 minutes but is just R200, so not the end of the world. Make sure you keep your tickets for all attractions as they will ask to see them again at exit. "
"This place is near City Palace.. an amazing historical observatory.. Astronomy enthusiasts would definitely love this place.. Lot of instruments like Sundial etc were there which were used to measure the position of various planets, sun etc.. Each instrument requires time to understand.. Taking a guide would be a better thing if someone have no idea on astronomy.."
Interesting place to spend an hour or so. Even if you aren’t interested in astronomy - the structures are amazing to see and everyone can relate to one - as there are individual ones for each star sign. Try to avoid the middle of the day when it is too hot as there is little…
Just across the entrance of City Palace gate this is again an amazing place to visit on your sightseeing tour of Jaipur. Do get a guide for understanding the facts of History.
You will be amazed by this place. This is a perfect example of hundreds of year of Indian Ancient Science example. Keep a guide while visiting this place.
"Ideal time to visit this place is between 2pm to 5pm, in clear sunlight. Hire a local guide here to understand these historical astrological tools."
"A beautiful and well preserved place where you get to see and understand the wisdom and knowledge that the ancients possesses. The accurate instruments that observe time, movement of the sun, planets and much more. Am very impress with the creation and how the Maharaja create a small scale model to ensure that the instrument works before creating the actual version. Wonderful!"
It's a great experience to know how intelligent people created devices.  The time and gps calculation up to accuracy of 2 minutes and 2 degree.  Take a guide to know the exact working of each devices and it worth.  Otherwise you will be wasting time by reading the explanation..
Great place. Super interesting . Gets the grey matter working. The kids were really intrigued by the whole complex. Great for young and less young scientific brains.
"Fasciniting visit to the place, a guide is a must as he/she will walk you through wih various system. It is built with seconds precision, where based on Sun and Moon movement, one can check the time and predict the horroscope."
"visited here as we didnt get time in Delhi. maintained very well and guards are present at all points. if you are interested in astronomy, then it is worthy visit. but otherwise also a good visit and can take some good photos."
"Interesting place and real relief from the city noise as you can chill in the gardens as long as you want. Get a guide, but confirm that they will show you all the instruments and how long as our guy obviously wanted to get his lunch!Also don’t wait for long I’ll cals queue, v. Short foreigner queue. Do this above the city palace which is pretty bang average"
This is a must visit when in Jaipur.  Learning the astrological details of time and dates based on the sun's placement during the day and year are amazing.  It all started as a hobby for an ambitious person.  The time and date keeping mechanisms are intricate and surprisingly timely considering when they were built.  A unique stop.
"An amazing collection of sundials under differing formats, and some linked to the zodiac. There are ""guides"" available for tour, however are very expensive. 250 rupee entry fee, and another 250 for the short tour. Take your time of birth also, and you'll get a ""reading"" of your attributes....LOL."
"We visited the place as one of the places of Tourism. It was an experience which can not be described in word's. It's an Engineering and Astronomical marvel from the ancient times. Anybody who is interested in our Civilization, must visit and spend a good amount of time. Make sure you have a good Guide."
"Visited yesterday via our booking with the travel agents. We were taken back by all the instruments, their size, how accurate they were and still working.  What a gem."
Ancient time machine in Jaipur.  Worlds largest stone sundial. Used to measure distances and positions of celestial objects. Amazing to see.
The ancient observatory is always of interest. See and be surprised. It’s always better to see for yourself.
"I'm not sure how someone could say that this place was boring. If you enjoy learning about astronomy and astrology through the ages, this place is very cool. Amazing to know how old many of these sundials, etc., are. Spending about an hour is good, or 1-2 hours if you have the…"
"Get there early it's in full sun! Since it's there to measure the sun and the stars... You do need a guide,for only 200 ruppees to understand how they work and to appreciate fully their creation. Several instruments were replicated at the time as aid for students. The sundial is…"
My husband and I were glad we added this stop onto our list. It is a collection of huge astronomical instruments that make up this observatory. The size of the sundial alone was very impressive. Watch out for random people who will walk up to you and offer a tour - and then want…
"If you are doing the classic India tour you are likely to see a few Jantar Mantars. Take it from me, this is the one to see. It is perfectly preserved and in full working order.  That means that they have been taking readings and timings with pinpoint accuracy for the last 300…"
"Jantar Mantar really is fascinating and interesting for anyone who has an interest in science. Even if you don't, enjoy the beauty in the precision, curves and lines of the large scale astronomical instruments. We took a guide for 300Rs and it lasted only about 20 minutes. He was a little impatient (probably in a hurry to make more money from the next group of tourists!) and had a rude attitude too. Find the museum, where you can watch a film that explains things well, and the exhibits also does a good job explaining what the instruments are all about. You can use the 300Rs instead to buy a good publication in the bookshop about Jantar Mantar. Go early to avoid large crowds."
"went with my partner in February. It's very beautiful and the the complexity of these seemingly simple structures is astounding, however, someone with a science background would definitely get more out of it. There are descriptions next to each astrological tool for how it…"
