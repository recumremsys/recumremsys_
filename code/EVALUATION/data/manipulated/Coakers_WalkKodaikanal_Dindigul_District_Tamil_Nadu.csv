Good View from Coakers Walk. Its a nice km long walking track. Can be done once during your stay in Kodai. Has an entry charge of Rs 30/person.
"Located not very far from Bryant Park, Kodai lake and Market. This pavement gives you a good view of the valley. Must visit while in Kodai. Your tour operator will include it in Valley view package."
Its a very good view point and the entrance fees is reasonable. Enjoy the walk and the pics :) it is at walkable distance from the kodai lake and the main center
One of the major tourist attractions in Kodai. Provides some fabulous views. Visited earlier here. It was good at that time but It's not at all in good shape now. The Maintenance seems to be poor.
"Coakers Walk is neat and very well maintained path way. With a very nominal entry fee (20/-) you get to see a breath taking view of mountain chains with clouds rolling over them. This place is very well within the city, walk-able from Bus Stand. If you are a nature lover, you will surely enjoy walking on this lane. Vehicles are not allowed here. there are some vendors selling petty things and eatables. Do visit the Telescope center at the end of this pathway (fee 6/- per person)."
"Take pictures and pictures and pictures along with the walk trail , amazing point in Kodailkanal, Must visit, enjoy eating Bhel on the way, we cherised the same !!!!"
It is a clean and nice walk with beautiful sights. There are vendors along the walk that sell interesting snacks.We went during the off season so did not have to deal with large crowds. Recommend go in the morning as in the evening the mist covers the views.
"Provides great views and makes for a pleasant walk. There are small shops who deal with handmade goods and articles. There is also a provision for an observatory, but, this was hardly of any use due to the poor visibility in December."
"This place is unique, where you can find cloud invading whole of the Coakers Walk. Loved the flora and fauna throughout the  path when you progress from one end to another. You can see the deep slope in one side of the path. The stroll starts close to Van Allen Hospital and intersects the main road above St. Peter's Church. The entry fee is just Rs. 10 for all. Camera fee is Rs. 30 only."
This 1 km walk through sky is meant to be experienced. On a clear day beautiful view of Kodai valleys on cloudy day with some rain heaven when clouds almost pass you by. One of the best attractions in main city. See the gentle rolling hills. I was lucky to see a green snake in…
Is a nice place to relax and drink a cup of coffee while you see the amazing views of the mountain. very beautiful to see
"Offers a eagle eye view of the place , well maintained. Though too commercial but the view is awesome. When it is raining it appears as you are walking in the clouds.NOTE to travellers - Climate keeps changing hence be ready for some unexpected showers, don't let the rain spoil all the fun. The telescope room is closed when it rains as it gets cloudy and nothing is visible."
"Do'nt miss this place. It offers multiple views of valley. Though you can visit any time, the best time to visit in morning."
We had a good view of the valley from Coakers Walk. The eateries along the walk also made us to crave for the snacks. Having an icecream is a must
Clean walking path with nice view. Lot of small shops in the path. Enjoyed brief walk in the area with good valley view
A 1km long man made walk on the slope of the mountain.  Take a walk around while getting mesmerized at  beautiful valley  & mountains.
"Went here during sunset and God is this place beautiful! The veiw from here is breathtaking. The clouds would take over the whole way and once it gets cleared the whole city looks divine! As it starts getting darker , the lights looks prettier. However, this place does get closed after 7pm. So the ideal time is to get in around 5pm. Spend some time till the sun sets and then go ahead with your day ."
"What a view!!!  One could spend entire morning looking at the spectacular view along entire stretch.   There is telescope at the end, just try to view through scope.   There are some shops along the way providing local novelties. Do not miss this view. One of the best places for…"
"Walk and view on croakers walk was good and scenik...but wish they could open it early morning...they open only at 7,30.. I would hane enyoed the walk viewing the sun rise"
"Close to the Kodai Bus Stand and few meters away from Kodai Lake and Bryant Park, is this heavenly walkway named after Lt. Coaker, way back in 1872. It is fantastic 1km (3300 feet) well paved and fenced pedestrian pathway (entry paid, 10 rupees per person and 20 rupees for camera) that provides awesome panoramic views of the Kodai town. Edged on a deep slope it is a photographer must visit destination which provides mesmerizing play of clouds floating around and giving a unique landscape below. On a clear day, you can view as far as the town of Periyakulam and even the city of Madurai. As the mist gets deposited, a pre noon visit is recommended however, on a clear day any time is fantastic for its very soothing and spectacular view."
Felt like walking amidst the clouds and enjoyed beautiful scenery. Shops are also very good. Enjoyed very much.
Go there early in the morning and you will have breath taking view of the valley and different flowers. Crowded after 9 am
Enjoyed the walk with family and there was mist almost all over the view point. Excellent Climate - Must go
"This sight seen is. Noting but an park side with velly view with small shops selling handicraft, eatables etc.... This is a good. Place to start a dah with a morning walk..."
Nice picture perfect view one cane get to see! Do wake up early in the morning just after the sunshine and when clouds come down on this cokkers walk track to exeperience amazing natural beauty!Charges : 35 inr (actually it should be free of cost since its hardly maintained)
Enjoyed our slow walk around Coakers walk.  Air was simply fresh with beautiful sceneries. Shopping was very reasonable.
Beautiful place for morning walks with cool breeze. Views are breathtaking. Hide and seek of clouds made it interesting.
This is a nice place to take a walk and enjoy the scenery in the heart of kodaikanal in walk-able distance to lake and bryant park. Mesmerizing sky and views. Beautiful clouds before the sunset. You also should go there in the night to see the view of lights in the city. Its amazing. We went twice once in the evening and once in the night. We missed to go for a morning walk to the same place :)
"Just taking a walk here is so relaxing and soothing. Be sure to walk here during 3-4 PM, that's when it gets misty and you feel like walking through the clouds. The aroma of Kurunji flower makes this walk a delightful experience."
A must-visit viewpoint. Walking in the premises itself gives you pleasure. Aged persons may feel some difficulty to walk.
You can get a view of Kodaikanal from here. The place has however become commercial with stalls along the way. Losing its charm
"Good to spend about an hour or so. Opposite the ""botanical garden"". Gives you a good view to the valley. When we went there, the clouds were just rolling in so it was amazing. There's a small observation room where you can view through telescopes. It gets over very soon though and you need to purchase tickets to enter."
Entrance fee was reasonable. Had a good view . Had a good view from telescope . It’s very old view point . We all had a good time . There shops inside . Toilets is also there.
"One of the beautiful experience in kodaikanal. Walking peacefully looking at the clouds, the fog, the mountains, the valley, the flowers and the houses built on the hill. Entry fee of Rs. 30PP is higher. Good experience of walking along the mountain path."
"It's a lovely place for a lovely walk! Do visit this place.. Not to be missed. Not very expensive, and few light shops in the sidewalk help cheering the environment along with Beautiful view."
