This was an interesting and lovely place to visit.  A soulful combination of spiritual and educational especially for those of us who didn't know much about Sufism.  The rooms with the information and description were clear and well done and managed to hold the interest of our children.  Visiting the main tomb itself was calm and spiritual.Very well worth visiting.
"It must visit location if traveling in Turkey .The museum is well kept and organized.I would recommend the audio guide or take the tour, very detailed information . Tell you the whole story of Mevlana Rumi .The staff are very friendly and helpful One word of caution ,there are no restroom in the museum ."
"The Museum was more than I expected as it is also a living quarters, burial site and mosque. Read the history of Mevlana before you go and you will appreciate what you are seeing much more. It was boring for my 5 year old son but ultimately we enjoyed it!"
"Included as part of our Gate 1 tour. Great to have a guide to explain and give background. The exhibits really conveyed the belief that all should be welcomed, respected and cared for. What a unique religious approach. Sure turns around the perception of radical Islam."
Loved loved the museum! Although very busy - there was beautiful music playing and amazing energy!We were fortunate to be there on Thursday and watched the dervishes do their magic
"The one good aspect of this attraction, is that now they permit photography within the buildings.  A couple of years ago, photography was forbidden.In Konya this is one of the main attractions.  Providing a look at a religious sect.Would we recommend this attraction:  Yes, at least once.Would we return to this establishment:  No, as we have been to this attraction at least two times."
This is a must see if your in Konya. The place is very easy to find as everyone knows where it is. Ask for Mevlana Rumi Museum. Currently the place is going through some construction work and the tomb place is boarded but nevertheless it’s still worth visiting. It’s what you feel that counts as opposed to what you see. Highly recommended.
"This museum has so much to offer for those who can look and see. If you don't see what you are looking at, or just stare around, you would still notice so many details about Rumi philosopy.This is a mystic place and it is very much respected by the local people and also considered a holly place.  Proper dressing is required. Keeping the peaceful environment is also required. It can be very crowded sometimes, but you will not be disturbed.  You would feel welcomed here.  There are many handwritten Qurans and other books, which are priceless.  Some are written with liquid gold.  You will be amazed by the beauty of the handwritings, and handcrafts.  A must to do in Konya."
Fantastic final resting place of this great Sufi Master and poet. Nicely arranged history artefacts in the courtyard of the museum. Washing facilities for those who want to pray in the adjacent mosque. Women advised to dress appropriately and shoe coverings are provided. Sacrophagus of Moulana Room (Rumi) is inspiring and thought provoking. Prayer space is adjacent to graves. Entry is free. Souvenir shop on site and also outside main gates. For lovers of Rumi's poetry a visit to this place is a must
"Was very happy to visit this place, found it true to the spirit of Rumi- all embracing, tolerant & educational & very calming. Women were free to keep their heads uncovered if they wished so & entry is free. Very neat & clean, they had plastic shoe covers so no need to take footwear off. No restrictions on using the camera or where to stand. You can sit inside, read, pray or just pay your respects & linger in the grounds. The mausoleum itself is done up discreetly & reverentially. They have a lot of well preserved artefacts on display. The cells are well maintained, very clearly labelled & extremely informative. The staff are polite. We went back again the next day. Do visit it if you have any interest in Sufism-very educational."
"Loaded with history, tradition, education, learnings, legend and philosophy. It helps understand why the whirling dervishes whirl. We had the precious help of Nazif nazifdemirci@yahoo.com who accompanied us through 3 mosques and explained absolutely everything to us. Nazif is knowledgeable, has a storyteller's gift and, also, owns an interesting nomad carpet store. Look for Nazif if you want to enjoy Konya. You won't regret it."
Beautiful museum. We took the audio guide which was cheap but not very helpful. Added a little to the experience only. Visit with someone who knows the history to really enrich your experience.Not to be missed!!
"Even though Konya is not a very (non-Turkish) touristic city, we were very pleasantly surprised to find this attraction right in the city center. This museum/mosque/tomb combo is even free to enter and has quite a few very impressive items.It includes Rumi’s tomb, it apparently includes the (/a piece of?) beard of Muhammed, a lot of information about the followers of Mevlana (Rumi) and a lot of information about the life of Rumi himself.For those that don’t know, Rumi was a Persian poet, scholar and theologist, who lived in the 13th century. To this day, many people follow his teachings, as such, we definitely recommend more offline reading about him to understand even more when visiting this museum.Recommended program? Absolutely. Suggested duration: around 2 hours (although it is quite subjective as you can imagine)."
"Unfortunately total desecration of a venerable site in the name of religion! Do not expect to see any ""humanism"" here... only releigious shows"
This is a must see if you are  in Konya. The place is very easy to find as everyone knows where it is. Ask for Mevlana Rumi Museum
"Be polite and observe signs when visiting the museum. On the outside, there are beautiful city signs to take photos. You can buy souvenirs of the city at the museum's shop."
"Mevlana Museum is a real highlight! You can't miss it and a reason itself to visit Konya! The exterior is nice and impressive, also during the night when the lights bring a special mystic to the buildings. But the interior and the atmosphere inside...fantastic! The special about it is also that it is both a museum AND a place where people come to pray and worship, it seems to be a very special place of pilgrimage for many people. You see the tomb of Rumi and several smaller tombs for his disciples. Also the decoration around them is nice. You can hear the Sufi music, ney music, inside. It makes the atmosphere very special, very relaxed, mystique and meditative. This is a place to get your heartbeats down. The museum itself is also very nicely organized, very informative. And it was free too:)! A big surprise! Enjoy:)!"
"If you know little or a lot about Mevlana, this is the must place to go. First, this is the place where Mevlana used to be so there goes the biggest reason, second you will find everything about him and the dervish life here. Pay respect to Mevlana at his tomb, look at his belongings, its just so spiritual.  Lots of other artifacts too such as gilded Qurans and miniature art and stuff from the Ottoman times."
Having never heard about the Mevlana religion this was something new to me. First experienced it at the whirling dervishes in Capadocia. The history as depicted in the mosque and adjacent old school and feeding scheme buildings is an experience.
You feel your heart with joy and you thank to life. Visiting Mevlana mUseum is the heart of reason for Konya visit
"Was very much looking forward to visiting the museum, but was a little disappointed. Very crowded and very little information in English, was difficult to get an idea of what I was actually looking at. However, it was a beautiful place."
"For those in the know, this is the place of spiritual upliftment, retreat and self-evaluation. Excellent facility with standard is museum artefacts and of course the tomb of this great Sufi saint and his followers. Going again next week."
"If you are visiting Konya you have to visit here. It is the resting place of Jalal ad-din Rumi. Come here to pay your respects, it is quiet and peaceful with many other people resting. Also there are many beautiful relics in the same building. Not rushed or hassled at all by the guards.  His teacher Shems-e-Tebrazi is 15 minute walk away also."
If anyone going to Konya should never miss visiting this amazing historical place. Take a train from Istanbul Pendik to Konya . Book 15 days in advance online TCDD. 3 hours train comfy ride from Istanbul. Worth a visit. Dont need a tour guide. All the exhibits are clearly written in English. Free entry daily. There is also a relic of our prophet Muhammad (pbuh) blessed beard on display.
"A place of pure energy and light. The heart goes into peace for those who believe yet the love welcomes those who do not. Whoever you are, wherever you're from, come. Come and find your inner self."
Beautiful and profound. A must see in Konya. Try to visit it twice or more. So much to see and feel there. Walk around the museum and enjoy the beauty of it all.
Visited on a Saturday so very busy. A guide would be helpful but there was a lot in English. A useful and entertaining visit but no Dervishes.
"Worth a quick stop.  Doesn't take long to tour and photos are allowed.  Interesting background of the residents tombs.  The outside view was best for me , with the bright bluish tint."
When your in the presence of Mevlana be assured that it'll be magical. Words can not describe the beauty of this place and the inner peacefulness and serenity you get. You'll be astouned by the exterior architecture as well as all that you'll see inside in addition to you standing right infront od Mevlana's tomb that alone would be a dream come true to every Rumi lover. Scarfs should be put by women before entering as a sign of respect and you'll find bags before you enter over your shoes in order for the inside of this sacred place remain clean. There are scarfs for women before entering so dont panic if you went there and forgot to get one. The entry is totaly free of charge. However if you would like to get an audio guide that would be 10 TL only. Try to go early as they are opening the gates because at later times youll have to manage with so many people around you and it can get quite noisy.
Went first thing in morning and the entrance is free. Still large groups of people. Once inside I just leaned against the wall and looked around at all the unique art. Very peaceful and special.
"We were staying across the street from the Muzesi and was one of the places we wanted to see.  As this is a key place for Muslims (so we were told) is it pretty busy.  There is a big square with a Cami (which is also beautiful).  There really isnt much to the Museum but worth the trip.  You go into the actual musuem and see many ancient writing and manuscripts.  As you enter the main part, there are lots of tombs of Rumi's followers.  Were Rumi is actually laid to rest is quite beautiful.  Mosaic tile line the floor to ceiling in bright beautiful colors.  You will see people what looks like in prayer.  There are some of his books, some beautiful Koran's on display and then you are done.  It probably took us 20 minutes.It is a major attraction so you will have vendors and small kids asking for money/food but nothing real aggressive"
"This museum was function as boarding school for people who interested in learning Sufism and aspire to be a Dervis.The museum complex exhibit example of the Dervis student bedroom, study room, and ancient Al Qur'an copy among other things.There were thombs of several key figures in Sufism in the main building. Please be mindful of your clothing when entering the premise. Wearing clothes which is not too reavealing will be your best bet."
"This museum, prior mosque, is not only the heart of Sufism and the Whirling Dervishs, but this is the number one attraction in all of Turkey for Muslims. Given the opportunity, a guide is preferred as there are many small items that are remarkable. The monastery rooms of the initiates are also interesting."
Spend over half day..museum Resting place of maulana rumi. It's a tourist spot as well as having a special place in the hearts of sufi's. Gift shop. Very peaceful. Many shops around the area with gifts to buy.
"Entry was free on Wednesday! Loved everything about it, Im obsessed with Rumi! It as amazing to see how their lives were during tht time"
