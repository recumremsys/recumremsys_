"It took us multiple attempts to get to Tian Tan Buddha due to the strict cable car schedule but what an experience it was. Soak up the temples, statues, and gorgeous nature, and then take the bus to Tai O village for dinner."
"We took the bus to the Big Buddha since the cable car was not running and had a great half day climbing the steps, viewing the relic, and visiting the monastery.  The Buddha is amazing. Be aware that it is over 200 steps to get up to the Buddha so take your time, it's worth the climb for the views all around."
Great chair-lift ride to the Big Buddha; provided some spectacular views.  We were lucky to travel at a quiet time due to being off-peak as well as the effect of the protests.  Was a great trip.  Highly recommended.
Visiting The Big Buddha and Po Lin Monastery were highlights of our stay in Hong Kong. It was a 35 minute taxi ride from our hotel by the airport to the Big Buddha. You could also take a cable car to the Buddha from a town close to the airport. We got there right as they opened. It was so quiet and peaceful. We climbed the 256+ stairs to the top (took about 5-7 minutes) where the views of Po Lin Monastery and Lantau Island were amazing and seeing the Buddha up close was a great experience.
"We visited the Big Buddha and monastery via the cable car on a weekday and it was a real highlight of our trip to Hong Kong. The cable car trip gives fantastic views over Lantau and the airport - those with a fear of heights beware,  it goes a long way above the ground! The tourist village at the top has a theme park feel,  not really our thing, but the Big Buddha and the monastery are beautiful and well worth the visit. We also got the bus down to Tai O which was fascinating with the stilt houses particularly interesting. It's worth checking the bus times though as the service is only hourly and was busy even on a comparatively quiet day. Judging by the queueing facilities at Tung Chang it will be very busy at weekends."
"We travelled out by MTR to Tung Chung and walked the couple of minutes to the cable car for the ride up to the Big Buddha. We had been warned about long queues, so got there around 10 am when it opened, so only had to wait a few minutes. Enjoyed seeing the Buddha but the monastery is absolutely stunning and the Path of Wisdom walk also worth doing. On its own the Buddha is worth seeing, but the cable car, monastery and walk definitely made it more memorable."
"A highlight for me in Hong Kong, got the MTR and followed by the cable car up to the Big Buddha.Exceptional spot, great vibe and along with the monastery a great place to see.Plenty of steps to the top. Go early to avoid the crowds."
It rained but we decided to walk up those stairs anyways and was not disappointed. Breathtaking views regardless and something you gotta see while visiting Hong Kong. Try going during the Chinese New Year and you get to see some festive culture!
The gondolas were shutdown so we had to take the 45 min bus ride from the mtr station (tung chung?).  bus was full but it had some nice views of local mountains and the coastline.  Climbing the stairs (250?) can be a chore for some but take your time.  The view is amazing and there is a bathroom near the top.  The displays inside are interesting and look great.  We also checked out the gift shops.  They were not that expensive and had some really nice stuff...chopstick sets and jewellery.
"One of the best parts of visiting the Tian Tan Buddha is getting there in a cable car. The first sight of seeing the buddha's silhouette from the horizon as you approach sitting inside the cable car is just breathtaking.  Try to get there when they first open as it gets extremely busy by Lunchtime. The experience just isn't the same when the place is crowded.The Buddha is an HK landmark that you shouldn't miss, it's just a wonderful place to visit with the children and they also have lost of reasonably priced restaurants on site.  I really love the Tain Tan Buddha and would highly recommend it."
"Took the metro to get there early but ended up waiting about an hour before the gondolas were operational! It was all worth it in the end. The gondola ride took about 30 minutes and the scenery was fantastic. The Big Buddha is very impressive even from ground level though the climb up those many, many steps is worth it. The Po Lin monastery is very beautiful. Ngong Ping village is very touristy but still worth a look around."
"Only had morning before our flight,  but was a really nice trip , you could have spent longer up the mountain as bars restraints shops . But still worth going for hour or two as we did . Don’t think it would be worth it if not a clear day ."
We were a family with two children. We took the cable car up to the Big Buddha. The ride was quite expensive but our children enjoyed it. All of the shops in the area is very expensive. I do highly recommend the vegetarian food on the left side of the temple. Walk to the end than you will se a stall with plenty of vegetarian food you can choose. The radish cake does test very good. So when you are up there do not forget to eat that. Our two children had great fun walking around the temple and Big Buddha. There are plenty of dogs walking and sleeping around the temple. Most of them are very friendly but still be careful with your children so they do not get bitten. /Henrik
"We had not booked in advance and were expecting long queues for the cable car especially as it was a Sunday. Nothing could have been further from the truth. We exited the MTR at Tung Chung station (only 10 HK Dollars each way concession-for over 65’s- from Olympic). Had breakfast at Urban snack bar then off to the cable car....no queues.....great. Wow, what a journey up and over the hills to the Buda. Once there, had drink in the village before heading to the Buda. So many steps to climb but boy, is it worth it when you reach the top. Thoroughly recommend this location."
"Get cable car tickets in advance as they’ll be cheaper, the hike up to the Buddha is not for the amateur. The Buddha and monastery are well worth the visit."
I took the glass bottom cable car (must do) from Ngong Ping. View was amazing.There's an area with statues of chinese zodiac which I found really cool. Tourists were amused by the cows walking around as well. They looked very tamed. There are plenty of shops and restaurants (both western and eastern) on the way to big buddha statue. Prices were fairly reasonable. There's a nice tea store as soon as you enter the village with really nice staff. Feel free to check it out if you are a tea buff like me.There are plenty of steps to climb so will be your cardio workout for the day. But the views and the feeling at the top well worth it.If you buy a ticket I think you can go to a balcony just under the buddha statue I didn't do it.If you have time please add this to your list. You will never regret as this was one of my highlights of the Hong Kong trip.
The tram ride to the top is beautiful and the 268 to Big Buddha is worth it no matter how many times you stop on the way.  Take the city bus going and leaving; you’ll save a bundle and the view is spectacular
"We got the cable car option to have glass bottom but did not choose this to be honest the views up and around are more exhilarating than below,  can hike around d if you wish. We choose to just look around at top and not go into this was free again beautiful views across to other islands,  brochure helpful in points of interest. Lots of lovely shops too on the way to buddha. Worth a visit.We dropped our bags in storage at airport then did this which took 20min to cable by bus from airport, then 25min cable each way and we had about 90min to look around. Manage it although longer would of been better but we had flight to catch to Seoul"
Had a bus trip to this amazing TempleVery informative tour guide who could answer all our questions. The temple is is a very peaceful place and the giant Buddha is amazing .  Well with the visit
"Be ready to walk up a lot of stairs but it's worth the burn! The Big Buddha is awesome, from your trip to it all the way up it is amazing . I have been up there a few times and I will be back.."
Great couple hour trip. Do the sky team for sure. About a 20 minute ride and very scenic. The Buddha is amazing. A bit touristy in the town but not detracting. Well worth the trip.
"It's my second time visiting Tian Tan Buddha in 15 years, extremely impressed with the cable car.It's highly recommended to get there early about 9 am (about 15 mins getting the ticket) unless buying in advance. Otherwise, you might have to wait at least an hour if you're there after 11 am. Also, highly suggested to board a crystal (glass-bottomed) cabin on the Ngong Ping 360 Cable Car to Ngong Ping village (25 mins ride). Walking up to the big Buddha and pray.  We got a private cabin on the way back. Then, can do a (window) shopping at the Citygate Outlets"
We took the ferry from Hong Kong to Mui Wo and caught the bus there to the Big Buddha. Although the weather wasn't co-operating on our visit the statue was even more impressive in real life. Take time for a snack from the vegetarian cafe before heading down on the cable car.
"A fabulous cable car ride, a short walk and then a climb up lots of steps brings the substantial reward of amazing views and an inspiring monument.  Climb back down and turn right to the monastery which is worth a few hours of anyone's time.  Vibrant colours, stunning architecture and lovely surrounds.  As a contrast to the craziness of Hong Kong a trip to Lantau Island and the Big Buddha is worth the full day it really requires."
"One has seen the odd view of the Buddha from the cable car but of course one is still a long way away. One steps of the cable car and enters a village of many different shops and restaurants. The shops are classy and quite expensive but of course there are cheaper tasteful goods on sale too. In fact there was a seasonal sale on when we visited, some good bargains were purchased. There is a feeling of space as one walks towards the foot of the Buddha. The climb up the Buddha is 268 steps. When we walked up we noticed that one set of steps was in the sun and the other was in the shade. For obvious reasons we took the shady steps. Stop along the way to take in the ambiance, take photos and catch your breath. At the bottom of the steps along the way to the Buddha are smaller statues of the 12 Divine Generals. At the top around the Buddha are 6 statues of Bodahisattbas, 3 on each side. There are small shops inside under the Buddha selling quality related products. The views from the top are very good indeed on a clear day."
"It is an absolutely lovely trip, getting out of the city and experience the buddha, but it is an experience slightly hollowed by the amount of tourist shops you have to pass before you actually get to it. Still worthwhile though! Make sure to take the cable car there for a beautiful trip!"
We took the train out and then the cable car. Walking around is lovely and the walk up to the big Buddha was great. Would recommend the vegetarian restaurant located near the main monastery
"Definitely take the 3.5 mile cable car to this attraction on Lantau Island. Hiking there will take you at least 4-6 hours. Very touristy but this huge Buddha is impressive. If you are able, buy your ticket from a park worker before the entrance so you can skip the ticket line, if there is one. Even with the cable ride, you still have to climb 268 steep steps to get to Tian Tan, the Big Buddha.My favorite part was the cable car ride -- what a view -- of Hong Kong, the airport, the Big Buddha -- and I also enjoyed the feral cows on the premises. Not sure I would pick this attraction if my time were limited. Cable car was 220 rmb pp."
"We took the cable car up and down to Ngong Ping. It is cheaper to take the bus up or down, but you may want both experiences. Climbing the stairs up to Big Buddha is not hard; we are both fit. We explored the accessible parts of the monastery and ate lunch at one of the newer restaurants. We would have given the sites five stars if there was some sort of information while we were touring that didn't require scanning QR codes to get to buggy websites. Perhaps an english audio tour or similar. We wanted a more accessible way to learn about what we were seeing. We spent approximately three hours all-in-all here. It is very close to the airport, so we did this experience on our way out of Hong Kong."
"Wow, our first encounter with the East, Asia, Buddha and it was terrific. Enjoyed the trip over, enjoyed the climb, walked inside. It would have been nice to have some English speaking guides to tell you the story and not have to google it all. Bought the tickets to go inside, and instead of ""free ice cream and water"" took the souvenir.On a hot day come prepared (shades, hat, plenty of water). The ""village"" from the s60 cable car to the TTB is more of a ""modern village"" with Starbucks (kinda spoils the day) and plenty of places to eat and get souvenirs (for those who must). Great visit.Yariv & Son"
This is one of the fantastic attractions of Hong Kong. You need to take a cable car ride to this and the entire trip is worth a few hours. You can find good deals on Klook.com for the cable car. Visiting the statue is free. There is a monastery nearby where you get Chinese vegetarian food as well
While on a long stop at Hong Kong airport the Big Buddha was a perfect thing to see. Left airport on a cab and got there in 25 minutes and spent two hours touring this incredible site. Gotta climb stairs to reach the Buddha so wear comfortable shoes. Beautiful site as well as the monastery!
Took the cable car up to the village and had the chance to visit various monuments to Buddhism. A decent hike up the steps and great views. Enjoy.....
"Advise cable car ascent and bus down to fisherman's village after spending a couple of hours exploring both temple and Buddha... Wander around, talk to strangers, light incense and say a prayer if you are so inclined... Marvel at the abundance of dragonfly elegantly negotiating both garden and visitors ... Allow yourself to stand in awe of this amazing Buddha and be intoxicated by the deafening silence...Seek out the Triple Lanterns cafe in the fisherman's village to cap off a wonderful day and put things in to perspective a little..."
Took the MTR and cable car to monetary and Tian tan Buddha. Took 45 mins from Kowloon MTR station. Worth it. Can skip cable car by taking local bus then longer time to get there. Truly a memorable site.
