"Temple has a rich heritage n history. Must visit place in Trivandrum.It has strict dress code for men n women. Must check before going.Huge serpentine queues would be waiting. Plan accordingly. Buy tinned prasadam for 200 Rs, it's handy if u r traveling further.Seeing the architecture was second best thing for me apart from darshan.No photography allowed. In fact no phones allowed. Carry a pouch with change currency for donations at many places."
Really nice temple to visit still looks ancient inside and posture of Sree padma Swamy is must see. Don’t take more than 1000 rupees to be safe. Leave ur credit cards and wallet at safe place. Men should wear dhoti to enter temple and women must wear sarre or dhoti below…
"The temple is probably the primary reason one would visit Trivandrum for. The temple is beautiful and it's a must visit for the religious ones. Others can also visit once for the experience.Do take care that you follow the dress code and the timings. Won't write much about it as it's well documented in other reviews. Do note that standard timings do not apply these days due to renovation work. Buy the premium entry tickets only if you see the place crowded.You can buy extra prasadam for friends and family after the darshan. It costs Rs. 80 per box. The dressing rules for women are a farce as we saw ladies in shorts/beach clothes being allowed entry by wrapping a near see-through dhoti, whereas traditional salwar suits and churidars are not allowed. Anyways, I won't get into the debate, it's just doesn't make mush sense to me.A note for non Hindus - you will not be allowed entry. :)"
"Padmanabha temple in Trivandrum is a must visit temple for Hindus. Situated in fort area this ancient temple of Lord  Vishnu on Adisesha is famous for its historical and religious reasons. The temple has some rituals which every visitor is expected to follow, men have to remove shirts and wear dhothis and women have to wear saris or cover dresses with dhothis. Mobiles, camera and other electronic devices are not allowed and outside the temple there are shops for dhothis and changing rooms with lockers at very low cost. Temple is crowded with devotees but everything is well organised and causes no inconvenience. The main Sanctus sanctorum has three doors and one can see head , mid body and padam( lotus feet) of the Lord with each door. A ticket for 20₹ offers Darshan from the frontline and can get Prasadam also . The complex also has temples for Ganesha, Garuda and krishna"
"It's an amazing temple to visit where you have Darshan of Vishnu ji in 3 parts. One with Sheshnag and his hand on Shivlinga, in second part goddess Laxmi and Brahma ji in lotus coming out of his naval, in third this feet. Got the opportunity to have Darshans twice."
"This is a very ancient temple of Lord Vishnu. Kindly visit this temple after darshan of Pazhavangadi temple. Confers peace, health and happiness. "
This temple looks magnificent from the outside and better from the inside. Located at the capital city of kerala. Thiruvananthapuram. Very famous Vishnu temple in South india and all over the world. Richest dewity in the world. Non-hindus are not allowed.
"Temple is grand. Remind me of our great ancestors and rich culture. Marvelous and huge. I feeling of proud.After saying this i will say like any temple in India its place of corruption/Unhygiene/open dustbin and highly commercialised. I really don't like concept of VIP darshan. Pujaris in front gate are ready to bite you... Temple is one of richest religious building in world, still its roof/windows are broken. They charge you at every step. They should learn from GURUDWARAS. Concept of SEWA."
Good place to visit. Located at the capital city of kerala. Thiruvananthapuram.  Very famous Vishnu temple in South india
"Capital city, Thiruvananthpuram, is known by this famous temple. Located in the heart of city this temple has got multiple entrances. Post the treasure discovery this temple has become so famous that one has to time his visit for a decent darshan of god. Lord Vishnu in his…"
Serene and tranquil place. Do plan you visit well in advance to visit the temple. Inside the temple you can see the magnificent and magnanimous structure which has stood the times and elements for many millenia. Keep wondering about the architecture and artwork. The main deity…
Visited the temple on the last day of lakshadeepam. Extraordinary temple architecture. The darshan is very simple with even getting the faculty of express darshan. A must visit in tvm
"Padmanabhaswamy  Temple in Trivendrum is very old and is the temple of Lord Vishnu reclining on his bed of Seshanaga. It’s origin is steeped in antiquity and it is believed to be thousands of years old. There are mentions of this temple in ancient Hindu scriptures. It is also claimed to be the richest temple in the world, with wealth locked in its hidden vaults that some estimate as 1000 billion US Dollars! The wealth of the temple stored in underground vaults is however not on display. Opening time slots for visits by devotees are given on the temples website and should be seen before planning a visit. There is a strict dress code. Women must be dressed in traditional attire of Sari. Men must wear a dhoti (available outside the temple for about 60 Rs (one US$). You must remove your shirt and pant and wear the dhoti. If you wear the dhoti over your pants or half pants, you would be turned back. Mobiles and smart watches are also not allowed. There is a cloakroom outside where all these things can be deposited for few rupees. Normally, there is a long queue of devotees but by paying Rs. 200 (Rs. 250 for two people), one can get a special pass for a quick view of the deity. Buying this pass is highly recommended. We had this special view and could see the deity from three windows. First one was the right hand of the daity, then the central par and feet could be viewed from the third window. Only Hindus are allowed in. On way out, one gets prasadam in a sealed aluminum cans. One can is free for paid devotees and additional cans can be purchased for Rs. 80 each. Visit to this temple is highly recommended."

The Richest Temple of India. Standing tall and strong. Hail Lord Vishnu. Best time to visit the Shrine is the morning and evening to see the real charisma.
"Clean and blissful temple.  So very hourned to visit the richest temple in the world.  Rituals practised there are for all walks of life, rich or poor the gents need to wear the dhoti and remove their shirt.  Enjoyed the calmness within the temple.  Someday I wish to do serve at this temple."

Have got a chance to go the temple and I would say blessed to see such a wonderful temple ! Full of positive vibes and also ancient sculptures 
"One of the richest temples, Padmanabhaswamy temple is a must-visit not just for the spiritual experience but also for its unique architectural beauty. Lord Vishnu is worshiped here as 'Ananthashayanan' i.e. reclining on the serpant Ananta. The massive idol can be seen through three different doors. Located in the heart of Trivandrum city, the temple is easily accessible. Lord Padmanabha Swamy is considered to be the presiding deity of the Royal family.Good to know: Please follow the dress code to enter the temple. For men: DhotiFor women : Saree, Half sareeGirls below 12 are allowed to wear frocks and gownsDhotis are available for purchase and rental right outside the temple."
"We visited this temple on 11/10/19 (9 members).  Took special Dharshan Ticket of Rs.200/- (One ticket for 2) at 1630 hours and entered the temple to have a dharshan of Lord Padmanaba in Lying Position.  Three entrances to have dharshan of Thiruvadi, Thirunabi and Thirumugam. …"
"The Temple is very beautiful, spacious, beautiful architecture. But...When we entered the gate, some of the visitors were carrying shirts (not wearing). In a very rude and arrogant voice, the person at the gate shooed them away and told them that shirts are not allowed inside. Did not even guide as to where they could be kept. Mobiles are not allowed (which is fine).We got Rs. 250 tickets and were standing in the line (4th or 5th). At 5pm, the entrance opened for darshanam. And we went inside. At the same time from the side entrance, about 300 people, all from the north (apparently the governor's guests) just rushed inside creating chaos. They were just pushing and pulling each other and shouting. There was absolutely no crowd control. At the sanctum, the priests were shouting (never seen this in other temples in Kerala). There was no line - might was right. We just had a glimpse of the Lord and walked outside. And these 300 There is a Rs. 200 ticket, Rs. 250 ticket - the difference is an additional flower and a plastic bag. The east nada has steps to climb. The south does not. And there is a Boli and Chips shop (Maha Boli and Maha chips) near the East nada."
Must go if you visit Trivandrum. Early morning before 4.30am one should be present there to witness the morning abhishekam and Aarathi . You can stand in front of the God and witness it without much rush . Go with proper attire . Gents to wear Mundu and ladies in sarees. After the Darshan go around the temples and see the glory of pandals and Kottaram which was constructed by the kings in old days. If time permits have afternoon food also inside the temple.
Sunday evening visit to this beautiful temple. Peace and quite at its best. Visited the temple from the north gate. The natural old architecture and natural lighting brings a charm to this place. The openness and decoram maintained here was good. Top notch security.
"Took a car from the hotel and visited this temple, the neighbouring palace and the art gallery... all within distance of each other.    Amazed at the site of this temple as one of the largest in South India and built in the Tamil style.    Recommended.  do spend a few hours…"
"Visiting Padmanabhaswamy temple after 15 years, the most important change I could notice was the increased security and restrictions, even in the wee hours of the day. That said, the temple still has its charm. Managed to be on time for the Nirmalya Darishanam early in the morning (around 3.45 AM). Without doubt, this is the best time to visit the temple. There is not much of crowd. The rituals performed at this hour are special, and one can feel it only when one sees it. If you are visiting the temple, make sure you plan to visit at this hour for the pooja."
"Located right in the center of the city, it is an architectural marvel. Only tradition clothes are allowed and men cannot don shirts. If you do a guided tour you will be able to get the intricate details. Best time to visit is early morning."
"This is one of the most important Hindu temples of India.  Check timings on the website.  Men must wear dhoti and no shirt.  Women have to wear sari.  If wearing a salwar, a white dhoti should be worn over it.  There are no exceptions to this rule. If you do not have a dhoti, buy one from the shops outside the temple. There are cloak rooms outside where you can keep your belongings for a fee. Cell phones, cameras and all other electronic items are not allowed.  Better leave them in your car. No footwear (obviously). Free darshan is available.  If you dont have the time, a ticket of Rs. 250 (allows two persons) permits you to jump the queue and also you get to the see the deity from close quarters."
"Very near to the city. Very strict dress code. Man cannot even take their tops in hand. Only dhoti allowed. Women are allowed only in Saris.  Need to cover with a mundu when in Churidhar.  The temple is divine and completely orthodox, religious and clod to heart. "
"Initially we learnt that we need to go in dhoti and saree. When I reached there, I was asked to take shirt out, but leather purse was allowed. Entrance is magnificent. Not too many people, still a lots of commotion near main temple. Hipocratical brahminical practice allowing purse to buy ticket for pooja. If you did not buy ticket, they would not allow to pray for more than few seconds. Shouting put put. Amazing temple run poorly."
"When one thinks about a trip to Trivandrum, the first thing that comes to mind is the renowned Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple. Touted as one of the richest temples in India, this temple is second to no other temple in attracting devotees world-wide. The temple houses an idol of Lord Vishnu in a sleeping posture, reclining on the serpent Anantha or Adi Sesha with five hoods facing inwards. The consorts Sridevi and Bhudevi are on the sides of the Lord. Offering prayers to Vishnu at this temple kindles the spirit of each devotee bringing in miraculous changes in their thoughts and feelings. The temple has gained attention especially in recent years due to its mysterious secret vault, the door for which is believed that no human or technology can open, defying which may result in havoc or catastrophy.  This is one of the very few temples with suggested dress codes for men and women. For those visiting the temple with no prior knowledge about the dress code, there are help centers just outside the temple entrance to rent dhotis, wearing which they will be allowed to enter the temple."
"A must visit place. Entry restricted to Hindus. The darshan of the lord is through 3 doors as the deity is huge. Lord Padmanabha is in reclining position. Don't expect to have a glimpse of the treasures of the temple. It's all safely locked up. The intricate carvings in the temple is worth the time. There is a saptaswara mandapa inside, where each pillar will give you Saregama notes if you can percussion it right. Thursday is a rush day."
Entering the Temple is restricted to Hindus in proper dress. The area is busy. There are souvenir sellers. The tower is nicely decorated.
"The temple is so beautiful during day or at night. One can really experience the aura of spirituality the second you enter the temple premises. It's a must to follow dress code which is saree for women and dhoti for men. Inorder for people not to be disappointed, the temple sells dhoti for 50rs so that can be worn as mund by women if they are wearing anything other than saree or long skirt. The paal payasam is my favorites which is given as Prasad if you order one day in advance. The temple has a good locker facility as no electronics are allowed inside temple. The security can be a bit strict that they will not let u wear any smart watches. Make sure to leave everything except you wallet at the cloak room so you can have a peaceful darshan. There is a long queue if you are visiting the temple on an auspicious occasion. It's crowded and there will be people flooding from all directions without following the queue and it's something that can't do anything about. It's better to just stay calm as you will be the last person to have a great darshan if you wait patiently admist the crowd. Last but not the least make sure to stop by the famous clock which is said to have been installed in the 1840s during the reign of Maharaja Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma. The clock still works perfectly, and strikes each hour in a day. Don't miss it."
