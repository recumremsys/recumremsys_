"As one of the original World Wonders the pyramids are still very much worth while to visit. Even now that the city of Ca√Øro has almost sprawled out to the foot of the pyramids (or the sfinx anyway) and the dessert sharm of these buildings in the dessert has gone a bit. Be weary of the touts who can be very annoying surely now that visitor numbers are still  quit low. Other side of the medal is that the lac of tourists makes for a much nicer visit with almost no waiting que. Hors carriage or camel rides are readily available but shorely not a must, all of the monuments are also reachable by foot, but takes a lot of walking..."
"Seeing these magnificent structures, still standing after millennia, is very humbling. All we see with our eyes has been marveled over by many through the centuries and we still are not sure how they were achieved. It is surrounded by sand and rocks...and vendors. You can't blame them, they are making a living. They have some very interesting stuff but I just want my memories. The camel ride of 10 minutes was enjoyed by some but it feels a little like a little kid pulled on a pony. The views are hard to describe until you are there."
"If you love Egyptian history the pyramids are absolutely amazing! The entire necropolis is a must see.I prefer going to these areas alone as then there is no restriction on the time that I can spend. JUST A PRE WARNING, ENTRANCE TO THE AREA AND THE PYRAMIDS CLOSE AT 4pm. The pyramids are also closed between 1-2pm and if you are thinking of going inside it can be claustrophobic.The reason I have to give this place 4 stars is because the number of locals that con you. DO NOT ENTERTAIN ANYONE until you get to the official ticket booth which is at the top of the hill.If you stop for the locals they will make up a number of lies to force you to go with them. They will point you towards their own ‚Äòticket offices‚Äô they will say you aren‚Äôt allowed to walk up to the pyramid by yourself.You also have a number of ‚Äòfake ticket inspectors‚Äô within the complex who will then say they will give you a so called ‚Äòfree‚Äô tour. Don‚Äôt fall for it as they will try and charge you at the end. The only place your ticket gets checked is the entrance to the pyramids and the entrance to the complex Also don‚Äôt believe anyone when they say about ‚Äògovernment ID‚Äô. They have just printed badges off.Don‚Äôt let locals take a picture for you as they will expect a tip, just ask other tourists Finally Uber is extremely cheap in this country but most drivers don‚Äôt know their way around so  add about 20 minutes to journey. It is a really enjoyable place to visit, but just ignore all locals.ALSO THEY ONLY ACCEPT CASH AT THE TICKET OFFICE.Adult: 200 E¬£ for area entry Adult: 400 E¬£ for pyramids entry"
"Of course the pyramids and the Sphinx are very impressive world class attractions, which is why so many people make the effort to visit. But one shouldn't underestimate the hassle factor involved when visiting - touts, camel ride sellers, all kinds of scams and rip-offs and hordes of tourists. It's a very overwhelming experience, but still worth the effort. Be prepared to spend at least half a day here in order to see the site properly."
"These are the most famous monuments around the world. No trip in Egypt is complete without a visit to these amazing works standing proudly for millenia, from the dawn of civilization. Be warned, there are lots of street sellers buzzing around the tourists. Good idea to visit the museum of the royal ship of Khufu, just around his pyramid."
"The pyramids continue to be a mystery and standing at the foot of the pyramids was a fascinating experience. It is helpful to go with a guide, and also choose a time when there are fewer tourists. We travelled in February, their winter months (although it is still quite hot around 25C).  Wear comfortable shoes, a good hat and sunglasses as the sandstorms can suddenly just arise.  The pyramids do not have much of a touristy feel to it. There are camel rides on offer.  The sphinx is close by and there are toilets available at exorbitant fees of 2 euros."
"This is a truly wonderful and mesmerizing site. It is like no other. Imagine how people lived and marched along these grand structures few thousands years ago! To get to the site, you can take a bus or a taxi. To find your way into the entrance it was quiet a hassle passing all the camel tour pushers. If you can avoid them and go straight into the entrance that would be quiet an achievement. Be persistent though, don't let them ruin your visit to this wonderful site."
"It was definitely a ‚ÄúWOW‚Äù moment when you first see them.  The largest of these three structures in ancient Egypt is the Pyramids of Khufu built more than 2,600 years before the time of Christ. It stands 480 feet tall, this pyramid is the last of the seven wonders of the ancient World that still stands. Along with these major monuments are a number of smaller satellite edifices, known as ""queens"" pyramids, causeways and valley pyramids. Took 33,000 workers involved in the construction of the  project. You‚Äôll need to spend a few hours here or more. Positively a MUST DO! We We‚Äôre not able to go inside today because of electrical issues inside. We were able to go inside the pyramid of King Khafre (you will need to pay another 100 EGP). Vendors are quite aggressive so no eye contact unless you want to buy something."
"It is just mind blowing to stand in front of the great pyramid and just be amazed at the size and the scale. We stayed at the Marriott Mena House and was a short walk from there to the main entrance . We stayed for 2 days and for the first day did the tour through Emo tours ( booked directly on their site- they have coupons too; will do a separate review) - full day including Dahsur, Saqara and Memphis . The tour picked us up and bought tickets - the entrance to the site is EGP 200; entry into Great Pyramid is EGP 400 and solar boat museum is EGP 100; Memphis EGP 80; Dahsur EGP 60; Saqara EGP 180. We also did the add on for camel ride with the tours. The first day we did the private tour and second day went by ourselves. This was great to get a lay of the land. Going with a private tour was great to keep the other guides away . They tour covered all the entry tickets and the next day we bought our own tickets when we went by ourselves. Make sure you have Egyptian pounds they do not take credit cards. We first visited Cheops , then Khafre and the care took us to the camel ride - make sure you ride to the desert view to get a panorama of all the pyramids. The camel guides are adept at getting all the usual touristy photos. Tip them about 10 EGP . We then went to see the Sphinx and drove to Memphis, Saqara and dahshur - these are less touristy sites but must be visited to get a real appreciation of the efforts made prior to building the great pyramid. Friday‚Äôs tend to get busy at the pyramid as it is a holiday . Do bring water and a snack - we had nutri grain bars, fruit and yogurt. On the drive to other sites stop by local markets and pick up fresh fruits absolutely delicious. We went inside the red pyramid ((Saqara)and husband went inside the great pyramid at Giza - both are recommended for going in. We watched the sound and light from the Pizza Hut roof top"
"From the time we are in Jr. High we have heard about the Egyptians and their magnificent pyramids. . . Well, they are spectacular.  Of all the man made wonders we have seen these 3 stand out as ""The Best."" Much of that awe is pegged to the time frame in which these were built and the massive amount of materials and effort that went into these beauties. Go see them!"
"Our tour to the Pyramids was arranged by Viator that offered an 8 hour private tour of the Pyramids, Sphinx, Egyptian Museum and the Bazaar.Our guide Bassem, an Egyptologist was qualified and had a good knowledge of Egyptian history. Of all the marvels of Egypt the Pyramids leave the most vivid and lasting impression. The Pyramids stand out in the desert with an aura of greatness and mystery. Most of the Pyramids were built as tombs for the country's pharaohs and their companions during the old and middle kingdom periods.In Giza there are three Pyramids . The biggest one is called Khufu, the middle-size one is called Khafre and the smallest is called Menkaure. Climbing the pyramids to the gate (it is prohibited to climb to the top) was a good experience and on the advice of our guide we did not go inside because we were told there is nothing much to see other than tunnels leading to excavated tombs.We had a good view of the three Pyramids from a spot that offered people to ride camels to the nearby Pyramids. This is a nice experience but its best you leave your guide to handle the arrangement with the camel owners for the ride. Do remember to take a photo on the camel with the Pyramids in the background. The guide can snap this for you.Munir D."
"Although insanely crowded when we visited (it was a holiday time for local schools), this is still a brilliant sight to see and we loved every minute here.  The ‚Äúsolar boat‚Äù museum was, for me, the highlight of the day ‚Äî more than 4000 years old and in spectacular condition.  Don‚Äôt miss it!"
"We loved our visit to Pyramids of Giza , our only complaint was the seller men! They are very annoying! Try to avoid , just say La Shokran ‚ÄúNo Thank You‚ÄùüòÄ"
"Absolutely beautiful, exactly what you would expect. The engineering and the grand beauty is out of this world. We didn‚Äôt go into these pyramids, but traveling around the outside is breathtaking. The on-site museum that houses the ship that was buried with the king is crazy amazing, such a treasure and so old. Keep in mind you have to check your camera at the door or pay a camera fee. We checked our camera without any issues, but did remove the SD card first. A few pointers. There will be hundreds of people trying to sell you things and a lot of ‚Äúrandom‚Äù people that offer to take your photo. If you have somebody your camera even if they say they won‚Äôt charge you, they will (unless they are another tourist or obviously a guide). If a police officer wants to help you in any way, they will want a tip. If you take a photo of somebody that is there to sell you something, they will want a tip. The camels and horses smell so bad, I am sure if you ride one you can throw out your closing including your shoes. If your there to enjoy yourself and just ignore the people trying to sell you something, you will have the time of your life!"
"Absolutely brilliant! No wonder this is a wonder of the world. The main pyramid stands out among the rest of the lot, owing to its delicate bricks layout and the way one sits on another. Its a piece of art that fascinates so much. Beware of the hawkers though!"
"Touring the Great Pyramids with a personal guide and driver is a must. Our tour guide Reham Shawky and driver Ibrahim Essa, did a fantastic job of making sure we had an early start on our first day in Cairo/ Giza -to see the Great Pyramids, the Sphinx, Valley Temple, the Sakkara complex and Old Kingdom‚Äôs Capital , Memphis.This first days journey was comfortable and good pace. Our driver was able to drive us right up to the sites. Once there, Reham share the facts and fun side notes about the World Heritage sites. She knew just the right places to take the perfect picture and would even take some pictures of us (little things like taking a picture make for a great tour).Reham is a licensed guide, She has a Masters degree in Egypt History. She is very knowledgeable and approachable with questions, even about her daily life as a guide and mom during the busy tourist season. She is excellent guide and speaks beautiful English. If you are needing a guide for a tour, my husband and I would highly recommend Reham."
"My egyptian fiance and I took a car to go around the pyramids and we had a great time! It‚Äôs true that there is people trying to sell camel trips and more but as you say ‚Äûla, shukran‚Äú (No, thank you) in a serious way they leave you Alone. Just be prepared that you have to show that you are definitely not interested. The entry price of 200pound for foreigners is super fair and we paid small extra money to See the Pharaos boat. That was super cool! We didnt Go inside the pyramid and I think that was a good Choice. Since we went on a friday ( public holiday) we were a little concerned it would be crowded so we went early from 9 to 11 in the Morning. There were not many people, also not that many sellers and you have a lot of opportunities to take a great picture! The pyramids are huge and very impressive as well as the Sphinx! To the animals: I agree it is not nice that camels and horses have to pull Big and many tourists up the hill to the photo point but I‚Äòve seen way worse. You don‚Äôt need to take an Animal, you Can walk ( altough in Summer that might be tough.. I think it will roughly take 45 min to Go to the photo Point which is nice But not necessary for your Perfect pyramid day) or Just take a car ( Can order in an App, we paid 300 pound for having the car plus driver 3 Hours plus 35 EGP car entry fee) To the people complaining so much about the animal abuse: think about not eating them, cause i am quiet sure most of you do. Bring water as you can Not buy it there üòä"
"surreal to be standing right there, in front of the pyramids and the sphinx. got some great photos and marveled at the wonder of these ancient structures."
"Words are not enough to describe of how clever people were those days. Having an excellent local guide she told us a lot of things about the history behind, the way they were build up and general. What was disapointing it was the camel ride. It wasnt worth of the money we've paid (and it was already a discounted one). The boy that lead the camels didn't care much about us and on the way when we asked him to take some pics he was asking again and again for a good tip. Pics were very far and he didn't seem to care about us at all. After giving him a tip he said is small but ok.... A tip is a gift my lil man... : ("
"I think it goes without saying that if you're visiting Egypt you have to see the Pyramids.  They're one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World for a good reason; they're absolutely amazing to see and truly iconic.  I've heard of some people being disappointed when seeing them in person, but I can't understand why.  They are exactly what I expected and seeing them in-person in simply a great experience.  Since we were here, of course we paid for the extra ticket to go inside the great pyramid.  Was there anything to see inside?  No, not especially.  Was it worth it though?  Definitely.  Just to be able to go inside the pyramid is an experience you simply can't have anywhere else, and since we were there, we just had to do it."
This is a must do visit. We enjoyed walking around and visit the pyramids. We went into the middle one. We also went for a carriage ride. Make sure you do not get cheated. It is 350 pound per carriage and not per person.
"Let's be fair - The Great Pyramids of Giza are great indeed and there is no doubt in that. It's people who make the place horrible - from thousands of school kids who want a selfie or a picture to pushy sellers who want to make money on you no matter what. The only thing you want while you are there, is just to be left alone or leave the place asap!I believe the government or tourism department should look into the issue, as it is a shame that your own people are scaring the tourists away from such a beautiful historical place!On the way out we've made another mistake of taking a road through the real slum on the to the entrance. That was a truly appalling and shocking view to see how people right behind the touristy pyramids exist. Overall, it's definitely a place to see, but be ready that the experience won't be pleasing."
"Cheops or Khufu is beyond words. It is the largest thing made by humans ( and other sources) and without comparison.They say 25 years to build it. At 2,300,000 blocks weighing around 10-30 tonnes each, that is one block every 3 minutes - if you assume daylight hours only. Forget the flood season interfering - oh they floated all the blocks down the Nile, so that‚Äôs 92,000 blocks a year, every year or 21 per hour. Chiselled our with COPPER or BRONZE tools, finished to 3-5mm tolerance over the face 2-5M long.(8,760 hrs X 25 years /2 divide into 2.3M - yes, not possible.)This structure should not exist . Simples."
Words cannot describe the splendor of the entire site.  Plan several hours to take it all in. We decided to do a camel ride and were  glad we did.  Avoid doing the light show at night. It is total waste of time and money.  It is very dated.
"Visiting the pyramid was the highlight of our Egypt tour. To be there, up close is a sight to behold. It was the first of the seven wonders of the world and has withstood all odds for more than four thousand years!We stood there for a while and gazed at the Great Pyramid in all its ancient glory and majesty. What an unforgettable experience!We made the right decision to enter the Great Pyramid despite warning that one has to walk bending forward and the lack of oxygen. Only a third of our tour group chose to be inside this great structure.It was an amazing experience climbing the narrow stairway, which is bi-directional, to the Great Gallery before reaching the King's Chamber.Though what we could see is just a lidless stone sarcophagus (no mummy) in a big space with high ceiling.  It was an out-of-this-world experience to know that we were standing in the heart of the Great Pyramid and I let that moment sink in and sear into my mind.Totally worth it to visit."
"As I gazed at the Giza Pyramids after visiting them, I realized that the sun has been setting behind them for over 1.4 million times. Take your time when visiting the majestic pyramids of the Giza Plateau. Universally recognized around the world; these imposing structures have been a tourist attraction since they were built over four thousand years ago. Anyone who comes to Egypt visits the pyramids, be it the modern tourist of today or the tourist of yesterday, Napoleon or Julius Caesar. The three pyramids of Khufu, Krafre and Menkuara are a outstanding site as nothing beats taking a photograph of them on a sunny day. This was the second time visiting these wonders (first in 2010 and now in 2020). I found that an winter‚Äôs morning, the three pyramids are shrouded in early morning fog which makes an eerie photographic opportunity. And that by the afternoon, when the fog had lifted the photograph is clearer. However, on the day of my last visit, it was sprinkling spots of rain and overcast at times. A strange day when it rains in Cairo. Plenty of camel rides to be had along with touts selling all sorts of things. We somehow managed to be there on a public holiday which added to the thrall and the experience."
"Been dreaming to see pyramids since I was kid and now I saw and touched them. AMAZING structure, I really believe they are made by alien. Entrance fee 200EP, alot of people will try to make money, if you speak in arabic better so if you want to refuse you can tell them, some are aggresive telling you why im refusing them and not minding them, i only tell them I want to be alone and say no thank you. Guards also will not help you, you are really on your own but be firm and smile, they just want to make a living.One guy told me I can go up in one of the stones, eventually guards whistled on me and says not allowed. Funny that he will not say anything to the guy only to me that its not allowed. Anyways overall pyramids are worth it. I didnt go inside the pyramid for me seeing them up close and touched them is enough. I Dont want to ruin something inside or even outside. Teenage locals are very friendly with foreigner. ‚ù§"
"Still can't believe that I saw the pyramids last week. When we decided to book a last minute holiday to Sharm el Sheikh last week, we did not plan to visit Cairo, but we decided to book the day trip by flight with Redsea rep at the hotel. We spent nearly 2hrs here. Loved every minute! I am not a fan of dark, narrow places. So we didn't go inside."
"Seeing and touching the Pyramids is the experience of a lifetime. The pyramids are made of stone blocks about a meter cubed. How these heavy blocks were hoisted up and placed in correct position to build these huge structures over four millennia ago is a wonder. There is an entry to the tunnel going into the pyramid at about 15-20 ft. height above the ground level. The public can enter and walk into the tunnel for a short distance, paying an entry fee. We reached the Pyramids before 7 am, but there were already several tourist buses in the parking area. In another hour the crowd of tourists had swelled. Its best to reach early."
Must see sight in Egypt. Very touristic but worth it. Bring a bunch of small bills either dollars or $10 Egyptian pounds to tip everyone for everything.
"One of the world's wonder situated in Cairo Egypt. You must visit at least once in your lifetime. You can buy the combined ticket to see the Plateau, the Great pyramid and the boat museum, which is 500 Egyptian pounds. make sure you are wearing comfortable walking shoes and a good covered dress for walking and climbing. It is a great experience to walk bending your body in the tunnel to reach the inner chambers of the Pyramid. unfortunately the inner chamber is empty. This is a must-visit in Egypt."
Mind blowing experience. Arrived very early in the morning and we have the whole place to ourselves. Truly a must visit attraction / place in our  lifetime.  
"Great place. Be sure to go inside and see the tunnel, gallery and kings chamber..not for the unfit or claustrophobic. DO NOT show your ticket to anyone but the doorman. Be sure to go on the camel ride"
"Of course, its the reason why all tourists come to Egypt in thousands every year.  An Engineering Marvel, Huge Structure, Beauty meets the expectation.  Many things to do in the Giza Complex.The entire place is called Giza Platea which hosts # great Pyramids along with 6 small ones for queens and many small ones. Of course not to forget the old and mysterious Sphinx (believed to be of 8000-12000yrs old).We started the tour with the Light and Sound Show in the evening. Bit disappointed and not that impressive for all of us. The light part is fine but the sound part not clear and not something that makes you cling on.Next-day Morning we went to Giza Plateau to witness the wonders. Mesmerised by the view of 3 pyramids. You need to buy an additional ticket to enter into the largest Pyramid and its worth and must buy. You will witness the chamber deep inside the Pyramid after passing through 2-3 channels.  Very old people and pregnant ladies or people with back issues, better avoid as you have to bend and climb narrow ducts.Not to miss the massive sphinx located in the same plateau. Another must do will be - Camel Ride around the Pyramids (1 hr) or a ride on Horse cart which is, of course, more comfortable). They charge some 350 EGP for camel per person. For the horse cart, they charge for 3 people and take the fourth one for free if you negotiate."
Loved seeing the pyramids live. Try not to do the camel rides as we avoided those so camels didn't have to be put through the cruelty of walking in the hot sun. But otherwise we did ATVs around the pyramids as well on a different day and every time i saw them it was such a magical experience. Would return again just to live in that moment!
