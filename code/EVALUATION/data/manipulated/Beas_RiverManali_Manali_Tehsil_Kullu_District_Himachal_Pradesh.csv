"I didn‚Äôt really stop at this river for rAfting,but the views I had enroute Manali were breathtaking! Loved the view of the river and the gushing sound and the cool breeze!"
Calm & serene...the timeless flowing of water will enchant your mind & heart. Look at the snow capped mighty Himalayas at the backdrop. Enjoy the local fish cuisine at any riverside restaurant. Great experience!
"Meandering through breath-taking mountain-sides, the Beas river flows along the road-side. Singing a delightful melody of it's own, it gushes down lush green slopes. Many adventure companies provide rafting and paragliding experiences, but make sure that they are licensed and take all the safety measures before venturing for any of these adventures. The riverbank can be a heavenly spot where you can enjoy some moments of serenity."
Taken a river rafting in the Bea's river for five km and it's been a wonderful experience for us. Our kids enjoyed the most of the rafting for five km.
It was my first river rafting experience. Enjoyed a lot. Beautiful river and scenery. Must visit place for kulu Manali trip
"Did River rafting here, it was an experience to remember. Make sure you opt for the option to record the video on GoPro camera, as it captures great memories. The water was clean and really cold. Don't forget to pack extra pair of clothes, we you will need them after completing this activity. I would strongly recommend doing river rafting, for the great experience it provides."
"The whole manali town is located on d banks of dis ferocious river.. Guzzling water, sushing sound.. Below 0 degree water.. Its a beauty to watch.. Flowing from the lap of Himalayas meandering ots way...it indeed is a art of God.. Beautiful!"
Who doesn't love the sound of the flowing river? There is a peace in that sound and beas river is the perfect. Take time out in evening and sit next to the river bank.
The river flows along your path for the best road trip of your life!! Immerse in the beauty of the nature here amidst the mountains. Enjoy the cute village scenes along the way.
This falls throughout Manali..with lovely White and Grey round  pebbles. Falling beneath beautiful snow mountains. People do river rafting as well. Very broad river. Most places so many BIIIIGGG stones and makes river falling noisy and exited.
"go upstream along the river towards the old manali for a better quieter place, sit along the river absorb in the sound of the water flow. its nothing less than meditation."
"Did not do river rafting this time around when visiting Manali, since we had young kids, but this is an extremely beautiful river to sit around and enjoy the natural beauty.Since water from the dam can be released any time without prior notice, you are now barred from entering the waters at many scenic spots. So keep a note of this."
"Probably you have seen various river in Himalaya. Now how Bea's is different! Still now the river is not polluted in the name of religion (but anthropogenic affect is there).The greenery along the bank, the colour of foliage, serene view of snow capped mountain and the clear and colourless water is something different from other rivers. Enjoy the beauty of Beas enroute Kullu to Manali. Higher at Manali it's more clean. But it lost its charm after the Dam near Mandi. Few places rapids are too good. I was coming back from Manali on Buddha Purnima, during evening the river was like flowing molten silver. It was the high point of my trip. That view I will never forget in my life."
"Opt for 3km, unless you are a hardcore adventure lover. See to that you have landed up with right people, and what they offer and what they provide is the same. Ask those who have completed rafting for reviews."
The shores of this river are so calm and peaceful. Did river rafting here and had an amazing experience. Surely the best place to relax and have some peacefull time.
"All throughout Manali right from Start to end you will find Beas river flowing along. Water gushing through rocks and greenery is a scene to behold. During rainy season, the water level is quite high which might be dangerous to stroll around the river. Other times, the river can be visited at various designated places throughout its course for a peaceful sit out and some awesome photography shots. Many river sports are also organised at several places. Enjoy."
"In most parts of Manali, the Beas river has some of the clearest water I have seen of the rivers in Himachal Pradesh.One of the top reasons you enjoy Manali, as the sound of running river water is itself therapy. Find a spot on the side where they serve maggi and hot chai(I suggest the spot below the bridge to old Manali), and settle down. Bliss!"
Sitting aside the Beas River is one of the best things to do in Manali. That feeling is worth a million dollars. The moving water sound and calmness of this place are so mesmerizing that you will get lost in it.
"Great to do River rafting. Please ensure that you do not overpay. the drivers of your vehicle have tie ups here and will take you to the place where they intend to. Do your research. Pay the price that is appropriate for the season. For Dec, it is around 3K for 2 people in an individual raft. if you share, max 6, it will be less."
We were blessed by Lord to have experienced this rapturous feeling of thrillful River Rafting on Beas River. We had our parents who are senior citizens and they throughly enjoyed rafting as guide professionally manuevered our raft in rapids. There icy cold sweet water was delight and rains added cherry on top. We rented the entire raft which was reasonable then paying for 5 individual people. Rowing bars and wet suit were provided. Highly recommend traventure guru manager Manu for this adventure. Read more on my other Manali reviews.
The river is simply priceless. We travelling by road from Kullu to Manali and practically found every twist and turn of this river that runs alongside to be abundant with natural beauty. Feels like heaven on earth.
"Enjoyed thrilling, adventure on the bank of Beas river in Manali.water is clean and cold. It's length is 470 km. It flows from a height of 14300 ft approx at Rohtash Pass which is 40 km from Manali. This river has a lot of history from Alexander . It is called Bipasa in sanskrit. It meets into Sutlej river in Punjab. Luni, Ban ganga are its tributaries.Its source is Beas Kund. Heavy flow is its beauty. There are provision of lot of amusement on its bank in Manali. Safe for rafting. It is one of the best place for meditation. It is near to Hidimba temple. We went along with Sanyasi of Tapashya Osho center and did meditation."
"From the moment you enter Manali , or even before that , River Beas, becomes your companion. And everywhere you go , River Beas flows by your side , sometimes on your right and then suddenly it will appear on your left. Looks like it‚Äôs playing pee-a-boo , teasing you. Sparkling , gurgling , full of life ! So many tourist , rush from one spot to another , ignoring this beautiful flowing river . Make sure , you spare some time to sit by river side and listen to it‚Äôs soothing sounds. It‚Äôs nothing less than meditation that will refresh you , washing all your stress.You can choose variety of spots to enjoy it‚Äôs company. Adventure lovers can go for rafting too , otherwise enjoy Hot tea and Maggi as you sit dipping your feet in playful waters. For sure , this is one thing most of us can‚Äôt dream of doing in our home cities.Just one word of caution - This river tends to swell all of a sudden , due to rains or increased water flow. Do not venture much deep into it , unless the spot is inhabited with locals."
Tourists are destroying the local eco system. Don't go deep inside as it can be dangerous. Water is always cold.
It reminds you of life..... the free flowing river that is just like life.... small tributries join in to give it a dynamic look .... small moments of life combine to make life beautiful...  Spending some time near the bank of the river will make you philosophically reflect on life. DO PAY A VISIT...... you will love it.
Visited Man√£li for 10 days. This river was the second amazing thing after the mountains sights. Gave it 4 üòÅ
"If you are travelling by road, this river will continue through out your most of the route. Be cautious while photography."
"A river with a lot of force. Pristine, serene and just out of the world. Dipping feet in water can be quite relaxing. Though the water is very cold."
The beas river covers almost all Manali and it's neighbouring areas. The flow is always good over here. You can hear the sound of river echo in all of Manali. Visit a cafe which next to the river for a better experience.
"Beas river invoked mixed reactions in us. After experiencing the beautiful Teesta in Sikkim, we were looking forward to having Beas as our companion during our jouney to Manali. The river was beautiful at times- gushing, bubbling, like a playful girl, flowing over the pebbles and rock. But most part of its course, the river has been reduced to a narrow stream, littered with plastic waste, clothes and what not. In Manali too it was no different. People have made it into a waste dumping ground. Many places we saw that nearby restaurants/hotels/home-stays dispose waste and sewage water into the river. At Club House when we we went down to the river to get a better view, we were heartbroken. It was stinking. Sewage water from nearby establishments was flowing into the river. So much plastic and clothes dumped in. River was hardly flowing.It was so lifeless and dark- not her usual self. We couldn't stand there for a minute. We wish the administration did something to save her from this painful death, that they take stringent measures to ensure that she is kept clean. Enforce rules and laws to prevent her encroachment. Or else, very soon she will cease to exist. And that will be a crime by us-each one of us will be responsible for her death."
The sight of beas river flowing in Manali-Kullu valley is a treat to watch. Wild river rafting is a life time experience. Never miss this. There are government authorized agencies with well trained personnel. You can have short or a long course. Take long course (about 8 km in the river) if possible. It is worth every penny you pay. The raft guy takes videos while rafting from a good quality helmet camera. They are worthy but little expensive. There is a scope to bargain but may not get great discount since government has fixed rates. Carry one set of clothing. You need to change after rafting.
"Went to the beas river and experienced icy cold water on our feet. Had snacks near the river and tea, excellent."
Clear water gushing thru valley. Try approaching river on your way to solang. Very quiet and place to enjoy
"you will find rafting booths on the way to Manali on the river Beas side. We went during mid march and the river was not so huge with water. but a very good experience . we had a an extremely experienced guide from  Nepal. We had lilttle bit of thrill ride. it will cost you 3000 to 6000 for pack of 4 depends on the length of journey. water lever will be high and rough when the summer picks up and ice melts. was told if will be much more rough ride. you will defiantly enjoy this rafting experience. try to get in to some water related cloths, coz u will get wet. carry extra cloths"
"You can't miss this in Manali and often will come across this river. Beas was flowing few hundred meters away from our Vashist Home Stay and the river sound in the night was soothing. Used to sit in the Balcony (cold though :-)) and listen to this sound. As per the law you are not supposed to enter (what we heard from our driver) but there are some open spaces where you can access the river and touch and feel the water. There are few adventure activities organized by private operators - river rafting, hot air balloon (just goes up and comes down, not a actual flight though) - i tried to book but the wind direction was suddenly changed and was a bit scary. so we gave up. this is near Vashist. Otherwise, go down, touch the river, feel it and more importanly take few pictures."
