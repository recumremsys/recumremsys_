"I took a cab from Jammu in the morning on 17 October and went straight to Banganga Army Camp, Katra. Being a veteran, Indian Navy, got the Yatra registration slip from there otherwise you have to get the same at the bus stand, Katra. Then started the spiritual journey on a pony which you have to hire from the designated booth for this purpose. The weather was awesome, entire Trikuta Hills, the abode of Ma Vaishno were cover with mist. In one hour I reached Ardhkwari which is 6 KM from Katra. Fromthere went on foot via Himkoti to Bhawan a distance of 5.5 KM. Hired locker to put my stuff & did excellent Darshan entering through Army Gate or else you have to register to get your group & turn for the Darshan on the designated point there on arrival. All indications & help are available from the Na. Wish o Devi Shrine board. Thereafter had a wonderful Rava Masala Dosa & South Indian filter coffee at  Sagar Ratna restaurant priced very reasonably. I also  enjoyed the Ropeway ride to visit Bhairon Mandir. This is an excellent facility & costs just 100 INRs for the return trip. Return journey to Katra by walk & pony was completed in 2 hours comfortably. The standard of cleanliness is very high throughout. There is no bargaining or any unnecessary nuisance. All facilities are available on the way. A must visit even if you are not religiously inclined. It’s a tourist delight giving you a great opportunity for a spiritual & physical work out. I could cross over 40K steps on my Fitbit despite using a mix of pony rides & walking. Jai Mata Di 🙏"
We started our walk from Banganga at 7 pm and reached Bhavan at 1 am . Had very good darshaan as it was not too crowded then.
"so I went to this yatra after 14 years approximately and believe me a lot has changed since then. I would try to answer all the questions that were in my mind before I began this journey so anyone having the same questions could benefit from this.so i started off from mumbai by air landed jammu. there are prepaid taxi available at the airport for rs.1500 approx one way. they also offer a drop at the helipad .there is a requirement of registering for the yatra and get a yatra registration parchi which is kind of your entry ticket no matter which mode of darshan you choose. it is free of cost and lot of counters are available. one counter is also available at the airport. keep in mind the validity of the parchi, you gotta start your journey within that time.HELICOPTER: if you choose the helicopter way here is what you need to know (atleast what i can help you with)1) helicopter booking is only available online. booking start 2 months prior to your date of darshan in simple terms make sure you book 2 months in advance for a sure shot ticket. the tickets are available by registering on the official shrine board site.2) there is also a current booking counter but that simply means you may get a heli ticket in case of cancellations out of the advance booked tickets3) the current booking counters opens at 6 am in the morning but the line starts as early as 4 am. only after the counter opens you will know your fate that if any cancellations are there to accomodate you.it is pure luck you might get a ticket as late as 4 pm and still make it to the the helipad before the last heli takes off that is around 5-5.30 pm. so you gotta decide an upper limit upto which you want to wait before you take other alternativesas for me the counter opened at 6 and closed at 7 and i wasn't in the first 20 to get the ticket but i decided to wait little more and finally thanks to god, the counter opened up again at 9 and i got in the second lot. there were a lot of cancellations during my visit because of the recent attacks in jammu. i would suggest prebook the heli tickts if possible.4) once you land on the sanjhichat the main bhavan is a 3 km walk downwards. you can hire a pony or a palkhi which is easily available outside sanjhichat5) after the darshan next step is bhairav temple. which was my faviourite part. the new ropeway facility made it possible to cover the 3 km distance in a mere one minute time. and back in one minute. your time gets cut down to 10-15 mins for bhairav darshan.in the helicopter scenario if you do not go downwards you miss the adhkuwari but your main bhavan and bhairav can be covered in half time considering the crowd. hope this helps in planning your trip jaimatadi"
"We (me and my wife) went to Vaishno Devi temple on May 2017. I had booked SSVP aarti. We landed on Jammu and went straight to Niharika and checked in there (part of the SSVP package). We got a AC room but as their was no electricity the AC was not on, but the room was decent. We took rest for around 30 mins, freshen up, left our luggage at the cloak room in Niharika and left for Banganga. It took us almost 5 hrs to reach Bhawan from Banganga (we took lot of rest in between). Do carry you cameras as the view is good and very scenic. Also, if you have booked for SSVP then you dont need to deposit anything in the cloak rooms, so carry whatever you want to (but keep it light). Once you reach Bhawan, you dont need to stand in the queue and get a group number assigned (if you have booked for SSVP) you can directly go to counter no.4 (you need to walk around extra 1 km roughly). You just need to show your reservation print out, photo Id's and present the card through which you made the booking. The room at the Bhawan is nice, we had some water issues as there was some pipeline problem but that got partially resolved. The food is of good quality. We rested in the Bhawan at night and reported back to counter 4 at 5.45 am from there we went inside to the aarti area (just outside the holy cave). Everyone was given a aarti book and a Jai mata di headband. We sat there for sometime and then went inside the holy cave, they made us stand as per our height and then allowed us to get inside the holy cave where we could see the main panditji performing the puja. There is enough space for 10 people to stand. After the puja we were given Prasad and was again taken back to the aarti area we sat there for some more time (till the aarti got over) and then were back in our room. It was honestly a divine experience. We had our breakfast and then we left for Bhaironnath Mandir. Although it is just a 3km distance, the climb is more steep. While climbing down we took the steps and where back in Banganga in around 2:30 mins. Note - Avoid taking stairs while climbing up."
Visited Jammu with family and travelled to Mayra. Then by helicopter to Martha temple. The visit was awesome and the travel by helicopter was superb. The Devine temple and its atmosphere creates a new mind
"I was planning to go to Mata Rani ( VAISHNO DEVI TEMPLE ) from eight years ago when my prayers were answered ( My wife was sick ). We went last October ( 2019 ). People say you cannot go unless Mata calls you. Go there ,Mata will do miracle. But Helicopter trip is cancelled sometime due to low visibility."
"Day 1 We reached Jammu Tawi at around 830 AM by the Duronto Express from Delhi - train was 1 hour late. We had read a lot about how taxis fleece us for the Katra trip and the need to display our bargaining skills. None of that happened as we checked with the Prepaid taxi operator's stand right opposite Jammu Tawi. Very well mannered people and we got a taxi which took us to Katra in 1.5 hours (Basic taxi costs Rs.1,100 plus tolls). Drivers are well mannered. If you book a return at the same time, you get Rs.200 off and have to pay only Rs.2,000/-. Proper receipt is issued at the taxi stand.We checked in to the rooms Spiritual Growth Centre which we had pre-booked on the shrine board website and spent the day walking around Katra town, enquiring about routes, preparing for darshan the next day etc. There are restaurants for all budgets located near the bus stand. The weather was unusually pleasant in December.Day 2 - We had breakfast and took an auto from bus stand to Banganga checkpost (Rs.100 as per the tariff chart). We hired 3 horses @ Rs.700 each to Bhawan.(again, the rates are mentioned in the tariff board - so no need to bargain). The horses know their way and the horsemen run behind the horses, egging them on. The foot paths are roofed for major part of the journey and are completely paved. So the pilgrims are protected from rains. There are shops selling food stuff, darshan items etc. all along the way. The horse ride took us 2.5 hours, including a short break mid way. We learnt that the same journey takes 4-5 hours by foot. The major drawback appears to be having the same pathway for both horses and pedestrians, who are forced to move to the side whenever horses pass by.Once we reached Bhavan, we asked the horsemen to wait and take us to Bhairon Cave as well and later drop us at the helipad. They wanted the same Rs700 to cover their return as well which we felt was not much. All items, including shoes, pens, combs, cell phones, bags etc. need to be deposited at lockers provided free of cost near the main gate. Keep only your purse and loose change when you enter the temple. Luckily the crowds were moderate and we finished our darshan within 30 minutes. After that, we began the ascent to Bhairon’s cave. This is much steeper. But for the horses, I doubt if we could have ever managed this. This takes around 45 minutes and by 130 PM we got dropped at the helipad for the return trip. We had booked helicopter tickets in advance and the journey time took us just 10 minutes. After that we took an auto from the Katra helipad to the bus stop @Rs.50 per person (shared ride). By 2:30 PM we were back at Katra.Day 3After taking adequate rest. (3 hours on horse back wreaks havoc on your back and joints), we took the taxi back to Jammu. Jai Mata Di."
It was awesome place. we started out yatra around 7 in the eve and reached bhawan around 5 in the morning. its upto you how fast you walk as we are doing out yatra with my parents so it took around 10 hrs but it was awesome. we attended moring arti which is wonderful. need to deposit all the belonging in the locker whcih is near by the place you stand for queue for holy cave darshan than we started our journey  to bharon baba temple which is around an hr time to reach and one can have incrediable pic from such height. it is said that without bharon baba temple darshan vaishno devi yatra is incomplete
"We decided to Seek for Blessings from Maa Vaishno Devi to commence our Journey to Kashmir. Had a Very Peaceful & Quick Darshan. Weather during the Daylight was very Warm, but surprisingly Weather after the SunSet changes in Contrast to very Chilly & Cold."
"I have been to Mata Vaishno Devi Mandir Katra many times but this time I visited with family. We had booked helicopter tickets which is good based on my understanding from other reviews. So planned to go with it. Booking can be done only in official website of Mata Vaishno Devi Ji.We enjoyed a lot with all our journey by the blessing of Mata Ji and also attend the Arti in Mata da Darbar which was amazing for all of us. After doing darsan we started to move back. We wish Ma Vaishno Devi gives happiness, health and wealth to all the  visitors who visited this holy place."
"We started our journey to Katra from Amritsar by road on a hired car. It took us about 7 hours to reach Katra via Jammu. People should know once they enter Jammu no prepaid mobile numbers work only postpaid numbers work. Katra can also be reached by train or flight up to Jammu and from Jammu by road.We had booked early morning helicopter service for reaching Sanjhichhat. We booked it online from the official website of Vaishno Devi shrine board. The booking opens 60 days before the date of visit and a return trip costs INR 2010. It is very efficient and takes 4 minutes to take you to Sanjhichhat helipad.  From there it is a walk of about 2 1/2 kms that takes about half an hour. There is also palanquin and ponnies service available, those who have difficulty in walking may avail the service. Palanquin service for one person costs INR 2500 for a return trip. You also require a Yatra slip which can be booked online. The walk from Sanjichat to the temple was not tiring as the road was well maintained. There are many  shops on the way from where one can purchase the items for puja and offerings. Once you are near the temple you have to keep all your belongings in the lockers available there and can carry only valuables. There are many entrances and you have to be in the queue. We visited on a Monday and was off season so it took us less than an hour to have the divine darshan. We were  lucky to be taken through the old cave that's open for public rarely these days due to large numbers of pilgrimages. Passing through the narrow cave isn't easy and is an experience itself. By the grace of Devi we had a very good darshan and could stay for some time and do the offerings properly due to being a less crowded day. There are many restaurants and refreshments shops available. All servings are strictly vegetarian. From Vaishno Devi, one should go and visit Bhairo Baba temple as it's said the visit to Vaishno Devi is incomplete without visiting Bhairo Baba temple. Bhairo Baba temple is further up the hill and a walk of about 3 kms. The climb up to the temple is very steep and us stressful. Palanquin and ponnies services are available. We consider us to be very fortunate to have visited the Vaishno Devi temple without any obstacles by the grace of Devi. Jai Matadi."
"KATRADistance from Katra Bus stand to Banganga (1km max)We reached there by 12pmWe started walking and reached Banganga by 12:45pmWe had Yatra Parchi, so we entered BangangaBANGANGAEntry point for Yatra, a proper check of your baggage and body will take place.(NOTE: NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE ANY TOBACCO, CIGARETTE, HOWEVER I WILL RECOMEND DONOT TAKE IT AS THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF OTHER CHECK POSTS DURING THE YATRA AND YOU CAN BE EASILY CAUGHT, ALSO NO HARM TO LEAVE THESE ITEAMS FOR A DAY OR TWO)Also I had my Canon DSLR (this was allowed to carry, however be mindful and you will be carrying extra few kgs, so ask your self first as do you really want to carry this..... but when i carried this, and clicked some wonderful pics, trust me the load was paid off)So, soon after crossing the security check, we had a free lunch at T-Series langar, which is just after you cross the check post. Then I sent my wife and kido on pony( Rs 350 till Adhkuwari)BANGANGA - ADHKUWARIIf you are traveling by your own, this is the only toughest segment as the height is approx 2000 ft, with a distance of 6KM.(I am 35yrs old, didnt find it very easy). However with some stopover and regular water consumption, this distance was covered by us in 4 hrs.(in our group the youngest girl was of 7yrs and oldest person was of 45yrs, my kido is of 3yrs hence sent her along with my wife on pony, trust me I later on realized that how wise that decision was)Also If you are traveling in winters, donot wear heavy winter jackets as you will take that off soon after you start tracking.Instead you can wear small woolen sweaters and carry you heavy jackets in bag.(only you need jackets, if you plan to stay at Adhkuwari or Bhawan, other wise if you plan to return the same day then you dont even need them at all. Note: Temp dramatically drops after sunset)ADHKUWARI (18/12/2016)Similar to Jammu Tawi, we had our dormitory beds booked at Shailputri Bhawan (Rs 120 per Bed). This place is just 100meter from Adkuwari Temple.One room had 12 sets of bunk beds (24 people in one room), Blankets were provided for free (with a refundable deposit of  Rs 500/blanket). Even like Jammu Tawi, this boarding place was also very clean and well maintained. The entire hotel had only dormitory beds and still they had geyser in bathrooms."
"Situated about 40 kms from Jammu is Katra from where one starts the 'yatra' on foot for about 13 kms to reach the holy shrine. Chanting Jai Mata Di' the worshippers gain energy and confidence that the can reach the holy shrine. Enroute there are many food and refreshment stalls. Helicopter, pony and doli service are also available. Katra is now accessible by train also."
"I had the privilage to visit Vaishnu Devi, a very holy shrine for Hindus after 27 years again. The trip was enjoyable due to fine weather and excellent arrangement of the shrine board. Walking through the Trikuta mountain under green envirnment was very refreshing and enjoyable."
"We had visited Vaishno Devi temple with family and it needs an entire day. Even if you travel on horse (Khacchar) it is tiring as the final lap you need to walk (climb up). Walking all the way up takes you around 3 hours with breaks. Even if you take a helicopter or any other means, you need to walk the last leg of the journey. The security is very heavy with check 6 points which scans you completely. It is understandable considering the state affairs. Its best to haggle with the horse keepers to take you to the top. The arrangements are excellent, with water provision, clean toilets, eating joints all through out the steep climb. The shrine also has an ashram to stay at a very economical rate and seemed very clean. In the final leg, you cant take anything inside, no wallet, no prasad nothing, just you and yourself, you get lockers to keep all our stuff before you enter the shrine. Finally when you visit the divine deity, it is all worth your efforts."
went there this november after diwali.was impressed with the management of shrine board. the path was well lit and clean. toilet facilities available all along the path.Excellent views and great darshan. every person should visit at least once and feel blessed.Jai Mata Di.
"Reached Katra by Train early morning at 5:30 am. Checked in the luggage in hotel and after getting refreshed, Started walk at 9:30 AM from BANGANGA check post, with young kids 9 and 13 years old. As it had rained the previous night with hail, it was very cold and by morning it started to rain for 30 min. So the start was bit delayed.Reached Ardhkumari at 1 pm. This first 6 km of walk is the most steep one. really tough for legs. People take to stairs also , but some say to avoid it. So it is up to you if you are fit then steps is lot preferred. This trail is very busy with walkers, ponies, palkies and shops. Because of ponies it stinks a lot all the way to Ardhkumari. From there onward last 5 km to Bhawan, there is separate ways for ponies and pilgrims, so much better and fresh air. All the way well laid out path, mostly covered to protect from sun and rain ( no need to carry umbrella or rain jackets). Water, snacks ,beverages , ice cream, and food available all along the way.Keep your hands free.Toilet facilities are conveniently located along the way approx at every two km. But it stinks and could have been maintained well. BUT SOMETHING IS AVAILABLE.Reached bhawan at 03:30 pm, with lots of stop on the way, and cool drinks break for kids every hour.First thing first get your Yatra parchi stamped before start, in between and also at top for online they do only at the top.Book online in advance for accommodation at Bhawan, other wise you will end up sleeping on walk ways around the bhawan. Blanket's are available free of cost. We have seen people taking there luggage all the way to the top, prefer to keep the luggage at Katra as it is very difficult for the first timers like us to take the luggage to top.Before getting in Darshan queue, you have to lock all bags, phones, cameras, and shoes in locker room. Just go with prashad, parchi and wallet. if the queue is long carry a bottle of water. Toilet Facilities available along the way while standing in queue. Common people enters from gate no 3 and VIP pass holders from gate 5 ( VIP pass must be obtained from katra)Our dharshan finished within 1 hr.Sign boards in Hindi and English are very well marked and placed at right place for directions. Do not miss them.It would have been better if the km covered is highlighted as reflector boards every 200 meters, but black stenciling is visible at some places and not at other locations.Katra to Bhwan you can start walk any time 24 hrs, well safe and lit path. Parchi time at katra is ( 5 am to 11pm) Better to book online Yatra Parchi, to avoid queue at katra to get yatra parchi. It saves lot time. Yatra parchi counter is also located next to bus stand , along with JKTDC locker room and hotel. On way back we took ponies for all four of us and they mention different rates on the board, the pony operators negotiate some other rates and by the time you finish and ready to pay you end up paying 1.5 to 2 times the fare mentioned on the boards by the shrine trust.Helicopter service is also available but the timing and weather matters. It closes by 4:45 pm-5:00 pmOverall a wonderful experience and nice scenic view from top.Jai Mata Ji."
"We travelled from Delhi RedFort buy a overnight Bus journey to Katra by Ashok Bus Service. Suggest dont take this service as the tour operator left us only at Jammu Tawi. It was confusing how to reach katra though we took a cab and reached to our hotel. As it was peak hot summer day we decided to start for vaishnodevi in evening. Left hotel at 5PM collected our darshan tickets and took Auto to reach BangaGanga checkpost. It is a 1Km distance from city to Banganga and Auto charges Rs 100 fixed. From there after clearing secuity checks at 6 PM started climbing. As a senior citizen was with us so took Pony. Note to bargain with Pony wala. They charged Rs 1100 per head for climbing up. It took 4 hours to reach at Bhawan. As we travelled in June it was extremely crowded and stuffy. Best time to go there is in winters. Please carry some blankets or Sweaters as it is cold in the night. Inside Bhawan Mobiles, Wallets, Jewellery, etc is not allowed so keep it in lockers above. Bhawan darshan took 2 hours to complete. Post this is it is mandatory to visit Bhairon Temple 3Km from Bhawan. While descending down again we took Pony it cost Rs 900 per head on bargain. Do be careful to stay together with your family as Mobile Networks are not accessible. Shrine board need to work on Food Availability and Clean Toilets."
"We drove from Gurgaon to Katra via Jammu highway by car , roads were very nice and apparently no slopes or Hills areas, Feels you are driving on flat roads. (Bad for Nature).#We reached a day earlier to gain blessings on 31st Midnight , so we took a short visit to Patnitop . go straight to Nathuhills - it was covered in Snow and we took a guide and paid him 1500 per couple to do slopping , provided us with Gum Boots to avoid mud. Fun experience , Nathuhills opened for us at around 4 PM due to Traffic . so plan a early visit. #We Returned to Katra same night, preped ourselves for 31st Hiking to Vaishno Devi. started climbing at around 11AM , We walked all the way top by Foot , taking stairs at times to fasten the pace and reach the top by 7 PM . Now i will put Bad things first then Good things at the end as what happpened during that course of time:1.Lot of Horses , no cleanup of DUng and horse riders(pitthu) their Attitude is worst , they will run over you if you dont pay attention , so BEWARE , walk Sideways and Stop when needed2.Women Restroom - Everyone Pees in them , No cleaning , worst site , They were better once you start climbing but as you go top , they are a FEW and in bad shape. ardhjumari and Bottom one are Hygenic . I still dont get as why they dont spend MOney and awareness around TOilets for Women. Men are supposed to pee in worst so not even mentioning it here.Shrine Board can do better with Money being offered for Womens. Ironically it will be a good offering for Mata , anyday seeing less trouble for womens. I hope people understand soon the pain women go through holding the pressure and walking and trying to save themselves from Infection and getting Dehyrated avoiding waters for such a long journey. anyways old story i guess.3.People Jumping the queues ,fighting over Prasad counters, Police men slapping people (Biharis mostly) to move forward in lines , No Lockers availability , shops asking for 1000/500 rs to keep your stuff, No seperate queues for Senior Citizens apparently or specially challenged people (Because everyone is equal in God's eye) but VIPS have a privilege. anyhow , despite all that once we reach the shrine , there are 2 gates both have same Shrine as people told us, we were allowed to look at 1 sec and PUJARI shoved a Girl and Threw a Guy's Rs10 Offering , how in the World you can do that. We shouted at Wrong People , told Policemen of what was going wrong - may be in hope that next time when similar situation happens they would know that someone reminded of that previously n who knows their heart changes. Point is avoid travel on Over Crowded days as ShrineBoard is not equipped to handle such crowds or maintain discipline.   May be it was Mata rani's blessing that no major trouble happened to us and we came back safely , with a slight Hope that if there were BARS/Handles to let everyone be in line and there is more management and TOilels for WOmen- Wouldn't it be a happy trip for everyone, sshhh .. That was the wish we made .I am sharing my experience - just take the pointers home and plan better , I still would come to Vaishno Devi again - just at different time and hopefully will share the comments to Board with support and make it a better place for pilgrims like us to have a good experience for Old folks, girls. Jai Mata Di."
We visited vaishno devi in the month of may. We started our journey on 11th may at 9.00 pm. At night. This is best time to start your journey to words mandir. First you have to take entry pass. From bus stand or online or best option from your hotel. I which hotel we stayed they given us entry pass for mandir. Note.: No mobile network . In between you will get network bus less....bee along with your family.  Take water bottles and food items. Because journey is too long. We started at 9.00pm at night and reached at 4.00am by walk. You can also take pony/horse 800-1200 also you can take helicopter ride but not in night rs. 1100  per person.in arti  gate close from 5.30 to 8.00 aprox 2hr.So plan accordingly.
"I was planning to go to Vaishno Devi temple since a pretty long time and this was also my first visit to the temple. Was kinda scared as I was traveling with my 3 year old kid and was not very sure on how I would manage the climb with the kid. Foreseeing the difficulty in climbing; I’d booked to and fro helicopter service well in advance. Will explain the Itinerary in detail for clarity -Day 1 (at Katra) 8:40 AM - Reached Katra via Delhi-Katra Sampark Kranti Express. Train is the best mode to reach the nearest destination (i.e Katra) and the train made good sense. 13:00 PM - After taking some rest and bath in Katra guest house we reached helipad destination where we were informed that the service was cancelled that day due to bad weather. The cancellation worried us as we had to do the climb ourselves now. However, we moved towards BANGANGA where the climb would start. Kindly note that you can book ‘Yatra Parchi’ (kind of registration and identification for Darshana)online and this shall avoid getting into queue at BANGANGA. We opted for a stroller for the kid (charged Rs.500)  till ARDHKUMARI (which is half way through the climb). The stroller was pushed by and the person carried our bags too. 16:30 PM - The climb from BANGANGA to Ardhkumari was almost 7 km and we were completely exhausted till then. Here we had an option to go to BHAWAN (main temple) via a battery car and we opted for it. However, the counter was closed till 19 PM! After almost 3 hrs of wait we got the tickets for Battery Car and we reached BHAWAN by 20:00 PM. 20:00 PM - We were stunned by the long queue for Darshan (as Aarati is scheduled at 20:30 PM) and we didn’t have stamina now to go for Darshan. So we decided to have dinner (@ Sagar Ratna restaurant) and went to our Room which was booked in GAURI BHAWAN. We slept till 22:00 PM as we had now planned early morning Darshan for the next day. Day 2:4:00 AM - We started early as we had to do Darshan at Bhawan and rush to BHAIRAV temple and reach SANJICHHAT Helipad by 7:30 AM. We completed Maata Rani’s darshan within an hour as rush was minimal at this time of morning and then checked out of Gouri Bhawan guest house. Considering the paucity of time we booked two ponies (BHAWAN to BHAIRAV to SANJICHHAT) which costed us Rs.650 each. 5:45 AM - We reached BHAIRAV and completed our Darshan within 30 minutes. Early morning Darshan is always suggested as both mind and body are fresh. We reached SANJICHHAT by 7:30 AM as planned. 9:00 AM - Fortunately weather was good and Helicopter service was operational. We reached down within minimal time and moved to our guest house. POINTS TO NOTE:1. There are 3 Pindis in the main temple Bhawan (Mahalakshmi, Mahakali and Saraswathi). One may ignore the pindis during rush hours and time allowed to be spent in front of pindis is scarce. Hence ensure that you keep your eyes completely open and focus on the Darshan. It will be a magical moment and ensure complete attention here. 2. There are ample means of making your climb easier (helicopter, ponies, pithoos who carry the kids, palkis). However the most effective way is either to go via helicopter (if infant or elderly are there) or to do the climb oneself. By doing the climb partially, I realised the worth and is highly suggested. 3. It is recommended to make the room reservations in BHAWAN (main temple) well in advance via the Shrine Board as getting rooms at last moment is next to impossible. Also Maata Vaishno Devi’s charm is good enough to vanish our tiredness and gives us eternal strength to handle any kind of situation. The Darshan is a lifetime experience and highly recommended. Jai Mata Di 🙏"
Visited Mata Vaishno Devi Temple for first time. I was accompanied by my wife. Atmosphere was full of spirituality.
"By the blessing of matarani me and my friend with our families visited Vaishno devi mata. This was my 3rd visit.My parents my 11 month old daughter and my friend's 5 years old daughter went by helicopter. I was very tensed because I was suspecting that helicopter will not fly because of rainy season but by mata rani's grace the helicopter services resumed after 10 days on our day of visit.Remaining 5 of us started waking from baan ganga check post by 7:45 in morning. It took us 6 hrs to reach bhawan, we didn't stopped at ardhkavari. After taking some rest we went for darshan and it took us just 45 mins to do darshan and come out.Weather was bad till a day prior to our visit but on our day of visit it was clear and sunny.Everyone was very tired after reaching bhawan that nobody has stamina to go to bhairav mandir so we decide to come back from bhawan itself.It took us 5 hrs to come down. For my mother we took palki from bhawan to baan ganga and it coasted us 3500 (costlier then to and from ticket of helicopter) but as we had booked only one side helicopter booking so we didn't had any option. My father walked down by himself.My 11 months daughter was with me while walking down. We had a baby carry bag but she started feeling uncomfortable in that after an hour. And after sometime she felt asleep so I had to carry her into my lap all the way.For our 3 small bag packs and to carry my friend's 5 year daughter we hired a pitthu which charged us 500 rs.There is an option of battery operated car from bhawan to ardhkavari for senior citizens. But getting a ticket for that is the biggest challenge as there is a long queue for that and there is no advance booking for it. I think the ticket for battery operated car is 200 per head.There are food stalls all the way so you really need not to carry any food item. If you are travelling with small kids then you carry some of the food item for them.Most of the track is covered so you will be protected from direct sun light and rains if there are any. From ardhkavari if you go by new track then it's easy and less stiff.Don't miss the rajma chawal at various shrine board refreshment center.The mobile signal is available on most of the track but if you are carrying a prepaid mobile sim then it won't work in whole J&K. Only postpaid phone works here. Getting a locker at bhawan is very time consuming task, it may take more time then actual darshan. So try to carry minimal things.Jai mata di...."
"I have been to ‘Vaishno Devi’ many times but this time I visited after 7 years with my family (myself, wife and 5 year son)  and parents (senior citizens)I had booked online helicopter tickets  (Himalayan Heli) 60 days in advance for reaching Sanjichat. If you are in Jammu, take taxi, bus or train to reach Katra. In case you are coming directly from Delhi, make sure to have train ticket until Katra to reach Katra  without any hassle. It costs you around 200 rs to reach katra helipad from katra stationThere are 2 operators for helicopter service: Himalayan Heli & Global Vectra. I had booked Heli helicopter which is good based on my understanding from other reviews, so decided to go with it. It cost me 2010/- Rs for return journey- they have same day return & Next day Return. My advise is to take Next day  Return journey if  you have time and afford return trip.    Tip :- Try booking  flight for 4 PM departure from Katra Helipad and next day around 10 AM  fro Sanjichat to Katra Helipad.   Bookings can be done on only on official website of Vaishno Devi Make sure to carry the debit/credit  card used for booking flight tickets along with ID proof that you have entered while booking ticket - though it was not written on my ticket to carry card but I see people were getting hassled with this on the online ticket verification counter.From this official site, one can also book accommodation- I have booked Vaishnavi Dham accommodation which is 1 KM approx from Sanjichat and 1.5 KM from Bhawan. Considering location an important factor this is best to book . Rooms were large with attached bathroom that give hot water. In case, you have managed to get double bed room and require extra mattress/blanket- this is provided with extra cost at the reception counter.Make sure to obtain Registration slip for first day  with which you can do darshan on first day after checkin to your hotel preferred time after 9 (7-9 is the arti time during which gates are closed) . For next morning, I have booked Atka Arti tickets from official site - that costs 1000 rs per head. Children below 10 years can be accompanied free for arti.Tip:     If you have Atka Arti ticket , you do not require registration slip for next day to do darshan. Tip: When you go first day to bhawan complex for darshan make sure to show the atka arti slip for next day along with ID proofs so that they can confirm your attendance and provide the priority slip along with Sequence No. for sitting to attend arti. This will help save your time next day and you have to just reach the place to be in queue . After doing darshan first time in the evening, we have visited Bhairon mandir and managed to be back in booked accommodation at 1 AM for much needed sleep and to get ready next morning 5:30 AM for Arti which started at 6:10 AM until 8:10 AM.At the end of arti, we had first darshan before the gates get open for other people.Hope you find this useful in planning your visit to Mata Vaishno Devi.Jai mata di!!!"
"If from Delhi - Board Train Shri Shakti which directly takes you to Katra at 5 am in morning. Take a HOtel, get freshen up and after good breakfast start the rejuvenating journey. Don't take stairs else you will feel tired. After around 6 kms, Adkwari cave comes. It will take around 3 hours (Crowd dependent). Take brunch and start again for next around 7kms and your reach Maa Vaishno Bhawan. Take bath, deposit your baggage  in Cloak room and get in the quee and within 1-2 hours you will have darshan of Maa.  After this move to Bhairon Baba temple - 2 kms steep climb. and return. Try choosing a mild temperature day. Good facilities, Try booking room to rest at Bhawan online itself, as physical there may be scarcity. Free Dormitories are available at Manokamna and Parvati guest houses wher also you may change and rest a bit. Total time on average crowd may be around 12 - 14 hours (with family). Try carrying one extra set of cloths if you wish to take bath and change. Helicopter is another option which starts near Railway station and takes your to Sanjhi Chat after which its only 2 kms.JAI MAATA DI"
"We always wanted to have Ardhkuwari Darshan but never made it before this visit due to long queues and waiting time. But this time even when it was a peak time of July, we had been more than lucky to get Darshan   after a wait time of 1 hour only and would like to share #HOW#Trick#1: Just greet and ask fellow yatris who are returning to Katra about the waiting parchi of Ardhkuwari. You will meet a lot of people who have got their parchis but due to the time constraint returning without Darshan.People are happy to share their waiting numbers and till the time you reach Ardhkuwari you will definitely be ahead of many of others.Trick#2: Try your luck by asking people standing for their next call. We met few groups who had entry tickets for more numbers since their turn was next and few members were missing. You can request and join them.Trick#3: What if you return from Bhawan and  your waiting number is gone. Don't worry..No need to rush..Even if you missed you waiting number on your request the door guards will send you inside in the next call.This trick worked out for us and hope they will be helpfull for you.JAI MATA DI..!!"
"Visited the VaishNo devi temple in Jammu with senior citizen and young kids.. opted the helicopter ride which was very comfortable and a Novelty for kidsThe temple is indeed a spiritual experience . Be prepared for super long queues . There are enough joints for food, washrooms etc"
"I visited to Maa Vaishno Devi with my family in June, 2018 which is a peak season due to summer vacations. I have a special place in my heart for this place because the atmosphere is filled with affection of Mata Rani. I feel too happy and satisfied spiritually whenever i visit this charming place. Our trip was really great due to proper planing and advance booking of everything. It was my fifth visit in June, 2018.We booked our train tickets in March when we decided to visit the place. I went through the website of shrine board and understood the rules for online booking of aarti and room at bhawan, which is booked in 2 months advance.We were 6 adults so i booked a four bedded room in gouri bhawan. The room was big enough for 6 people with all the facilities like hot water, clean bed and blankets, almirah, clean bathroom/toilet in room etc. The view of bhawan from our room was really beautiful and fascinating. My parents were  too happy and they thanked me for booking the room at bhawan because there was a huge rush of bhakats in bhawan. there was long queues for bathing, cloak room and mata darshan. But  we had booked our room so we escaped from the long queues.We started our trekking in morning 8 am after light breakfast and we reached bhawan around 2-3 pm as we were taking plenty of rest on the way.we checked in to our room in gouri bhawan and got ready for evening aarti by 6 pm. i had already booked evening attka aarti in two months advance. We went for aarti and it sat in front of mata rani's old cave. The aarti is a divine experience which every bhakt must have whenever they visit. The bhajans of aarti were lovely. Right after the aarti, we had darshan of mata rani without waiting in long queues. When we came outside after darshan , people were waiting in very long queues for their turn of darshan.We took overnight rest in our room and checked out next day morning and proceeded for Bhairo Baba Darshan and came down to our hotel in katra by evening. Next day we visited shivkhodi, baba dhansar waterfall etc.Some advice for devotees:1. Make advance booking of aarti/room at bhawan as per the details on shrine board website. It will be beneficial as u dont have to wait in long queues for cloak room/darshan/bathing.2. No need to book yatra parchi if you have booked attkka aarti.3. take your id proof and debit card in bhawan which you have used for aarti/room booking.4. helicopter booking is better than pony/horse riding as it causes pain in legs. also the prices are also same for both.5. wear shoes for trekking and avoid sleepers/sandles for comfortable treking.6. Drink plenty of waters.7. Dont expect clean washrooms on the way to bhawan due to huge rush in the peak season.8. Bhairo Baba visit is mandatory without which your darshan will be incomplete.9. Take new route for trekking as it is free from horses and very clean and covered in mostly parts and saves us from rain and sunrays.Thanks. Jai Mata Di."
Blessed. We visited Mata temple and it took 1 hr for darshan from gate. It took 2.5 hrs in horse to climb up and in return we took walk till banganga check post. With the slow pace with family it took 6-7 hrs to come down from bhairavnath temple.
The obvious reason to be Katra is for the visit to Vaishno Devi temple. Was very lucky as there were not many family and people around and hence could to take the blessing of the Godess very peacefully and most importantly unhurriedly.
"Visited many times to haridwar but not steped to Katra just 500+ Km by train.In may 12th started From Tiruchirappalli by TEN express reached katra.Himsagar express from trivandraum linked at Erode.rly station reached to yatra Niwas Rs.100/- Dormatory stayed .Received entry pass near the yatra niwas went to hill for dharshan by walk.reached by evening 4.00PM. Around 8.00 Pm returned by horse paid Rs800/- came down. helicaptor, horse , doli available any can choose according to their budget and interest.Near bus stand so many tour operators conduct one day two days tour. Visit and enjoy. My general opinion, those who donot want medicine can perform tour.No mathra (medicine) yatra good. No yatra Mathra (medicine ) good. Choice is yours.Travel in train to enjoy tunnel exits.Explaining the enjoyment through words will give only lesser emotion of joy than that of actual feel."
"2 day trip to Mata Vaishno Devi in December 2017> We started on Friday night (Dec 1st week) from Rajdhani (8:40 PM started on time) and reached katra at 5:15 AM Saturday (before time) > We wasted our 1 hour for private bus (Fare Rs 50-70) which driver was not ready to start until fully occupied; finally we took taxi to katra (Rs 1180 prepaid fixed) and reached katra at 7:30 AM in 70-80 mins> We took a average hotel room in Rs 1000 for a day (starting 8:30 AM to 12:00 PM next day to checkout). Try to take hotel near Katra bus-stand.> We started at 10:15 AM from Ban-ganga(starting point for trek - 12 to 14 km long).> For Pony, Pithoo, Palki the prices are fixed. e.g. For pony Rs 380 to ardhkuwari and Rs700 to Bhawan.> We preferred walking only.> We reached bhawan at 3:15 Pm (in 5 hrs), there is lot of food option in between especially the govt counters(rajma chawal, dosa, vada, tea, colddrink etc at economical price). We took Himkoti way which is easiest & new track and by pass to ardhkuwari> First we took prasad(in jute bag from govt counter) then secondly got freshen up with quick bath in cold water and lastly wasted 30 minute in cloak room queue as you cannot carry anything while doing mata darshan> In 30 mins we did mata darshan as there was no queue.> At 5:00 PM we started for Bhairav baba by foot only(no horse ride) and reached at 6:0 PM (1.5 to 1.8 km steep trek)> In 15 mins we did Bairav baba darshan> At 6:30 we started to get down from old and direct trek to ardhkuwari.> At 10:30 PM we reached banganga and tool auto(Rs 200 prepaid) to katra busstand - 2-3 km away.> In 12 hours we covered Vaishno Devi, Bhairav Baba and back to hotel> Next day at leisure, visited market.> Did luch at Katra bus-stand at sher-e-punjab. Little bit costly with above average food. Try to explore other options.> 4:30 PM took GOVT bus to Jammu (fare Rs 55) very nice & economical bus and I recommend to take govt bus only and reached jammu at 5:30 PM> At station there is jan aahar kendra with good food option, rested there and took rajhani at 7:40PM to return back at delhi at 5:AM on Monday morning> Weather was very nice, neither hot nor cold while going for darshan even in 2017 Dec 1st week"
"People do Yatra for reason so there is nothing to compliant about. I visited Mata vaishno devi in April end with family and 1 year old kid. Here are some tips which i found useful during yatra.1. Pre book your yatra parchi online then you may start yatra anytime during 24 hrs.2. Its better if you start yatra late in the evening and complete it by next morning, then you can avoid sun and heat which will otherwise add to the tiredness. Also you can avoid monkeys during night time.3. If there is no special reason then you must select a suitable time for yatra so as to avoid heavy rush. Avoid weekend and holidays.4. Only limited number of lockers available near bhawan so should take this thing into consideration.5. Taking the new route from ardhkuwari to bhawan will save your time and energy.Thanks."
"Holy SHRINE SMVD is about 56 km from jammu,  i visit SMVD atleast twice a year... Feels good to visit there.... Must visit atleast once in life"
Had a wonderful experience while visiting Mata  Vaishno Devi with family. I went after a gap of 5 yeas and was thrilled to see that the Shrine Board has indeed worked for the comfort of the pilgrims on all fronts and work is on to further develop and improve the infrastructure.Attended the beautiful  Atka Arti and got blessing of Mata.Jai Mata Di.
