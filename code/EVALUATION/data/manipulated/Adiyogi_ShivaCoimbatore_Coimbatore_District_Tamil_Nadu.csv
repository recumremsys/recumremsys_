"What a place!! Now I see why Indian people are so relaxing and stress free! Take a bath in a cold blessed pool, have a 15 min meditation, be around kind people in a blessed temple and you’ll feel what I am talking about..."
"Isha Yoga is an excellent place to visit for the spiritual person. Taking a dip in the pools there, Meditating in the dome and spectacular view of the Adi Yogi statue in the foothills of Vellingiri with scenic views of the mountains is an experience not to be missed by any traveler to Coimbatore."
"It's a nice place, a must visit place ,a sincere request to the people those who can walk please don't use Bullock cart , i agree it's totally a new experience but think about the animals too they repeatedly keep walking for hours together without rest . Let every creature be happy."
Mesmerizing is the word I can think of ... It is an experience more than anything. serenity around exonerate everything from us. One needs to visit to believe !
"Anyone who shares Hindu philosophy, or has an interest in it must visit the Sadhguru ashram here and enjoy the beauty and serenity. The Dhyanlinga is a must see. Keep at least 3-4 hours for the entire trip."
"Excellent soulful experience. Enjoyed the ambience, calmness and serenity.  Would have loved to spend couple of days!"
"Its a nice place to visit on a nice weather.  Enjoyed the dip in the Kundam or the water tank.  I am  not a follower of Isha yoga , but since it is based on Hinduism its good place to visit. "
"it was a peaceful visit to the Isha foundation with family. took part in the rituals and yogas for a day, very enlightening experience"
Our visit to adiyogi place was an inspiration and a kind of extreme Joy.  We visited standings. Had a wonderful dip in the surrounds of blissful place.
Visited on a weekday. It was not at all crowded. Had a peaceful time. The bust sculpture is simply magnificent. Beware of bees hive on the ear of the lord though.
"visited Isha centre and stayed for a couple of days, ideal place for relaxing and to make your mind cool. they serve 2 meals a day with the room. "
"I am recommending this place For a small 2 to 3 hours relaxation trip in a calm location who is searching peaceful atmosphere.  BIG STATUE OF Lord siva for photographers, Big silent Hall for meditation.  Surrounded by nature(This peoples destroyed a huge area of forest)  other…"
Excellent place to relax. With good greenary and calm place. Feeling more relaxed. Big statue is awesome.
Shivaaaa... Shivaa..Shiva. Abode the Best interaction with the Superme. enlightenment.  Experience the Best of Shiva. The chants keep you calm.  You can travel in a Bullock cart. For a price of 10/- per person. And in a golf cart for 50/- per person. But my suggestion. Don't Ur…
Well well designed and spacious.. The entry and exit roads are a bit cramped tough. Avoid weekends if possible
"Do you want to feel the greatness of the creation and the creator HIMSELF ( not fully,  but to try a bit),  then Please visit this place without fail.. If you are really a person of good understanding, then you will surely startAnd try to understand the vastness of the creation and the universe.. Yes. ..Let me explain.. A gigantic statue of around 110-120 feet tall (it's just up to the chest level statue)..We look like a very small ant when compared to that statue..Now comparing ourselves with the universe, we can understand how great the CREATOR is.. Nothing more to say... Just feel this.. You will become silent after returning from this place.."
"Beatiful place, but far away from coimbator. Need your own vehical to travel. The Ashram is away from the city in the middle of coconut  orchard and at the foot hill. DIfferent architecture. One can pay and do some rituals. Otherwise fold your hands , sit near Dhyanalingum and return. For everything you need to pay. Including washroom! Clean and beautiful"
Magnificient Shiva ---but calm ....with meditation and poojas happening in the footstep..Lot of changes and improvements happening actively at Isha centre.Enjoyed Silence at Dhyana mandapam...I visited this time late evening. My nephew developed allergic reactions due to some ant/insect bite. Being a medico i immediately recognized that he needed some medications to contain his allergic reactions and sequelae. I was bit tense and enquired the people at Information centre..was told that medical centre would be closed by evening and was directed to Isha health centre which was not easy to find..being coimbatorian i have some idea about near by villages and took him to Alandhur with the help of locals guiding the route..Took IV medications from a clinic which releived his distress..Thank God..He is fine.I request the admin of the centre to consider this feedback as this place is surrounded by forests and high chances for insect stings and allergic reactions which sometimes are medical emergencies.
"This was the 1st place i visited when reaching india, and it was the most spiritual one too! upon arriving, i saw this big statue of shiva. walked around, saw devotees all the way through, and there was prayers going on.  People were also meditating around the statue.  Then i walked over to another place, and this is where the real magic was! no phone was admitted beyond this point.  1st went to some kind of lake, with a shivling, there was a swami and a devotee in the water.  The latter was swimming to the middle of the lake to the shivling for prayers. it was unbelievably calm and relaxing.  then i went to another place, where devotees were requested to sit down for 5 minutes and relax, in the hope of reaching a stage of meditation.  this was THE experience of the place. absolutely awesome and spiritual place."
Went to Isha foundation with friends. Very neat and calm place. Highly perfect for following daily healthy rituals. Lucky to be present in First Sermon by Sadhguru. He addressed Public for the first time in the year 2020. Tempted to extend my stay. But could not stay. Will…
"What is not to love. Was at Mahashivaratri 2019. The experience was one of bucket list proportions. The energy, music, ambiance and of course Sadhguru were off the charts! Prior to Mahashivratri, the walkway to and from Adiyogi were lined with mobile shops, selling various food and drinks. We stayed it ISHA itself, in Mansarovar class. Great experience all around!"
This place has great strength which provides you Calmness and inner peace. This place is located outside Coimbatore and travel time is about 1 hour. Surrounding is great. Place provide paid parking. Statue of Adiyogi is sublime and calm. There are snacks and tea stalls inside.…
Do booking to stay overnight at the aashram.  Day trip would be very tiring and not let you feel the energy created by sadguru. 
This is one of the parts of your visit to the Isha foundation. On one side of the road is the ashram (incl. Dhyanlinga temple) and on the other side is the mighty statue of lord shiva in the adiyogi form. It is 5-7 mins of walk from the end but the option of bullock cart is also available for a nominal charge. The statue stands with all its might in the natural surroundings comprising of vast open spaces. Looking at the statue makes one feel like the Shiva himself is present. There is one small temple in front of the statue where one can offer prayers
Attended 1 dhyan session. it is life changing I can say. I hired a car for 8 hours and visited the place.
Though great piece of structure but at the  same time giving serene feeling when you go closer to Shiva. If you are in Coimbatore don't miss a chance to visit Adiyogi and Isha Foundation. Do spare four to five hours and feel spirituality in the atmosphere.
Took A bullcart ride to Adiyogi and enjoyed the great view of the area. It was really Windy and the statue looks great with the setting it was erected in.
Wonderful sculpture. Please try to visit in early morning. Make sure you finish your visit before ten to avoid extreme heat.
The feel is amazing to be standing next to this huge monument. Makes you think beyond this engineering marvel located about 50 km from the city of coimbatore.this is a part of the Isha Yoga Centre and this is my 3rd trip to this place. It leaves you spell bound looking at this magnificient structure.
"The structure is magnificent, completely made of steel and gives you a divine feeling. Surrounded by greenery Adiyogi stands alone and can be sighted from a long distance. A must visit place in Coimbatore."
"A total waste of a trip. The organization of this tourist attraction is very poorly run. Be warned before going. There is no clear direction. There is no translator. There is no one to help you. I have been to several ashrams around the world and was shocked to see the lack of organization. There is not even a visitor's desk or help desk. Only Tamil is spoken so do not expect any guidance or help from locals.  In fact, i was surprised to encounter how unpleasant people were and unwilling to help. It's a nice statue but not worth the terrible experience otherwise."
Sath Guru has become a prominent spiritual leader in India and is also very well known internationally especially for his talks on numerous subjects. Make sure you visit the covered in ground pool to obtain that very special feeling of bliss.
An amazing place. Worth the visit.... travel from Mauritius and came to Coimbatore mainly for Adi Yogi. Offering Jal to shiv linga and once done the most interesting part is the Kala Dhaga wish fulfilling thread same needs to be tied up in the trishul. One must try the coconut water.
"As you all might have seen on TV or the internet, it is surely a HUGE sculpture with a few awards tagged to it.112 Feet Tall, weighing 500 tonnes. (Heard that 1 Lakh Rudraksha's were used to make the Rudraksha garland around the neck. Just a rumor, might be false.)A mesmerizing view and a great place to visit at least once.Ample car parking space and almost well organized. Has a little work and maintenance to be done. Commercialized due to lots of shops near the place, but it is needed as it is on the outskirts and nothing could be found nearby.But overall an absolute delight to visit in the evening time around 5 to 7."
"Had been to Dhyanalingam earlier but this was my first visit after inauguration of the beautiful , and enormous Shiva's statue..The Adiyogi ( The first yogi) . This ""bust"" is one of the worlds largest one at a towering 110 ft and is seen from quite a far place. Somehow , as soon as I land here ,  I have always felt out of the world of mortals and moving into a soulful journey . The 5 minutes we spend inside the dhyanalingam in padmasan meditation , is one of the most private moments I have experienced. Once done , the whole mind gets refreshed ..something like a reset button pressed in our subconscious. I have felt this each and every time I set foot outside the place.One lands in the entrance from where Adiyogi is seen and you walk around a km inside before you are in touching distance of this engineering marvel. From there u walk into the Ishayoga premises where you finally land up at the Dhyanalingam . The whole premises is filled with Sadgurus teachings and a sense of contentment around.Whenever you feel that the world is eating into you , take a break and drive to this place and become one with your inner self"
