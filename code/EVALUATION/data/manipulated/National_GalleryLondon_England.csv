National Gallery have absolutely got this right - we did the C tour - loved it. So helpful and positive. Felt very normal. Not over crowded. Calm and just what we needed.
"Have visited the tItian exhibition twice now. On both occasions social,distancing exemplary, staff are friendly, doing their absolute best. Lovely browse around other rooms too.i was unsure previsit about the route to take but an email was quickly answered with a helpful reply."
"National Gallery- an inspiring visit to Titian exhibition and more763243177The gallery has just reopened after the Covid19 lockdown. We were lucky to be there early on and booked to see the Titian Exhibition. Getting tickets means using their website- worked well for us. Be sure to turn up in good time however done come too early either.The gallery has good measures in place to cope with Covid19The Titian exhibitions had been affected by the lockdown. Fascinating to see these famous paintings painted over several years-and transported across Europe in the 16th century. No HGV lorries in those days!Worth looking for the National Gallery You tube video before you go as it explains so much more about the paintings.Then onto the main galleries and there are various routes to follow.I was particularly struck by 2 - The view of Delft after the explosion of 1654 and the Long Road. It served to remind me that disasters of all types have happened over the centuries. Also if life feels like we are all following a long road into the distance then for those who walked or rode a horse or donkey then lockdown was a real thingTheir shop is open. The cafe was open for takeaways only when we visitedFinally enjoy Trafalgar Square nearby - it is generally very crowded but for us the lack of crowds, clean air and clear skies was part of the experience"
"Spent a very enjoyable afternoon, looking at the impressionist art and gift shop at the national gallery. It’s free to visit and we’ll organised. They ask for a voluntary donation, we’ll worth a Visit if you enjoy art."
"This is a free entrance museum and audio recorder available £5.This building in itself is fantastic - look up at the ceilings inside some of the rooms .We're not huge art lovers , but can't express how wonderful  the museum has cleverly arranged each room with art work dedicated to the different times of era's and brings history to life. The art work shows the way of life /clothes etc of that particular time - without being boring. Using the audio information is easy as numbered to select the numbered art work  in different rooms to get an  idea about the artists intentions when creating the master pieces.Too much to go through audio one by one - you'll be there all week! Just walk around each room and pick two or three you are drawn to and look and listen --you'll get hooked!!!Famous master pieces are on display - a must to see and we unexpectedly felt very special to be somehow, in the presence of all these talented famous painters .Highly recommend , but very busy if it's raining !!!"
"Returning to the National Gallery after lockdown is a microcosm of London itself: a cornucopia of cultural riches which is so easily taken for granted. It also helps that the more limited visitor numbers enable one to view comfortably each artistic masterpiece from the Italian Renaissance to French Impressionism and beyond without waiting for an opening in a crowd. Being forced to follow specific routes also allows focussing upon particular periods or artists rather than a random wander through the collection as a whole. Starting with the special exhibition of seven Titians mainly based on tales from Ovid’s Metamorphoses (Actaeon for spying the naked Diana turned into a stag; Jupiter turning himself into a white bull in order to seduce a nymph), I then moved into a room featuring other Titians and world by Veronese; then Canaletto, Hogarth and Gainsborough; perhaps the most famous paintings by Turner and Constable (The Fighting Temeraire and The Hay Wain respectively); then three rooms of French Impressionists, Gauguin and Seurat. And downstairs four rooms of a special exhibition of works by Nicolas Maes, a pupil of Rembrandt. And I almost forgot the rooms of Rembrandts and Van Dycks I had passed through earlier."
"A must if you like art and you are in London. Amazing gallery with superb art work. Went there because it started to rain, and it was the happiest moment of my tour in lonodon."
"Can one tire of viewing famous old artists close up...and for free? Besides seeing lesser known but equally lovely and inspiring artists' works such as the beautiful, awe inspiring ""Whistlejacket"" by Stubbs or ""Pan and Syrinx"" by Bougher or the exquisite ""A Child with an Apple"" by Grueze and hundreds perhaps, thousands of others. Additionally, how can one not mention how the gallery rooms are designed with lovely colored walls and carved cornices and marble pillars extending so high. It is all a bit of a maze and it does one well to have comfortable shoes. Allow a goodly amount of time to properly see all the major works not to forget the outside of the museum itself with Lord Nelson looking down and the giant and majestic Lions standing guard. Many street performers as well entertain. A must see when you are visiting London."
"World class gallery. And it's free!  It has been some years since I was here. So long in fact, that the last time I was here I entered through the main doors, rather than through the modern building to the left. Not sure what advantage to the public it is to have to enter via the modern building, because there is now a long walk to get to the gallery popular. Also, I didn't like having to walk past the official beggars just inside the entrance who  want you to pay to enter a free gallery that we already pay for through our tax contributions. If the gallery want more money, they should ask the government, not the people. Imagine entering a hospital and having the same experience. Not nice.   A donation box is fine, but the shouting beggars are not."
"We are  so lucky that we can go to London and enter such places like the National Gallery for free.  You don't have to be a ""luvvie"" to enjoy this experience - there is something here for everyone.  In truth it is overwhelming when you see what the National Gallery has to offer.  It breathes history - the location, the building and the collections inside.  As I get older I appreciate more and more what has gone before me. Take time out to visit the National Gallery (more than once)."
"If you love art, then this must be your 1st stop.Having been to the Louve in Paris, the Uffittsi in Florence and the Googlehiem in LA, all havens of visual art, the National Gallery is the show piece of them all.Don't just use it to get out of the rain, take time to view some of the best paintings in the World by every World master.The NA is a visit to blow your visual senses and a chance to learn as much from whats IN the paintings as it is a joy to see Works of ArtOn the hot day we went it was almost deserted and absent with Covid 19 tourists. Go now whilst there's a new ambience of studying ......."
Just returned from a lockdown visit to NG. We went to see the Titian exhibition but also visited the equally interesting show about Dutch master Nicolas Maes. But most incredible of all is that you get to see everything with no more than 10-15 people in a room at once. Many rooms are completely empty and you have them entirely for yourself. Grab this amazing opportunity whilst it lasts.
"I came to see Gauguin Portraits, which was a paid exhibition. Simply fantastic! There are many other things to see - the place is full of treasures and a lot is free. Recommended!"
"Visited many times, usually to see a specific exhibition, but there are also talks of interest often relating to the current exhibitions. Loads of galleries showing art from different eras and a lot are free.  Once you've been here you will probably want to return."
"Delighted to have the opportunity to explore the exhibition. Signed up for membership and tickets on line very easily. Arrived at alloted time and directed to exhibition, after leisurely visit continued on two of the trails and visited Maes."
This is an impressive building in itself. Added in with all the amazing artworks and you have a building full of beauty. You could spend hours here just roaming the halls.
Brilliant to see the old art works kept in such immaculate condition.  Loved the old masters and the setting is amazing and just as beautiful as the art works
"Having visited the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg, I feel that this museum is quite disorganised. Partially due to the fact that they were doing restoration works in some of the rooms. The main highlght in the museum is Van Gogh's sunflowers and the Bathers at Asnières."
"I was impressed & satisfied by this gallery & it’s collections. really beautiful and interesting works. spent a good amount of time here. only thing was the signage was a bit misleading as to where to go to find a certain room or section, otherwise, this gallery is a must in london !!"
Be prepared to put a day aside to wander through this beautiful gallery with an extensive display of paintings by all the old masters. Thank goodness for the coffee/tea bars.
"Located right off Trafalgar Square, the National Gallery is a must whilst in London. Admission is free, but special exhibitions require an addition fee. The architecture Of the museum as well as the collection itself are worth the time. The gallery with the French impressions features some classic pieces such as VanGogh’s Sunflowers.  Allow at least an hour, more if you are a serious art lover."
"Free to enter, yet full of the most amazing pictures by the worlds most well known artist. My partner was crying with emotion as we sat looking at some of them. Just sit down, look at one area and focus on that area then slowly move out from that spot to take in all the hidden details. Loved it, this country can do some things so well, and art galleries is one of those things. Well worth a visit, and caters for children to, with art sets so they can try their hand at forgery!"
there is so many things to see in that place that in one day there is no time! definately deserves a visit! the building is amazing on the outside ! same inside ! very helpfull everyone ! is a must in london!
Went with my partner after we booked tickets online. The whole experience was very well organized  with plenty of staff to guide us through the gallery. Its a fantastic place to visit and we spend 3 hours  looking at the artwork. Felt very safe re covid and will recommend happily. Thank you!
This gallery offers a wide range of great masters. The galleries are stunning as is the art. Don’t forget to also enjoy Trafalgar Square after visiting the museum.
"Fantastic place. A feast for the eyes with room upon room of famous, important art. There's not too much to say except that it gets very very busy at peak holidays and weekends. Avoid those times if you can, especially as hoards of people crowd the most  famous paintings.  But they're not really looking at the paintings. They're clicking and doing selfies. Entry is free which is great but obviously makes it a tourist pull. If you want to look at and appreciate art and longer go at quieter times or seek out the quieter rooms. There is a fairly good restaurant, a cafe and the usual shops. Actually they do some nice things to but with some reasonably priced gifts. Exhibitions are usually good but carry a fee."
"Given it was a rainy day the gallery was quite busy with a line to get in however as it is so big with so many rooms this was not an issue at all! The art and the history behind it was just amazing. Best of all its free! Highly recommend if you like art and even if you don't, just pop in and check out the grandeur."
"My favourite museum in London! Situated in the central Trafalgar Square, it contains unique collections and pieces of art that only there you are able to find. Van Gogh, Vermeer, Monet, Rubens, Rembrandt, Michelangelo, amongst many others famous artists have some of their work here. Definitely recommend!"
Fantastic museum to go on holidays or day off. Have a good bar and restaurant inside to eat. Enjoy !
A total must-see for art lovers as well as those who don't usually visit galleries. It contains some of the most famous masterpieces of European art. Don't delay your visit. Its free. No excuse.
"We went early - 10am at opening time and walked straight in. Make sure you go round in room number order, or you could miss half the gallery out.  I went for the Turners and Van Goghs.  So great stand inches away and imagine the brush strokes being applied!  A great cheap way to spend half a day."
Just great. Loved impressionist section. It might take more than a day. can't miss it and it's free!!!
"This is one of the best collections of classical art in the world containing works by da Vinci, Rubens, Michaelangelo to name a few. There is an extensive pre-Renaissance collection in the Sainsbury wing that is most enlightening. It is a big collection and takes a good day to wander around casually. Enjoy."
small display but still enjoyable. Well sign posted for safe distancing. Was able to safely visit rest of the museum safely
"Magnificent pinoteca smaller than the Prado or the Louvre. In a spectacular building in Trafalgar square. From works by the most important European painters such as: Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Rembrandt, Velásquez, Monet, Manet or Vincent van Gogh. I would highlight the Virgin of the rocks and the Sunflowers. Visiting this gallery in London is a must. Free entry all the time."
