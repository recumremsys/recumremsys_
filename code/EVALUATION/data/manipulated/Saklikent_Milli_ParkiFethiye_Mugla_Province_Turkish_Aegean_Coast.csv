Been here many times before. Beautiful surroundings. Great for lunch. So relaxing you don't want to leave!
"Went here as part of a trip, loved it its awesome! water is freezing which is lovely, walked down the rapids, and up the gorge through the mud, thoroughly enjoyed!"
"Great views good to go and see. Water is freezing, you must go and experience it, once in a life thing. Loved it. Also joined a rafting activity which was about 15 minutes, 70 Lira per person but was worth it. Also natural mud sources which you can rub onto your skin.A must visit if you have enough time in hand"
Superb scenery. Walking through a gorge hundreds of feet high. Wear beach shoes to walk through the river very cold water
"I have visited the Saklikent twice now. It’s an amazing day out. Definitely recommend a visit here. We had so much fun. Walked through the gorge, knee deep, ( do not wear flip flops ) we also done the water rafting that i would highly recommend. Lunch was very yummy also! If you are gluten free it’s no problem. the lunch spot is absolutely stunning.... So glad we done another trip here ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️"
Beautiful and breathtaking walking through this gorge. Was quite difficult in places especially for young children. The fresh water was so cold but refreshing. The scenery was a sight not to be missed and a chance for some stunning photography.
"Just returned from this excellent excursion. Visited Turkey many times & this trip is a must. Seeing traditional Turkish villages, mountains & forests . Visit waterfalls as well as the gorge & river which is a must with rapid riding & delicious lunch followed by mud bath visit. Evergreen company excellent especially Errol the guide & Jadon the photographer who captures your day on a personalised cd. True Turkey."
This gorge is just simply magnificent and must see if you're ever in this region. The water is clean and very soothing. Loved it and I'm sure you will too.
Is a most enjoyable experience. Beautiful scenery and amazing gorge and spring water. Sensible shoes a must for full experience .
"We did this walk with Turkish friends and it’s an absolute must if you enjoy a beautiful walk wading through water. Make sure you have good water shoes and a light weight jacket as it can get surprisingly cold in the shade. After the walk we visited a fish restaurant (I can’t remember it’s name)  just down past the car park, near a river. This had to be one of the most memorable meals I have ever had, good honest Turkish style fish and chips in a stunning setting."
It was a great way to spend a few hours out of the sun.  People very helpful and would definitely recommend to others as great value for money.  Make sure you go to the toilet before you go in !!!
Fantastic place. Wear beach shoes as the stones and walk ways are rather slippery.The water is very cold. Bring loose change to give to the boy helpers.If you go on a package you get the meal which is basic but very nice
"A lovely park with an amazing gorge/canyon to walk down with rock pools and fantastic views. You can but plastic aqua shoes there for 15 lira however wearing trainers will do just fine, as long as you don’t mind getting them wet! The water at the start is very cold because it comes straight from underground however as you walk into the canyon it gets a lot warmer. Try to go in the week if you can and as early as possible to get a parking space.Highly recommended."
Came on a day trip from Calis and what great fun my wife and I had. Lovely place and walking up the gorge in the water is great fun. Wear good shoes as it’s tricky in areas but we both got 600meters into the stunning gorge. Excellent place to visit and cool off.
"We had a great time.  The rocks are amazing and you walk through some shallow water, rich with clay you can put on your skin for a mini spa.   Go as dar as you dare.  We stopped before the boulder ‘cascade’ where you have to squeeze through a hole big enough for one person crawling.Do wear the helmets provided as small rocks do fall from time to time."
One of beautiful canyons in the world. The nature is unbelievable beautiful. Need to take with you swimwear and sea shoes.
"Walk through the gorge, which is magnificent to see.  Rafting on the river and mud bath.  Had a great afternoon out.  The river rafting is on rubber rings and you have one each.  We were lucky as it was not busy and there was only our tour group - we did not have to wait and had plenty of time.The mud baths are fab and worth recommending, make sure to slap it on and rub into your skin, well worth the cold shower afterwards.We did the tour with Evergreen Jeep Safari and we had a great time."
"Visited this place with my boyfriend last week. It’s a beautiful place, but be sureto bring watershoes. It’s very very hard to walk here. We are both athletic, but still it was tough! You are climbing under and over big rocks, it’s slippery at some place and there is a strong current. My boyfriend has a problem with his ankle and it was almost impossible for him to walk here. Tip; go fun rafting overthere, its so much fun!"
"What an amazing feat of nature, the gorge forged by water. Visited out of season with friends so did not walk through the river, it was wonderfully cool, the scenery was fascinating. Would love to visit when warmer."
This place is incredible. You will feel so tiny between the high rocknountains. In summer it is a real nice a nd cool place. Take a walk trough the fresh but icy cold water. It is wonderfull.
"We repeated our visit to Saklikent many times, it was that gorgeous! An adventure wading through the shallow rushing waters to walk through the gorge that is 800ft deep. Stunning vistas that take you breath away. Exiting don't miss lunch by one of the river of pond restaurants. Fabulous food and impeccable Turkish service & atmosphere. Rafting another day is wonderful!"
"You should definitely visit and see this natural beauty. Enjoy the cold water, take your swimwear. Also you need sea shoes because the water runs very fast! But very crowded!"
Beautiful place to see the real craziness of nature. You are taken walking in the canyon through the strong River. Remember shorts or swimsuit as you get wet. The park has also zipliners and rafting.
"Really cool and welcomed cold water in the hot summer months. Go early ! it gets packed wall-to-wall people. Wear good closed toe shoes and a waterproof bag for your camera. It’s a really different experience, we thoroughly enjoyed it!"
Great visit although cut short by a storm. Did river rafting which was fun. Chose not to walk along Gorge this time as have done many times before. There was a storm brewing so just got on with the river rafting.
"Was very busy, so would be good to get there early. Gorge is pretty, water cold. Need water shoes to get to stream, but can get them there. River rafting very enjoyable, worth the extra charge"
We visited Saklikent Gorge on a Jeep Safari excursion. It is an amazing place and a must see! Make sure you take your water shoes!
This is a great experience even in the height of the summer tourist season. The gorge is spectacular and you are allowed to walk through the falls and upstream. The rocks can be slippery. My best advice is to wear really good shoes that grip the rocks. Don't take anything that you don't want to suffer water damage. My partner tried climbing up a waterfall. He slipped and banged his head and his passport fell from his top pocket into the water. If you're a woman then wear a sports bra with pockets for keys etc - safety above water levels.
"Went here on a half day trip with an excursion group from hotel. This place is amazing. It takes about 40mins (for me anyway) to get to a curtain point then you walk back the same way you came. I think you can go more, but that includes some climbing, as it gets more slippery and advance physical body strength, to what I saw personally. Any age can turn up for this place, but I recommend from 3/4 years up for a child and a good leave of fitness of elderly folk as at the beginning they is strong waterfall that you need to cross, to walk along the Gorge and at parts along the trail as some area dip quite deep too. I watch a little small girl almost got submerged in a pocket the father didn’t see and quickly yanked her up as they was both shocked by all. Also the water is clear and quite cold in some parts too. You need really good level of foot wear too, as the rocks can be quite slippery. I wore good travelling sandals and was slipping around with the small rocks getting under my feet. So trainers your willing to get damaged or those sea shoes you can get that has a plastic vase at bottom. They do hire shoes and hard hats for the day of 4 lire’s and they wash the shoes after you’ve used them too. What I’ve been told you can do water rafting there too, but I didn’t see it, so it maybe up the river from the gorge need to ask when you visit the place."
"Beautiful location and only 8tl entrance fee. We didn’t have a guide and managed fine. It would be really difficult though for people with mobility issues or small children. Can’t believe that we saw so many people clambering over the rocks and into fast flowing water while carrying babies!! Or people attempting to walk through fast flowing water and over slippery rocks wearing 3” heels (not joking!),The gorge is beautiful and worth seeing. It’s just such a shame they don’t limit the entrance numbers. There’s no health and safety to speak of and we didn’t see any facilities for first aid. The cafe inside the gorge is self service and tea/coffee/cold drinks are available at ok prices. Be prepared to be sitting next to chain smokers though, nobody seems to care less about passive smoking!! By the time we left I felt like I’d passively smoked 200 cigarettes!! So much for the fresh mountain air! We’ve been to the gorge on the weekend and it is so crowded it seems unsafe. It’s worth visiting during the week and going earlier. Rubber beach shoes are a must and can be hired inside the gorge for 5tl or new pairs can be bought for 20tl. We bought ours as £3 seemed a small price to pay to avoid verrucas or fungal nail!  All in all, the gorge is worth a visit"
"This was our third visit over the years and again not disappointed. Great family day out. Be prepared to get wet (just over waist height when we went) if you make it all the way to the end. Carry as little as possible as this will get wet too!  Wear wet shoes or hire them at the entrance.  Can thoroughly recommend eating at one of the little local cafes on the way to Saklikent, just pull over at the side of the road."
i would definitely recommend this adventurous trip. not very far from where we stayed. The stepping stones were a fun memory for kids as well as adults. Make sure to take good walking shoes /trainers.
"Travelled here on a Saga tour and realised fitness essential to visit here. The canyon is some 18 kilometres deep, with steep sided rmulti coloured cliffs and icy, icy cold streams. A footbridge takes you to the entance, but to get inside you have to wade through an icy cold fast running river, holding onto a rope,  or companion! Not for the unsteady but worth visiting nonetheless.."
Lovely relaxing time here. Had a light lunch and drinks. We sat on a boat which was moored to a jetty. Big comfy cushions to relax on in a stunning environment.
This is a really fantastic day out it’s so beautiful. Walking in the ice cold water is a bit of a shock at first but once in its so refreshing and beautiful
