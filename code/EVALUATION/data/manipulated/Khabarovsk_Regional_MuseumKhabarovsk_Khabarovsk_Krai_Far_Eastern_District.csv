Enjoy this place to learn Russian History.   Very helpful staff for non-Russian speakers.  I now understand the region and the history much better
"It is an excellent small museum in a historical building. Lighting is a bit dim for an old eyes and can improve on explanations.. No English no guide. Google translate. Display reminds me of the Victoria BC Canada's provincial museum,smaller. Excellent for family. Easy to walk to. It was very cold in Oct,snowed,too."
"This is a great museum for anyone wishing to learn history of Russian Far East. They have exhibits ranging from natural history (see the remains of Amurozaurus) and ethnography, to history of Russian revolution in the Far East. Expect to spend several hours at the museum and do not forget to bring a camera. On the day we went, they a lot of activities for kids including painting and a play room. Overall a must see if you're in Khabarovsk.Here is a more formal quote from museum's website: ""The Khabarovsk Regional Museum was opened on the initiative of the Priamursky department of the Imperial Russian Geographical Society in April, 19, 1894.    The museum has got the status of the scientific institution and is a member of the Russian Committee of the International Council of Museums (ICOM).    Nowadays the museum reserves contain more than 460 thousand items. Its expositions give information on the ancient history of the Priamurye, the unique nature of the Russian Far East, inhabitants of the Amur-River, history and culture of the region. Unique archeological, ethnographical, paleontological and historical collections are the basis of the expositions, which annually are visited by 180.000 people. """
"As a foreigner living in Russia, I have seen a lot of museums documenting both natural history and the history of the country. Unfortunately, the first category tend to be worn down and the latter to be unable to renew themselves for economical or ideological reasons. Not so in Khabarovsk. This museum starts with a great exhibition about the nature and environment of the region. Then it follows up with an up-to-date review of the region's modern history, with a lot of information and fascinating displays about the repression in the 30's, the thaw of the 60's and the havoc of the 90's. A guide is recommended if you can't read Russian. Do not pass by if you intend to visit any museum in the Russia Far east. 330 rubles for adults."
"Well worth a visit with a wide range of exhibits covering all aspects of the Russian Far East from History, local culture to wildlife.  Need an English speaking guide as no English signage.  As a Geologist particularly liked the section on rocks and minerals found in the region.  On the top floor is a stunning 360 degree painting montage depicting a famous civil war battle fought in the region.  A must see attraction"
