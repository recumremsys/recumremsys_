A wet and windy day but we enjoyed running around in the open. Clean park and play area. Good playground for children. Wollaton Hall was very interesting & a lovely touch to have the storyteller for the children. Kept them spellbound. Cafe staff helpful . Easy to park even though a busy day.
Had a lovely walk at the weekend to see the Red Deer rut and wasn't disappointed spent over a hour just watching these 2 .Had a stroll around the lake as well and was happy to see the ringed necked parakeets.  On the down side the car park is over priced and full of great pot holes .
"Visited here with the kids and some friends. Had a nice walk around the park, visited the very well equipped play area (with a seating area and coffee stall) looked around Wollaston Hall and played with the Rugby ball on many of the plenty open areas suitable for playing and picnics. Will be coming back in the summer to really enjoy it!!"
"Lovely place with a large Park, lake & Deer. Visited the industrial museum and enjoyed chatting with some very informative volunteers. Unfortunately missed visiting the hall due to a wedding occasion. Hopefully we can visit again sometime."
"Friendly staff, great exhibits, nice coffee and cakes and lovely grounds for a picnic or walks. Also good play area for younger children. Went with friends and had a picnic in the gardens after  walking around the hall."
Found this place through the Tourist Office info. Great place. Huge parkland with roaming deer. Big car park (pay and display). Lots of green space. Manor house was interesting. Natural History museum of various 'stuffed' or preserved animals was interesting and fascinating. Great displays within the manor house itself. Nice formal gardens. Shame the Glasshouse was closed. Coffee shop in courtyard was good. And the little pay to enter museum looked interesting too. A worthwhile find and worth a visit.
"Visited Wollaton Hall for an organized Ghost tour. About 2 hours long & a drink included half way through. Our guide was very knowledgeable & took us to different rooms & told us of the stories relevant to the rooms. Visited the kitchen& sellers, even took a trip to the roof. The view was stunning, would definitely recommend this tour."
Visited Wollaston hall for a first date and was magical. Scenes and the deers and the walk is so nice. Need to count on beautiful weather though
"Free to visit and my son loves the gorilla and giraffe, so we have made several trips.  Play area is enjoyable and parking plentiful."
Very good fun. Did you know batman was filmed here!The animaps are also great fun to watch prollock around
"A lovely free day out. One just has to pay for car parking. Free on foot. Apart from the main drive, there are several foot entrances. The grounds of the grade 1 Elizabethan city house are quite extensive, with lake, formal gardens, orangery, and very good children's play park. Red and Fallow deer roam the park. Wollaton Hall  houses a fascinating natural history museum, with free admission. The collections largely date from a much earlier century when it was deemed acceptable and educational to own exhibits, seen only in photographs. Signage to the collection rooms would be useful,  One arrives into an almost empty hall, and it's easy to miss out areas. Stairs lead to an upper floor, and there is also a lift; both unsigned when last visited. A little further down the hill is an excellent Industrial Museum with a small admission price. There are eating facilities, although we didn't eat.The park hosts an array of events throughout the year, and there are guided tours of the hall itself. Check opening hours of hall, as differ from park. Something for everyone!"
A damp day lead us here as inside and we enjoyed our visit. Did some geocaching which was great to find here. Somehow didn’t manage to see any deer! Industrial museum closed on Tuesday March 3rd and the cafe was full. Lovely building. Thought £10 a head for a tour was a bit much but probably very good from the little bit we heard in passing a group and you would get access to some parts others can’t reach! Well worth paying the parking and you could be here a long time if walking the estate.
"What a place!  What a find!  Great for singles, couples and families alike.  Have a lovely walk and then take in the exhibition in the hall."
"Walk and breathe in this park. See the ducks, bird, and if the time is right, you will find deer. See the benches and the people whom they were dedicated to. They loved the park, and I'm sure you will love it too. I did."
Stumbled across this place by accident. Only costs £5 to park for the whole day and no other entrance fee. Huge grassed areas for children (and dogs) to run around or to stop for a picnic. Large lake - you can buy duck food for £1 a bag. Natural history museum and industrial museum which we sadly didn't have time to go in. Play area and a couple of cafes. There are wild deer here as well although we didn't see any. We will definitely be going again for a day out
"Great place for walking the dog although muddy in places at this time of year. There was a Christmas market going on which was nice and a cafe which looked good too! Shop on site too for gifts and souvenirs. We will go again because we want to see the house and obviously couldn’t do that with the dog,Nice play area for children near the car park.Lots going on here. Parking expensive according to locals but we walked so can’t confirm."
"Love it here, very nice place to go with the family. Recommend coming here with the family in the summer."
"Opening/closing times change through the year so check the website, but this is my favourite place to run and walk round. A small charge for the car park but a fab children's play area, nice cafe in the stable block, the Industrial Museum is brilliant to visit but again check opening times, the Arkwright Society sometimes have Steaming Days. Formal gardens aren't open at the moment but a lovely stroll down to the lakeside is just a perfect way to relax."
"Took the grandchildren, they enjoyed the play park, running in acres of well maintained space and the hall and natural history museum, which is still free. Only necessary to pay for parking, which was reasonable. Must be good the grandchildren have requested a return visit."
"This is a fantastic park hidden away on edge of city. Visited numerous times for walks around the lake, the wood to spot the deer and walled gardens. There is a very good children’s play park, the house it’s self is a museum  often with good displays to see. Plenty of cafes, ice cream vans etc. Parking is reasonably priced at £5 for the day - I would recommend taking cash as pay machines don’t accept cards."
Its exactly a yw=ear today that we last visited here with our grandsons. Parked ok and close to the play area. The boys spent 90 mins in the play area and really enjoyed it. We sat on our chairs keeping an eye on them. Toilets are close by and very clean. Also a café doing takeaway drinks etc. Some selfish and disrespectful person had let their dog do its duty and not cleaned it up and a lady near us had trod in it. A nice morning out and we will return
"Planned this day out for a while to enjoy the hall and funfair. The whole visit was a huge disappointment. First of all the signage to disabled parking was non-existent until following the roads further towards the hall. Parked and walked through the courtyard to find a signpost for the hall. Following this signage led to steps, nowhere was signposted with ramp access. Eventually got to the front of the house and yet more steps with no clear signage for disabled access. Once in the hall it was unclear which way to go and downstairs was taxidermy heaven. Some attempts to make it a child-friendly museum had been made but blunt pencil crayons and a fishing game minus the magnet were examples of how tired and worn it was. Finally worked out how to get upstairs in a lift but, on the door opening, there was an unattended bag to the rear. We reported the bag to a member of staff who was unbelievably complacent. How many times do news reports show people saying, “ You wouldn’t have thought that anything would happen here”? Outside again we couldn’t go in the formal gardens because someone had decided it would be a good idea to have tree felling at the same time as having the attraction of the vintage funfair for the school holidays. Service in the cafe was painfully slow. On the plus side the children’s play area is superb with plenty for all ages. The parkland is vast with many benches for tired legs. Will not be back in a hurry."
"Had a lovely walk around the grounds, unfortunately we just missed the craft fair that was then clearing up, such a beautiful house and grounds even in the middle of winter. A great place fora lovely walk and some much needed fresh air."
We took our 2 grandchildren here aged 8 and 6. Was a great place to go to especially into the museum. There lots of open space so you can also take a picnic and sprawl out on the grass. We bought some animals from the museum shop. There's also a great play area for children. Worth going to. They both enjoyed it.
Had some time to kill prior to a business meeting so filled the signs. A beautiful well kept location for a lovely walk down to the lake.The main house was very interesting and free to enter with some very unusual collections.A great find.
So lucky to have this place on my door step.  Had a look around the house for the first time cant believe I didn't sooner so cool.  Cant wait for summer this place will be bliss
"What a great place to visit ! Been here hundreds of times when I was little and now I bring my 2 year old quite often ! He loves the park and a good run around looking for deer and other animals! Inside the museum it’s lovely, looking and explaining all the different animal to my son.Also the cafe is lovely ! Fantastic place to visit if your in Nottingham :) Great also for wheelchair users and pushchairs as they have a lift 😄"
"Popped in for a day out while we’re away nearby. Incredible grounds, extremely well kept, amazing inside the hall seeing all the taxidermy. Corvid measures all in place, what an amazing day out!"
Went here to have a walk around not been for about 15 years and it’s not changed much . It was a lovey day so busy
"Lived in nottingham all my life.,visited many times. Loved taking my 3yr od grandson today.paid £3 in carpark.but the hall was free to visit.thoroughly enjoyed yourselves,made more perfect memory's."
Visiting in Nottingham we decided to get out of boys for a breath of fresh air so headed to Wollaton Hall for a stroll around the estate and stately hall. Lovely surroundings; plenty of birds and squirrels around but unfortunately no deer or stags around on this crisp morning. The hall itself is a fascinating place and the surrounding cafe and courtyard are very nice too. So lovely to find such a wonderful place in the centre of a bustling city.  Well worth a visit .
"Love all Wollaton ages, but few days ago realised: Batman was here!!! if U LOVE DC u definitely come and see that castle. is amazing to watching place when your heroes was walking <3Also all park is amazing place to have contact with nature and animals close to u. also lake is amazing :D"
This was our first visit and we loved it! Armed with a picnic lunch we headed straight to the children’s play area. Lots of equipment to play on and well kept. There is a free museum (in the big house) you can walk around although this is only filled with dead stuffed animals which my children found to be a bit distressing so we skipped through pretty quick and it is a steep walk up a hill or lots of steps! Didn’t notice any way of getting to it if you struggle with mobility/wheelchair access. The other museum (in the courtyard) you have to pay for. We spotted 2 ice cream vans in the grounds. Toilet facilities are clean and well kept/easy to access. The deer were lovely but make sure you take some extra shoes as to get to them you need to walk a big field that is absolutely full of deer poop. Lovely views. All in all we really enjoyed the day! Most importantly the kids LOVED it. Will definitely return
"Drive there from city around 15 mins, need to pay for the car park. No restaurant or coffee shop found. Great place for photo, can’t see the deers this time, which suppose have. The water in the lake a bit dirty."
"We have visited on many occasions. It really is a change of scenery to do a daily walk here. Also it is lovely to see the deer roaming freely. Due to Covid, alot of its attractions were still closed but lots of people had set up their own blankets and bought food along. Also there were food stalls open, such as a mobile coffee shop and icecream van around. Parking is paid for which is annoying as if you have forgotten change you have to pay online which is time consuming. Parking around the side streets is even worse, neighbour watch call the police (PSCO) to warn drivers or record your reg as your vehicle is 'unfamiliar'."
