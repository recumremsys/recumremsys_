"Had just a short time in the city,  and monument,  along with the explanation beside it (as part of the green line walking tour,  in English as well!)  is a must if you come to perm.  Plus you get a funny photo with the ears and some historical details about the place."
Walking in the town center you can bumb into this sculpture. It is funny but it is not worth to spend more than 3 minutes!
The monument with the history and with the sense of humor. Have been there with many visitors - it's fun to take memorable pictures and at the same time to find out some facts about the history of the Perm Krai.
"Having stayed at the Prikamie Hotel overlooking the sculptures, it was fun watching people taking pictures. If you are a tourist,  the city has two sightseeingâ€‹ self walking tours demarcated by painted lines on the sidewalks (red or green). At each historical or cultural point there are explanatory signs of the history and significance of the building or object of interest. The Salt Ears is on the green lined path so it is fairly easy to find it."
The salty ears sculpture is great fun and a great fun opportunity for silly pictures. Also at start of green line which is a good and instructive walk around Perm.Story of ears comes from salt workers who had to carry bags of salt which caused the ears to go red and become sore. The main salt producers in the area where the Stroganoff family inventors of the stew. Heard two stories as to how invested one was that the Baron stroganoff had no teeth and the other that although fabulously rich they where also not very generous when entertaining guests.
