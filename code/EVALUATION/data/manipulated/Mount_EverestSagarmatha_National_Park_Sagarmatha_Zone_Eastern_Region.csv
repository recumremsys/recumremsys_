"The adventure was trekking to Everest Base Camp but the experience was Nepal, the people and culture were amazing. From the rich, vibrant streets of the Kathmandu city to the remote vast expanse of the high Himalayas were such contrasts. I love so much about Nepal and this tour with Ruff Diamond Adventures was extraordinary. Trekking in the months of December to January was very cold but we had the trails alomost to ourselves as well as clear sky days and a bit of snow to top it off."
What a thrill! Making it to Everest Base Camp was a hallelujah moment. Cannot even imagine what making it to/from the top would be like. The sky was crystal blue and the excitement of the expedition preparation overwhelming. Go For It!
Viewing Everest from a plane on the way to Bhutan was a wonderful experience. I never did see it in Nepal but the clear air above the clouds makes for a great siting.
Trekking in Nepal is something some people dream of and when you're there it is simply amazing! I'm dreaming of the next time I return. The Nepalese people are amazing and make the trip extra memorable.
"My husband and I hired a private mountain guide and porter and did the EBC trek. The trek is absolutely fabulous. Every step of the way is beautiful scenery. We were extremely glad to not be in a large group as we like to walk at a faster pace. We often got ahead of all of the groups and could walk more freely, instead of just being part of a large traffic jam going up the mountain. We completed the trek from Kathmandu - back to Kathmandu in 11 days. We still took things slow enough that we did not feel altitude sickness. The tea houses that we stayed in on the way up are beyond expectations. We always had great food (try the Tibetan bread). We chose to stay vegetarian to lower our risk of getting sick but many people ate meat and we did not hear of any issues. Bring toilet paper as you won’t find any in the bathrooms on the mountain (you can buy it on the mountain). Bring baby wipes for a “shower” as it is too cold up top to shower/ the shower facilities are not always great. We showered in Namche Bazar quite comfortably.We highly recommend trekking poles. Make sure that you are arriving in decent shape. We saw many people early on in the trek struggling greatly - unlikely to do well once the air is thinner.Bundle up! It gets cold in the evenings and mornings. Your room will not have heating so we often slept in our clothes. WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND USING WATER PURIFICATION PILLS. We saw many people buying bottled water. 1st: it is not cheap2nd: all of that plastic is terrible for our planetThe pills work great, you can’t taste them, they are easy to buy in Kathmandu, they are cheap. You can easily fill your reusable water bottles in the tea houses and then put a pill in the water. We never got sick once.We highly recommend Kala Patthar. We met a lot of people who skipped it. It was the most beautiful part of the trek. It is a challenge as the air is thin but it is absolutely worth it. By FAR the best part of the trek.Enjoy your trek!  Don’t forget to look up every once in a while to enjoy the views! It’s easy to get caught looking down at the trail to prevent yourself from tripping and miss the views! It is a wonderful experience. We really enjoyed ourselves. The Himalayas are absolutely majestic."
"As a tour leader I have hiked to Everest Base Camp for innumerable times by taking trekking groups, one of the most popular trekking routes in the Himalayas. Thousands of trekkers hike to the base camp every month. Pack up your gears and get ready for the hike. It's your turn!"
"We did an 11 day trek from Lukla and it was a once in a lifetime experience...that I hope to recreate at some point. Spectacular views at every turn, especially of Ama Dablam, Llotse and Everest. Do it!"
"To be  a Tour and Trekking  guide in Nepal as well as group organizer,  I have  trekked Everest region many times via every route (EBC/Chola pass Via Gokyo Lake/ Renjola Pass Via Thame, Kalapatthar through Kongma-La pass via Chhukhung  ect).  overall of  my clients are very happy  with this trek and amazing  view of Mountain. from second day of trek, we can see the view of  the world highest mountain Everest, Beautiful View of Amadablam is another major attraction of this trek.  Panoramic View of above 8000 meter mountain   from Gokyo Ri is highly  recommended.Here some tips for the  trekkers who willing  to do this trekking. The first thing to consider is whether you want a guide and porters. If you want to go cheap, then carry your own gear and get a map. Trekking maps are abundant in Kathmandu and cost from $3-5 (not so easy to find here in your country). Most treks take standard routes. Several websites that offer trekking services outline the trekking routes and you can easily follow their suggested routes. The routes are designed so that you don’t go up more than about 400 m elevation per day as you acclimate. Some of the days are short (3 hr hiking) but if you’re not acclimated it is wise not to go up too fast. If you get altitude sickness, your trip is over. Also, there’s no reason to hurry. Slow down and enjoy the scenery.The villages along the way all have teahouses that offer sleeping and eating accommodations. Villages that are part of the standard trekking route and stop are well equipped with several tea houses other villages may only have 1 or 2. During the peak season (Oct – Nov.), a room costs about 300-400 rupees per person per night and 200 rupees/night in the off-season (exchange rate are more or less ~95:1 ). Most rooms are doubles, some triples. The teahouses can fill up during peak season and for the same price you can sleep on the floor in the dining room. The benefits of a guide is that they have connections and can call ahead and get a room (if there is cell phone service). It is pretty quiet in September to December and March to May of the years.. Several groups hiking in around Christmas time Lots of places close up after December.You are expected to eat at the teahouse where you stay. Most teahouses offer the same menu so it doesn’t really matter. Breakfast can be eggs with bread (Tibetan bread, chipati or really dry white toast), oatmeal, yogurt with fruit. Breakfast will typically cost you about 400-500 rupees. Prices go up the further you are from valley to as everything is carried in by porters and yak. Lunch and dinner are the same menu. High in carbohydrates (rice, spaghetti, noodles, french fries) with a little meat and veggies. Some places had yak steaks – a nice alternative to the carbos. Dinners will cost about 700-1000 rupees.If you decide to hire a guide and porters, Better ! there are over 1000 trekking agencies in Kathmandu as well as several international agencies and some individuals, It is highly competitive and you can barter over the price or you can randomly walked into a couple agencies.Touch The Himalaya Treks and Expedition is one among them, which is located in the center of town more accessable location. The agency should give you two options: 1) you pay in advance for food, lodging, guide and porters, or 2 is called package trip) you pay in advance for the guide and porters and pay for your own food and lodging (is called only hiring trip) . The guides and porters have a set salary that includes their food and lodging. I’m not sure what the guide and porters actually get paid, they have several rules of trekking agencies but the agency will quote you a price that includes their profit – this is a negotiating point.You also need to pay the airfare for the guide and porters to get to some remote location (or wherever you are going) but Nepali prices are much cheaper than for foreigners. Porters typically are hired locally. The agency also will arrange for your travel to wherever.You need to bring enough rupees with you to cover all your basic expenses while trekking. The advantage of paying for the entire trip in advance is that the guide will responsible for paying for everything (except for extra drinks, snacks). . All you have to o do was hike and your guide take care of everything else – pick out the tea house where you would stay, got your rooms, paid the bill at the end of your stay, etc. The downside to this option is that for some reason you cut your trip short (bad weather, health issues), you will not be reimbursed.Other things to consider:Boiled and bottled water is expensive, especially in the higher elevation villages (~350 rs/liter). Bring a water filter.You need a government issued TIMS card to go trekking ($20) that has to be purchased in Kathmandu. Bring 2 passport size photos or you will need to get photos in Kathmandu. The trekking agency will get these for you.You also need a National Park and conservation area permit These can be purchased when you enter the park or conservation area, but it’s easier to get it in advance in Kathmandu. Again, if you hire a guide, the agency will get this for you.Happy Trekking."
"My husband, daughter and myself have just a 17 day package with Advanced Adventures to reach Everest Base Camp successfully, when so many other people did not! Our trek allowed for 14 days trekking  plus 3 days in Kathmandu! The best thing you can do to acclimatise is to go slowly! Most people only give themselves 12 days, which isn't enough time to enjoy the view and also stop in at Khumjung, which has the Hilary Hospital, schools and Sherpas! Our accommodation was owned by Pema Chhosang Sherpa, who has reached the summit of Everest 3 times, and other surrounding mountains many times! It was so good to sit around the fireplace with him and his family and talk about the fantastic work that the Sherpa do to make it possible for people to climb these mighty hills!! Our guide Lok was informative, caring and so easy to get along with, and our wonderful porters, Bisnu and Roman, were always cheerful and watching out for us! Without this great team, we may not have the great memories of this once in a lifetime adventure! The easy pace is definitely the key to a successful trek, we saw so many people who were in a hurry and then suffered with altitude sickness! This was our third trek with Lok and Advanced Adventures and we would highly recommend them! Lok got us over Thorong-La at 5416 metres in the snow on the Annapurna Circuit in October, the Chispanpi Trek in November and now the Everest Base Camp trek! We feel very safe in Nepal, the people are amazing especially considering the natural disasters and Indian blockade which is still in progress! Come to Nepal! The experience will stay with you forever!"
"We just finished a 14 day group trek with Ace the Himalaya and had a fantastic time.  Everyone in our group made it to Everest Base Camp and many of us did the next morning hike to Kala Patthar 18,315ft.  Although you can go alone, I definitely know that our trip was easier and more enjoyable in the hands of Ace the Himalaya.  They make sure their passengers are on the first flights from Kathmandu to Lukla.  This is no small thing.  On the day we left, our flight (the first of the day) was the only one to go that day.  Many flights are cancelled due to weather each day.  Also, due to the fuel shortage, the allowed weight is reduced to 15kg per person before being charged an additional fee.   On the way back from Lukla after the trek, the airport waiting room was jammed with passengers, but again, Ace had us booked on the first flight and once again, we made it without problems.  Sometimes people are stuck there for 3-4 days! Ace arranged for the porters to meet us in Lukla.  One porter carries gear for two trekkers.  There is supposed to be a 20kg limit per porter which should include their personal gear- so make sure you weigh your bag before you go.  When you see the terrain and how hard they work, you will definitely want your bag to be as light as possible.We had a lead guide named Kishore and two assistant guides; Prem and Dev.  All of the tea houses were arranged for us on the way and the guides were great at making sure all of our needs were met.   We ate a lot of Dahl Bhat which was tasty, but also enjoyed the potato dishes and fried noodles.  Take their advice and eat the vegetarian option.  There are eggs for protein.  We brought trail mix from home to mix into our porridge in the morning for extra protein and flavor.The tea houses were basic, but the food was good and there were extra thick blankets on all the beds.  That was greatly appreciated because the rooms were not heated and it got very cold at night.  We made sure to order hot boiled water in our liter Nalgene bottles before bed ($1-3 dollars depending on altitude of tea house- price got higher as we went higher).  The hot water bottle felt amazing in the sleeping bag.  I brought an extra garbage bag from home to put my hot water bottle in case it ever leaked, but it didn't.  This water is great to drink in the morning as well because it won't be so cold as regular water.You can order filtered tap water in most places for a small charge to put straight in your water bottle.  Regular bottled water is available, but they discourage its use due to environmental issues.  We brought a steri-pen to treat the water and never had any problems.  Other people used tablets or filtration devices.  We tried to drink 4 liters per day.Although it was very cold at night, during the day while we hiked, it was in the 50's and 60's and very sunny.  We wore long hiking trousers and a long sleeve shirt and a sun hat and felt fine most days. Lots of sunscreen on exposed areas!   It was cold in the first part of the morning requiring mittens/gloves and a down jacket.   On the day we reached Everest Base Camp, it was probably in the 30's Fahrenheit so that day we dressed much warmer.   The early morning climb to Kala Patthar was the coldest since we left at 4:30am to see the sunrise.  We wore ski-pants and our down jackets and fleeces underneath, hats and gloves/mittens and felt fine.Regarding altitude.  My husband and I did Kilimanjaro in February 2015 and now this trek and we have not had any sickness so I'm feeling pretty confident about our strategy.  I did extensive research before Kilimanjaro and this is what we did.  1. Diamox prescription.  We took 125mg 2x per day.  On waking and then around 6pm.  We tried the Diamox at home for a day or two well before the trip to make sure we were not allergic and to see how it felt.  The only side effects we felt was a tingling in the ends of the fingers and on the scalp for about 45 minutes after taking (I actually thought it felt kind of cool!)  It does make you have to urinate more, but if you try to consume your 4 liters before 7pm, it will cut your night time bathroom visits.  We started the Diamox in Namche Bazaar 11,286ft and continued taking it until we returned to Namche Bazaar.2.  We took 120mg Ginko Biloba two times daily for 5 days before beginning ascent.  We read that you should build up to 240mg so 3 weeks before the trek we took one pill daily and let that lead into the 5 days of increased dosage.  We never had any side effects.  I read that Ginko and Diamox interact with each other so stop the Ginko before beginning Diamox. 3.  600mg of ibuprofen at each new altitude but not on the acclimatization days.  4.  Mountain Might natural supplements.  We took these both for Kilimanjaro and Everest as directed for 10 days during the trek.  I ordered them online.5. Yoga breathing.  After each day's trek, we did some deep breathing exercises.  We would sit or lie flat and breathe in for 4 counts and out forcefully for 4 counts.  This really helps to oxygenate the blood!  Do at least 10 cycles of this breathing each day and whenever you feel a headache coming on.  While hiking we made sure to forcefully breathe out to help dispel carbon dioxide.  6.  Vinpocetine: 10mg 4x daily during the trek.  You can read about this online when searched with altitude remedy into your browser.7.  Walk slowly!!!!  Even more slowly than you think!  There is more than enough daylight to get to each new place so take it slow!  The scenery is so beautiful and you only help yourself when you go slowly.  Going too quickly can really dampen your immunity.  Trust me.  Slow is the only way to go!8.  Give up alcohol and caffeine during the trek or until you are heading back down from Namche.  Tea is fine.All of the things we did may sound like overkill, but I cannot stress how great we felt on both of these treks.  Sure you can grind it out and make it to the top, but don't you want to ENJOY it?  A lot of people around us got various degrees of altitude sickness ranging from headaches to nausea, weakness, and several people got colds and flu-like symptoms.  We felt fine and healthy the entire time!There is definitely a thing called KHOMBU COUGH and many people in our group and those we met on the trail suffered from this.  It's a cough that comes on as you gain altitude from the thin air, dust, and lack of oxygen.  Bring cough drops and cough syrup.  It does go away as you descend, but it made many people pretty miserable for those few days.  I read that wearing a Buff over your mouth in the high air can help to prevent it as well.   I would suggest bringing cold/allergy medicine as well.  There are a lot of animals on the trail and a lot of dust in certain places and it can have its effect.Training:  We lived near the mountains so that's where we trained, but if you don't, I would recommend going for long walks or hikes on whatever terrain you have available to you.  If you go slowly on the actual trek, the steepness won't be that huge of a factor, but you definitely have to be ready to walk 6-8 hours each day.  So, try to build up to 2 one hour long hikes/walks during the week and one long hike/walk on the weekend building to the length of 6-7 hours in one shot.   Since the porters carry most of your gear, you just need to carry your daypack which with water will probably weigh 10-12lbs.  Carry that when you train. Tipping:  The porters do get paid, but they have to pay their own expenses which nets them about $2 a day.  They work so hard---you will see so be generous.  The minimum tip just for the porters should be $50 per trekker for a 14 day trip (12 days trekking with them).  You can decide what to give for your guides, but they say that 10% of your overall trip price is a good guideline for the total tips for everyone.Since we did our trek in early November, I brought our left-over Halloween candy to hand out to kids we met.  They definitely wanted that instead of pens or pencils.  I would have brought coloring books and crayons etc, but with the weight restrictions on the flights to Lukla, I didn't have room in my bag.  Bubbles are always a big hit with kids.  You can bring a bottle or two and blow some for passing kids.  They really go crazy!!!!!I wished that I had a little thermometer for the outside of my day pack.  We were all so curious to know what the actual temperature was day and night and in our rooms.  If you can find one, it could be useful to bring.  Also, I bought a Luci Outdoor inflatable solar lantern from REI for $15 and it was immensely helpful.  It gains solar power during the day attached to your pack and it powers so brightly at night for 8-10 hours or more.  Casts great light and was really great to use on our ascent of Kala Patthar.  I had it hanging at my waist and it illuminated the ground for walking but I was able to look up and see the stars so clearly (as opposed to everyone else wearing headlamps).  The solar lamp wasn't effected by the cold.  Oh yes, keep your phones and cameras and other devices with batteries in your sleeping bags with you at night to preserve the battery power.  Cold sucks them down big time.You need to bring a lot of cash with you because there aren't many chances for ATM's except in Kathmandu and Namche.  My husband and I spent about $17 US per day each on meals including buying filtered and boiled water.  We did not drink alcohol or soda on the trip.  We loved the hot lemon ginger honey tea!  Hope all these tips help!  Have a great trek!  Don't cancel or postpone your trip!  Nepal needs our tourism and they are set up to make sure it's safe and successful."
"Well worth the energy and time. Note that views of Everest itself are not that great however the journey is something you will remember forever. Spectacular place, lovely people, amazing journey. This trip isn't for everyone. You have to be willing to grind along for days and days but it is an amazing part of the world to visit. I feel that this is more of a mental challenge than physical and that anyone with the desire to get there will do it regardless of physical ability. I had a porter and a guide, however, if you are young and fearless, it can be competed without any support. Just buy a map."
Trekked for 14 days in the Himalayas reaching the Everest Base Camp (EBC). We booked through Everest Hiking Treks and Expedition and met our guide in Kathmandu. The trek itself was an amazing experience but be warned that you will probably suffer to some degree due to the altitude. That said our was limited to the occasional mild headache and general breathlessness over 5000m. Its definitely an experience one should add to their bucket list
"It was truly one of the best experiences i have ever had, i visited in oktober 2014 but i newer got to put up the review before i thought about it now. Go to the trek as early as possible since the route can be quite crowded in high season. when me and my friend went be had the trail nearly to ourself and it was a magical experience. It was a great experience to visit and i would love to comeback sometime. A tip our guide was very good, feel free to contact him on facebook his name is Mmtamang Tamang"
"When me and my friend booked our trek to Everest base camp with Advanced Adventures we were a little unsure of how it is was going to turn out considering neither of us had any trekking experience. However, the amazing team at Advanced Adventures (especially our guide Santosh) made us feel really comfortable and whilst it was not easy, we both felt like we had the best possible guidance and hospitality for a very reasonable price! The trek is simply amazing and no photos or videos are able to accurately describe the enormity and magnificence of the Himalayas. Advanced Adventures is a Nepal based company, it is very reasonably priced and has all the luxuries that other more expensive companies have to offer. Considering the hard year Nepal has had with the Earthquake and recent Fuel crisis we were truly amazed at how smoothly everything went (we even got a free upgraded to a helicopter ride on our way to lukla!). Thank you Santosh and Advanced Adventures for an incredible experience!!"
"Thank you so much Heian Treks for arranging our Everest Base Camp trek. Our guide Gopal was fantastic and his professionalism, guidance, support and friendship made our trip a success. His encouragement and knowledge of the area ensured we not only trekked but also learned about the area. He ensured we were well looked after at every Teahouse when our trekking day was over. Gopal not only looked after us but also our two porters. He made sure they had sleeping bags etc and that they ate and had somewhere warm to sleep.We enjoyed our friendly banter and the new card game he taught us, even if he did cheat at times!We would have no hesitation recommending Heian Treks to anyone wanting to enjoy not only the magnificent scenery but also get to know the beautiful Nepalese people and their culture. Discussions have already begun about the next Nepal trip!Craig, Justin & Chris Heskett and Adam WatersonNovember 2015"
"Had an amazing 21 day Everest 3 passes trek with Nepal Vision Treks in October 2016. After months of research, I chose Nepal Vision Treks because of their fantastic professionalism (fast communication by email before the trip answering all questions, extra inclusions, professionalism and logistical wizards before and after the trip, and amazing cultural interpreters). They met or exceeded every expectation I had! Highly recommended for trekking in the Everest region. I would use them again in a heartbeat."
"My family and I recently trekked to Everest Base Camp (EBC) with Imperial Nepal Trek (INT) and this company really did so much for us to make our experience enjoyable and unforgettable.They had a high level of professionalism and were well-organised since our touch down in Kathmandu. At the airport we were met by who was to be out guide to EBC and back (friendly and patient Sujan Khanal), and INT organised a taxi straight to our hotel (hotel also organised by INT). The following day we were met by the organiser (Paras Khanal) of the feel in person, who gave us a run down of itinerary and answered our many questions so patiently! On that note, Paras was very accomodating with creating an itinerary specifically tailored to our needs - this was a huge plus, as we didn't have the time to do the trek they initially recommended. paras was very willing to tailor a trek to suit some of our limitations. INT also made some of those admin and difficult parts of travelling in a new city MUCH easier - they organised all taxi transfers around the City, as we needed, the organised the down jackets, down sleeping bags and duffel bags that would be incredibly necessarily in the colder parts of the trek! They also facilitated some sight-seeing around Kathmandu and a provided 2 really enjoyable dinners - a welcome dinner on arrival to Kathmandu and farewell dinner after our trek. Trekking with our guide and 2 porters was a great experienxe in the mountains - we were looked after, entertained, informed and a bit spoilt at times (that extra cup of coffee or opportunity to have a quick and hot shower when you thought it wasn't possible!). This really made the (at times difficult) trek that much more enjoyable. We are very grateful to Sujan our guide and our 2 porters for all the effort they put in on this trek. They are incredibly tough and resilient to the Himalayan cold!It was a relief throughout the trek not to have to fuss with payment for every meal and every room etc - these expenses were all included in the total cost we paid INT - and it was well worth it! Very reasonable price and we more than got our money's worth. Definitely contact Paras and INT for quotes.The trekl itself is amazing but I figure you probably know that already and more likely, you're trying to decide which trekking company to choose. I would highly recommend Imperial Nepal Treks!"
"Did a standard 12-day EBC trek with a local trek agent. A dream fulfilled! Everest can already be seen during the first few days of the trek. Views are absolutely stunning - they were my motivation and reward on each day of the trek. February is low season (end winter), so most of the time we had the place to ourselves. One gets to enjoy the majestic Himalayas in quiet solitude at one's own pace without having to worry about jams and crowds. Downside is that the weather is unpredictable. Since it was Feb, be prepared to trek and sleep in harsh conditions. It got super cold and windy the day we set off for EBC and it started snowing lightly with relentless winds and a lot of clouds on our way back from EBC. A Nalgene bottle might be a better idea than a water bladder because my water tube was frozen for the entire day where we headed for EBC so I didn't drink much that entire day of trekking. Worth every bit of the experience though!"
"My partner and I recently trekked with Advanced Adventures to Everest Base Camp and I highly recommend using this company if you are considering trekking to EBC or anywhere in the Himalayas. We were so well looked after, both our guide and porter were very attentive, knowledgable, friendly and went at our pace the whole time. We enjoyed out trip immensely and would not have made it to base camp without them. Being winter is was very cold and we both got a little bit sick along the way but with the help of our guide we still made it! We felt safe the whole way and were free to just enjoy the magnificent views rather than worry about accommodation or our health! Other trekkers commented on how well our guide and porter were looking after us, definitely one of the best adventures of our life!!"
Took a helicopter to see the peak and was absolutely incredibly. I know it can be expensive but it is well worth it.
"This trek should definitely be on every trekkers bucket list! The minimum time to complete the trek is 13 days but if you have time nothing is stopping you from taking longer just be aware of the very serious risks of altitude sickness if trying to do it in less days. Over my 13 days I saw many people being airlifted, walking or riding horseback to lower ground due to AMS. Please ensure you have insurance! While you only need 14 days to complete the trail you have to include extra days for bad weather etc. My luggage on my international flight was delayed by a day and due to bad weather I flew back from Lukla a day late, so I lost two days luckily I stayed in Nepal for 30 days and was doing the trail independently through a local agency.There are several ways of arranging the trail but I would recommend avoiding the big international or local group tours and rather find a local agency that has great recommendations/reviews and have them arrange your flights, TIMS and staff for an independent trek. Regarding staff I would recommend several options depending on the situation:>If everyone in your group is fit enough to carry all their own gear then I would recommend a Guide(0KG) that can assist with accommodation, knowledge on the region, translating...>If you travelling solo or two people and need help carrying some gear while on a budget then I would recommend a porter-guide(10-15KG) along with a good book on the region to read in the evenings as porter-guides tend to lack on knowledge of the region.>If you more than two people that needs help carrying gear then I would recommend a Guide(0KG) and a Porter (30KG)You only allowed to take a total of 15KG on the plane to Lukla but I would recommend taking only the absolute necessary.I've personally never been to the gym in my life and my training for this trek was basically completing a much easier 21Km hike (low altitude) on both Saturdays and Sundays for three months. I also tried to walk, use the stairs everywhere I went and stuck to healthy home cooked meals avoiding fast and processed foods. On the trail I saw people in their 60's, overweight smokers... The trail itself is not difficult!You have more than enough time to get to the next place you will sleep for the night and there's not much to do once you get there. The accommodation is extremely basic, room with two beds and four walls. Entertainment is hanging around the dining hall, conversations with other trekkers/guides, reading books, playing games... The real fun and entertainment is the actual trail so I recommend sleeping early to get up at the break of dawn for an early start so you can take your sweet time, resting often, taking lots of pictures and enjoying the view.Avoid meat at all costs as its carried up on the backs of people while kept cool using ice. Also try to avoid purchasing bottled water on the trail as the trash has to be carried down and its sad to see how much trash is thrown on the trail. Instead take enough purification tablets and at least two one liter bottles, one nalgene bottle and one metal for filling up with boiling water and throwing in your sleeping bag in the evenings. You can fill up at all guest houses and remember to drink at least four liters a day!The EBC Trek is Amazing! It's filled with Challenging Paths, Breathtaking Views, Amazing Culture, Wonderful People... Its an adventure of a lifetime!!!"
Is very Amazing place !! I still cant believed I been there such a  memorable event of my life .I so thankful to our Guide its so easy for us  all we have to do is walk he takes care of everything  he such a good guide. I WILL recommend  him to everybody. I would  like to go there again.
I am proud to say that I had reached at the base of Everest . Enjoyed a lot with my siblings. Had so many unforgettable beautiful memories. Just do not plan just start your journey towards your destination if you are planing.  I think nobody will regret going to Everest to climb or for trekking till base camp it will be worth it trust me 👍👍👍.
"I think this recently released doco called “Trouble on Everest” is a must see for anyone trekking in Nepal. A reminder that unless you don a backpack and carry ALL your own stuff then you are assisted by the Sherpa. They risk their lives so that foreigners can climb. Please respect them and the mountains. Ask yourself why you truly want to do it in the first place. If you can, book through a locally owned and operated outfit so as many proceeds go directly to the Sherpas."
Highest peak of the world is an amazing place to see. i trek to Everest base camp and Kala Patthar many times i like this destination very much. go to explore once in a life time highly recommended destination.
"This a spectacular trek to do and we thankfully decided to go with a local company, Green Valley Nepal Treks, who were awesome to deal with from start to finish. We'd done Kilimanjaro last year and decided to up our game and tackle the three passes with Jommy(Jami) as our local guide from Green Valley. We made the decision to also have a porter - and why not? - carrying just a day pack takes the edge off an already strenuous 16 days and let's you enjoy the stunning environment you are in just that little bit more. It's also putting money back into the locals pockets as the team we had were from the region - a region still recovering from the 2015 earthquake.Our trek covered 16 days with two acclimitization days. Don't skip these days, because a lot of the helicopters you see racing up and down the valley in the first few days of walking aren't usually rich sightseers but medivacs taking ill trekkers out! Listen to your guide, take the necessary acclimitization days and don't get caught up in the need to rush. You will probably pay for it later and further up.The Three Passes trek, once you get off the Everest Base Camp trail, is a lot quieter and we met great people doing it solo or with guides/porters. You also get to experience the beautiful Gokyo Lakes region. The middle section from the Kongma La through to Everest Base Camp, Kala Patthar and then on to the Cholo Pass is where your crave a rest day but there really is no where to do this, so battle on to Gokyo and enjoy some time off plus there's also the world's highest bakery.  Pack a solar charger if you can, it was the best thing I brought with me as I used my phone as a camera and it's expensive and not really that reliable getting the teahouses to charge your electronics up. I didnt really even need to hike with it as there was always enough sun at the end of the day's walk to cram in a bit of charging time. Also our guide advised us NOT to eat meat and as someone who usually gets sick, I thankfully had minimal issues in this department by following his advice. We heard some horror stories of people eating Yak steaks in Namche Bizarre  just two days into their trips and falling ill and having to be airlifted out. Splash out on the occasional bucket of warm water for a shower (400rp). It just makes you feel a little human again and you've earned it. This will be an amazing journey with spectacular scenery as your back drop and the Nepalese people are lovely.Green Valley Nepal Treks own several hotels in Kathmandu - so that's all sorted for arrival and departure plus the lovely Arjun arranged for us do a day's sightseeing around Kathmandu after our trek as well as transfers to and from the airport for international/Lukla flights."
It was such a good experience. It's hard and you push your self every day during the 13 days. I only did the EBC without any pas and was enough. As soon as you go higher the prices are getting higher as well. Grab a good gloves and jacket because the temperature in March almost on the Base Camp was negative 15. Wind very strong didn't allow us to do Kalapathar. Try to walk around in Kathmandu to get a good deal with everything included in the trekking.
"November 2016 - Just amazing. The views are breathtaking (as is the altitude!), the atmosphere is buzzing even though nearly everybody is exhausted and the culture has to be seen. Watching the sun rise and set over Everest is something I will never forget. The Sherpas are great, the food is delicious (most of the time) and although tough at times, the best trek I have done so far. Don't hesitate, just book it and make sure you have put in the training so you can really enjoy it!"
"In our nature I find the most breathtaking view of Mt. Everest which is covered with fair white snow.  People think it is very hard trek to the Mt. Everest Base camp. Actually we should climb slowly but regularly, it would become easier. Try once and enjoy the Entire beautiful nature and scenario."
"We visited Nepal in October 2014 and trekked in the Annapurna region. Following the earthquake we wanted to come back and 'do something'. We looked at volunteering and found that either we did not have any useful skills or what was offered was in fact a holiday with a couple of days 'volunteering'. My other half decided that a trek to Everest Base Camp would be a good idea so we decided to visit purely as tourists and help by spending our money in the country. The Nepalese we spoke to were very grateful for our visit emphasising how our money will pay the wages of the local population.According to our guide tourist numbers are down by some 70% in the Everest region and 60% in the Annapurna region following the dual impact of the devastating earthquake in April 2015 and the politically motivated fuel blockade by India in late 2015, just as Nepal was beginning to recover. Kathmandu was noticeably quieter than our previous visit and there were times on the trek when we did not see another foreigner for miles. The trek itself was amazing from the unnerving flight into one of the most dangerous airports in the world perched on the edge of a mountain to the breath-taking views around every corner. Literally breath-taking the higher you climb! We are 50-somethings of average fitness and had not really done any extra preparation for the trip. We had trekked to Machu Picchu via Dead Woman's Pass (4215m) in November with few problems - how much harder could it be? Everest Base camp is 5364m and Kala Patthar 5545m - the extra 1000m or so makes a huge difference.It is very important to follow the advice of your guide and to have at least 2 rest days during your trek. If you rush up the trail you are far more likely to succumb to altitude sickness. It can and does affect anyone regardless of fitness level. It can start as low as 3000m but we found that we did not really feel any effects until about 4000m. From there you start to slow down, walking up steep paths leaves you gasping for breath, your appetite diminishes and you may not sleep as well. The key to the steep sections is to find your rhythm. Work out how many steps you can take for each breath and stick to it, regardless of how slowly you are progressing. On our climb to the top of Kala Patthar I found that I could keep going without my legs failing by: foot forward, breathe in, foot forward, breathe out. It was slow but I made it shortly after the sun rose above the surrounding mountains. You need to get up there by the time the sun rises as it appears over the shoulder of Everest and you lose any photo opportunities quite quickly. You can trek up there for sunset but it is unlikely to be clear in the Spring - more likely in the Autumn.You can camp on the trail but there are plenty of tea houses in the various settlements along the way. They do vary in quality and facilities but most provide a clean room with either 'ensuite' or shared toilets. Be aware that some do not have running water. At least two villages lost their water supply as a consequence of the earthquake but you will be provided with water to 'flush' the toilet and to wash with. Do not drink local water unless you have treated it with chlorine or iodine tablets. Bottled water is available everywhere and whilst there has been much negative press about the impact of empty bottles etc. you will also find recycling bins along the paths.DO NOT LET ANY OF THE ABOVE PUT YOU OFF!! Nepal is a wonderful country with a huge diversity of culture, scenery and wildlife and lovely people. They need you to visit. You do not have to climb mountains. There are many beautiful old buildings still standing, wildlife to see and adventures to be had. There are also still many people living in tents or makeshift shelters amongst the rubble of their homes, villages without water and children without schools."
"Visited Nepal Mach/April 2016...booked through BikeHike Adventures.  The trip was spectacular!!  Trish and Meghan made booking and planning the trip easy.  Everything was looked after from the moment we landed in Kathmandu, to our 2 week hike to Everest Base Camp and back, right up until we departed Kathmandu.  We were a small group of 4, just my husband and I, our guide and porter.  This allowed us to travel at our own pace and to explore what we wished along the way.  We were able to interact with the locals and enjoyed amazing cultural experiences during our trek.A challenging and rewarding trip of a lifetime!  Looking forward to our next BikeHike Adventure!"
"Started off my journey to Everest base camp and Mount Kalapathar from a small town called Jiri, North of Kathmandu. We flew from Sri Lanka to Chennai and took the train up north. Didn't work with any tour groups but we were accompanied by a veteran trekker who had gone to base camp more than 10 times. It was a difficult first few days getting used to the climate and the trek but eventually every things was working fine. You have to climb at your own pace acclimatizing your self. You have to drink plenty of water. We didn't have any Diamox but you should consider for altitude sickness. Its an achievable task with some amazing views along the valley."
"Uncompairable trekking thanks to the First Environmental Trekking company which allowed me to make my own itinerary in the Solo Khumbu. We went from Lukla to EBC and then to Gokyo, but not over the Cho La.  We rounded the valley by the other side and went by Pangboche, Phortse and Thare to Dragnag, crossed the Ngozumpa glacier and went so to Gokyo where we stayed for a couple of days. Climbed the Gokyo Ri and hiked around and found a spot which I ratter keep to myself. So we wondered around for 21 days...me, My eldest daughter and three friends. An uncompairable trekking experience at our own pace."
"A few tips from our EBC trek, (ps wonderful places, truly wonderful trek, one of the best travel in our life) we arrived on October 4 on base camp:we are a 50 years old couple, not very fit and at our first trek, however, we managed to avoid AMS and gastrointestinal problems by taking it easy in the ascent, eg 3 nights in Namche instead of 2 and 2 nights in DingbocheDrinking lots of water in various forms (eg local hot soups, hot lemons, avoided teas and coffee in afternoon/nights not to spoil the sleeping chances), we always drunk bottled water or very hot teas/etcEating  traditional Nepali/Sherpa food especially in those lodges where we felt the customer turnover was not too high (and thus the frozen pizza or similar imported food possibly expired or unadvisable)We did not need Diamox albeit we had it with us ready to be taken in case of serious AMS symptomsused the cardiofrequenzimeter especially in the 3 steep ascents (namche, tengboche, lobuche) and we found it very precious to ""discover"" our ""right steady"" but not exaggerated walking pace, that by the way then proved in line with the guides/book average assumed timing had with us the oxymeter (you can buy on Amazon, eBay) and it was mainly useful to check if  the levels of oxygen of each of us kept broadly aligned throughout in the ascent (we measured 79 in gorak shep and 86 in pheriche)In the lodges most meals are made-to-ordee so you have to order  in advance, however this practice increases the quality and the safety of the lodgesbrought maybe too many clothes, in fact especially above 4000 mts you dont change much yourself :( had a huge box of medicines, it was not a bad idea, in most places if you dont have medicines you can only hope some other traveller would have....Several nights were cold or very humid (also in the lower valley) so we asked often for extrablankets and regretted not to have with us a couple of hot water bags to be filled by the lodgeSone rooms were a bit ""smelly"", we used incense in those occasionsMany lodges have wifi (not free)It was good to have lipstick, sunprotection and real antiUVA sunglassesWe were lucky with the guide and porter, two great persons that made our trek easier, pleasant and very ""human""You find bottled water everywhere with price per bottle climbing from $0.80 in Lukla to $3 in Lobuche/GorakShepIf you like dogs this is a great place, there are many beautiful, semidomesticated, incredibly clean dogs that wander around trekkers looking for food and the occasional hug.we brought pens for the children as per some guide suggestions...well the beautiful Sherpa children like their peers elsewhere want chocolate not pens :) Between Lobuche and GorakShep you may want to make a one hour deviation to visit the Italian-Nepali research center shaped like the Louvre pyramid and mirroring the above magnificent Pumori. Depending on how busy they are you may have a look inside the pyramid.Did it all go right? No, she strived to sleep in the first week, he suffered from a acute back pain in the ""highest"" days, but we both thrived and survived :)"
"Walking from Lukla to Everest Base Camp and return.  Accommodation in lodges, breakfast included.  Traveled with Himalayan Social Journey (group of 10) out of Kathmandu, 18 day trip from Australia.  A good company and especially the lead guide, Gunga, who couldn't do enough for us.  A late monsoon meant weather wasn't always good but a great trip for anyone with reasonable walking fitness."
