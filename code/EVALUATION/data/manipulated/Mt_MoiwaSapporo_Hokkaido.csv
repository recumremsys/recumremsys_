"Great excursion involving various forms of transportation to get to the summit of Mt. Moiwa (531m).  First you need to take the subway to Susukino subway station (Station N08 on the Namboku Subway Line), then interchange with the Sapporo Streetcar (tram) at street level (Streetcar stop SC23).   Take the tram to Ropeway Iriguchi (Streetcar stop SC10); 11-stops anticlockwise or 13-stops in a clockwise direction.  Close by the Ropeway tram stop, there is a bus stop with turning circle for the Ropeway shuttle bus; a green 4WD, hi-wheelbase minibus, which takes 5-mins to negotiate the climb up the hill to the Moiwa Base Station.The 1st leg from Base Station to Mid Station is by Ropeway; the gondola can accommodate up to 66 passengers for the 5-min journey and gondolas depart every 15-mins.  At Mid  Station you transfer to the Mo-risu Cars which transport you to the Summit Station in 2-mins.  The Mo-risu consist of a pair of mini cable cars in tandem; each can hold 30 passengers (60 in total) and also depart every 15-mins.When I travelled on a January Monday morning, traffic was surprisingly light and blessed with good visibility the views of snow-covered Sapporo from the summit were spectacular.  Great excursion, enjoyed the transportation and a special shout-out to Mt. Moiwa Ropeway for giving a discount to Senior Citizens like myself!"
"Convenient ride by Tram and shuttle up and experience two type of 'lifts' up the mountain top. Feel the air and love, Also wait til its darker and have a night view of the spectacular city and you tell me what you think !..... Remember to lock your love away too."
"You can access the peak of Mt. Moiwa by riding the ropeway and then transferring to the cable car. The ropeway that departs from Moiwa Sanroku Station travels 1,200 meters in five minutes. The ride includes the stunning view of Ishikari Bay in the distance past the cityscape, providing clear, unobstructed views of Sapporo. Next, transfer to the cable car called Mo-risu Car, which brings you to the peak after traveling through the forest. Be sure to check out the views from both the ropeway and cable car. The price is quite expensive but it comparable with the experiences that we had."
"How to reach Mt. Moiwa observation.The best way to get Mt. Moiwa is to use city tram loop. You'll need station ""ロープウエイ入口"" (rōpu uei iriguchi). Price for. Tram is 170円 w/o price zones. Take a look inside a car, normally you can find there free coupons in the pockets with printing give aways for ropeway to Mt. Moiwa, that gives you 2-way ticket for 1500円 instead of 1700円. 200円 only, but c'mon it is 1 zone trip via subway or a can of beer or whatever. ))Depend the way you've came this station (clockwise or counter clockwise) go to to left (in case of clockwise tram way) or right in other case. There will be small bus stop where free bus shuttle to Ropeway station is going. Take this shuttle, 5 min and you are there.Ropeway consists of 2 parts, you'll need to use both. There is no reason to stay on the 1st station. Main observation point is on the top.Good luck!"
We took the cable car and rope car to the top of Mt Moiwa. Lots of snow but the views are incredible. Watched the 3D movie which was interesting although it was Japanese which was to be expected of course but still got the gist of it. Had an ice-cream which seems to be the norm in Japan even though its winter.
"My trip to Mount Moiwa was a memorable one!The cable car station was easily accessible and the going up the mount via the cable car followed by the tram was an adventure in its own right.Do note that due to it altitude, the outdoor viewing platform tends to be very windy and hence cold in winter. Do note that if you are going by the city circle tram, there are discount coupons available onboard which you could use for the cable car ride."
Very easy to access by tram. Go to Mt Moiwa when the sun is setting to see the night lights over Sapporo.
"Excellent views from the top.  Highlight of Sapporo.  Take the Mt Moiwa Ropeway.  But don’t expect to have a drink at the bar as you wait for sunset. Pretentious expensive restaurant has the best views, but no bar.  Best to BYO."
Reminds me of The Peak in Hong Kong. An accessible mountain in a city. Buy the tickets up to the top and enjoy the view of Sapporo city. Can be done in an hour if there's no crowd.
Easy access and the best views of Sapporo from the peak. doubles as a ski resort in winter. dress warmly as it gets pretty windy at the top
"Sapporo Mount Moiwa This tourist destination is recommended. You may go up the peak either in the day or at night. I think the night view is even better than that of Mt Hakodate. According to the brochure, during the “Nightscape Summit 2015 in Kobe”, Sapporo Mt Moiwa was chosen along with Nagasaki and Kobe as one of the three most beautiful nightscapes of Japan. To take the tram (streetcar) and alight at Ropeway Iriguchi station. Walk along the main road with Mt. Moiwa signboard to the shuttle bus pick up point on the left. The free shuttle bus will ferry you to the ropeway station. If you are a senior above 65 years, there is a discounted ticket available. The ropeway climbs from the base of the mountain to the transfer station. From here, you will be transferred to an unique twin cable cars to the peak. The observatory at the peak offer you spectacular view of Sapporo city. The view is especially beautiful after sunset. Mount Moiwa offers five mountain trails too. The shortest is 2.4 km and you may hike in casual clothing. You may wish to venture into it."
The views from the top was fantastic.  Worth going up for the views. Taking the cable car up the top was a great ride. The usher bow to u when U are getting out of your cable car. That's the respect you get .. the feeling was great.Will go back again..
"Boasts of a spectacular night view of the city.  Going up with the 2 cable car rides is relatively quick even as we went in mid June 2019.  There is a souvenir store but most visitors did not linger there. The cafe was closed when we were there at around 9 pm.  Coming down took longer as there was a queue of people waiting for the cable cars. The view of worth the effort to go. The guide inside the cable cars only spoke in Japanese so we didn’t know what she was saying.I reckon we took around 2 hrs in all going up and coming down, even if we didn’t linger longer than 20 mins at the top due to all the waiting time taken."
Really great trip up to the top of Mt. Moiwa to see excellent views of Sapporo.  Went in the winter and saw a beautiful scene with snow and the city.  Really great.
"Visited Mt. Moiwa in the winter while in Sapporo for the Snow Festival.  Very easy access taking the city's only street car and then the free shuttle bus to the cable car station.  As roads can be quite icy, it is highly recommended to take the shuttle bus during the winter than to walk up to the station.The view from taking the cable car up was great, could see the snow covered roofs of the city buildings. There's a shop at the midstation before taking the morris car to the top.  The night view was stunning on a clear night, full view of the city down below.For those who want to enjoy the view longer and in comfort, there is a fancy restaurant there too."
"Mt Moiwa (Moiwayama) is right inside Sapporo with  two lifts, hiking trails, skiing, and neat views of the whole city. How to get there: from the central city, take a streetcar to the Ropeway station. You can walk about 600m to the entrance - turn left when you see the sign for ropeway parking- or take a free shuttle about 50m from the streetcar. The entrance is labeled and looks like an office building. When we went, the path was icy, and some of it is uphill; not safe for elderly or very young children. How to tickets: Go to the fourth floor via elevator or stairs to the right. You will be deposited in a ticket line. The workers speak English, and you can use a credit card. The cost for round trip tickets on both the doorway and mini cable car was ¥1700 per adult. There were coupons in the Sapporo guide we were given at the airport; alas, we did not know and did. It bring them. How to get to the top: the rope way and mini cable cars leave every 15 minutes. The  first trip takes about 5 minutes, get a view facing down to watch the city unfurl beneath you! Then, you can buy items at the shop, leave for hiking (we did not try it on a February night), or go up the mini cable car. The second trip is just about 2 minutes. Go out the Rooftop observation deck. What to do: Get your picture ringing the bell on top of Sapporo. Look at the pictures indicating key sites in the city and natural landmarks. You can eat at a restaurant at the top (we didn't) and head back down. If you can't get to ant Moiwa and still want to see the city, you can go to observation decks in JR tower near Sapporo station or the clock tower in Odari park. Neither is nearly as high, though."
Nice view over the city from top of MT Moiwa. Recommend to go there in the evening . Go there by bus and ropeway
"Drove up to the mountain - mid point, before walking up the remaining 200 m. It is 660 Yen for the toll.It was extremely difficult to find the entrance, maybe I was searching for the wrong place. Only found the toll highway leading up to the mid-point on my third attempt, leaving little time to enjoy the view.Decided to walk up the remaining distance as it was supposed to be 200 m. It was exhausting for my family, as we are not the outdoor type. But the locals were moving up the same path relatively fast and with ease.Walked down from the summit using the 500 m (less physical demanding) as we were quite tired and it was dangerous to use the shorter route.There were signs to discourage using of the paths at night, in view of safety.It was not too crowded during the visit at just before noon.Would consider the night visit in the next visit."
"Anyone seeking a spectacular panoramic view of Sapporo will want to take the gondola to the top of Mt. Moiwa. The view was spectacular, the facilities impressive, and the restaurant/bar a great place for a cocktail. Enjoyed every minute of it."
"Sunset worthy spot, but however, after sunset hours, the cable car to go down will take 1-2 hours. There is a total of 2 cabins and limited pax going up and down. Be prepared to wait."
"Do it properly and hike up. It's not a particularly long or hard climb (an hour up at most), and makes the views at the top even better. I went up the mountain the day after I went up the JR T38 tower. and the views over the city are even better! with the bonus of being able to see the countryside beyond the city."
"I personally like the whole concept of reaching the mountain top observatory with a cable car. The view from the top was just unbelievably stunning. As we reached the top at around 8PM, the lights that decorate Sapporo just looked fantastic. Practically everyone in the cable car couldn't stop saying how beautiful the view was when it starts ascending to the top. Keep in mind that you need to wait for 20-30 minutes to purchase the ticket(s) to get to the top (or 2nd station). I definitely recommend going all the way to the top, which will cost you 1.700Yen (round trip). Going to the second station will cost you 1.100Yen (round trip). Trust me, the view that you get worth every waiting minute."
"The views from the top are second to none of the Sapporo area and beyond. You can catch the local bus right to the door. Take bus #11 from Maruyama Koen, which is a stop on the Tozai line subway.It was ¥1700 each to the top. There is a stop halfway up where you change cableway. There is a restaurant at the top for romantic dinners and a little take away shop selling snacks and drinks too. There is a love dedication type of activity for couples. Suggest going on sunset so you can see the sun go down and the city light up."
"need to take two times of cable car to reach the hill top. good panoramic view of Sapporo city. was told it""s beautiful at night."
Mt Moiwa is a must visit place if you go to Sapporo. Ring the bell and enjoy the view of the Sapporo.
Visited Mt. Moiwa  on 19 Feb 20. Took a public bus from Susikino Station to the Ropeway station. It is worth the visit with beautiful views and snow.....during sunset time
Worth a visit to view Sapporo from top. The only   dissapoint aspect is the cabel car. They put as many people posibble in the cabel car. Saw 1 old lady fall from the cabel car.
"The ropeway and cable car experience up MT Moiwa was unforgettable for our 2 boys. Be there just before 4 pm to catch both daylight, sunset and the amazing night views of the city."
"Been there during Winter, the view is 'whitely+snowly' superb! It is worth a visit. You need to take a cable car to go up to the peak and this is one of the must visit attraction in Sapporo. Easily accessible by public transport too and they do have a free shuttle bus from a certain bus stand. Suitable for anybody."
"Mt. Moiwa boasts the best spot to view the city of Sapporo, and it did draw lots of people even on a rainy, humid August night. As you might have already learned, you need to take two different gondolas to get to the top. As the gondola sent us upward, the nightly cityscape slowly and elegantly came into view, despite the annoyingly unstoppable rain. Reaching the top, well, the expected sense of excitement did not kick in. I guess it's again because of the rain. We didn't stay long as there was no shelter or awning where we could temporarily shun the raindrops. Maybe we should have come during the day time? Some afterthought after all this? The small windfall of riding on the city tram, which was very different from riding the metro. (To get to Mt. Moiwa, you either have to hop on a tram (streetcar), or hire a taxi.)"
"Went to Mt Moiwa on a lovely clear day. There's a free shuttle bus dropping you off at the cable car entrance near the street car stop. Then need to catch 2 separate cars to get to the top. As they charge separately for the 2 cars, you can decide not to go to the top if you don't want to...but why wouldn't you?The view from the top was great. Apparently it's one of the 3 'new' best night view in Japan. Oops, maybe we should've visited at night."
"We drove and took the mini cable car up to the mt moiwa. Need to pay for parking (toll) and also for the mini cable car. We went in the afternoon, it was quite windy. Nice view of Sapporo. We rang the bell of happiness for good blessings. Should have brought a padlock to place it there! There are many snacks at the shop too."
"Go to Mt. Moiwa for one of the best night views that you can get in Sapporo. Would recommend you to take a taxi there if you stay near to Sapporo station. It is much more convenient and doesn't cost too much. The ropeway and cable car towards the summit tends to get crowded, but it'll be fine once you reach the top."
"They have a live cam installed at the top of the hill where you can preview the scenery on a TV screen at reception floor, before you purchase the tickets.It was night time on our first visit there. We were hoping to see the magnificent view but unfortunately, there was heavy snow fall. The receptionist pointed at the TV screen and told us there is no view at that time (from the TV screen it was pitch black).He was polite enough to apologize to us, although it was the weather and no one could have done anything about it.We left and visited again a few days later. This time in the afternoon. The weather was fairly good, but still not clear enough. Went up all the same but didn't have a good view of the city.There isn't much to do there at the top, really. If you're going just for the view, I suppose 30 minutes would be more than enough.Make sure the sky is 110% clear on your visit, or you'll be disappointed."
Took the cable car ride up around 3pm and the  surrounding views were amazing. The sunset & night view from the top was breathtaking! Dine at Jewels restaurant. Fine food & views!
