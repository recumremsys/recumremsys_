Had such an exciting amazing experience with my girlfriend we went on the anfield stadium tour and visited the museum as wellIt was great to see all the trophies stand in the stadium when it was empty to see how huge it was. Visit the dressing rooms and media/interview areaAbsolutely fantastic guide was full of information and tips
"We had a great time visiting Anfield for the stadium tour for my sons birthday and his first trip to Anfield. Started with a few pics by the famous and New statues then into the LFC Shop. Had a good look around and he bought a new top with his birthday money.. Put it on over his other lfc top immediately.. Ha ha.. Then onto the tour itself. Alot has changed since I was there last time.. All for the better. An excellent tour up to the top of the new main stand then through to changing rooms an interview areas. Press room an other areas. An there is old big ears on the way too. Then onto the museum with all the history and trophies.. Plenty of them. Just brilliant..,and finally, a drink in the Boot Room. Carlsberg for me of course. My lad loved everything about it and my missus enjoyed it as well, our official picture taker. Getting there an back was no problem.. Train to Liverpool, breakfast in town, a trip to the Maritime museum on the Albert Dock, then the no. 26 bus takes you right outside the stadium.. Runs regularly every 10 minutes. All in all.. A very good day.."
"Have done the stadium tour twice before but wanted to see the premier league trophy & the main stand. The tour guides Mike & John were very informative, helpful & friendly & I felt very safe touring the stadium & museum with all the safety precautions in place for covid. Despite having to limit the amount of people on each tour we didn't feel rushed & were given plenty of time to take photos etc. Highly recommend this tour"
"Booked a tour of the stadium for two as a Christmas present for my fiancé through virgin experiences, we booked our slot online and pre booked a two course meal also which was really straight forward to do.We live local and parking was easy and available and close to the stadium, it was half term and there was quite a few others around. For the price we had a great little day and got a few bits from the gift shop also, would recommend for anyone who wants a tour and self guided at your own pace with headsets."
"The stadium tour was fantastic, all Liverpool fans should visit.  Going to a game was magical and a 30 year bucket list item accomplished."
"We booked an Anfield tour for the celebration of our son's 17th birthday - he's mad on Liverpool FC. His dad is Liverpool born and bred and although we live in Yorkshire he is loyal to his Liverpool roots. We arrived in terrible wet, stormy weather but were immediately given a warm and cheery welcome by the staff at the tour reception. Lots of jokes and friendly banter - there's a real genuine 'family' feel amongst the staff. We were a bit early for our tour time and they helpfully gave us our visitor wrist bands so we could visit the museum whilst we were waiting - this was really useful. The tour itself was so well organised and interesting - even to a football fan's wife. We had been on a tour here 10 years ago which was good but the tour has evolved and become even better. The tour guides Gordon and Mike were superb - so funny and lots of personal anecdotes - you could tell their genuine love and enthusiasm for the club and thorough historical knowledge. There were plenty of opportunities to stop and take photos in key areas and the background stories were fascinating and funny. We all had a great time and left with happy memories. It really made our son's birthday special. Thank you to the Anfield Tour Staff - especially Gordon and Mike who made it special."
Booked to do the Stadium tour as a Christmas present for my 13 year old son and it did not disappoint! We all had the most enjoyable day. The audio guide is great and very interesting. You go at your own pace but there are guides to answer any questions you may have. We spent 3 hours looking round and took over 100 pictures!Highlights were the dressing room and sitting in Klopps seat.Can't wait to return in March for the Liverpool Legends game.Thanks for a day we will never forget
"Did the LFC stadium tour where you can walk the grounds, visit the stands, dressing rooms and press room. You can also have your photo taken with a replica champions league trophy. Next to the stadium is the museum where you collect your photos and a huge LFC store in front of it where you can purchase all sorts of memorabilia. Even if you’re not a fan, you would be impressed with the set up. My wife isn’t and she was impressed with the Football club when she accompanied me and kids on the tour."
"Did the museum tour and it was amazing! If you are a Liverpool fan, you have to do it. The manager quotes, Stevie G’s memorabilia were just amazing. And you still could experience the players changing room, sit at Kop’s end — omg! It was surreal.. A must visit for the Liverpool fans!"
"We booked onto the tour as part of a weekend away for my husband who is a fan from a boy. Seeing all the statues, trophies and walking the stadium that he has seen only on the TV was a very emotional experience for him. We have great photos of the ground from all perspectives and an insight into the inner workings of the club. The staff were so friendly and entertaining and the tour was very well constructed to suit all ages and interest in the club. This was the perfect build up to watching a live match the day after."
"Very great stadium. Did the tour for £20 which entitles you to a stadium tour which includes home and away dressing room (best book a tour two days before a match there as they have to close off the home room the day before matchday). Staff were brilliant, tour entitles you to the Liverpool Museum which is a great learning area on older and current players. Would definitely recommend."
"Oh boy!  This is special.The tour was excellent - lead by someone who has a real passion for the club and the museum was very good, not simply hagiography.  It was special to be in the changing room and to touch the Anfield side on the way out to the pitch (not allowed on it but do walk round it!)However what was really special was that I'd been given a ticket to the game.  I'd been before, admittedly in the away end, and you didn't get the feeling that the fans mattered that much; now: what a difference.  The first thing was the overall ground, it has really been developed over the past 10 years.  It still rises from the terraced housing but it feels as if it belongs.  The club has invested in the local community and there is a wonderful sense of belonging.The ground is now set in a plaza (before  it felt cramped).  There's a band playing before kick off, the super store is doing good business and there's a really relaxed atmosphere.  I've got a ticket to the main stand which entitles me to be in the 'Dug Out' pre match area. (One area - once you are in the this area, I was not allowed back out). Riding on the escalator up to the third level there's a wonderful view out to the mouth of the Mersey and across to the Wirral.  The 'Dug Out' is brilliant. Again, relaxed and easy going. Bars at either end but the kicker are the food stands, eat the world... all covered in the price of the ticket. I had tandori chicken burger - very good.Then out into the stand. Stunning, wonderful - building atmosphere which is released at kick off as everyone sings You'll Never Walk AloneYou'd have guessed - I'm a fan: I can't compare this to other Premiership grounds (last game was Spennymoor Town v. Northwich Victoria) but I was so impressed. I think the tour though will appeal to non-supporters too, as it does cover the social history and impact of the club on the local  community."
Great tour of Anfield with brilliant informative staff.  A must for Liverpool fans! Recommend getting the bus tour which takes you there on the hour and also brings you back.
"We booked the trip via Klook.Easy to redeem at the tour counter with our mobile ticket for a wrist band Prior to the tour, a staff called Laura had emailed to inform us that the date we chose didn’t have a visit to the changing room. Luckily we were able to change the dates of our tour. Our guide was Gordon. Truly knowledgable and shared the info with such sincerity, pride and humour. He clearly adores his team and takes pride in the company he works for. My child is a Liverpool fan.I am not but I enjoyed the tour tremendously. The tour is about 1.5hours and you really get the stadium well including VIP areas. Go to the retail store AFTER the tour as they don’t allow large bags into the stadium. Worth a visit!"
"I dragged my wife to the stadium tour at Anfield for my birthday. She was dubious but did come along with an open mind. Parking was easy at Stanley Park, a short walk from the stadium. The tour guide was extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the club. The tour utilised technology really well and took in all the key areas including the press room, changing room, the top of the main stand, sitting in the Kop and the dug-outs to name a few. Included in the price was entrance to the museum to see the trophies.Both of us really enjoyed the tour and spent some time in the massive team store. We also had lunch at the stadium restaurant. All in all a very enjoyable day. This was the slickest stadium tour I have done but was the first football stadium so not sure how it compares to other big football clubs.I would definitely recommend the tour to all but it is a must for any Liverpool fan."
Thoroughly enjoyed this tour.  Went by bus from Pier Head and our guide Oliver was brilliant.  Hugely knowledgeable and v funny.  Anfied Stadium tour was great too.  All the staff were really helpful and food and merchandise reasonably priced.  Definately recommend!!
"We took our 8-year old son on the LFC Stadium Tour in November 2019. We’re not Liverpool fans, but our son is currently football mad so we took him on a couple of stadium tours over the course of a weekend break.I must say we were slightly disappointed with the Anfield tour. We counted about 50 people on the same tour, which was far too many for one group. One part of the tour involved showing the view across Liverpool from the top of the main stand, where apparently you can see to Snowdonia in one direction and the Isle of Man in the other. However, being at the back of the large group, we couldn’t see anything. On trying to go and have a look at the view as the group moved on, we were told to move along and keep up with the rest of the group.Too much time was spent with the tour guide talking about how many times Liverpool had won the Champions League, describing every final in detail as we walked the corridors. This meant that the latter part of the tour, which was the bit we had wanted to see (i.e. the dressing rooms, tunnel and pitch side etc.) was very rushed. In fact, in the press conference room, many people were still queuing up to have their photo taken in Jurgen Klopp’s seat when the tour guides told us all to move on.Having been on a tour of Old Trafford on the same weekend (we’re not Man Utd fans either), I was surprised at some of the comments by the tour guide about how much Liverpool like to intimidate their opponents and make them feel very unwelcome. The tour guide at Man Utd was actually quite complimentary about Liverpool as a team - the same couldn’t be said about the Liverpool staff regarding Man Utd or in fact any away team!On the plus side, the views from the top of the main stand were great and the augmented reality viewing of a pre-match rendition of YNWA using the audio guide was very impressive. We also used the LFC City Explorer bus to get to and from Anfield and the lady who was our guide on there was very friendly and knowledgeable not just about football but about the city as a whole."
"If you even slightly love LFC, then yo should do this tour.Audio tour is great and the stadium is imposing, but the guides that you meet along the way really make it worthwhile. Have a chat and they all have something interesting to share with you.Loved it!"
Really great tour. Highly recommend whether your a Liverpool fan or not. Loads to see. Very surreal. The tour guides were great. Made it fun. Definitely do this tour. If your a Liverpool fan. It’s a must do
"Purchased for my partner who is a die hard Liverpool supporter, he loved it.As a non football fan I was pleasantly surprised and also enjoyed the stadium tour and learning about my partners passion.I didn't enjoy the museum as there were too many people and my anxiety levels increased due to lack of social distancing. We didnt do the kop bar for this reason.Overall a good tour"
Spent a few hours on a Sunday afternoon doing the Anfield Stadium and Museum tour.  It was really interesting and captures the spirit really well.  Lots of photo opportunities as well as an interesting insight into the history and current successes of the club.  Some great information around the museum.
"Had a wonderful time, spending 4 hours in total, having lunch at the boot room, museum, stadium tour and shopping at the megastore.Firstly, the stadium tour. Its professional done and i would strongly recommend that you don your liverpool kit for the occasion as there are lotsa of photo taking opportunity. Photos will look better with your liverpool kit on. Regular sized bags are allowed as well.As for the boot room, food are reasonably priced and delicious. Liverpool goals are played over and over again which makes the food taste better.The museum tour brings you back in time, old school jerseys as well as boots are on display. The highlight would be of course the 6 european cups on display. Lastly, the liverpool megastore store. Huge collection of souveniers but due to the crowd, you would be better of purchasing it via the liverpool city centre outlet.All in all, i had a great time, with sweet memories lasting for a long time."
"This was a surprise trip for my boyfriend who is a massive Liverpool fan and from the get go it was an amazing tour. Our tour guides were so involved, helpful and knowledgeable throughout making jokes and making the experience so much better than it could’ve been. The tour it’s self was amazing you get to see  so much of the stadium as fan would love! Including pitch side. Both the away and home changing rooms (brilliant seeing the difference) along with the Gerrard Collection, Liverpool museum and currently the Premier League Trophy is on display. Overall the tour was enjoyable afternoon for a non-football fan, would be perfect for a Liverpool fan there is so much to see and so much to learn and would happily go on this trip again.   Nothing better for a true Liverpool fan, getting to see such iconic parts of the stadium."
"Went on Sat 29th Feb to watch away game against Watford. This was my visit there. Took along a friend from Italy. Whilst the venue was clean and well organised - and easy to get served at the the bar ( Card only be the way ) NO CASH at bar allowed ! Place was freezing cold. I asked steward about this - who told me there was nothing they could do as it was in his words down to 'air ducts' in building. What ...I go to loads of venues to watch pop gigs , football matches ...never heard this excuse before .Also whilst there was plenty of screens there - you could hardly hear any commentary. Toilet was probably louder than anywhere here . So consequently little atmosphere. My Italian friend after  hearing all the 'Ballyhoo' around LFC was a little bit disappointed.  No wont be visiting again. There is a better atmosphere in my local pub ."
"Dragged the other half round this when we were in Liverpool for the day. Both enjoyed it and I can't recommend it highly enough, especially if you are a fan. Our tour guide (Micheal) was unbelievably knowledgeable. Everyone their was really friendly"
Been to see Liverpool play here a few times. The atmosphere is brilliant. The staff is friendly and helpful. Love visiting the stadium
"Was my hubby's dream to visit Anfield, home o this favourite team. The atmosphere was electric and we felt charged with emotion to be there. Taxis were a hell to get back to our lodgings, but a trip that was thoroughly enjoyed by us. In fact, plan to do this trip again  soon."
"An amazing dream come true for my son who got to watch Liverpool beat Leicester on the Saturday, experiencing the full Anfield atmosphere first-hand. We had the stadium tour on the Sunday and would really recommend, it was amazing to be there. Staff are so knowledgeable and passionate about the club. Recommend 100%."
"Totally worth the money. Got it all + friendly staff.    Come early, and try the boot room cafe for lunch, when youre done."
As you’d expect it’s quite the spectacle. Lots of fans around all year around and particularly at this prestigious time. Nice huge fan shop over two floors with lifts. Didn’t do any tours as it’s lockdown but nice to walk around and Stanley Park literally next to it is very nice too.
"Been on this tour twice. Absolutely flawless when we came the first time, we were given the tour in a small group by a guide. I wish I could remember his name because he was fantastic & we felt immersed in the LFC experience. Second time we had high hopes, but it was a weekend & we were surprised to find out the tour guides weren’t around, there were people everywhere wondering around with no direction and we were left with a speaker & headphones to guide us. Still fun but not the same as a savvy scouser sharing his passion as he takes you through Liverpool’s history."
Pilgrimage for a liverpool supporter. Had the opportunity to watch the derby match as well. One of the best football stadium and game i have ever been in my life
We brought our boys away for a few days over half term to Liverpool and Anfield was our first stop and it did not disappoint!! It was busy with a lot of other visitors as it was half term but didn’t feel crowded as you walk around in so many groups!! We are huge LFC supporters and the stadium tour is a must to do if you are!!Reasonable price also for a family of 5. Your can easily spend a good few hours here! Bring plenty of money for the shop too!!
Visited Anfield Stadium to complete the stadium tour. Tour guides were enthusiastic and informative. Lots of opportunities to stop and take pictures. I visited before over 10 years ago and to see the improvement/upgrades/progress was impressive. Can't wait to visit again to see the Premier League trophy!
Went for a tour for my stepdaughter and husband who are both avid Liverpool fans. The day was excellent and well managed especially with all COVID restrictions in place. Everyone made a real fuss over my stepdaughter and the icing on the cake was getting pictures taken with the premier league trophy.
