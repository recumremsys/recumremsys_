"This is a very new museum so it is modern from the outside in. It is dark inside, for obvious reasons of preserving the mosaics as much as possible. The mosaics kept here were largely found in the Zeugma area and is predominantly Greek. Most of the mosaics are very well in tact and the museum has very good signage going. There are electronic interactive displays in various parts of the museum too. The basement level was under construction when I visited so I didn't get to see much down there but the mosaics on the entrance level was definitely worth the visit. It becomes a  bit noisy with larger crowds because it creates a hollow sound. When you have a midday flight out of Gaziantep, you can easily visit this museum and make it for your flight. Don't skip this, it is worth it!"
"Took us 3 hour to leave. it was hard to leave. buy ipod museum info things, very good explanations there."
I visited Bardo Museum in Tunus couple years ago. It is known as the best mosaic museum on the world. Let me say that  Gaziantep Zeugma Mosaic Museum is as good as Bardo. Do not forget to watch the movie of history of Zeugma Ancient city at the entrance of the museum before starting to visit inside.
We had so short time in Antep but our fav thing is Zeugma Museum. Take your 2 hours enough to see around this museum. But we had less than 40 minutes and fascinating Gipsy Girl masterpiece that you will find a special show area. You will not find any sign . Upper floor and ask Cingene Kizi to the security .
"Went there with friends. The place is immense and full of archaeological treasures from the region, all well preserved and nicely exposed for the public. Some of the mosaics are really detailed, priceless pieces of art."
"Impressive, art and history museum.  Located in Antep, but 3D vine vision must be re arranged, because 3D glasses are not hygienic, they must switch with single use 3D glasses."
"Great exhibition of Zeugma Mosaics (there are mosaics from another places too, but the main collection is from Zeugma). The mosaics are incredibly in good condition and It's worth a long visit. Take the audio guide. There's also a short film about the mosaics but you have to pay and it's not open to everyone. I think they could find the way to show the film all day in different languages as it happens in most museums."
"A huge mozaik collection of the antique city Zeugma, and all of this in a great building with wonderful displays. Maybe the most astonishing is the so-called 'gipsy girl' image, but there is so much to see (sculpture of Mars) that this museum is truly a gem of the city. Take your time and enjoy!"
"The Zeugma Mosaic Museum is extremely modern and well run. Being drop off at the end of our tour, we came with suitcases. There was an storage area at the right of the entrance free of charge.The museum uses full scale replicas of street, fountain, building walls and foundation stones, constructed according to the architecture of the time. There were a ever changing video images on a small area of the floor near the entrance, that we've never seen anywhere else before. The mysterious Gypsy Girl on the second floor, displayed in a labyrinthine dark room. Very captivating.Gaziantep is so far out of the main tourist drag, the museum was not at all crowed. One can take your time to enjoy all the gorgeously displayed artwork. The 8 minutes 3D movie/video with sound track, on the right of the entrance is an experience not to be missed ( ticket 8 lira)There's a good size gift shop and café just outside the main gate. Taxi stand is at the back of the museum. A must see if you love art and history."
"A beautiful collection of mosaics, mostly from Zeugma. The collection is displayed in a very nice way and there are some interactive pieces as well. Seeing the incredible artistry from the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD was just mind boggling. As I kept repeating, ""This was made with ROCKS!"" Definitely worth a trip!!"
i can't believe how they preserve the ancient stones. Perfect place to visit. If you are in Antep you have to go there. Don't forget to see the Gipsy..
"In addition to the famous mosaic ""Gipsy Girl"", you will see lots of mosaics from ancient times. Be careful enough and you might hear the story of the Gipsy Girl!"
Fantastic museum of Zeugma’s incredible mosaics. Better to watch the cinevision before the tour inside. Don’t miss the gipsy girl upstairs
This is a fascinating museum made especially to house the mosaics found whilst a damp was being developed. Saving them from the waters. The C2nd to C4th Greek works depict everything from the classic god through to the early signs of Christianity. The large space really brought me close to the peoples who made the art.
"Working in Gaziantep in February 2019 and our host arranged for us to visit this museum.  Did not know what to expect but you start with a 3D film about the mosaics, where they were found and how they were rescued from the Euphratris river as it was being flooded as part of a large project.  We were fortunate to have a local archiologist to explain each mosaic although for visitors you can rent a headset in your own language to I assume provide the same.  The mosaics are wonderful most laid out on the floor but some wall mounted.  2 hours went past in the blink of an eye.  By the time we ame out the caf and shop had closed so cnnot comment on them.  Definately the place to visit if you are in Gaziantep"
"This museum is located in the suburb area of Gaziantep. It's better to take a taxi to get there.And due to the location, there are few visitors and it's good to look around.Since it opens at 9, It's preferred to visit early-opening places first if you are in a hurry schedule.It's worthy of visiting and well-maintained. The highlight of the museum is The Gypsy Girl that the girl in the painting is beholding. Try to move from left to right while watching."
"Going to this museum is an experience worth the trip to Turkey.  The quality of the mosaics is outstanding.  The mosaics are exhibited as they were found, in many cases in the settings of the villas that housed them.  The second floor looks down unto the astounding designs  so they can be better understood and appreciated. Incredible portraits, inventive patterns, carefully selected colors, all make for a visit that you promise yourself you will return again. A must see."
Loved the detail and preservation of historic items from Roman times.  It is one of the best museums I have seen in Turkey.  Very modern and peaceful.  Reasonably priced Gift shop on site.
"A must!! Even if it is out of your way, you have to add this museum to your preferred sights. The recovered mosaics and fresco’s are impressive. Knowing that they had limited time to save these pieces of art. Each one is more impressive than the other ... visit :)"
I am not a museum type person but was blown away by this museum. Incredible collection displayed beautifully. Spent 1 1/2 hours here but could easily have taken longer. Much more impressive mosaic display than at Pompeii or the Ephesus Terrace Houses. Entry covered by the Museum Card. Was very busy at time we visited. Visited at opening time and there were already 4 tour buses unloaded in the carpark.
"Well maintained museum for a 1-2 h visit, close to forum mall. Take your time through the first parts of the museum, as here the best collections are exhibited, towards the end it becomes all less extraordinary."
Don't leave Gaziantep without seeing this museum. I amazed by the mosaics and history beyond them. You should take 2 hours for truly visiting
"A gorgeously, aesthetic and well planned exhibit of beautiful mosaics from Zeugma.  This is definitely the gem of Gaziantep and a gem in the anthropological/archaeological crown of Turkey, ""the biggest museum in the world"".  As you enter, the exhibit is set so that you feel you are in a late Roman courtyard.  Make sure you rent the audio as there is more detailed information than is posted in the exhibit.  Although the staff knows little English many made efforts to help me with questions and directions and were quite friendly.  It is a definite must see museum."
"I have been to many of the mosaic museums this Levant, However this museum is the best I've been to indeed. Most of the Mosaics are very well preserved with very high sense of fine art, especially of those of Zeugma. You will see in other rooms some christian mosaics, some with Syriac writing, but the Zeugma ones are the best really. The visit to the museum has triggered our curiosity and the we headed to the Euphrates on the very next day and stopped for an hour at the site itself by the reservoir. We saw some villas covered for protection and some of the mosaics kept on location. Do not leave Antep until you see it."
A great museum displaying beautiful mosaics uncovered from the ancient city of Zeugma. The plaques provide great commentary on the mosaics. Spend around 2 hrs here.
"A must see place in Turkey, especially if you are in Gaziantep. Unbelievable, great mosaics from thousands years ago. Get an audio guide and enjoy the amazing mosaics.."
"This is a definite holiday destination.  Lots to see and very well arranged.  There is a small entry fee, if you don't have the national museum pass.  Really good.  Don't miss the Gypsy Girl, which is hidden in a black room in the back of the second floor."
Priceless historical artifacts . Mosaics . There are many characteristics that puts Belkýs? Zeugma in a distinguished position among similar antique sites in Anatolia.One of these is the style in the sculpture and teliefs.Samples of this uniqe style can be seen at many museums around Turkey the world. The main importance of Zeugma are the Roman villas and the floor mosaics found in them only.A small number of which could be brought to daylight by the excavations.These hillside villas which similars can only be see in Ephesus Antique city in Turkey and they carry utmost importance archeologically. Researches by experts have proved that once the excavations are completed Gaziantep Museum will be the leading mosaic Museum in the world.The reason it is on a cross road and it’s a trade and military city it has been very popular by the artists.Even the retired officers had a attracted the best artists of the period.This way they have left behind the masterpieces of mosaics and fresks which is today a big issue.
One of the best museums in Turkey. Don't miss to watch the cinema (costs 5 tl / person) before taking the tour to have a general knowledge.
"Thank to the prominent works of Ministry of Culture, nicely preserved mosaics are demonstrated in a series of fluent themes. One of those to-be-seen-before-one-dies kind of things"
"Everything that other reviewers have said is true. This is a wonderful exhibition of the rescued mosaics of Zeugma, some in reconstructed settings of the original buildings that they were found in. It also makes you appreciate the lengths that looters will go to to remove parts of mosaics just to serve the selfish greed of the few. My favourite mosaic were not actually from Zeugma itself, but from the region. One, with a doppy-looking dog, looks like the parents went away for a weekend and told the kids to amuse themselves with the box of mosaic tiles. It's hilarious! The other came from a church, and there is writing on either side of a figure. The strange thing is that the `writing' is not in any known local script! Check it out."
We had family trip to Gaziantep with the kids. We visited this museum on a Saturday afternoon. When you are getting the the tickets you are asked if you want to join the the 3D video of History of Zeugma Film which take aproximately 12 minutes. We joined it and I recommend you to do it before you visit the museum. The rest is history. The museum will take you to 2000 years earlier. Enjoy it...
A must see in gaziantep. Wowww both the mosaic and the presentation is great. Do not forget your mouseum entrance card...
"There is a great collection of mosaics here, some are completely intact while others in various states of incomplete condition.  Note that the collection will be expanding (no date was given) as they were installing additional mosaics in an adjacent building.  Photography is allowed.  Allow 1 to 1.5hrs visiting."
One of the best museums I have ever been. Get an audio guide and listen to the all items with every details available.Very exciting way of brushing up your mythology knowledge.
