"DO NOT GO HERE! Just skip it! I went on 8/15 and I had a horrible experience. I have a green health QR code but because I’m a foreigner they took me out of line and and wrote down my passport number. Basess discrimination. I had to buy a physical ticket because I’m not Chinese. A ticket that you can ONLY buy with cash. No one uses cash. I needed to ask 5 people to give me 100 RMB Cash and give them WeChat pay in exchange. No one was social distancing, not everyone was wearing masks and Covid is still a very real problem here. It was a mess. You walk from 1 ticket check to another ticket check 500 meters away. Because in your 500 meters somehow your admission into the place must be called into question. You walk more into this big building. Take 1 picture and leave. This whole process takes 90 mins for 1 picture of the warriors. Just horrible! . Also to make matters worse it was 100 degrees and I had two younger children with me.What made it even worse was the fact someone shoved my wife and she almost fell down the stairs. Never never never again! This is 100% factual!"
"Visited the warriors and we were not disappointed. We had our own guide, arranged beforehand and was able to learn so much. Living in  china has enabled to see so many things we thought we’d never see including these. The main pit is humongous and the warriors all lined up is amazing! Pure sight of awe. Looking at the others are interesting too, including the bronze statues and the different warriors in the glass display cabinets. Best fact- every SINGLE one has different facial features. No two are the same. Amazing"
"Visited August 2017:One of the greatest archeological discoveries of modern time. An extraordinary underground treasure, an entire army of life size terrain cotta soldiers and horses interred for more than 2,000 years. A must see!"
Took a taxi to the Park and selected a guide at the Museum.  Best to get a guide and he saved us lot of time and seen the impostant locations.
"This is probably the main attraction in Xian.  We took a bus from the railway station. had to queue up with lots of people but buses move as soon as it was full.  Had to pay 120 yuan per person, but free for seniors 65 years and above.  Quite interesting to see the various excavation sites and the terra cotta warriors.  Very crowded with tourists and need to jostle for space to take photos.  Lots of walking and outside sun is hot when walking between buildings. Bring hat and water. Wear comfortable shoes. Need a day trip to visit here."
"Imagine standing in a large shed that can fit 3 A380s side by side. Then, imagine the jets are replaced by Emperor Qin’s terra-cotta army facing you. Archers, soldiers, generals, chariots and all facial expressions and features  of each soldier are muddled Ina actually soldier in Qin’s Army. That’s the daunting reality of the Terra-cotta Army!"
"Loved the warriors, especially the individual hairstyles and faces! All the family enjoyed our visit."
Took the public transport which consists of a train ride and a bus ride. It takes around one hour or so to get there by public transport. It can get crowded at times because there is so many people heading to this place. So I recommend to go there early. Many open pits for you to see the terracotta warriors.
No visit to Xian is complete without visiting this famed world heritage site from the Qin dynasty built for the Qin Emperor (Qin Shi Huang). Take approx. 1-2 hours to visit this place.
"A collection of several thousand life-size figures, made of terracotta (burnt clay), depicting soldiers, officers and horses found in the tomb of the first Chinese emperor Qin Shi. During the funeral of the emperor in 210 BCE the whole army was also placed in underground rooms. The most important point of the entire complex of buildings that make up the mausoleum is the hill, under which the burial chambers surrounded by the underground defensive wall were placed. According to beliefs, the Terracotta Army was to protect the emperor and help him regain power in the afterlife. Sculptures of soldiers have individualized features, initially all figures were painted in bright red, blue, pink and gold [2]. The colors remained until they were discovered in 1974, however, under the influence of air, the colors began to gradually fade.

The downside of this place is the large number of tourists, which is crowded."
