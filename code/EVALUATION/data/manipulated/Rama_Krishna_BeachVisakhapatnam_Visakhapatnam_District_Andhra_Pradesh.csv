Visited this beautiful beach this week.It is just 10 kms away from city having a long strech of around 40 kms. OLA Uber cabs are easily available to reach here. Really clean water and Elegant beach it is. Few vendors are available for refreshment.Washroom not seen nearby.
"Well maintained beach road, and area by AP govt. You can spend early morning and evening at this place. Being rock area its not advisable to enter the water. Great place to spend your time with family."
"This is the nearest and longest developed beach in Vizag. People come here for mornjng and evening jogs. Unlike other beaches in India, this one is maintained clean and tidy. Come here for the year end Vishaka Utsav where you get to see many new stalls, attractions, live concerts and many more to do right on the beach. Water is very clean here and from here you can see many ships and commercial vessels sailing. Apart from this clean long Beach where you can play enjoy or relax single or with friends or family, on the other side of the beach road are many restaurants good eateries hotels to stay, theatres to watch movies. Means be it on the beach or off the beach you are sure shot not to be left out. Eating staying entertainment and all these when your at this beach also know. As RK beach. Enjoy folks"
Rk beach is one of the famous beach in Visakhapatnam. Cool breeze and beautiful sea. Have fun with your family members. Enjoy with your family members
"This is a must visit place for all visitors to Visakhapatnam. The name came due to the existance of Rama Krishna Mission, nearly 80 years. It is still exists and many visit the Ashram. They maintain a Temple, guest houses and a Library. The beach is beautiful. Many people walk on beach road. In the morning the road blocked for vehicular traffic between 0500AM  to 0730 AM, to facilitate pollution-free walking. It has a beautiful Durga Temple. There are decent Restaurants and places for children activities. Rama Krishna Beach has Submarine Museum and Aircraft Museum. One can taste many local snacks from small vendors, especially PIDATHA KINDA PAPPU. Come any enjoy !!But keep it clean !!"
"Developed by VUDA, a nice & cool place to hang out in evenings. It is surrounded by lot of restaurants, street chats. Nearby there is a matsyalaya. Few water sports options are available. Even Bean bags are available to sit and enjoy the beach view."
"Among the many beaches in Vizag, this is the most popular. Happens to be crowded for the same reason. Near to various hotels like novotel, grandbay, gateway, oyo blak n wite etc. Easily accessible by auto, bus n cab. Many stalls selling street food and fish are there. Responsible for a lot of trash generated. Drain opening into the sea is an eyesore. Must visit nevertheless, esp in the mornings."
Most clean beach in india(I visited all the prominent beaches in india) in trems of cosmopolitan cities. Vast beach with many attractions and activities for all age groups. Try andhra style bhel(pidatha mixture)
Good and clean beach. Love the tree planted in the beach.  Feel  like Goa. Good food joints near the beach even lot of place to see.
"Neatly maintained by Govt! Peoples also more cautious about cleanliness. Controlled traffic in and around this beach. Helpful cops. Plenty of roadside shop for food, shopping, restaurants etc available in a stretch. Museums, parks, road side land marks.. Must visit in Vizaq."
"Seen city waste water draining directly to sea....this is seriously blunder from municipal of vizag...how can we enter into this beach? No hygenine....Rest the roads are well maintained, good for morning walking. But do not enter into the sea...else you will be infected."
Had been to this beach for a morning jog. Municipal corporation has done a great job by constructing and maintaining all around the beach. Even public toilets are in place.. Yet as usual we and our country men take pleasure to use the beach as a public toilet for both types of excretion. I would say MC should install CCTVs and publish such videos on TV on local channels. U can barely walk on the beach as most places are flooded with human waste and debris and garbage.
"Busy and renowned beach in Vizag, very crowded. Try not to miss this one if you are in Vizag, nothing new to offer but a regular beach. Go during non sunny day."
"I was on a trip to Bangalore and had a halt at Vizag. Decided to visit RK beach which i heard a lot about. It was just 30 mins from Airport. Nice place. well kept. Adjacent to the beach road. Great view of the open ocean. Very peaceful too. We could see huge ships anchored at distance. Was lucky to see a diesel submarine also! We reached there in noon so it was not crowded. Couldn't get the see the Submarine Museum as it opens at 2 PM; We left before that; There was am option to lie down at Sunbatch chair (cushioned); they charge Rs 30 for an hour. No liquor is permitted there. But you can sneak it in from a nearby shop and drink silently, i heard..Overall the view was great! Wind was blowing nicely and it was cool. Great Experience."
"If you went to Visakhapatnam, you should go to to RK Beach evening. Rk beach is very romantic at evening time. Sounds waves and breeze awesome."
Ram Krishna Beach is about 7-8 Km from Yatri Nivas Haritha Hotel and about 4.5 km from Vizag railway station. Go there by auto via the Beach Road. Auto on Reserve generally takes 100 INR to 150 INR. Swimming is prohibited as well as smoking. Though I saw people swimming merrily. Horse and Camel riding available generally at the evening. Beach umbrellas with relaxing beds/chairs available at one point. Washroom available nearby on the beach itself. Ambience is good.
Went there few days back! It is a calm beach which is totally neat and tidy with a little tourists visiting it. The beach is within 15 minutes reach from Railway station (take bus no.211 ticket Rs.10/-) and be there. Remember the first compartment of bus in the front is reserved for ladies and men are strictly advised to board the bus from back door.Good place to take morning /evening stroll as the views are amazing that time.
"I m born n brought up in Mumbai. Saw many beaches from berth here but first time I ever seen such clean n neat Beach.Very very safe for all, well connected to main city n market by buses n autos also private cabs n vehicles.Must visit !"
"RK Beach is a must visit in Vizag and frankly you cannot miss it. while the beach is little dirty, the promenade is well maintained. very good for evening walks. enjoyed it."
Been to RK beach early morning. Neatly maintained roads. Ample parking space and small park for kids.. Beach is good for early morning stroll.
Beautiful beach. Nice place for family friends and kids too. Walking along the beach is nice or even a car ride. Good place to spend time.
Visited Vizag after over 20 years. Was there mainly to watch the India vs SA cricket test match. Was very happy with the way the RK Beach area has been developed. It is fairly clean and the Submarine and TU142 aircraft museums add to the beauty of the area. Hope they keep it that way.
"Thank's to the etiquettes of the people of Visakhapatnam, this famous beach ( both with the locals and tourists) is clean and well maintained. You can have a bath in the sea during the day or have a lazy stroll , enjoying the sea breeze in the evening.There are a lot of small shops selling street food to toys and clothes. Do try some street food while you are here."
"Located near Novotel And Gateway hotels, it is one of the best beaches in Vizag. Proper Parking. Plenty of People and Food Stalls. Very Clean and Maintained Beach."
Did not enjoyed that much because it's so crowded all the time. It can be more planned. Cleanliness also another issue here.
"vishakapatnam is my favourite and most peaceful place.i just love vizag and its calmness. watching movies at inox varun beach and an evening walk at the beach is most happiest thing to do. winter is the best time to visit as it is too humid and warm during other seasons. araku,paderu and other tribal hamlets are pleasure to travel and see the life that you have never seen. everyone should visit these places if you want to experience real nature."
"The RK beach coast line is a beautiful stretch for approx 35 to 40 Kms. We can certainly enjoy a morning jog, cycling, walking with families and the weather is really lovely and we live here so i can only i absolutely love it. Being travelled all arouond the world and across the planet due to my business and job reasons i love relaxing here for approx 4 months a year with my family and having loads of fun."
Went for a evening walk in the beach. It was clean and beautiful. A must visit place in Vizag. There is a submarine museum which is also good.
"Went on 2/10/17 with family, street food presence, nice pavement to walk. Good bustle on the road and beach. best keep your shoes sandles at bay and take walk on the sand. clean beach with good for playing beach vollyball, specially designed sand/ beach motorcycle."
"This is one of the cleanest beach I have ever been to in India. Though, during the evenings it is a bit too much crowded. Try to go before the sunset, otherwise it is flooded with local people as it is a popular spot"
"RK beach - excellent views, with the Submarine museum onshore. Have a plenty of excellent hotel by the shores. Nice place to stay few days and rejuvenate."
Avoid RK Beach if you are looking for a peachful beach outing. It is extremely crowded and dirty. Nothing much to offer expect small shops.
"Coming from the good beaches in goa and a recent trip to Cebu, the beach was a disaster.. Though the government has kept it clean, there are a lot of hassling from beggars and vendors.."
We visited during the time of May and the beach is super crowded and really really dirty. I don't recommend anybody to venture into the water. Its a good place for a morning walk and pretty much that's it. Try RishiKonda beach instead
Stroll down the beach will be a nice experience. But not that clean. Good part is that traffic is blocked in the morning time along the beach road. Lovely sight to watch the sun rise.
