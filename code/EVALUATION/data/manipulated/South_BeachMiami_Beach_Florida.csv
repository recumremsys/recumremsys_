"very nice beach, very popular.  great place to people-watch or enjoy the sand.   be sure to explore the boardwalk too."
"Lots of iconic buildings, beach, volleyball & fitness stations. Numerous restaurants. great place for biking. Was there midweek so parking was easy."
"South Beach was wild. So many beautiful people. Great food, Cold drinks, Good Music. Hot cars. Loved Versace's Mansion, The Clevelander, The Breakwater. The Carlye Hotel."
"Best spot in Miami, food, beach, sports, people, fun and environment. Go there, its unbelievable. Amazing"
I had a great time! It was clean and beautiful. Rhey have paid beach daybeds and chairs. I dont know how much. I Recommend this beach. follow me on ig nikkilyfe
"Nice location, very busy with people, lots of fun and easy-going atmosphere. Hard to find a good spot during busy days. Close to some other attractions too. Boardwalk was a pleasant experience too. Looking forward to going there again"
"Had a great time, the strip is awesome. Fat Tuesday is a good place to go for drinks, music & games."
"Clean sand, blue water and a quite place to relax is all we wanted and we got it! We will go back. Thank you"
"Given its fame, it’s rather ordinary just like any other beach with sand, ocean and people. No specific character to it. If one is looking to just relax, sunbathe and swim it serves the purpose."
"A lovely beach, pristine and blissful. Take the family there to enjoy the sun sand and sea or rock solo and enjoy it yourself. I visited in Jan 2020 and the place was cold as well as the ocean."
Spend a great day at South Beach. Enjoyed the water and the waves. Good size waves but not overpowering. The beach is very long so we enjoyed a nice long walk.
"The trendy, but beautiful beach to be seen at. Packed on a hot day. Silver sand, warm waters. Life guards. Beautiful people. Music. Shouldn’t be missed!"
It was a nice walk and a calm day.  Went to the pier and took photos.  The beach was busy and inviting.
Miami Beach is like the Gold Coast in Australia on steroids. Is clean iconic and surrounding cafes make for a interesting stay
Beautiful weather and location! There is a lot to do at every hour of the day! Prices are a little on the high side but that is to be expected at a location like South Beach! Bring your wallet and sunscreen!
Well worth a visit. A lot of restaurants to choose from but a bit expensive. Hire A bike it’s cheap and great fun!
"You can take picts besides or in the front of these scenic beach houses/observation towers, some do it to post on social cal media. Best time early in the morning or late afternoon. Be careful of the strong sun, protection required. The beach is clean and ordinary, public authorities (Security and cleaning services) are present. One day on the beach during your holidays here is a must."
"The beach is beautiful and you will have an amazing day. However, don't try to rent a chair and some shadow, they will charge $60.00 for it, crazy! A bottle of water$6.00. Be prepare to spend money if you're prepared."
"So beautiful, clean and quiet.  Having an umbrella and a chair was very helpful. Not too crowded everyone kept social distance and that was very important. Can’t wait to go back."
Enjoyed going to the beach in January. The sand wasn't as soft as other beaches. The seagulls were relentless when I pulled out my lunch. But the water was clean. Waves were calm.
"Beach is beautiful. Especially, there are many colorful small houses for the life guards. Walking on the beach is relax. In the morning, yoga or meditation is nice. But, the sand quality could be better."
"The beaches were beautiful and not over-crowded. The seaweed was quite bothersome, but that is expected at times. Rented a beach chair/umbrella at the beach and had a great time."
"Walked around at the tail end of a major Arts show - there were still sand sculptures on the beach which were pretty cool.  There is a section dedicated for people to work out and exercise at - one of the busier places just off the beach.  Easy access from the main drag with lotsa families, couple and singles walking around."
Bring your credit card and try not to gawk. No cheap eats here and the scenery is awesome. Go inside some of these beautifully restored restaurants/bars/hotels. Quite the scene.
"Try and visit the beach and sunrise, take a walk along the shore. You won't be disappointed, the view is beautiful."
Gorgeous sandy beach that stretches for miles on end. Really big. Not super busy but maybe it’s because we went in low season. Felt really safe. Lots of sun beds on offer. Gorgeous beach to top up your sun tan.
We as a family enjoyed our day out. We really enjoyed the walking and Sightseeing. Of course we also found some really great small stores and restaurants. Enjoy
"Walking to watch the sun rise from the southern point has become a favorite with us when we visit Miami Beach. Great for ambiance, great light for photography and great for people watching. Finishing the walk with a breakfast on Ocean Drive makes this a perfect way to start your day."
Visited south beach for my birthday after the 4th of July. The beach was nice and socially distanced. I really enjoyed it!
"After going to siesta Beach by Sarasota, this just doesn't compare to the number one beach, it does have a beautiful view a nice sky line behind you, but there are definitely nicer beaches and the sand was not very good for building castles.  Add on the dozen cigarette butts within sight of where I sat, and.. you make up your own mind if it sounds like a place you want to go???"
Went for Art Deco festival. The architecture is phenomenal. The streets were blocked off for the festival which was very fun. We felt safe. A lot of police presence. Beach clean. Water too cold to swim.
"I have been to South Beach a half dozen trips for various reasons and enjoy it presents an opportunity for a nice, long, unobstructed walk while being close to plenty of restaurants and shops.  Don't expect serene ocean sounds in the evenings, rather it is that mixed with music from nearby establishments and cars along Ocean Drive."
South Beach Miami. If you are thinking of staying in South Beach prior to a cruise forget it. The whole place is a rip off. From 2 sandwiches and 2 coffees costing you $65 to dinner 1 course and wine at $165 if we had 4 courses it would have been $300. They have a mandatory 20% tip included plus tax of 7% so you really feel at every turn you are being had over.  Our hotel was $250 a night and the breakfast is another rip off. Plus a resort fee added after you have prepaid of $40 a night and some hotels are up to $ 80 a night. The whole area seems run down with 25% of shops empty it feels like a ghetto so if you are cruise passengers avoid this whole area. Stay downtown or by the port...avoid South Beach at all costs otherwise you will be fleeced at every point and you cannot avoid it. Be warned! Shipmates this place is not for you.
"My husband and I planned to extend our trip and celebrate our anniversary in South Beach.  We love the action, architecture, beach and variety of hotel and food options in South Beach.  This visit did not disappointed, as it was just as beautiful and active as we had remembered. To our surprise we were present the Sunday before the Super Bowl.  All the big sports channels had set up along the ocean front to broadcast live.  Every visit we have been surprised by various events happening along the waterfront, great place to sit and watch the world walk by.  If you are looking for quiet South Beach is not for you, we are in our 50’s and love to see action, watch young people be young and feel the pulse and energy of a hot spot.  The noise of music and traffic come with that and we love it on Ocean Ave.  Stayed at the lovely restored Victory hotel with a balcony to take advantage of the action.  If you are not like us and want quiet, you might want to consider Collins Ave., but you will need to walk further to beach and action.  I highly recommend this fantastic, fun, vibrant vacation destination! Great for couples but we saw families and we have brought our kids in their 20’s and they  think it is the place to be. Highly Recommend!"
excellent walking/people watching whether or not it's a beach day. Bring a camera and head from muscle area all the way down to the Lincoln Rd area before
