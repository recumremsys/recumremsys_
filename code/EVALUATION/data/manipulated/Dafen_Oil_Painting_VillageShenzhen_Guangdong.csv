"There are some interesting things to do here, like get a painting class.  Watch Artisans at work.  But you have to spend a little time walking around and stopping in places.  Somethings are not so obvious at first glance."
Very colorful and interesting to watch the artists work. There are so msny varities of paintings. Give yourself a couple of hours to wander around. Its right off the metro line and easy to find.
"It was a good experience to see various paintings, styles, tools and techniques. Saw some artists at work. Relaxed day out. To avoid with kids as they will get bored and no time for parents to enjoy quietly the art works. Good Walmart supermarket also available for good and warm food."
Go only if you are interested in buying articles and paintings. could find some copy of famous paintings and could buy at a better deal
"A great place to spend between half day to one day. Went there a couple of times to help friends get paintings framed, buy art supplies (canvas, acrylic paint) and also to just explore the small galleries and alleys. Best way is taking the metro to Dafen station exit A1 from Longgang Line (blue one)"
Had a wonderful day in this village -- seeing artists at work and never knowing what lies around the next corner.  The art supply shops were also very helpful.
"Dafen is where we go to relax,  to buy art and art supplies,  to walk,  to see artists in action,  to enjoy the architecture and the street vibe. There are art shops as far as the eye can see,  workshops that do framing,  printing and block mounting. The silk thread art is extraordinary but the oils and watercolors are why people go there. The original work is impressive but the reproductions are what make Dafen for me. Hand painted reproductions that are excellent but do not pretend to be anything other than reproductions."
Spent a few hours walking around and bought some nice art for good prices. Worth a visit if you are looking to buy some art!
"If paintings interest you, then this makes a wonderful day trip. There are hundreds of shop selling all kinds of art, from the cheap and cheerful to average copies of Van Gogh and Klimt, to some stunning original art. Remember to budget lots of time, shops or painters have different specialties, so you will need to spend time walking around. Don't miss the Courtyard, a beautiful old house that it's also the owners gallery. Easily can spend 3-4 hours here not including breaks. Makes a great day trip."
I spent a very pleasant afternoon here. Don't miss going to the famous artist's house at the Sunrise Art Centre and the Dafen Art Gallery.  It's a short walk from Dafen metro station.    There is a huge amount and variety of art with everything from commercial bulk copies to the genuinely lovely and original.
"Listen, you are in Shenzhen, not Paris. It is still amazing to see art being made. There are people printing out masterpieces on canvas and applying oil techniques on top to create very good replicas. There are also some people doing original things. It doesn't matter, people are creating things and its cool. Also, get some lunch at the noodle place (look for vibrant blue tables) or dumplings right around the corner. If you are traveling with a husband... you can get him a beer at the convenience store and bring it to lunch. Just go."
"I read every review on tripadvisor before I came. Well I'm an art lover and I spent 3 happy days in the village. I bought art supplies (really cheap) and art drawing books that you cant get elsewhere. And of course looked and looked at all the art works. Many art lovers pooh pooh the place, it is a copycat, there's no artistic merit etc but I think otherwise. In the western world, people pay obscene amounts for an unmade bed littered with condoms and hundreds of millions for a painting. Isn't that more questionable? Most art enthusiasts aren't collectors so we aren't rich so dafen has bridged that gap by making art accessible to the masses. Sure most of the paintings look about the same, western landscape, classical ballrooms etc but it still takes skill to paint it, even if it is over a computer generated image. You have to think about how to get the shading effect, the mix of colours, it takes skill. My only grouse is that there aren't any decent hotels nearby, mine was quite run down. Still I.enjoyed myself thoroughly and might consider returning to take art lessons."
"I live in Shenzhen and went here to frame some paintings that I had.  Ended up spending half a day here walking around.  First of all, take a taxi here.  We drove, parking is a total and complete nightmare as this place is really a village within the city, very little parking.  Lots of galleries and people painting in alleyways here, pretty cool to see basically painting manufacturing in process.  We didn't buy any paintings but wow, framing is cheap.  Framing a pretty big painting with my chosen frame wood, background and glass with something like Rmb 150.  Couldn't believe it.  Took about 30 minutes, you can watch them cutting the wood etc, which is cool by itself.There are cafes and restaurants around here as well.  So you can see some paintings and then go have lunch.  Foot massage places here too if you want.  Altogether, not a bad place to go for a half day, definitely a unique place."
"Pretty good. Lots of paintings for sale, or send a photo on wechat and have a custom painting done. Cheapest with low detail, had a nice size work done for 160rmb in an abstract style. Don't plan to eat here, there's nothing in the area that's really great."
Lovely to wander round the streets and take in all the Art.  Bought some fantastic pieces at a reasonable price.  it is a really interesting visit and worth the time to wander the streets.
"An absolute must do when visiting Shenzen. Amazing to watch the artists at work. Prices vary depending on what you are looking for. I have an artist that does all my paintings. I email the photo from Australia and when he is finished he posts home to me. Does an awesome job. Had the opportunity to meet him and pick up my paintings this time. Language barrier quite difficult, but usually an interpreter around somewhere who understands basic English.Could spend a whole day in this village.Not as easy to get a cab from Dafen as it is to go there, but there is a train station if you know where you are goingBig Walmart across the road for shopper aholics"
"This is a good place to go and buy oil paintings from makers directly. Note that there is a complete range of prices you will encounter and to get better prices you might have to walk in some of the side roads.We came across a shop selling small media panels at 15 yuans each. The place itself is well connected via Dafen metro station, just walk past the Walmart."
"Cool, artsy village with lots of oil paintings to admire and stores to browse through. Great finds at good prices if you look close enough. They have a few cafes and snack places there as well and I'd say 2 hours is plenty to walk and see most of it. Took a taxi there and back, wasn't a problem. One of the few ""urban villages"" in Shenzhen, 60% of the world's oil paintings came from Dafen at one point in time."
"Developers are closing in on this charming place where you can see artists painting in the alleyways. See it before it's gone. You can also buy all kinds of art here, or order it to your liking."
Enjoyed a great day with students from our school touring the DaFen Village. Great bargains and lots and lots of different paintings to choose from. Definitely an interesting place to visit and explore! Many small alleyways with artist busy painting copies of some famous artist as well as creating some of their own great works.
"Did not really enjoyed much, but there where nice paintings of course. A lot of portraits of Chairman Mao."
Ample Art works depending on your budget from cheap too expensive. Spend the day. Get there by Metro / Subway.
"Take 300RMB and you can get a family portrait in many different styles.  Lots of great art for you to browse in many different forms (water color, oil, pottery etc.)Good for at least a half day."
"Looking for a nice fake? Need a painting of your own picture, or just something nice on the wall; a place to go."
"I'm not a big art fan, but I loved this little painting village! Been there several times since my stay here in Shenzhen! Definitely a great place to come to if you ever visit Shenzhen! You can also see the painters at work which is pretty cool! You could also haggle and get a really good deal on a painting! Also you could even buy painting supplies, which I did!"
"Don't shop immediately - walk around, price everywhere and negotiate. Don't go to early as some shops wont be open yet."
"Lots of Chinese paintings in one place.  Trickling of contemporary art when we visited, thought it may change in the future.  Interesting experience."
Had a few hours while visiting Shenzhen and took their very easy to use Subway to Dafen.  So interesting to see the artists making copies of famous works of art.  Each and every street is packed with little studios.  Well worth a visit to see.
"An interesting place with art for everyone, a wide range of paintings and embroidery in many different styles, some originals some copies or if you want a portrait or something specific you will be able to get it done here. Only down side being a foreigner like most places out of town is that the language barrier can be a problem so have a local with you or try and use your phone to translate. But a very interesting place and a couple quirky cafe's around too. Don't be afraid to walk down the side streets and go into shops, shop owners and artists are more than happy for you to view their work and watch them creating their paintings"
Little oasis in Shenzen & amazing art. Good coffee but almost nothing by way of food. Have commissioned some art & also bought 'off the wall'
Went there thinking of there being a museum and some type of history behind this. Very misleading. There's just alleys of art shops. Nothing much to see if you're not interested in buying some art pieces.
"To walk around Dafen and see shop after shop chock full of paintings is to be amazed at the scale of the business that Dafen represents. Enjoy the walk, talk to the shop owners. Marvel at the artificial quality of the area. Simply amazing."
You can spend the entire day sinking in the beauty and atmosphere of the place. Talented artists all around you will end u buying something or the other.Beware of counterfeits. Take time to observe the painters its quite a rewarding experience.Get down at Dafen Village MTR and walk towards Walmart. Its on the lane next to Walmart.
"I was amazed to visit the village and saw how many Monets and Renoirs and other modern chinese paintings were available for as little as 350 RMB.   But most interesting thing was not the coping of old masters but the real artists in the village.  For example, paper cutting is a real art form and I was able to see those artists at work.   You can find real interesting things in a most obscure art shop.   Be open minded for what these painters can do...."
"I really enjoyed my visit to the Dafen Oil Painting Village. I could get lost walking up and down the laneways looking at replicas of some of the greatest artworks in history. Getting a replica isn't to my taste, but this is China, and China loves a good replica! That said, it is very impressive seeing these painters recreate these classics. Replica in my opinion is its own form of expression. This is for art lovers, but in the bustling city that is Shenzhen, it's nice to step out into something more tranquil."
