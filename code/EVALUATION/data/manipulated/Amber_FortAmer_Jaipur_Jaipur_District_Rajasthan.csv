"This is a must visit if you are in Jaipur. This is an excellently built palace / fort a few hundred years ago. You can enjoy and wonder about each and every bit of the fort. Having a guide with you is advisable to get a most out of the place. They hardly charge you 150 to 200 rupees. Its definitely worth it. It located on a very small hill. So a jeap or elephant ride is provided to reach the entrance of the fort if you are not on a personal vehicle. Please do not take the elephant ride. Please!! Please !! The animals seem to be so badly treated. I pity the animals.If possible, plan a visit in the evening and try attending the sound and light show in the late evening. I missed it. But heard its very nice!Overall, don't think skipping the place if you are in Jaipur."
"You cant come to Jaipur and not visit  Amber..the ancient capital. Fabulously scenic,great Rajput architecture,a once in a lifetime experience. Photographs dont do justice, so just go there. Walk up ,drive or on elephant back it's an experience like no other.  See the Son at…"
Loved this place. Really  worthwhile  the visit. Walls whisper  ancient  stories  of mughal  history.  Do not miss this fort.
"We had a guide (Raj) who explained so much about this impressive Fort. Don't miss this place but be aware that if you are offered the option to see a textile block printing demo, you will be 'encouraged' to buy something."
"Very nice place to explore. It is a very massive fort, full of history and fascinating. Unfortunately, inside there is not so much to see if you want to admire some artistic treasures. The architecture itself worth a visit and from the fort you can see also some very nice views of the landscapes nearby. Take your time for lost yourself inside the tight and long corridors or to enjoy a pause in one of the several balconies."
Wow don’t miss this! Beats the Great Wall of china!Your mind will remember this amazing place: no need for photos!Take water comfortable shoes there are steps to climb to get in!Cost is about 500 rupees
Really impressive place to visit. The colour of the buildings is amazing.  So many places to photograph.  Arrive by elephant to add another element to this visit!
"The most beautiful fort of Jaipur, approx 20 km from the city. Crowded place, you may not found the art work like Red Fort of Delhi and Agra here. Must visit Kali Mata temple at Fort."
Lovely fort but not maintained well. Remember my early days when the Amer Fort was so grand and magnificent. But now just did not get the feel of my old remembrances. A bit down after going there after almost 30 years
Loved visiting this historical site. A lovely walk up the hill to enjoy the building and view. 500 rupees entrance fee for foreign tourists. A lovely garden area to sit and contemplate at bottom.
Great views and guides. Located in a narrow path but the fort was amazing. Also had dinner at the hotel there and everything was perfect.
Best place in Jaipur to visit. Look up Ashok Sharma as your tour guide he is the best! Excellent place for shopping and dinning.
"This post is about a beautiful Fort located near Jaipur called ''AMBER FORT''.Fort is an amazing example of royal RAJPUT ARCHITECTURE.View of the amber fort is stunning.I am sharing my experience from the last visit to this fort in 2019.I drove the fort in the morning, the first view of the fort was stunning.One can take Elephant-ride, Jeep-ride, go on foot to explore the Fort.I decided to go on foot.The fort itself contains- A lot of walking, Raja Man Singh Palace,Maotha lake,A park/courtyard, a great wall of boundaries, restaurants, Shila Mata Mandir, Hammam (Turkish Baths), Sheesh Mahal, Ruin of Palace, A Secret TunnelThis secret tunnel inside this Fort connects JAIGARH FORT.

Really great place to visit and get a feel of how the maharajas lived 400 years ago. It's truly epic. Recommend to take a tourguide. Our guide spoke very good English and was able to show us the place in an entertaining way. Go there during morning (latest by 11am) to see the…
Been to Jaipur 10 to 12 time in the last 7 years but never been to any historical places. Visited the fort and took the services of a local guide.  Was worth a visit n the guide took us around the fort n explained the history of the fort . Was worth it. A must visit place for…
Stunning piece of architecture.  Take the guided elephant ride to the top.  We had an excellent guide through Explore India.
"I visited the fort recently and was fascinated by its beauty and architecture. In 2013, Amer Fort, along with five other forts of Rajasthan, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Located high on a hill, it is the principal tourist attraction in Jaipur. Constructed of red…"
"This is an amazing place to visit until you see the animal Abuse with the elephants. They are forced 14 times a day to walk tourists up a long hill in the heat, look in their eyes and you see the sadness.  Visit the fort. DO NOT ride the elephants  If you think this is not…"
One of our very favorites from the many historic sites we visited on our tour of India. Enjoyed the drive to and surrounding areas to reach the Amber Fort. The surrounding views from the fortress are almost as special as the fort itself. So much to explore inside (watching the…
"Great visit. Brilliant architecture, beautiful gardens and marvellous views over the city and lake. Loved the elephants. "
Visited as part of our trip. It's an incredible fort and experience with much to see. Local guide provided rich history and detail.  One plea. Please dont ride the majestic female elephants up.  As they turned for the trip down it was terrible to hear their distress and see them being beaten and mistreated by the drivers.  Much better to get a jeep up or even walk! .
The amber fort is a beautiful fort and palace built atop a hill.  The elephant ride up the hill to the entrance costs a fixed 1100 rupees ($15 USD). Beware aggressive hawkers/vendors and ignore them at all costs.
Was amazed to see the palace in good state and its grandeur still present.  The drive was halfway to fort was in car then we had to climb little bit on foot.  I was astonished with the beauty of the fort and the collections too.  It was magnificent and a great experience to see…
"Very interesting visit however, saddened by the elephant rides. I am not sure why people still find enjoyment in riding painted and abused animals up a hill but this was big here. I witnessed one of the workers beat an elephant hard with a stick for moving while they were resting. Think about what you’re doing and paying for when you give into this type of tourism. The animals are treated poorly and this is not what they should be doing. We should not be riding, painting one of the most intelligent animals in the world."
This place is a must visit when in Jaipur. Highly recommended. Interesting history. Book your tour with Welcome Rajasthan Tours and Travels for a  hassle free vacation. :)
"Was wonderful experience, esp the elephant ride up the fort. Make it a point to reach there by morning 7.30. There are more than 100 elephants, so doesn’t take much time to clear the que. The elephant ride ends by 12 noon.  Take a guide for sure. Excellent architecture &…"
"India has lots of forts but they're all different.  We visited this one as part of a tour group and had a tour guide which is the best way to see these sorts of places as they can help bring them alive with stories and history.  This was no exception.I guess the feature that sets this fort apart is the beautiful mirror palace area.  Exquisite.  Check it out via Google.  It will whet your appetite.Yes, another fort but well worth a visit."
"We visited Amer Fort for its artistic style elements. Entering the fort is by riding an elephant.  The Fort is located on a hill. My Rider Mohammed was so happy and pleasant. His elephant, Monica did a great job. Amer Fort is a magnificent site with beautiful Mirror palace inside. SEE photos."
This place is stunning.  The place is huge and goes on for miles.  You could spend forever here if wanted.  Walk up is a good hike so wear good shoes.  The architecture is insane. There is so much going on inside this Fort. The views go on for miles so take lots of photos.  Glad we came and saw this amazing Fort.
"In Jaipur, this is the place you have to visit must. Many buses go from outside of Railway station to here in Rs.30. Entry is free. One area called Sheesh Mehal you have to buy ticket of Rs.100 to go in this area, it's worth. The wall of this Hall is carved with pure glass and mirrors. Here you can see 'Din me tare' with flash light point on ceiling. Parking facility is available."
Go with a guide or be sure to get the history of this place. The stone carvings and decorations are amazing.
"The Amber Fort was definitely worth visiting. The views of the surrounding areas are spectacular. The fort is very interesting with lots of fascinating architectural features. The elephant ride up the hill was fun although I would not recommend it to anyone afraid of heights.Like at many tourist destinations, tourist dollars are a major source of income for the locals and hawking/begging can be relentless. Just be prepared and don’t get intimidated. Despite signs saying not to tip the elephant drivers, my driver badgered me continuously. I had planned to give him what I felt was a fair tip, which I did, and ignored his requests for more. Just say “no” to things you don’t want and say it forcefully. Feel free to continue walking and don’t feel that you have to engage the vendor. If you want to shop have a small amount that you can conveniently reach; don’t flash large sums of money. This is all part of the travel experience, learn to work with it."
"Very good visit. Guide worthwhile. Chose to walk to Fort rather than take elephant ride, but the elephants are a sight themselves. The Fort has plenty to see if you know what you are looking at and easily fills 2 hours."
"This is the prime tourist location of Jaipur. It is said that once you visit Amer fort, 50% Off your Jaipur sight seeing is done. The main attractions inside Amer fort are the courtyard, Diwan-e-aam, Diwan-e-khas,Sheesh Mahal, elaborate and intricately designed garden, Queens quarters.Sheesh Mahal(Hall of Mirrors) is an intricate piece of work If you flash a light on the ceiling of the Sheesh Mahal, you get the feeling of looking at many twinkling stars. In Sheesh Mahal, there are small mirrors where you can take a photo from the rear camera of your phone but the effect will be as if it a selfie photo.Besides there are a lot of areas to see inside the fort. Having a guide ensures that you don't miss on the must see areas of the fort. I would definitely recommend hiring a guide."
Get there early. Gets quite crowded w tourists. There are 100s of rooms in seemingly endless maze of rooms. One of the must see sites in Jaipur. Don't forget to visit the Stepwell just in back of the fort.
