"I have always been interested in scuba diving, and it was successful this time through Andaman Bubbles. This was my first experience and it was wonderful. They prepare you well and I was especially happy for them making my mother comfortable for her first Scuba. A must try. Though the visibility depends on the weather yet the experience is awe inspiring. Thank you Andaman Bubbles, and a special thanks to Varghese, Tapu and Rizvan."
Was a fantastic experience with all that gear and seeing all the corals and your gear is attached with camera to click pics. All those fishes and turtles was the best experience here.
"Andaman bubbles is a great diving club, with wonderful team of instructors and pleasant environment. After I did the try dive I decided to do the SSI open water course with the amazing instructor Mario! I was struggling at the beginning of the course and wanted to quit, but Mario didn't give up on me and insist that I will continue. He make me believe that I can do it and I really could, and had a wonderful time under water. when I finish the course I was so glad for not giving up. Mario is very professional, very patient, explain everything clearly and always happy to help with everything you need. Go to Andaman bubbles and ask for Mario as your instructor!! The best in Andaman"
"Dreamed of scuba diving for a long time.. andaman bubbles made the dream come true. Went in december 2016. Tappu, chloe and Mr.T.. u guys r awesome. I was literally swimming with the fish. Finding nemo (and his family) was amazing. So many colorful fishes. Loved the dive. Highly recommended. My Contact was Ms.shaurya on the andaman bubbles website. Thanks a lot shaurya. U guys rock. Period!"
"Andaman Bubbles rock! I have done my open water crtification with them this year in February '12 - the team hear is absolutely praise worthy. Their professional yet warm and friendly approach to guest will make u feel comfortable on the island. As a first time diver I had a lot of queries & presumptions before I could take on to diving..n Nikhil himself as well as the instructors and the dive masters were patient & happy enough to entertain me n answer all my queries right from day 1. AB is very transparent about their processes & rules. They are well equipped & sufficiently stuffed with d latest of diving equipments. Safety & comfort of guests is priority at AB and at the same time they are flexible enough to accomodate your wishes too -  Which eventually makes the dives absolute fun! N to support the entire show, AB has got a lovely set of Instructors, Dive Masters & Staffs :)) Very friendly and ready to help at any given point in time :) I loved my frst dive vacation! Thanx to team AB! Cheerios!!P.S: One thing what I personally feel, that makes the instructors, dive masters n ofcourse Nikhil stand out from the rest of the Dive Centers on the island  - is their love for diving and love for the island. Running a 5 Star Dive Center so successfully is one side of the story but the way these guys strive to maintain this island is really commendable :) Wish u all d success guys!!"
"I was amazed to see life underneath and it's addictive. All the dives are well managed with the trained staff and executed smoothly. I had wonderful experience. Thank you Tappu, Ayushman and Sanjana ....... for the awesome life time experiences.........."
"Scuba diving is a must @ Havelock and I'm happy that I chose Andaman Bubbles for my dive. Very warm & friendly crew. Got to see a host of corals and many exotic fishes, and not to mention the famous clown (Nemo) fish. Spend at least 30-35 minutes underwater."
Recently completed the SSI Open water and Advanced adventurer scuba courses from bubbles.All the people i interacted there Shaurya; Mario; Gary; Gaurav; Thiagu ;Sanjana;Suki were really cool people. Dealing with them was more like interacting with freinds. Shaurya was very helpful in resolving all our queries .We were lucky to have Mario as our instructor for both the courses. He had this zen like calm approach but also a perfectionist. With utmost patience made us repeat the drills till we reached some basic competency level.If ever get a chance for further courses will choose Mario and Bubbles for sure.
"Had a good 'first dive' with Andaman bubbles. The place is very relaxed with a very friendly atmosphere. The instructors are fun, welcoming and at the same time very good with what they do. Subhash and Malhar are wonderful! looking forward to visiting again.."
"Went there to take my open water SSi and, course, stayed for Advanced. How is it possible not to stay.. This increadible friendly shiny atmosphere. Thank you, Riz, for your work. Thank you guys, friends, Suki, Thiyagu, Mario for being smiling all the time.Now how to love without diving?"
"This was the first time i was trying out a dive. The staff at Andaman Bubbles were incredible, helpful, highly skilled and very well trained. They gave me the basics i needed to function underwater. After which i was taken under by one of the shops dive masters. The dive sites were amazing and i had the fortune of spotting a lot of marine life. Very exciting stuff. I can comfortably say that i will be returning very very soon to do my open water course and would not even consider another dive shop. I would strongly reccomend that anyone planning on visiting the andamans goes for atleast one dive with andaman bubbles. Look forward to seeing u guys real soon. Special shout out to Zan, Tyagi and Hardik (all divers with andaman bubbles). Cheers."
"I have traveled to the Andaman for scuba diving for a couple of years but this time for Free Diving. My instructor Mario Fernandes AKA SUPER MARIO was an expert in his training,approach and  very instructionally sound. He systematically identifies problematic aspects I was having and then structured a series of dives to address these areas. Giving feedback on performance after each dive. Safety was never compromised. Felt relaxed throughout the whole session. There was also a good training closure with tips on drills I could work on to improve my technique. Mario himself comes across as a friendly and approachable person who is generous with his advice and time. Really appreciate his hard  work during the session. Looking forward to the next level.""YOU MUST GIVE FREE DIVING A TRY ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE SUPER MARIO TRAINING YOU"""
"I dived with Andaman Bubbles a few weeks ago when I was on Havelock and had a great time.  There was a varied group on the boat including certified divers like myself, people doing an Open Water course and Advanced Open Water Course.  For certified divers there was one dive guide for every 2 divers and I felt very well looked after.  All the equipment is assembled for you and you're helped into and out of the water, I felt thoroughly spoilt!  Drinking water and snacks were provided and I loved the vegetable samosas!  The next time I visit Havelock I will dive with these guys again."
"we were diving with our 3 sons and they made perfect arrangements for us. Let them play under water, but also tought them things!"
"Really great place to learn to dive. Very friendly staff, who are so passionate about what you see down there and making the experience special. It's also a great place to meet lots of cool people, and we met some really nice Israeli travelers who like the cafe/bar there. Missing the Andamans a lot!"
"Its always been a pleasure diving @Andaman bubbles. Their greatest USP is the Quality of divers who show immense level of professionalism and builds confidence within visitors taking up the sport for the first time.Personally i have been diving with them for over 3 years and have successfully completed several  dives. Thank you Rizwan, Zhan, Subhash .. Its was a pleasure diving with you..Vishal Saigal"
"I did my open water dive course with Andaman Bubbles, the experience right from the reservation through email till the end was really great. My instructors were helpful and did their bit to help whenever required. Made 6 dives at different locations. Overall a great experience and value or money."
Are you in Andaman Islands and want to experience Scuba Diving? Get in touch with Andaman Bubbles and have the time of your life. The scuba experience offered by them is just amazing.
Saying I was apprehensive going 9mts under water in the middle of ocean will be an understatement. I was terrified but Andaman bubbles made my first diving experience a fantastic experience. So much so I can't wait to go scuba diving again. Gaurav our instructor was very friendly and understanding. We took our time learning tips in shallow water and when it was time for the real thing he was constantly by our side making us feel comfortable. Andaman bubbles having padi certified instructors gave us confidence. Their are other places which may offer cheaper services but your life depends on your instructor so you don't want to take any chances. Corals were actually bleached but that's something which has happened through out Andaman still Scuba diving is an awesome experience. Each one has to do it at least once in lifetime.
"We had a great time doing our advanced open water course with Andaman bubbles. All along the course we felt safe and secure. The whole staff were super nice. Our instructur, Mario, was very professional and always with good energy and a smile. Answering our questions with patiant.We really recommend Andaman bubbles for a great diving experience"
"It was wonderful. All the crew members of the scuba diving are very friendly and helpful, which made our first diving experience smooth. Although I panicked twice while diving, however, the diver who was with me, didnt lost his patience, which gave me enough energy to dive for third time and then I was able to do it smoothly. They also took underwater photographs of us. It was awesome. Keep it up guys, hope to see you again."
"This is my second trip to Havelock Island & I have good memories of this remote, beautiful Island, thanks to Andaman Bubbles & Wild Orchid. Did a DSD with Andaman Bubbles and staff are of great patience to take you through the safety procedures in detail. Within minutes you feel you're no stranger to diving world. The Wild Orchid cottages are simply amazing so are the both restaurants which serves simply the best Indian cuisine. I will definitely back to this Island very soon to dive with Andaman Bubbles:)"
"We went to Havelock with the sole intent of getting a certification in Scuba diving and Andaman bubbles didn't disappoint us in the least. Our SSI Open water instructor Abhijeet deserves a special mention. He was calm, extremely patient, friendly, serious at times and fun to dive with.I would recommend them anytime to anyone - be it beginners with little to no swimming experience to pros who want to tune up their skills.Thank you Abhi! Thank you bubbles.Thanks for the free Tee."
"I dived with Andaman Bubbles and was impressed by the genuine hospitality and kindness of the staff at both the dive centre and adjacent resort.As the Andaman islands and Havelock are remote, it means fantastic unspoilt diving!  The reefs at Jackson's, Dixon's and Johnny's are exceptional and, having been lucky enough to dive other 'far away' reefs, I have got to rate these amongst the best few dive sites in the world; these sites are for advanced divers but there are alternative (easier) sites available the less experienced. The boat was great, all our kit was fully rigged, of high quality, and the staff even changed the tanks between dives (but only if we wanted them to).  The 'tween dive snacks of Samosas supplied were great and helped with my ballast.  Guiding was first class and the days seemed to fly by.My biggest regret was only having 3 days available to dive!! However, all 3 days were well worth it.Big thanks to the team who looked after me throughout to enable me to enjoy all the fantastic diving."
"Andauern bubbles is a small, but really nice diving center on Havelock. Staff is really friendly, the equipment in good conditions. The center has a cozy cafe attached to it wish great relaxed atmosphere.  My diving course was led by Shaurya, a great dive master, with much experience, patience and good knowledge about the local sea life. She had a great eye for the individual needs to make this advanced open water course an awesome individual experience. Thank you so much!"
"We were a 12 member group that had gone for scuba diving with andaman bubbles. First off, the dive shop is probably one of the cutest ones iv seen by far with a small cozy low-seating cafe connected to it. The minute u enter, it gives u a very comfortable and inviting vibe! Coming to the dive crew, they are all AMAZING! Rizwan, Xavier, Subhash, Abhi and every single other instructor there are very helpful and super friendly! Even if we weren't diving, we could go over and hangout with them and be completely at ease. When diving, they were extremely professional, safety conscious and caring. The prices are very cost effective, infact Bubbles is one of the most cheapest places I have dived at.Overall, I had a great experience with Andaman Bubbles! Thanks to all the instructors for making our experience so much fun and most of all kudos to you'll for handling out group of 12! We know its not very easy :P"
"It was my first under water experience so I cannot compare the services I got. But it was a lifetime experience, the instructor was very friendly and helped greatly to complete the scuba dive comfortably. Recommended for everyone."
"Hats off to Andaman Bubbles....one of the best dive shops in all Andaman. I dived with them for a week and I have to say, they were absolutely amazing. Rizwan, Xavier, Zan, Thyagi, and the rest of the dive staff and dive masters were just amazing.They made my trip to the Andamans absolutely worthwhile. They have a couple of awesome boats to take you out diving. Be it the speed of the  Ive not met a dive shop yet where each of them went out of their way to make sure our every need was met. At a moments notice they arranged for 3 dives a day for a group of 9 people, which is no small task.Truly amazing knowledge of dive sites and their experience enhanced my entire dive experience.Look forward to going back at the first opportunity i get!"
Great prices and incredible instructors! I had such a wonderful experience getting my open water SSI certificate with them. I highly recommend Andaman Bubbles to expert and beginner divers. They are an intelligent team who will teach you all you need to know and take you to the best spots on the islands. Suki is an amazing instructor who worked with me one-on-one for no additional cost to make sure I got my certification on a tight deadline. They will work with you and make sure you also have an amazing experience! Thank you Andaman Bubbles!!
"Since it was my first time for a scuba, I had an awesome scuba experience. For a first timer in scuba, it is difficult to catch up with the rules under water one has to follow, but the instructors are at your side. So do not worry. Just Go.!!! They take care of you in all possible ways. They show you the wonderful underwater marine life. Breath taking.!!! All instructors at Andaman Bubbles are too good, Mario, Rommel, Appu, Mani you guys are awesome. Thank you guys."
Both dive sites had coral bleaching and did not have much to see. Dive shop and staff are nice.  However when I went the dive master kept us so closely grouped together I kept hitting people behind me. So much so it effected me seeing things cause I was so focused on not hitting people with my fins.
"Me and my wife did a trydive and loved it so much we then booked our padi openwater course. Hari was great, kind and professional. was 4 day course and was a great challenge and extremely rewarding. big thanks to all the andaman bubbles crew."
"Having almost drowned once, years back, I always wanted to get over my fear of water and I don't think anything and anywhere else would have been a better option than this.I had been in touch with these guys since couple of weeks before we actually landed there and the communication has been very very good from them. Be it over email, whatsapp or phone. Being a guest at The Wild Orchid resort, we were even given special rates!! Talk about icing on the cake!!The guys, Rizwan, Subhash,Taapu and all others, all of them know their job and responsibilities very well. Both of us, being non-swimmers, were taken to the Nemo's reef near the jetty as that was the only option for us. The training before the actual dive was short but to the point. Were clearly told about the Dos and Don'ts!!My dive instructor was very very responsible and assured me again and again that, he was right behind me and all I need to do is, just enjoy!! And he was true to his words.I was able to go upto 9mts. I would not say the water was spectacular but it was amazingly beautiful nonetheless!!Every 30 seconds or so, the diver who was with you would ask you if everything was ok and would always remind you to equalize your ears. That was very re-assuring.After this wonderful dive, me and my wife have decided to do it again, very soon. Keep going guys, you guys are doing great!!"
"We did scuba there. Me and my wife enjoyed a lot. We did fun drive of scuba. Duration was 4 hours including a theory class at fat martin,Dress change at a adjacent point, they provided head to toe accessories for scuba, journey to the beach point by jeep, familiarisation and basic  trails at shallow water and then main scuba then return to the original point for dress change etc.Trainer accompanied us the whole time under water. They gave us the time needed for familarisation with repeated trails till you are tension free and ready for the fun. You dont need to know swimming for it. And yes ! Saw a colorful and vibrant world down there!!"
"Guys! You in Havelock Island and wanna Scuba Dive!! Go with ""Andaman Bubbles"".. They are so professional and your scuba experience would be Amazing.."
