Muzhappilangad Drive-in Beach is the only driving beach in kerala and the longest one also . driving here is a real experience to have
"Muzhapillangad beach is one of the cleanest beaches I have been to in India, less crowded, almost a stretch of 5km beach where you can drive with waves hitting your car all through. Very scenic place, enjoyed taking pics. Stayed at a place called Samudra Homes, sea view from this home stay was amazing. But it wont be wise to spend more than a night here at Muzhapillangad, as there is no other place to visit apart from St Angelos Fort (at 10kms). Overall a nice experience for a one day trip."
This place can be reached by travelling about 15km from Kannur in Kerala. This beach is hardly 1.5km from the National Highway. The speciality is one can drive through the beach. Being monsoon the beach was shortened. So there was not much vehicles. So a few fishermen fishing with nets. The catch of the day was crabs. I asked whether it was planned or... They replied that the plan was for fish. But it's worth a fine catch because crabs are sold at about Rs.200/kg.
Loved driving car on Muzhappilangad drive in beach.Its pretty safe and a must visit beach while in kannur. Make sure you get a nice pressure wash for your car after the drive.
"Lying close to Kannur railway station and Calicut airport, Muzhappilangad Beach is famous for being Kerala's only drive in beach as 4 km of sand and a shimmering Malabar coastline can be viewed from the road.  The waters are protected from deep currents by the black rocks that protect the beach so this place is considered a swimmers paradise as well."
The only drive-in beach in Kerala. It really worth visiting the place. Driving through the beach with sunset is awesome
"Unique experience of drive-in. On the way from Thalassery to Kannur, you can enter the beach with an entry ticket for your vehicle. Go in the evening, though it will be crowded, to enjoy the sunset."
Long clean drive-inn beach and one of its kind in Kerala. Drive during evening time is excellent experience. Long clean beach with scope to spend some quality time.Nearby small tea shop (thattukada) availableOverall it is worth  to visit
"The wow experience...!!!, scenic beach which is the only drive in beach in Kerala (i guess). was quiet and calm area."
This beach is one of the best sights of Kerala which is actually gods own country. Do not miss this place.
"when you are on kannur, you have to visit this one. approx 5 kms long strech right on beach, you can drive into water & splash it around.Not many beaches offers you such experience. Sand is thick enough to carry weight of car & gives you immense experience. be careful not to go too much inside & wash your car later .sure worth visit."
May be most under rated tourist attraction in North Kerala. Most exhilarating experience. Sparking sea to one side and greenery to one side. Unique experience driving through sandy beach.
"A nice peaceful beach near thalassery. Probably the only drive-in beach in South. Suggest not to take your vehicle into water, the salt content in sea water may harm your vehicle parts. Get a good wash for your vehicle immediately after you leave this place."
"What a beautiful beach it is !!! Had an awesome experience there, as it is the only beach in India  where we can drive. That particular feeling is the highlight of the whole experience. The sea shore has many seashells as well, which is also an attraction. Not very much recommended for bathing over there in this beach, however driving is must. Get a bike there n enjoy the beauty."
This is the best beach in India for family with young kids. It's a flat beach n kids will HV fun . Don't forget to eat ice cream on beach
"It is supposedly India's longest drive-in beach and sure it lives up to its reputation. Driving on the beach is pleasurable and while one needs to be careful of folks on the beach it is totally a very different experience. Overall the place was clean and though not many options for snack, etc. it does have a few mobile carts for ice-creams etc.The waves are very gentle and totally safe even for small kids and is a nice place to just laze around in the sea. Evenings are wonderful though am sure it would be equally amazing during the day time"
"Nice & clean beach, which is one of the longest beach in India. Maintained well with good control of crowd & cleanliness at the best."
"I would rate this beach next to Kovalam on playing in water. very safe to play during my visit on 13th August. Driving through beach is good, but will complete in few minutes. But playing in sea water is real enjoyment and we did that on the beach for more than 3 hrs."
His looks to be only clean beach in Kannur. Drivable beach for around 4KM. Be careful not to go in to drive on wave just wait and let it come otherwise your vehicle might stuck in sand. A different experience
This is the only drive in beach in Asia so it is must visit place. Make sure that when you travel to this there should be no cyclone because they won’t allow youbto drive car at that time. Nice place for taking pics and different feeling in driving car on sea shore
"Its a  must visit. I was on a bike trip to Bangalore, i saw a board Muzhappilnagad beach 1KM. Just took a detour and experienced a lifetime feel. Avoid during monsoon, best timing during the day is mornings or evenings where you will have  a wonderful backdrop sky. Its just 10 rs for two wheelers and 40 for cars. There are 4 entry points to this beach and you can drive for around 4.5 kms. Dont get into the water, I did the mistake while taking photo and bike got stuck. People who like travel go for it, you can have excellent food near by Thalasserry resturants as well. There are small tea shops run by ladies, park your vehicle and dont forget to have chai from there."
"The only driving beach in south India, wide area for a titillating drive amongst the waves. The sand is super thick and it does not soften except close to the sea. Remember to wash the car/motorbike to avoid salt water corrosion. The stretch is close to 5 Kms and tends to get crowded during weekends."
"This is the only one Drive beach in India. But  please do not do stunts because local people were witnes for so many stunt activities and accident so now they will not allow you they will warn you.  It is great experience drive in beaches and is great. please service your vehicle after done it, if you dont want ruin your vehicle"
"Great ""drive-in"" beach perhaps the only one in India and the longest in Asia.  Be careful where you park your car.  As long as you are driving it's all right but when you park near to the water every time the waves pass under, your vehicle gets swamped into the sand beneath and then your car is stuck and can't pull out of water.  There are a group of locals who are waiting exactly for this to happen.  They come over and then tell you the only solution is to call a crane and pull it out.  Then you are scared further by quoting how exorbitant the cost of crane is (10000/-) and how it might take several hours for it to come.  Since it would be getting dark and there is the probability of high tide coming which could wash away your car, you would 99% succumb to the pressure and agree to the extortion by these locals who would easily pull out the vehicle and take away a hefty amount from you. So what should you do ?1) Avoid parking near water, after driving through, always park at dry place towards land.  2) If stuck gather a few people (5-6) who can just lift the rear of the car and you can easily put it out.  3)  Look around there would be few others like you stuck with their cars, pool in them and help each other to lift up the rear side.Note : 4x4 won't have this problem.Note2:  Remember drive in on sea water could rust your wheel and underside of your car.  So after having the drive-in fun do at least a basic water wash same day and get a pressure wash done at least the next day.  Hope this helps.  Follow these few things and enjoy your drivein as it still is a great experience.  The beach is very neat."
"You can drive up to 3KM on sand and just next to tides. You can have great photos with your family, car and sunset at beach.You can get great snaps on golden sands. But- There is no discipline. You may feel like you are on F1 track when you try to walk on the shore. You may have to brake hard when you drive on shores to avoid reckless drivers, people who pop up suddenly in front of your vehicle, etc. There is no proper guidance, no proper police monitoring. Though beach/life guards try their best, they are very much limited in numbers to cover all 3KM- so be careful while you play in sea.I would say find a place where less number of cars are plying. Park your car, enjoy the beach, be very cautious about reckless drunken drivers. Be very watchful on your kids."
"It’s the only drivable beach in India , so I am told!! Drove my bike during sunset time and had lots of fun."
This is the longest drive-in beach of Asia ( as told by local residence and we spent an evening there enjoying thoroughly with my family and friend's family. REcommend to go for anybody who visit Kannur.
Wow experience to drive on a beach!!! It is approx 4km long. You can enjoy every moment there. Did a car wash immediately after the drive
We had a nice time here driving at beach. There are very less beaches in india where things are not commercialized yet. This beach is one of them. My kids also enjoyed the quality time here. You can drive along the beach having icecream. Look wise this place is awesome. A must visit if you are at Kannur.
Variety experience. Only drive in beach of Kerala. Vehicle rent facility is not available. Need your own vehicle.
Driving in the beach is an exhilarating experience . Best time to visit is in the evening as u can have a perfect sun setting in the Arabian Sea
"Bored of roads... Now time to drive on waterMost beautiful driving beach in Kerala, don't stop your vehicles in water more than 2 min, after 2nd min you will not able to drive your vehicle without other's help!!!"
"It's a good Drive-in Beach and can​ be enjoyable for friends, family in all age groups. Having such a great natural resources it has not been promoted or have a great facilities. It can be developed to international standards but still a great Beach for drive-in, which is top of the world feeling.."
"Awesome experience to drive in a beach. The beach long ~ 3Km. Relaxing beach, visit early in the morning for a relaxed time. Evening get crowded."
The only beach to take your car/two wheeler right across the beach area for a titillating drive amongst the waves. The sand is super thick and it does not soften except close to the sea. Remember to wash the car/motorbike to avoid salt water corrosion. The beach is close to 4kms and tends to get crowded during weekends.
