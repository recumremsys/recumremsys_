"You have to pass a checkpoint and buy a ticket. They might also check documents. After the checkpoint you have beautiful nature on both sites of the narrow road (drive carefully). It's worth to explore the Curonian Spit for at least one full day. If the weather is good, stay longer! Take a spray against ticks and mosquitos!"
you go for 60 kms and you hope soon to be in place where you will remain breatheless. sorry but this did not happen to me. nice long forest like the ones you find everywhere in the north. does not deserve a deviation for a visit.
"Any time if the year you may go there and come back with tens of photos, beautiful amber, smoked fish and - the most important- recharged batteries. That what nature does with our souls. Welcome to my world üåé!!!"
"Stayed at Ecolodge Zen in the village of Morskoye.Right off the lodge you can climb the facing hill and emerge in WWII history with Nazi Germany authentic bunker and coastal artillery, and see two seas simultaneously! Stroll through the magic woods and exit on the dune of Efa, the highest in Europe, with magnificent views.From there, cross the main road to cafe Vinland for breakfast, and then head south to the mysterious Dancing Forest, an utterly reinvigorating walk, then continue on to Rybachi village for a hearty fish meal at the famous Rybni Dvor.Life is complete))"
I had a day's tour here and found it very interesting. We started at the bird ringing  centre and then moved on to the dunes and then the Dancing Forest. Being part of a group made the travel easy but I can imagine that if you were alone language could be a problem. There were quite a few Russian tourists also there at the time. If you enjoy the outdoors then this is the place to visit.
"Took a trip along the spit as way of familiarising myeslf with the region. The journey was interesting, passing many small settlements before arriving at Pillau. I drove to a car park on the coast and walked along the coast watching the very busy shipping canal into the Baltic which is the reason Kaliningrad was retained by Russia after the war. You can see the ferry go across the break in the spit which is a journey for another day. There could have been a hundred people fishing off the pier and the beach was also busy with beach-combers looking for Amber. A thouroughly beuatiful spot and well worth a visit."
"Long long way but very very nice view from the viewpoints! Don't be lazy ) u ll have a lot of nice pictures there) But be careful and don't step out from the wooden road,dangerous."
"I visited the spit as part of an organised tour on a coach, and really enjoyed it. Not because we saw something 'amazing' or 'special' but because we were outside in a beautiful natural habitat, surrounded by fresh air, pine trees and sandy beaches.It is a great place to wander around and just take in some scenery, and breathe some fresh air! Be aware of the weather though, as if it starts to rain it may get muddy. I'd recommend wearing long sleeve shirt or raincoat, and trousers with closed shoes in order to avoid picking up any forest insects (ticks) if you are going for a stroll into the 'dancing forest'. A beautiful place, but it is quite a long drive from Kaliningrad so be aware of this before setting off."
"The Curonian Spit is a beautiful place to walk around, see the dunes, the sand, the sea!Untouched corner. Be sure to take a trip there.There is a chance that you can see the animals."
"The Curonian Spit gave us a chance to walk through the desert, bicycle through the forest and swim at the beach...all on one day!  Liking to eat fish might be a prerequisite, but life on the Curonian Spit must be pretty good!  Lithuanians appreciate the importance of a good cup of coffee more than other places:  our morning was rescued by a Lavazza barrista with her Smartcar kitted out with an espresso machine, and in the afternoon we enjoyed a perfect espresso served up from a bicycle-mounted Lavazza machine!  Life is good!"
"Like a previous contributor, I walked from Zelenogradsk but you don't have to. Bus number 596 (Svetlogorsk to Mopckoe) runs from the main bus and train station. Its 20 roubles flat but I don't know the frequency of the service. You can walk along the beach, then cut inland and walk along the road, or better still use the well marked paths in the woods at the edge of the lagoon. Be prepared for mosquitoes though! The road itself is narrow but traffic is infrequent so its not totally unfeasible to walk it. Its just boring. You will arrive at a ticket office where you must pay 150 roubles to enter the park, much like Grand Canyon, Joshua Tree etc. The most striking thing here is the sense of splendid isolation. I did not meet a soul in 10 miles walking through the woods at the edge of the lagoon. The bird life is amazing with numerous strange calls and song and there is a viewing platform where I wished I'd had binoculars. The platform is quite rickety though, as are the boardwalks (pictured) so I advise extreme caution using them as any foot or leg injuries here could have dire consequences for the solo traveller."
"Visiting this part of the oblast was my reason for renting a car. Nature in all her glory. Dunes, beach, forest. Rain and wind during my visit."
Looks like the dutch islands but than with an baltic feel with very beautiful views and beaches. But needs some developments for tourists.
"We traveled from Klaipeda, Lithuania to Kaliningrad via the spit and visited a number of sites along the way. Very beautiful. Be sure to stop in at the bird migration center."
We see it from nida and kaliningard. Feels just like seeing niagara falls from canada and usa. Former is more touristic while the latter is a true and protected national park. We hired a private guide who is so experienced and full of information. It made the tour very interesting and memorable.
"The best beaches in region, variety of nature, dunes, some nice restaurants and hotels. Advise to go there only by car"
"We travelled the entire lenght of the spit coming down from Lithuania. Spent the night in the small village of Morskoye, and got to feel the village life. Cool landscapes here, with sanddunes, beaches, forest and a weird wonderful little area called Laughing forest (with twisted Trees). They probably sell up the spit more than it deserves, it's not _that_ special nature-wise as they sell it to be, but just being in Kaliningrad is cool! Recommended to stay a night in one of the small villages, like Morskoye, and roam the beaches and dunes during sunrise or sunset."
"Reading the review of those unimpressed I have to say the road along the spit itself reminds you of any other normal wood, however it's what behind those trees that's so interesting. What's important is to take a guide with you who would tell you everything about the spit, from the way it was formed through its forestation and show you the most interesting spots.I loved the stay at Curonian Spit, the walks were amazing, with wonderful humid air smelling of pines and breathtaking views of the sand dunes against the backdrop of a forest. Very unusual. And the Dancing Forest topped it all, with its eerie atmosphere that makes you feel quite apprehensive. You have to see and feel it for yourself, it's quite an experience. Please, go eith a guide, you'll enjoy it much more!"
"We booked our trip through the tourist agency inside Hotel Kaliningrad.  Lucky us came a few minutes before 11 in the morning, and bus left 11.The guide spoke only in Russian.  She never ran empty of information and spoke in the microfon more or less all the way.A couple stops, until we came to Curonian Spit which was breathtaking.  By the Baltic sea we had a soup of borscht in the Vinland-restaurant before going home.The trip cost 1180 rub, and you must plan to spend about six hours.  Bring cloths according to weather."
"I walked about 10 km by the sea from Zelenogradsk to Lesnoje. Windy day, very few people, I enjoyed. Tried to walk also in the forest, but beach was better. The road for cars is too narrow for walking. Public transportation rare."
"This is one of the most beautiful and unique place at Kaliningrad area. It's totally worth to visit. Beautiful dunes, a lot of wild life, dancing forest and clean wide sand beach. For the lunch or dinner I recommend to stop in Kurena cafe. They have very good fresh fish caught every day. Do not skip their doughnut holes with wild forest strawberry jam."
"Compare to Lithuanian part of this half-island, Kurshskaya Kosa looks not so fascinating as it seems to be. There is no opportunity to visit this place without a private car, compare to Kaunas ferries.As it was mentioned, nature is amazing. However, Lithuanian part seems to be clearer also with better equipment."
"Kurshskaya Kosa NP in Russian Kaliningrad region is a part of Curonian Spit thin strip of land dividing Curonian Lagoon from Baltic Sea. The other part of the spit is further north in Lithuania.Easy to get to Morskoe from Kaliningrad's Yuzhny Avtovokzal on bus #593, there are two departures in the morning. Coming back may seem slightly inconvenient, but there are a few more buses running to Zelenogradsk in addition to the Morskoe-Kaliningrad service. I'd do it this way if I was to repeat the experience: Kaliningrad to Tantsuyushchi Les (km 37), visit the Dancing Trees, walk to km 42 and visit the Efa dunes, visit the beach on the other side of the road, then bus from Efa Heights (Visoty Efa) either to Zelenogradsk or Kaliningrad."
