"Located in heart of city , in an old building with excellent architecture. The exhibits are weapons, crockery, currency, paintings, Egyptian Mummy, brass handicrafts, marble carvings .. a unique antique collection .."
"They charge Rs.40 per head for visit. But there is nothing great to see except the mummy. Carpet, weapons, crockeries, uniform etc are found in all the museum. Photography is allowed. Open garden is there outside."
"Family of four, arrived after a long morning of seeing other sites. Being tired, it was difficult to pay 700 rupees (about $9.75USD) each to enter. Then, we found out that it would be an additional 10 Euros (about $11USD) each to go further inside where the King's area was. Pretty expensive for India. Don't go when you're tired, and you'll probably have a great experience."
We landed at the site accidentally - our driver took us to the Coffee Day on the premises as we were craving our morning fix. Did not go inside the museum as it had not been on our agenda but drove by there a couple of time. It looks majestic at night - all lit up! This was a day before Republic day so the building was beautifully swathed in the colours of the Indian flag.
