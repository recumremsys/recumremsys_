Our family truly enjoyed our visit to the USS Midway.  It was very interesting and we especially loved all the veterans and volunteers who helped with the tours and put on talks.   Don't miss this piece of history.
"We thought we would visit this museum for an hour or 2 and stayed for 4.  It was an amazing experience.  We started with the tour that commences at the bridge.  This was a smart thing to do because it gave you a deep understanding of the boat, the planes and her achievements. After that we spent the next 3 hours looking around, speaking to the volunteers who are all ex-service people and then we stumbled onto another highlight - a presentation of how the planes land on the deck.  This also a must see - the tent where this is held is in the centre of the runway deck.  You cant miss it. Finally, finish with the video re; the Battle of Midway.  It is in the cinema on the middle level of the boat.  It is exceptionally moving!!! Must Do: 1. The formal tour.2. Grab and use the audio set3. The presentation on how to land on deck4. Cinema experience  - Battle of Midway."
We purchased our tickets ahead of time & were glad to skip the line. The audio-tour provides great information and insight. Presenters on the flight deck gave additional information. Wear comfortable shoes & be prepared to walk & climb stairs.
We had a great time exploring this beauty. Very very cool experience!! Seems like they hire vets too that either worked on the ship or one like it. Very informative!
"We went on a Saturday and really loved the entire time we were there!  What a great experience to be able to walk around the ship.  The tour gives tremendous insight into how this massive machine operates and lets you see a lot of different places.  If you go, make sure you give yourself enough time so you don't have to rush...look around and try not to miss too much.  The below decks parts were extremely interesting, giving an opportunity to see how the 4,500 sailors lived day-to-day.  Make sure you do both parts, the one near the stairs up to the flight deck and the part in the front of the ship just to the right of the theater.  The flight deck itself is, obviously, massive and gives you a sense of how the aircraft were operated.  And, don't miss the Bridge tour.  It is a little hard to see as it starts around on the outside of the Island/Bridge and there was, for us, a bit of a line and short wait for the approximately 1/2 hour tour.  If you can do the steep stairs, that part is well worth the time.  In case you couldn't tell, we loved it and it was definitely worth the price of admission!"
"Being a museum family and having previously visited the USS Yorktown, we were less than impressed with the Midway Museum. As the daughter of a veteran of the battle of Midway, I was extremely disappointed in the lack of recognition of the battle for which the carried was named.  But my disappointment didn’t stop there. After paying our hefty entrance fee, on-line, in advance, we arrived to find they had run out of headsets for the self-guided tour.  The alternate app they  offered didn’t work as a 50 year old aircraft carrier had no Wifi (go figure).  The visual interpretive materials were virtually non -existent.  Additionally, the flight deck was reminiscent of a road-side military museum, fully of an odd collection of aircraft most of which had no relationship or history related to any mission of this vessel.  If it’s your only chance to experience the ingenuity, powerful and magnitude of the US military, then go. But there are way more meaningful ways and less expensive ways to understand our military’s history of engineering innovation as well as the sacrifices of those who serve in it."
We enjoyed out visit to the USS Midway. It is massive and you get to see a lot of cool areas. Don’t miss checking out the sick bay!
"We were able to attend the USS Midway for a evening event/party. It was awesome to see the planes and some of the quarters. Our event had food, drinks, dancing and a band. Touring around the ship was fun. The views from the ship of the San Diego skyline was beautiful. They had veterans on the ship to talk about the ship and the planes, as well as their service. The only thing I wish they had was more lighting on the deck of the ship to spotlight the planes and ship."
This was so educational and I was amazed at size of the ship inside and out.  Everyone should truly appreciate the volunteers.  Loved it
"My wife, nephew and I spent a great afternoon touring the USS Midway. What a fascinating place! The technology and courage of our military strength makes me so proud to be an American! Everyone should visit the Midway to understand the sacrifices made by our men and women in the military. Thank you all for your service!"
We had a great day exploring the USS Midway with family. There was ten of us all together with our great great grandson became a Marine the day before. Because he became a Marine we all got in free. Get the free tour device and you can listen to different fact along the way. Tells you facts about different airplanes and helicopters and the ship itself. Some of took the tour to the top of ship. Seen the ship wheel and the Captain bunk. Great day. Glad we toured the Midway.
Visiting the USS Midway is a great tour of our history. It really makes you proud to be an American. We were very impressed by all the people that helped us see this great ship. Thank you all for your service!
"We have visited the USS Midway Museum twice and loved it both times.  If you visit in February, you might get to take advantage of the 1/2 price museum visit promotion.  Check a local library for a coupon.  Then if you keep your ticket stub, you will get $5.00 off a harbor cruise.  Park in the lot next to the Midway for $10.  After we spent 4 hours on the ship, we walked next door to The Fish Market restaurant and had a wonderful lunch!"
"I’m not especially interested in planes and helicopters nor giant ships but thought a quick walk through would be good. Five hours later we hadn’t seen much of the lower decks and decided we’d just have to come back another time!  Listening to retired pilots talk in detail about how planes are launched every 45 seconds was crazy cool. Another retired serviceman talked about how the ship was handled up top and what each crewman did to propel the ship. Who actually steered the ship and how tedious that simple job actually was is a quick conversation but very interesting. Heading back down to the Flight Deck to hear a whole different set of pilots educate the crowd on how they land places every 90 seconds (I think it was 90 seconds). Loved it! The Leap Frog Team dropped in on deck and that in itself was fun to watch!  2.5 hours in and we haven’t looked at one plane.... The hearing devices they give you are helpful. Each airplane or helicopter has a “chip” the listening device can activate if you want. Then 30 second monologue tells the significance of that particular aircraft. Again, very interesting!  Go check it out but give yourself a bit of flex time incase it takes longer than you think."
We visited the museum with older teenagers. It is a self-guided tour except for the bridge when a tour guide will take you for a short tour. The ship is bigger than you would think...so many passageways and doors. It was interesting for us how Navy men and women live at sea due to our daughter joining the Navy soon. Expect to spend a few hours on board if you want to see everything. I would start at the bottom deck and work my way up to the top deck. The top deck has many aircraft to see and also some volunteers that give video lessons on aircraft taking off/landing on aircraft carriers. Very interesting. For people who do not climb stairs this would be a difficult tour.
I’ve been making my way around to see this amazing ships. The Midway has great tours. Make sure you check their availability.
got there early and was so much to see it really takes 2 trips to cover everything . there are tours with actually servicemen that work on the midway when it was active
Spent the day on the Midway with my 12 and 14 year old boys. We had a great time. They enjoyed going in the planes and helicopters. Great tour overall!
"This is a must see! Even though most of the ship was off limits due to Covid, we still thoroughly enjoyed our visit (& felt very safe and welcome)! The best part for me was listening to the docents talk (explaining how things on the ship work and telling us about their experiences). Its my personal opinion that all Americans should visit a military museum or experience of some kind to put things in perspective. We so often take our freedoms for granted. Being on the flight deck was simply amazing! We actually went back to our hotel that evening and watched the Midway movie! My son now want to do a report about Midway. Thank you Midway Museum for the great day!"
We thoroughly enjoyed exploring the USS Midway - the best $26 we spent in San Diego. Informative and fun - self guided so you can take as long as you like. Recommended!
Touring the Midway was a bucket list activity for my husband and neither of us were disappointed. It was an excellent self guided tour but you learn so much more from chatting with the the volunteer docents who seem to be all ex service. We learned so much about this amazing ship! Plan for at least 2.5 to 3 hours.
"An afternoon in San Diego, having walked for miles exploring the city and having had a bus tour, we decided we couldn’t leave without checking out the Midway museum. The tour is all encompassing, starting on the cavernous main hangar deck indoors flowing up to the flight deck with its selection of parked warplanes (each with its own story) and then moving to a tour of the bridge and quarters. Staffed by ex-sailors and officers each of whom are pleased to explain the various areas of the ship or the planes, makes for a more realistic experience. The view from the flight deck as the sun slowly sank over the horizon is special and the lights of the city twinkle as you marvel at the size of this magnificent vessel. An afternoon well spent indeed!"
"People told us we could do the tour in an hour. That would have felt very rushed. We ended up spending over four hours on the Midway. We watched the LeapFrogs (Seals and other special forces) who parachute from a plane. They trailed some smoke and simulated a mid drop rescue. They all landed right on target at the front of the flight deck. That took about 30 minutes and was well worth it. There are two live presentations on the flight deck, with information about landing and taking off. We then took the guided tour of flight operations and the bridge (another 20 minutes or so). Finally, we watched ""Voices of Midway"" with some footage and interviews from Midway Battle participants, including George Gay, the only survivor of Torpedo Squadron 8 from USS Hornet. Made me very proud to be an American."
"Was part of our ""attractions"" package and it was brilliant.Vary interesting listening to the audio and also the stories told by veterans who in themselves were all very interesting, enthusiastic and knowledgable. Excellent experience to be on such a massive ship"
My husband and I loved our visit at the USS Midway Museum. Gave me additional appreciation for what young men and women do for the US. Thank you!!  The docent volunteers were amazing and I really enjoyed the audio tour!!
"Definitely worth a few hours to tour this magnificent ship!  Imagine the life back in the day.  Top deck amazing with all the planes that possibly flew off this deck.  The inside of the ship....it's an entire city!  Hospital, dental, lots of kitchens and eating halls, entertainment, and so much more!  Oh, and they even had a JAIL!  Yep!  (Behave sailors!)  There were also lots of volunteers that actually flew these jets off the decks of ships!  Talk about some good commentary!  GO!"
"While there were only two decks available for exploring, there is still plenty to check out on the ship. Take the time to sit down and learn form the men who ran this ship in its hay day. They are a wealth of knowledge and humor. We happened to go on the Midway's 75th birthday, so we were offered a commemorative medallion. It is stunning, just a small token of such an amazing ship. Bottom line, it may not be fully accessible, but it is definitely worth the trip to honor these men and women for their years of service and dedication."
We spent four hours at the Midway and it was worth every minute. We love history and there was a ton of it here. Take a trip up to the bridge on “the island.” An amazing look at how things actually happened! And don’t miss the film.
"We toured this GREAT SHIP a few years ago.  Suggest you arrive at opening, view the Command Center first (as lines grow long in the afternoon); we were the first people onto the SHIP and the last ones to leave at closing.   This is a superior exhibit.  Most interesting were all the stories from the Pilots that actually flew the planes.   We recently referred a young married couple and they simply loved it."
Do take time to visit the USS Midway Museum.  It is very interesting and worth the visit.  It's a great way to see how a military ship operates and what our men and women do to protect our nation.  The history of Midway is fascinating.
"Spent far longer at this attraction than we anticipated, it was that interesting. One can't fail to be impressed by the scale of this floating city, staffed by friendly, accommodating volunteers happy to share their knowledge.The tour focusses on all aspects of the ships operations, not just the glory and danger of the flying operations. Get there early, it does get busy. There's a lot of walking and stairs so make sure you take water and comfortable footwear. Take your time and just enjoy this piece of floating history."
"This place has so much to see and learn. The docents are so knowledgeable. I got to meet Paul, who has an immense amount of knowledge and expertise. Don't miss sitting in on his lecture about landing fighter jets on an aircraft carrier."
"We spent about 3 hours on the ship. With your admission you receive a electronic tour guide on a lanyard. Took the advice of other reviewers and brought our wired headsets so you didn't have to hold the device up to your ear. Throughout the ship you scan the sign with your device and you learn about that part of the ship, plane or helicopter. They have two scanning points, one for adults and one for children. We found listening to both was quite informational.  The living areas were informational on how they lived and worked. You could see sleeping bunks, the control room and sit at the controls for pictures. On the top deck they had volunteer veterans with an area set up with chairs and screen. They would show clips of the planes they flew and provide stories and information about the missions they flew. They were engaging and it was an honor to listen to them."
"Learn the great history behind this incredible ship. The docents were knowledgeable and very friendly. Great collection of planed, jets and helicopters. Amazing how big this ship really is when you walk all the levels. Definitely recommend."
Very informative worthwhile display. It was well done and plenty of people to answer any questions. Thank you to all veterans!
