"went to the match ManCity-Wolverhampton. overall a very good experience. Stadium easy to reach by metrolink. Lots of activities and food options pre match. Stadium is large and modern. Very good staff, high level of security and pleasant atmosphere. I am from overseas and was impressed with the whole organization."
Went with family season ticket holders. Private Parking nearby cost £8 about fifteen minutes walk . Stadium has developed a real character and friendly atmosphere. Bag search by friendly efficient security staff. Seats very comfy compared to your usual seats. More room than at Old Trafford !! Fan areas are good seats in catering areas for people to sit in at half time and the burgers are real quality ! Pies are locally produced and tasty.Very slow service which seems to be a regular problem. There are a large number of ladies toilets which are clean and well stocked.Definitely generally better fan experience than other grounds speaking as a season ticket holder of another premiership club the Etihad is a good place to visit .  Large screens give good information and replays .Music is good including Oasis tracks.Fans are self deprecating and quite funny and friendly. As for the football that was also a better experience than most fans get 4-0 to City ...
"The stadium is magnificent and well managed. Getting in and security extremely well done. They encourage you to use public transport well don’t. They close tram stations for 90 minutes after the game ends, build up huge queues and there is a tram maybe one every 20 minutes. How stupid. On top of this parking at or around the ground is difficult. Prepare to walk the distances De Brunner runs in the game - miles. Ruined a great experience."
"With small amount we can visit stadium, £25 per person  Recommend make online reservation especially in holiday season. Don’t bring many things such as bags because there is control before entering the stadium. Just bring camera (smartphone) and enjoy the tour. Don’t forget to make video and photo with Pep Guardiola :)"
"Surely with a venue used weekly the public travel to and from it should be seamless?  But of course not....40 minute (minimum) queues for a sardine can on rails (aka a tram) both ways.  There were additional buses on the way back, but the queue again was miles long.Then once at the venue cheerless security and unhelpful staff.Drinks were a rip off and decanted into plastic glasses (pint of wine anyone).  Taking in bottles was forbidden apparently, yet you could see many coke bottles and lager ones.  When you're expected to pay £25 for a cheap plastic bottle of wine you should at least be allowed the luxury of having it in the bottle and not as a 'drink me all now' option.This did put a dampener on an otherwise excellent night, but things like this would stop me from going again."
"Traveled to Manchester Piccadilly station and got the tram to the Etihad, staff at the train station was great to help direct us as we had never been before. Got to the stadium and went straight to the away end where there was a confusion to which gate to go in K or L, said K on the ticket but had to enter L. Finally got inside to a small bar with a poor choice of food but drinks was not overpriced. The steward was more than helpful to guide us to the seats which had plenty of room. The view from the away area was good but for some reason the ground did not impress me which I thought would after hearing thing about the Etihad. For some reason City fans do not fill this stadium and they sit watching the game like they are in a doctor’s surgery. A club like that should be sold out every home game along with drowning out the away fans with song. I can say now I’ve been to the Etihad Stadium but don’t think I will rush back. I think in truth City fans will agree with this review but will stay silent as it was at the game. I am a Aston Villa fan and this is not a review to be nasty in any way."
Attended Metallica gig. Great venue for concerts (despite the rain) excellent access and very well organised would recommend if this is one of the venues an artist is playing at.
"Visited here with teen and two 10 year olds. During our holiday we visited Old Trafford, Anfield and the Etihad, and as a United fan it pains me to say it, but the tour experience at the Etihad was definitely the best. The staff were amazing. Lucas and Georgia did the stadium with us, and the lovely Graham did the academy tour. Probably because we had the other tours to compare it to, we really appreciated the personal touches on this. Great not to be relying on ‘media devices’, but to hear stories from people who are entertaining and obvious fans themselves. Loved hearing about the past and present, and there are some really fun touches, like the interactive press room. Well worth the extra for the academy tour, and we even got to see Pep leaving after training. We are not converted, but have a new respect for City!"
Attend a match this week and found the stadium great. Easy access and parking was plentiful. Pleasant walk around the stadium and grounds with plenty of facilities to use prior to going in the stadium. Seating and views very good.
Home of the the greatest team in England. This is an amazing venue. A 15 minute walk from piccadilly train station. You can get the 216 bus from piccadilly.  Outside wetherspoons. Or jump the tram. On event days the tram gets packed. If your trying to get on at piccadilly train station you often can't get on the tram as it's so packed. I normally walk down to piccadilly gardens or st Peter's sq. You can now use your debit card touch and go for the tram. Meaning you dont have to que for a ticket. Just touch your card against the machine on the platform before boarding and then the same when u get off. Coming away from the stadium it's often quicker to walk into the city centre than que for tram or bus.
"We went to see the Spice Girls and traffic around the stadium was chaotic. Give yourself plenty of time if travelling by car. We witnessed a crash because of a drivers impatience, hitting another car hard enough to trigger air bags. Stadium itself is well equipped. Plenty of toilets inside, along with food outlets and bars. If seated, you are sheltered from the elements but those standing on pitch area got soaked in the rain. Egress inside the stadium well managed but roads were at a standstill. We waited 3/4 hour to move out of car park. I don’t know if charge is same for parking at every event, but this cost £15."
"Just got back from the stadium.  Staff were extremely helpful and pleasant and in good numbers.  Entry was quick and easy.  A nine seater golf-type buggy took us to our entry point as my g/daughter is suffering a knee injury.  Inside the stadium I found the staff equally professional, pleasant and helpful.  Seating was good (we were behind the goal post).  My criticism centres around the catering.  I ordered five portions of chips.  On receiving the first two they were cold.  Pointed this out to the server who politely took them back and returned them to the hotplate (where they were immediately picked up by the server of the next queue and given to the next customer!).  However, I did receive five portions of hot chips at a cost of 3 pounds per portion, (but cost only 1.50 when teamed up with an overpriced burger or hotdog.  There were no trays or boxes to carry them so had to do two trips.  Both the catering size tomato ketchup dispensers were empty and there was no mayonnaise or vinegar on offer.  Did not try the mustard sauce (who eats mustard sauce on chips!!!)."
"Incredible stadium. Very well staffed (professional attitude but also welcoming feeling)Very well designed. Serves drinks in reusable cups, which I feel all stadiums should have.This stadium is years ahead of other stadiums.They have an incredible souvenir shop and a village to create a great matchday atmosphere.The public transport is superb setup."
Went there for a concert and It was all well organised and clean. Toilets were quite easy to reach. Overall it was really clean. Security was thorough and the stadium is huge
My first visit to this impressive stadium was to see the Spice Girls. The stadium has its own tram stop so is easily accessible. The stadium itself had a great atmosphere. It was raining but we were dry as the seating is all under cover. The seats themselves were padded which is really unusual for a football stadium. The bars were well staffed but very expensive at £5 per bottle but at least you didn’t have to wait. There are plenty of toilets so no queuing. Exiting after was also well managed. A great experience all round.
"Had to change pre-booked seats for a match and so contacted the ticket line and spoke to a very helpful gentleman called Ross. Ross was very easy to talk to and was very professional in his job, could not ask any more from him. Great customer service from this guy!"
Attended here for a Champions League game and found the place to be a fab stadium. From ordering the tickets and getting to our seats really straight forward. The view from the seats were spot on and from looking from inside the stadium it looked like the majority of seats had a good view. No hassle in leaving the stadium either. A good all round experience.
"The Etihad Stadium Tour was amazing and very informative. Shout out to Manchester City guides @Kassim and @kristina, made me love City with their warm and passionate hospitality... made me feel like am part of the city family....Wish one day I would get a chance to watch Manchester City live in action... I definitely recommend the visit/Tour 100% and will obviously visit whenever am back in Manchester...RegardsStephen (from Nairobi, Kenya)"
"Easy to get to and concert very good. Felt safe, lots of security and staff to help with any problems. Limited choice of food available and everything was expensive.The main issue was the restricted view from our seats - South Stand, Block 213, seats 325 and 326. The view was blocked by a very tall speaker. We paid almost £90 each for the tickets and no warning that it was a restricted view. This was very disappointing and spoilt our enjoyment of the evening."
"Went to a City game and was very impressed by the Etihad compared to other stadiums. Great view from the seating even though high up, great bar area and entertainment/food outside but most impressive of all was the access in & out. You enter/leave via a spiral walkway that is easy wide enough for about 6 people at a time, so from the final wistle it took about 8 mins to empty the stadium!"
"Compared to other stadiums tours, the visit to Etihad stadiums is more intense and focused. It lasts 1h15 and brings you to majestic Manchester City's dressing room, round and completely different from any other dressing room. Then you visit the VIP stand and the players tunnel which is again much more majestic than in other stadiums. The pitch is fabulous.Then, the press rooms and other parts of the stadiums. Excellent."
"Have visited the Etihad on several occasions now for both sporting and musical events. The stadium is big, clean and grand in its stature. Entry is well managed, as are the queues inside. Love the introduction of reusable beer cups inside the stadium too!"
Visited the Etihad Stadium with family young children in October. Very nice stadium with lots of information about the city football club.
"So well organised and staffed, was a really clean and beautiful stadium.Plenty of decent food and drink at okay prices for the football. Was surprised how good all viewing angles were even though I was very high up.Prices for tickets were fantastic also given the quality of the team."
"Attended the Man City v Leicester. The corporate hospitality surely has to be the best of the best. Great environment, fabulous staff, excellent hospitality, amazing food and entertainment second to none. What else can you want"
"Went on the tour , fab experience . Interesting information and great photo opportunities. Amazing to sit where the players sit in the dressing room."
"Visited here recently to see the Spice Girls. The show was brilliant. Getting into the Stadium took a time but it is understandable nowadays. Security is paramount. As is generally the case, the ladies toilets were always busy and queuing estential. To be fair they did have lots of Portaloos as well. The Spice Girls gave a really good show, with fireworks too. At the end of the show it was very easy to exit the Stadium with lots of staff directing you. No problems. There was somebody who needed medical attention and the staff were able to locate the person by holding their high-vis jacket up in the air on a stick, thereby making the place to be sought easy to be foind. Things were quickly dealt with. I had a brilliant time"
Visiting the Etihad for the first time is pretty special. Start the day with the tour so you can sit in 'Pep's seat' and see where they do the TV interviews and get near to the hallowed turf. Our tour guides were fantastic - Linda was a diehard City fan and was terrific.Ray was an old funny Mancunian. It set the game up magically. City have thought about an overall family experience and they have music and interviews before and after the game to entertain the crowds. High drama as the coach with the players arrive and are taken through the 'tunnel club.'I had waited a long time to see City play at home and it was a perfect weekend. I absolutely love the set up at Manchester City after many decades a club to be genuinely proud of.
"Attended a concert here and although it’s pretty well organised, I feel it’s just too big for music events. There feels like there is no atmosphere at all. The stairs are very steep on the higher tiers and are rather dangerous."
"If I attend a football match at the Etihad and stand up I will be asked to sit down and then risk being ejected if I do not comply. Why the is it acceptable to stand up and obstruct other customers view at a concert. Last night yet again I had to watch 2 mature men nearly coming to blows due to one of the wives having no consideration while the steward turned blind one. Surely if you want to dance then there is plenty of room on the pitch. Do these selfish individuals not think that some punters have chosen a seat on issues such as injury,age,medical condition.I must stress this did not directly involve myself but I am seeing such incidents at converts on a regular basis. Come on Etihad and other such venues sort your policy out so we can avoid such hassle at an otherwise excellent venue.Top venue,excellent facilities."
"Set in the heart of the countryside in a valley we found this giant stadium where Tennis was being played on all 24 courts. Its a Mecca for enthusiasts although at times apparently they use the stadium for football but that is no worry as football is a very minority sport in this city. Usual gates at the ""Etihad"" are about 250 people for their 4th division games.The facilities are awesome and with free entry what's not to like.Yes its even rumoured that they might move ""Wimbledon"" to the ""Etihad"" stadium as parking is so bad in London, what a boost that would be for Manchester, bring it on as this is the city of Tennis."
"Did stadium tour at 11am on 14th June.  Graham and Ray were excellent,  very engaging even for a non football fan...although my husband is into football. Lady who we spoke to before tour who took our photo was also very polite and helpful!"
"Been to a few home matches at different times and always loved the atmosphere. everyones pleasant and very good, tight security."
Visited the stadium for Man City v West Ham fixture in February and attended the tunnel club.  I'm not a fan of either club but the experience was excellent in the opulent surroundings of the tunnel club.  it is a great new approach to matchday hospitality and I would highly recommend to anyone
Went to see Muse.  Well organised in terms of accessing the staduim and on leaving.  On leaving there was a long line for the metro tram back into the city but it was well organised.
