Heard so much about the Castle and am glad we were there. We walked a while in the Castle compound then realised that we haven‚Äôt even reached the Castle entrance. You already get a good view of the area around the Castle before going into the Castle. Toured the interior of the Castle compounds with us carrying our own shoes in plastic bags given out. Thought it was quite novel. The compound was well maintained. There was a lookout area there too which we took some pictures. Worth spending a couple of hours there. Enjoyable.
"Visited this castle one week before it was burned down. Picture in front of the main building with the clear blue sky was beautiful. There were many historic Ryokyu information in the building, hope restore work can go on smoothly."
"Go on your own to enjoy this castle. Although it is not as grand as the famous castles of Japan, its Chinese influence is quite striking. But don't go on a wet day. Too many things will be missed. The Museum Shop had too little to offer. Not even postcards of the castle was available. You can reach the castle by monorail."
"It‚Äôs worth the long walk up to the Castle, beautiful gardens and building. Look out for the tea room it‚Äôs work the break"
"We took the monorail there - last station but about 15 minutes walk, and not many signages so be prepared to ask the helpful locals and the students. Historical site but our very elderly friend couldn't walk up the steps (she had joined a day trip there). Go for the interesting cultural performances (only on certain days and timings) and the evening light up. We missed the latter as it rained that evening and the guide was very strict about not letting us in through the side gate (from the university grounds)."
"The place was destroyed about 6 weeks ago but there was still some things to see here. Wasn't quite sure if I was able to get to the main area of destruction as a lot of this place was cordoned off.  Did got to see a few buildings with damage which was a bit emotional from me for some reason.  Still there are things to see here like stone gates and some buildings and whatnot.   I believe the American Air Force destroyed this place once before, and it was resilient enough to come back then, so I'm sure it will again."
"Honestly, it‚Äôs rebuilt in 1990s, feel quite new. If you go by monorail, on the way to the castle, you can see a shop selling cheaper entrance fee. Go and buy it with cheaper price. People say that you can see the panorama view from the top of the castle but nothing to see on the top. Basically, the architect of the whole city is quite flat and no interesting building. Even its history, too short and nothing special to be remarked."
"Take a train to the Shuri castle. If the weather permits, the walk is very pleasant and you can find eateries around.  Have an ice cream. Try Shuri soba  Otherwise, the castle is recently rebuilt. So its like going to a movie set.   Nice pleasant walk."
"Stayed at Naha for 2 to 3 days before I headed to north, this place seems worth to go when I looked up in the internet where to go in Naha. Anyway, if you are not into history this is not your cup of tea. The garden and view are ok but I would not say amazing. But they do have a trick to attract people (in Japan culture), it is the stamp collection. For each signature spots or places they want you to visit (a bit like ikea, try to guide you to walk through the place), there has stamp station for you to stamp onto the leaflet and you can collect all or not (can have souvenir). And I quite obsessed into collect things personally so I sucked into it, and spent 1 to 2 hours to walk around to collect all. They also has pay and free areas, pay area I would say not much to see tbh. I don't recommend that but you are like me, want to collect all stamps then you need to pay money to go in. can get discount (JPY820 originally) if you show 1 or 2 days monorail pass."
"went here as part of a shore tour, the castle looked great and seemed to have lots of interesting things to look at the grounds and gardens also looked very interesting.  unfortunately we were only allowed a very limited time here so seemed to be rushed through with no time to stop and look.  there were some steep steps to access the main area and you are required to remove your shoes in one of the areas. Personally think it would be a great place to visit and send the day, but for us unfortunately that was not allowed."
"Restored nicely, this castle has an impressive facade and showcases some artefacts from the past. You can go higher up to get a view of the castle grounds too."
"We probably followed the signage for cars and walked a longer route to get to the castle. We walked to Ryutan-dori from the monorail station. From there, we walked along route 29 and 49 to the main access way (Samukawa-dori) to Shurijo Castle, passing blue seal ice cream, Lawson convenience store and Ryutan (dragon pond) on our way. Based on google map, it was a 1.4 km walk. We would have shortened the walk by 300m if we turned left after Lawson. But it was late March, the weather was nice and there were lots of blooming flowers along the way, the longer walk wasn't strenuous at all.On entering Samukawa-dori, you will pass by a little house on your right which has a resting place, lockers, toilets and a souvenir shop. We would have missed this place if we took the left turn at Lawson. This place also distributes a stamping pamphlet where fans can affix location ink stamps to the pamphlet when you reach various locations in Shurijo Castle.We reached Shurijo Castle at 10 am+ then slowly toured the castle compound. Access is free until you reach the square inside Koufukumon (Âª£Á¶èÈñÄ). The suggested route is to take the stairs from Kankaimon (Ê≠ìÊúÉÈñÄ) to Koufukumon (Âª£Á¶èÈñÄ), tour the castle and indoor exhibits (purchase the entrance tickets at the counter near Koufukumon (Âª£Á¶èÈñÄ)), then exit via the slope from the square inside Koufukumon (Âª£Á¶èÈñÄ) to Kobikimon (Êú®Êõ≥ÈñÄ). Shurijo Castle does not have much sheltered area. There was a tentage with seats for tourists to watch a short traditional Okinawan performance at the square inside Koufukumon (Âª£Á¶èÈñÄ) on the Friday we went."
Amazing Castle and surrounding gardens. Take time to go through the castle and see its history. Make sure you take time to stroll through the gardens. They are so peaceful.
"If you are in Naha for a day, this is your must see. Very easy to get to on the Monorail. Get off at the Shuri Station and the then it is a short 0.5 mile walk. The grounds and palace are nice. You take a self-guided tour by following signs. Limited information is provided but it is enough.  There is a good amount of stairs involved to see everything. You can also walk the ramparts. At the main gate, you can dress up in traditional costumes for a fee and get your photo taken. After you are done, take the short walk to the family mausoleum. It is a separate smaller fee and takes about 15 minutes to see. Watch you head üòÅ"
"This is the main attraction when visiting Naha, Okinawa. It was smaller than I expected. I was glad we hired a private bus for the day so we did not have to take that long walk from the monorail station. We parked at the underground parking lot and just took the elevator up. Free entry to the park/grounds but had to pay 800 Y to enter the castle. Free for disabled and one companion. It was very crowded inside the castle. Felt like a herd of cattle being pushed through the line but glad we got in at least to see the throne. Very Chinese, if you ask me. Wish we had more time there to see the rest of the park. Hopefully, will return someday."
"The Shuri castle is definitely a must see in Okinawa. It‚Äôs really pretty. can be very crowded so do plan your journey there.There‚Äôs a nice tea set that you could enjoy in the castle itself. Do try that if you had the chance, nice experience!"
"Having been to other more authentic castles in Japan, this castle was very much a disappointment as it felt very much like it was built with the sole purpose of making it a tourist attraction. Having said that, they did take great effort to replicate the castle to give us an idea of what it might have looked like."
"I was extremely excited about visiting Shuri Castle. It's in Japan, but used to belong to a royal family that presided over its own independent kingdom (Ryukyu), so it felt like I was going somewhere really ancient and unique.But it's not ancient, not really. Because the castle is a reconstruction and this was the feeling you got when you went inside the main hall. I found the exterior relatively impressive (the architecture resembles Chinese architecture). The red striped courtyard is a sight to see, but I imagine I would have been more wowed had there not been a mass of scaffolding over the main hall that substituted for this by hanging up a large print of what you could no longer see behind it.I may as well have been looking at a picture online. Although actually, I blame the online pictures for my disappointing experience because they make it look so spectacular.Inside, you could see a reconstruction of the old Ryukyuan King's throne, amongst other reconstructed artefacts and an exhibition of some legitimate heritage items. Only trouble is, my enthusiasm for such things had dulled because I was so let down by the unexpected scaffolding. I'll admit, there were some other factors not related to the castle that coloured my enjoyment of it. For one, I'd travelled to Okinawa in June, but it was the rainy season so although it was hot it was tipping down so I was walking around the castle getting drenched (didn't do the gardens because of this).Also, I'd mistakenly imagined the castle would be in a beautiful setting a stone's throw from the beach. This is the impression you get when you see pictures in guide books and such. But it was in the middle of the UGLIEST CITY IN THE ENTIRE WORLD - Naha.Entrance fee: 860 yen (tad overpriced). I noticed some accessible areas, but in order to get in to the place I had to go up some steep stairs so not sure about that.We drove there. Wasn't difficult navigating the roads."
"Well maintained historical and cultural site. Very organised and clearly marked route so you can see all that is on offer. The ‚ÄòStamp Rally‚Äô where you take a stamp sheet and use an ink stamp to stamp landmarks along the route is a genius way to get kids (and adults!) engaged and motivated during the sight seeing. Get all stamps to receive cute stickers and a mini folder at the end. Much of the outer grounds is free, and the inside of the buildings require an entrance fee (¬•800).  Good views of the city. The tea set in the building was a lovely break. For ¬•310 you get jasmine tea and 4 imperial cookies, served in the tatami room where the prince used to entertain diplomats and guests. The staff are dressed in red kimonos and explain the snacks. Lovely way to spend 1-2 hours."
"Castle frontage was undergoing repair works. Knew about it after paying the 820Yen entrance fees and going into the castle grounds. Otherwise, it was about a 30mins tour. Tick in the box!"
"Didn't enter the paid area but enjoyed walking the grounds of this castle. Still got to see everything, just not up close."
The must place in Okinawa. Do not hesitate to go this place. The car park fee is 320yen/2 hours. 2 hours is enough to look around.
Enjoyed our visit here will a well restored  castle and well laid out tour. Castle is positioned high on a hill with great views and there is a good tourist centre to take a break and rest with a decent restaurant
Very well set out attraction. Most of the exhibits had an English translation and we enjoyed learning about the area and it's history. At around ¬•800 it's well worth it. Take the monorail to the last stop and it's around 10 mins easy pace on foot. 
The original Castle was completely destroyed during WWII. What we see today is a reconstruction based on photographs and available plans.Getting to the Castle area is no easy task as you must walk an uphill path and a number of stairs. This is the Path to the Seiden where you will see a number of gates. The wheelchair path misses the sites along the path. The Museum tour is basically self guided. You must remove your shoes (you are given a bag to carry them) to walk through the halls. As my wife has orthopedic boots she declined the tour. Walking on bare feet would be too painful. The Ryukyu exhibits were somewhat on the sparse side. The staff were all dressed in period costume. There is no air conditioning inside the museum and it was very hot. There are free hand fans to keep cool.  During our visit there were large crowds. The tour finishes on the second floor. We spent the last 15 minutes in a mass crowd as we funneled onto a staircase and the exit where people are putting their footwear back on. Staff collect the bags for recycling.
Didn‚Äôt end up going into the castle due to lack of time. Was rushing for my bus to Ginowan. But the walk around the castle park was very scenic and totally worth the time it took to get over there. üòäüòä
"This place is a must visit in tour program.  Recommend to go by car due to the walk way to the castle is very steep.  This place is registered the world heritage and it is worth to visit.  Parking is available with fee, staffs manage very well in assist us find a parking.  The entrance fee is 800 yen/person, you have to take off your shoe before enter the wooden castle."
"Compared to your usual castles in central Japan this place is truly a treat. The building itself is still a reproduction but the area is huge, it looks amazing and it‚Äôs especially worth going inside because you get to walk through many rooms and the displays (including expensive decorations) are amazing. You get to see an Okinawan garden and for an additional price of ¬•300 you can try tea with a treat. With the free map you could also go on a fun stamp hunt. Definitely a must visit."
"Shurijo is just beautiful and must be on every travelers list when visiting Okinawa.Park in the official underground parking for practically same price as other outdoor parkings (I think it was even cheaper). Right there when you exit the underground parking and where info centre is located is ticket machine. Buy your tickets there (english supported) to skip the queues at the entrance of the castle!You will have to take off shoes for castle visit (plastic bags provided) so I advice you to have socks if you do not feel comfortable ‚Äúsharing‚Äù floor with bare feet.It can get hot in summer, so try to go on cloudy day. Inside of the caste is cooled so do not worry.For 300yen you can enjoy tea and okinawan ryukyu era sweets in the castle, it was totally worth it, so I recommend that too!"
"If you've been to castles in Japan before, this is a new experience. It has a very Chinese style to it, not like the towering palaces in most places. It's more spread out and has different themes in color and design. The paths wending up to the main buildings are a great walk, too, with many beautiful sidetracks you can take. Once you get to the main building, there are great views of Naha and the surrounding areas. Don't miss it!"
Busted the castle during our visit to Naha. It was restored & the exhibits gave an interesting insight to the life of royalty in the past. The surrounding park was also a nice place for a leisurely stroll.
"If you are driving, look for the signs indicating parking for Shurijo Castle. Ignore the other carparks nearby on the way to the castle. There is a large underground carpark and there are attendants who will guide you to the parking lot."
Visited on April 2019. Shuri Castle full of historical story behind which is perfect to visit and learn to know more about Okinawa or Ryukyu Kingdom in the past. There are a lot of paid-parking around the castle make it easily access to the castle. Walking route around the castle take about 1 - 1.5 hours.
The kids really enjoyed stopping at the passport stands to stamp their brochure. There are enough to occupy them on the free section of the castle. We didn‚Äôt pay to see the other parts. Great view from the top and informative stops along the route. Bring cash to pay for parking - credit card not accepted.
"Shurijo CastleNahathis is THE castle to visit in Okinawa.582297428Wife and I had one day in Naha, and decided this was the place to visit. Sure enough, it is! Located at 1-2, Shuri-Kinjo-cho, Naha-shi, Okinawa. Taxi drivers and Google Maps know exactly were it is and how to get there. You need at least half a day to do it justice. There are so many things to see, and information to try to absorb. I had no idea Okinawa had such a long history, and such close ties with China. Since the weather was cool, it was pleasant to walk through the castle, despite the throngs of other visitors: school kids, families with young children, elders, etc. The castle grounds are extensive, too, and there are several very important historical sites to visit. I recommend a Google search and check out several of the entries for more information and photos (you are not allowed to take photos in some parts of the castle, so you'll have to depend on the official photos authorized by the Castle). With a history (search for Shuri_Castle on Wikipedia; tripadvisor required me to remove the link) dating back to the 11th Century, a capsule review just doesn't cut it - you really need to experience it. And the experience is well worth the 800 yen price of admission."
