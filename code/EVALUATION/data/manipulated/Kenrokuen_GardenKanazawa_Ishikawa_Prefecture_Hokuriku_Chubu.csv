"We had read many good reviews about Kenrokuen Garden, which’s supposed to combine all six attributes of a perfect garden.  Taking the opportunity that we were in Kanazawa, we came here.  Many people took pictures in front of the two-legged stone lantern, which was a well-known spot in this garden.  Overall, the garden’s highly recommended and a must see."
Very nice garden to visit. One of the top 3 landscapegardens. Visited it for 2 hours and saw every part.
Remember that mid - April is still great for Sakura sights in Kanazawa.  Beautiful garden - see pictures.  Be prepared to walk up if you don’t get driven to the place.  It’s sits on a plateau on top of a small hill where the Kanazawa Castle is.  A must see.
"I visited this place along side 21st Century museum in winter 2011. Visited in spring April 2019, It is still the same park (of course!) and the same feeling of peace that you experienced as you walk in the park. The place is beautiful both in spring and winter. There were a lot of tourist, still it is the topPlace to visit if you are in kanazawa. The garden is awesome, indeed the top garden in japan."
"Walked over from Kanazawa Castle Park, and paid a small fee to enter this garden. Great location for photography as we saw tourists and even locals dressed in kimono here (we saw kimono rental shops just outside the garden). Despite the small crowd, it was a beautiful garden to walk around and appreciate the tranquillity of the Japanese gardens."
"We were in Kanazawa for 3 days and visited Kenrokuen twice, for the different light. It is a stunningly beautiful garden, sculptured and planned to the highest details. Every few steps there are beautiful photo opportunities. We were here in mid-May when the Azaleas, magnolia and Wisteria are in full bloom. Cherry blossom season must be spectacular but so must the crowds! We found the quietest time was lunch time, too early or late and you will get the large tour groups. Go when people are elsewhere eating! The light at midday is also at its best."
"We went exploring the garden by following the garden guide. We saw the turrets , store House and Ishikawamon gate of Kanazawa castle. Walking further we came to the Hisagoike pond , midoritaki waterfall and the Kasumigaike pond. We took lovely photos of the fountain and Kotojitoro lantern reflected on the pond.  The highlight of the park is the unique Karasakinomatsu pine with ropes tied to its branches. Nice Hanamibashi bridge to look out for. The trees and plants in the park is well maintained and nice to look at - the plum grove, the pine trees.  There are many rest areas where one can sit to rest the aching legs or visit the Shiguretei tea house. Look out for the rest area shaped like a boat. Was a really nice walk in the cool day , amidst all the greens."
"If you only do one thing in Kanazawa, visit Kenrokuen Garden. I got up early & got a taxi to be at the garden when it opens at 7am (tourist loop bus doesn't run that early). Going at opening time was completely worth the effort! That first half hour when the garden is almost empty is magical, absolutely awe-inspiring. I visited from 7am-10am on a cold, grey day and found that the garden was busy and noisy, including large tour groups, from 9am onwards. I stayed for three hours but you certainly don't need that long - I'd say one hour minimum.I'd come back to Kanawaza just to go to Kenrokuen again."
"Amazing gardens. So well maintained and clean.Really interesting oldest fountain inJapan. Go early. The crowds were arriving by the bus load as we were heading out at 9.30am. So many guides with flags and loud speakers!Impressive bridge next to old fountain made from one piece of stone.We just missed the plum trees blossoms, but can imagine it would look spectacular."
"Lovely typical Japanese garden, quite large. Was lucky enough to be there for the cherry blossoms...amazing!"
"Depending on how much you like to walk around beautiful park-like areas, you could walk around these Gardens in an hour and be pleased with that time. Or you could spend a leisurely day there. You could walk across and share the day at Kanazawa Castle."
"Visited here during the new year period. It was very beautiful and peaceful (even in the rain). I imagine it would be stunning during the spring and autumn seasons, however even in the winter it was still lovely. I believe normally you pay an entrance fee, however the day we visited, admission was free."
"A beautiful garden for a leisurely stroll.  Look for the Gankou Bashi, a line of 11 stones that appears to be wild geese in flight. As the stones are shaped like tortoise shells, it is also called the Tortoise Shell Bridge.  Note that crossing the bridge is prohibited. We ended our visit with matcha and Japanese sweets in the Shigure-tei tea house."
A very well kept Japanese garden that anyone that comes to Kanazawa should visit. Walk around and discover all the details.
"Visiting in end Dec 2018, giving a different view of it. Quite cold due to the wind breeze.  Very nice winter ambiance. Ground was quite wet and little slippery in some spots."
Went at end of day. Beautifully calm atmosphere.  I am now writing the rest just so I hit the dumb 100 character limit to submit
Visiting the garden is probably one of the main reasons you came to Kanazawa and it won’t disappoint. It’s delightful to wander around so thoughtfully designed and meticulously maintained. Very relaxing!
"This is the most beautiful Japanese garden I’ve ever seen. Don’t miss the plum grove, the raised root pine and Statue of Prince Yamato. There’s a tea house on site for you to enjoy a cup of tea while soaking in the atmosphere. Highly recommended if you are visiting Kanazawa."
"Beautiful and large park. Save 1.5 hours or more to really enjoy.  Lots to see from statues, to water park to a wonderful fountain that is naturally powered."
"One of the best garden to visit in Japan. Everything that you expect from a Japanese garden. However, it was very crowded in May. Had to shuffle behind queues of people. There was little peace and tranquillity. Just have to imagine what it might be like without the crowds."
Took the bullet train from Tokyo to visit these gardens. Two older ladies visiting from New Zealand. We did not have to pay for entry as we senior citizens. What a magnificent few hours we had strolling through these gardens.  The trees are magnificent.  We met several people out in traditional costumes which made our visit.  I was impressed with the way trees were preserved with cane props.
Beautiful gardens with cherry blossoms . Must see. See both the garden and the grounds of the palace leisurely . We spent 2 Hours of in a hurry an hour to 90 min would do
Very crowded in April due to Cherry Blossom but seasonal interest all round. Very interesting to see attention to detail in care of moss lawns and cloud pruned trees. Allow two hours.
"Enjoyed full cherry blossom there.  Very pretty.  Large ground with few undulation.  Easily accessible by tourist loop bus.  Heard that even better to view autumn leaves.  Together with the adjacent Kanazawa Castle, it is worth spending half a day there."
"I took the bus to Kenrokuen Garden and got turned around off the bus - walked around for 15 minutes before I crossed the street, walked up the steep to one of the entrances.  Given all the tourists in town today, I wasn’t surprised that there were no English-speaking guides available at the information center but it was a shame. The map provided at admission is very useful.  There were many tour groups so I veered off to the side paths because they were less crowded; turns out this was the right thing to do – I guess tour groups stick to the wider, well-trodden route!  This garden is famous because it contains the six different sublime qualities to which a garden can aspire:  spaciousness & seclusion; artifice & antiquity; watercourses & panoramas.  I had printed some info about these qualities and how they’re put into practice at Kenrouken which helped me understand the objectives and accomplishments.  And to realize that not everything in these gardens has to hit you in the face or be super huge or showy.  While there were people all around, there were plenty of meandering paths so I could have a path to myself for a minute or two. The Sei son Kaku villa inside the park was very interesting - possibly the highlight of my visit to the park.  Walking along the less travelled paths of the garden, I was interested to see how the branches of the large, older trees are propped up with very thick, strong & official looking wooden posts.  I got to a point where there was an exit and I was ready to leave."
"This was the place we really wanted to see in Japan. And it is truly amazing, even some of the cherry trees were in blossom! We spent 4 hours there and coupled it with a visit to Kanazawa Castle, which is opposite.It is easy to wander around, there are plenty of places to sit and relax, or take refreshments. Do visit the house in the grounds, especially if you haven’t seen a traditional property before.We were lucky with the weather and got some great photos, but in the middle of a city, it is a great place to visit and relax."
"Was a 2nd visit, as our 1st time they had the pond empty (yearly maintenance - pick your visit's timing). This time it was a perfect sunny day, cool and clear skies. Fantastic all-round gardens from ponds at the top to walking down the hill thru the trees etc."
The best (if not one of the best) garden. Doesn’t matter what weather it is always a beautiful place. When we visited it was raining but still manage to get some nice photos
"Outside Kanazawa Castle, these magnificent gardens attract visitors near and far to experience the serene, peaceful, zen ambience and the tranquil, calm waters with lots of quiet time amongst the pine trees and cherry blossoms.Located at Kanazawa, this region is famous for its gold leaf industry, which can be sampled as gold-decorated ice-cream. It is now a regional commercial centre and transportation hub for Ishikawa Prefecture. There are multiple outlets, selling gold-themed items, cosmetics and desserts. Choose ice-cream with gold sprinkles, gold (See my HAKUICHI review) sheets or gold tinsel garlands.Besides the lacquer and gold-mix-lacquer-work, the plum and cherry blossoms are also a major attraction here. There are some engineering feats, designs and techniques in the garden, such as the natural water fountain without any pressure system, or the bamboo supports which form the backbone for juvenile and senile trees. Many famous pictures show snow on the supporting ropes and bamboo, which illuminated at night appear as Christmas tree props. There is an earthy tone throughout the park, emphasizing the wonders and powers of nature interspersed with the gentle, soft colors and texture of the flora.Walk to Kasumigaike Pond and see the karasaki pine tree with its horizontal branch propped up by sticks. There are many bridges and footpaths traversing ponds and streams. The kotoji lantern at the lake is another photogenic site. The 6 Confucian virtues and elements; seclusion, antiquity, spaciousness, human ingenuity, water and scenic views are embodied in the design, character and layout of this traditional Japanese garden. Our group visited on a sunny morning, then continued our journey to snowy SHIRAKAWAGO (see my review) in the afternoon!"
"A terrific, beautiful garden for strolling around. Typical Japanese with a lot of different views created and contemplative spaces. Go in the morning as early as possible as it gets busy. The cherry blossoms were out when we were there, so there were a few couples in traditional dress having pre wedding photos taken. It all added to the joy of the place"
"The beautiful garden lives up to its name, even in winter. There was ice in many places, there were few visitors, and you could stroll for hours. Don't miss the Kasumigaike Pond. Every visitor stops here to take photographs."
Was drizzling on day of visit. Enjoyed the walk in the garden despite the wet weather. Would be a great place to visit in Spring when flowers blossom.
Did the garden walk today after touring the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art and the Suzuki Museum yesterday (both of which were excellent).  It is truly a magical walk through gorgeous woods with majestic trees and lovely ponds.  A perfect relaxing stroll for our last day in Kanazawa.
"We waited for a sunny day to visit the gardens, in early spring. Spent at least 2 hours exploring the whole gardens and loved all of it. Even though there were only a few plum blossom trees out, the gardens were still outstanding. It was definitely worth being there in the sun, as we went back again later in the day (the tickets are all-day) and it certainly wasn't as good. Beautifully tended, really extensive. We will seriously consider another trip to Japan to see the gardens in autumn colours, or with the azaleas out."
"It is definitely one of the most beautiful gardens in Japan. It is just calming and relaxing to walk around the garden. The best thing is that if you visit in November, you get to enter the garden at night to look at the night view which is absolutely stunning. Say no more! This is an absolute place to go to when you are in Kanazawa!"
