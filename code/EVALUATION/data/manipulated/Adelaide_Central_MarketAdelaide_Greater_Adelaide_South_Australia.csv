Worth a visit to the markets. Buy some tasty local food to take home. Sit and enjoy a coffee at Zuma Cafe.
"Always a must to visit when in Adelaide. So much fresh produce and delicious food options. Grab a coffee, some noodles & dumplings in China Town & some amazing cheese platter items for a lazy dinner. Our 2.5 yr old daughter loves the hustle and bustle too!"
"Large range of fresh produce, heaps of places to grab a coffee or something to eat. Close to public transport and heaps of parking. Relaxing atmosphere with a variety of foods for everyone."
"Loved the atmosphere, sights and sounds.  Good fresh produce and speciality items. Lots of food outlets to satisfy whatever you desire."
"If you love food go to the Central markets. A quick free tram ride will get you there. Plenty of delights to devour from cheeses, meats, fruits and veg, French pastries and more. Grab a coffee and have a wander or sit and have a bite to eat."
"Free admission. Adelaides main food and produce market but also a place to eat and mingle also. Crazy, busy on a Friday afternoon but that only adds to the experience. Peak period I estimate is 5.30-7.00 pm. Closes at 9, watch out for the bargains in the last 30 minutes. Allow 90 minutes to have a good look around. Easy to find, a few places to eat here as well as in surrounding area."
What a wonderful spot for everyone. Great variety of fresh food at competitive prices. Check it out.
"The best touristy thing to do in Adelaide! Outstanding produce, food and local products. Arrive early to avoid the rush!"
Great place for foodies or you like to try different things. Good place to grab fruit and vege to street food to cheeses and flowers. Meat seafood anything you could possibly need!I wish Brisbane had something like this.A must for a visitor to Adelaide.Nice coffee. Desserts wow look devine. I wish i had more time here. Parking free first hour.
It has everything! Enough said ! Best appreciated early before the crowds make parking and finding a table in the cafes harder . Parking on level 1 is easier than the entrance level 2 .
What a wonderful way to spend an hour or more. Take advantage of any food purveyor who offers free samples.
"Recommend a Christmas visit where you will discover everything you need for Christmas. Brunch, Lunch and Afternoon Tea is a must... So many choices for lovers of pasta and pizza Lucia’s is a must.  And coffee A salad at the big table or a coffee and cake... there are so many choices I can’t possibly list them all Make sure you visit the cheese shop in the middle of the market... where you can taste the cheese for free... international cheeses for tasting its a great experience for the kids as well. There are second hand book shops. Those travelling solo will enjoy a great people watching experience.. you will not feel alone. There are lots of people."
"Friday nighs in the markets is fantastic. a great chance to smell, taste and see the sights of Adelaide's great food options. taking the family for a walk around was great. love spending time with my family and always enjoy these times."
"Wonderful spot to wander.  We only did a quick trip in and out. Got some fruit, lovely Turkish delight and fresh bread. I wish we had more time to do one of the market food tours - I hear these are excellent and well worth it."
Great experience. Had lunch there and great variety of food. Bought some fantastic tasting cheese. Good value.
Plenty of fresh produce and deli selection.  Was a little disappointed in the variety of places to eat
"Ate and drank away the morning at the Central Market; super! Delicious coffee at Jamface ... amazing bread from The Market Bread Bar... onto cheese at The Smelly Cheese Shop, and then a a smoothie bowl at Jamu! And on the way out grabbed fresh fish at Cappi’s Fish Market. Wish we lived here!"
"Spending a week in Adelaide and visited the market 3 times to eat. Not only is it good for the local to purchase their weekly fruit, veges and deserts, it also a great place to visit and enjoy a meal at any of the restaurants or china town.Would definitely recommend to all to spend a few hours and walk through the site to take in the smells and aroma of Adelaide"
"Get here early. A fabulous market with amazing fresh produce from fish, meat, vegetables, fruit and cheese. On the outer perimeter are some nice quirky shops selling crafts, clothes and wines.Definitely worth a visit."
"We often takes interstate or overseas visitors to the market if their flight comes into Adelaide prior to lunch. Wander, buy some crusty bread, antipasto, cheeses, stop fir a coffee then head home for a ploughmans lunch. Always a winner!"
"Adelaide Central Markets offers a wide range of fresh fruit, pastries to die for, and interesting food to eat at the market or take home to warm up.  It is a buzz of people.  Grab a coffee and people watch.  The live music was brilliant.  :)"
"Wonderful under cover market in the middle of Adelaide bursting with the best of South Australian fresh produce: fruit and vegetables, nuts, dairy produce, preserved meats, providore, and fish and meat. A gastronome’s delight to compare with the best (think South Melbourne Market). Surrounded by retail outlets, cafes and street food stalls and with both parking and pubic transport access. Love it."
Had a great bib bim bab totally recommend the Korean restaurants inside the market. You’ll be very happy
Great market with all sorts of interesting and exiting products and produce. Take a big bag and plenty of money though there is so much great stuff to buy
"New to Adelaide I spent a Saturday morning wandering the market and enjoying its sights, sounds, and flavors. Everything looked fresh and of high quality, lots of shoppers means lots of turnover. I bought vegetables, wine, cheese, bread, olives and cured meat.  Lots of truly ethnic stalls and authentic foods. Treat yourself to El Souk for lunch if you go!"
Had lunch in the Food Market today and was quite impressed with the variety of food choices. Very clean and staff friendly for the time we spent there.
"I found these markets last time l was in Adelaide. The cheeses, breads, fruit, coffee are just amazing. Definitely the place to go and get dome amazing food. Carparing available, China Town just up the road.."
Need a market lime this in my own home town. So fascinating to see all the delicious fresh produce. Awesome!
"Loved going to this market, lots of variety I  the food. Met a lovely stall holder and had good chat which makes my day"
Spent a few hours wandering around the market - there is an abundance of produce stalls maybe even too many but lots of other things that make it an interesting visit. Well worth some time
"Central Market of Adelaide is truly a place of action; while you can either be involved or sit back and soak in . Connected to China Town on Gouger St, renowned for its many  restaurants and cuisines  ..."
Coming from Darwin we were delighted at the array and choice of fruit and veg - bought some mangosteins and they were perfect!!
This is the quintessential marketplace full of vendors ranging from fruits to bakery items to meats to restaurants. Be sure to visit on a Friday when they stay open until 9pm instead of the usual 5pm close time!
We spent 8 days in Adelaide and visited the market several times.  There is a great variety of excellent fresh  available.  Recommend visiting.
"If you’re visiting Adelaide then a trip to the markets is something you really have to do. If you’re after fresh produce then you have to come to the markets. I’ve included some pictures of amazing fruit, veg etc  but the photos just don’t do them the justice they deserve. There is a huge choice of fresh vegetables, fruit, deli meats, cheese, bread, cakes, nuts and lots more. I come from the NT and we just don’t get this quality or variety. The colours, smells and choices can be quite overwhelming if you haven’t been here before. Take your time, talk to the amazing people who work here, ask them what they recommend.  They will tell you what’s best on the day. If you want good coffee, then you will be spoilt for choice, there are a lot of very good cafes and coffee stalls where you can buy everything related to coffee.The markets are also home to some amazing eateries, there are so many choices for either breakfast or lunch."
