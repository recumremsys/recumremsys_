"Reviewing this place is pretty hard, the park itself is very nice, it is on the outskirts of town in woodlands and you can easily spend an entire day there as it is massive! however, the cages for the animals are a bit of a mixed bag - the new section is lovely with clean and well-designed pens for the animals while some of the older sections are pretty horrifying, particularly, the brown and black bears looked thoroughly miserable exhibiting pacing behaviour and sitting around in their own filth. However, it is probably your best chance of seeing an Amur/Siberian tiger in Siberia and they have one or two snow leopards, an extensive collection of birds of prey and a very engaging polar bear with a cub. Unlike European zoos it also has rides and a dino park with animatronics, and you can feed some of the animals (although some of the guests were feeding animals that were not on that list!)"
"Currently the main attraction in town! Spacious, comfortable for both animals and visitors, lots of entertainment for kids. Located in a forest, with a big lake inside. An impressive and diverse array of animals/birds kept with great care both out- and in-doors. An item of pride for the locals!"
"Need 3 to 5 hours to walk all the places, very nice place to visit for a whole day! You may also visit Kids railroad nearby"
"Been there with 2 kids in July 2016. There are surely some zoos with larger space allocations for animals, and some of them looked a bit miserable - but maybe this was in the eye of the beholder? Anyway, the variety of animals in the zoo is impressive, and the kids also liked the dinosaur-themed exhibition (extra admission is required) and the various slides and rides (not cheap, but reasonable). The place would benefit from more maps at intersections, as it may be unclear where you are and where to go. Don't forget your bug spray if you go in the summer - mosquitoes and black flies will eat you alive if you don't."
"Open space, fresh air! Great place to visit with kids!"
"this place is great! It's out of the way, yet easily accessible by public transport, the grounds are so vast, you wouldn't be surprised to find out that you've been there all day and haven't seen everything yet! Food stands and summer cafes are dotted all around the place, serving excellent shashlyks and pirozhkis for surprisingly low prices. Take the kids and have a great time in Novosibirsk zoo!"
"Foresee half a day to visit this nice zoo. Nice collection of wild cats (lion, tiger, snow leopard, etc)."
It was a nice outing to go to the zoo. The cages for the animals could honestly be bigger. A lot of the animals were pacing up and down the small cage. Seemed like they were agitated or disturbed. That needs to be reconsidered definitely.Was lovely to be able to see the Liger :-)
This is a must see when visiting Novosibirsk in the summer.  One of the most impressive zoos I've ever seen.  Be sure to allow ample time.  It really takes several hours to see and enjoy everything!
"Nice vist for an afternoon, you will probably see wild animals never seen before, only here. got a change to see 2 white Siberian bears, and tigres - for me the main thing. others animals are to be seen as in any  other zoo. ah make suer to check out the house upside down your children will simply love"
"Being a local, I've been to the zoo many times and I enjoy it a lot. The zoo is very big and has a lot of animals, and should be admired first for its scientific and nature preserving roll and only then for its entertaining ability.Keep in mind that it's quite hard to see the entire zoo in one go, especially if you are going with kids: it's simply exhausting. I hope that this will be solved somehow in the future, perhaps with some sort of transportation within the park. However, even though I personally never went through the entire zoo in one visit, I always enjoyed watching animals in the half I got to see.Novosibirsk Zoo is not as interactive as some others zoo can get, which can result in one's experience to be described as 'dull', but then again, Novosibirsk Zoo is much more admired for the great variety and not for entertaining and interactive presentation of animals. So if you like watching animals as much as I do, you will have your fun. Animals are cute. Unless it's a hot day, most animals will be hiding then.When planning your route around the zoo, don't miss liger, the mix of tiger and lion exclusive to Novosibirsk Zoo, the snow leopard, the only cat that lives in the snow regions and also one of the least represented species in nature (less than 100, all of them in Russia's Dalny Vostok), and, of course, white bears: they are very playful and always super fun to watch (many visitors say that they feel like watching white bears is the only thing worth the ticket price in the entire zoo).To conclude, Novosibirsk Zoo certainly has its flaws, but it doesn't mean it's a bad place to visit. Well, it might, but not necesserary. In fact, I am certain you will have a lot of fun and enjoy your visit."
"Must visit. Have to be a little patient to see all the animals. I am against animals in zoos, but visited this one due to being highly recommended on various websites including TripAdvisor. I was not disappointed. Also, the zoo does work sincerely for conservation. Was lucky to catch a glimpse of the Liger as it came out only when lunch was delivered. I did see many animals which I never saw on Animal Planet or NatGeoWILD. Animals appeared healthy. Few of the cages were small, but most enclosures were large. African lions were not looking miserable in the cold (I visited in Mar2018, when even noon temperature was -1 or -2 Celsius) - of course, lions used to be found in southern Europe too (before they were exterminated there). These 2 facts imply that lions obviously tolerate cold temperatures. Moreover, the maned wolf (found in tropical South America ) looked quite comfortable in the cold. A very varied collection. Hence, must visit at least this in Novosibirsk, if you don't have time for anything else."
"I have been to the Novosibirsk zoo many times throughout my life.  This zoo has come very far, in terms of quality, from when it was first constructed.  The exhibits are numerous and the animals, from my perspective, seem to be quite content.  My personal favorite exhibit was the polar bear, who seemed to be basking in the attention from the crowd; it was performing corkscrews in the water and strutted gloriously before it's audience.  The food is quite good.  The food mainly consists of many shishkabab stands.  Thank you for taking the time to read this.  I would recommend this zoo for anyone's day out in Novosibirsk and especially if you have children or friends interested in animals and the wilderness.Also:  The children's train runs to the zoo, so if by any chance you have a desire to travel upon a traditional Russian railway system, take the opportunity to do so.Thank you! Enjoy the wonderful city of Novosibirsk; it is my favorite."
"The vast majority of the animals are kept in old fashioned metal cages, mostly that looked way too small for the animals needs. Having said that all the animals looked quite healthy and well enough fed.  There is a wide range of animals but somehow they never created any 'wow' factor."
"Went on a trip back in 2014 and this year was the second year visiting with family. Nothing much has changed, the animals are still amazing. Just this year we came at a time when most of the lions, and monkeys were not in their cages. The polar bears were out - Mum and baby playing, but Dad looked a bit depressed. Other than that there's a vast variety of animals, although you'll need plenty of time to walk and explore the grounds. Food kiosks around, but I'd recommend you bring your one water, sandwiches and snacks and have your own picnic. Favourite attraction about the trip was seeing a money that was luring tourists to give him bananas with one of his toys."
Being one or the only location in the world with new feline species. A lion mixed with a leopard for example.
"It seemed like the animals were in distress, shaking their heads back and forth pacing themselves up and down. Small cages? They should go to LA in the states and get a real understanding of what a zoo means. Throwing human food and rubbish into the polar bears enclosure making them do tricks is wrong. Its not a zoo its an awful circus."
