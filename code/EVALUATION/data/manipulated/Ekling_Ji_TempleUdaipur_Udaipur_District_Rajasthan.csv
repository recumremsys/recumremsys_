Neat and clean temple. The deity has a historical significance for the rulers of udaipur. Ask people who are there.. The idol near the bull outside the main temple enclosure explains the significance.
The old temple established by Maharajs of Mevar. Location is superb. Don't miss if you are planning to visit Nathdwara. 
"Visited the temple on the way back from Nathdwara. It is a very large, clean and historic temple - certainly worth a visit!!"
It is one of the best temple of Shivji I have visited . Felt positive vibes and peaceful here. Visited here my family and it was a good visit .
"Almost 5 centuries old, this is a small historical marvel hidden in the Aravalli hills. Within the temple there are 108 smaller temples. The temple is free from the touts, clean and organised. Do not miss the yummy fresh kachoris just outside the temple, the best the i had in Udaipur, beats the famous JMB by scores."
"This temple is situated about 20 kms outside Udaipur and is the personal temple of the Royal family of Mewar. It is opened for public darshan for a few hours starting at 10.30 am. Avoid Mondays as the Maharaja comes on Mondays for offering puja. For good darshan be there by about 10.15 and be the first to enter. It is a small temple and crowds are large. It has a beautiful Shivling and though a small temple the stone carvings on each stone are very DEEP and EXTREMELY BEAUTIFUL. A very peaceful temple, its a pleasure to visit this temple but one cannot stay too much time in this temple since it is small and crowds are moving."
Went towards the temple side for business and was happy to see it. Mostly people from Gujarat and rajasthan visit this temple. Temple open Timings are regulated. The outside Resturant’s serve hot and crisp mirchi vadas. Don’t miss them.
Eklingji is a old and royal family’s shiva temple. Avoid Monday’s due to crowds. Carvings are beautiful. I love the the sounds of drums here. Must eat mirchi bada in shops outs side temple gate.
"This is an ancient Siva temple situated 30 odd Kms from Udaipur . Maintained by the current King , it's a protected site and the deity in the form of 4 faced Sivalingam is still worshipped with devotion . The faces depict , Brahma, Vishnu ,Mahesh and Sun . Very powerful temple with elegant architecture depicting the Rajasthani style at those times . A must visit"
Black Stonne temple is said to be built in 8th Century. Visited this marvelous temple of Lord Shiva in December End of 2017. The temple is made up of Black and White stones. At places black stones are very cold and at the same time you find quite warm white stones on floor.Most of the are of temple is closed and is accessible only on MahaShivratri. But otherwise also the temple resembles the rich carving on stones and reminds strong architecture knowledge of that era.
This temple of Lord Shiva is built in a very large area and offers  very peaceful surroundings. Do attend the Aarti in the temple and enjoy the mirchi pakoda outside.
One of the loveliest temple architecture here.Do visit for some great scenic views of the temple. Loved the pakoras and tea outside the temple ;-)
The architecture of temple is beautiful . Lord shiva's idol is too good . Felt blessed and happy after visiting here .
The temple is beautifully constructed centuries ago but still in its shape and colour. Situated on the national highway before Udaipur not to be missed visiting and experiencing.
Ekling Ji temple is the personal temple of the Maharaja of Mewar and is very ancient. It is open only for very limited time and visit should be well planned. The temple is not usually crowded and is very good. Must visit.
"Ekling ji is diety of mewar. It is worshipped equally by all. It's a form of Lord shiva. The temple is clean , nice , calm . When in udaipur  pls pay a visit there and get blessings. Do check the timings of temple before going."
We went there in the morning at 6. there were barely 4-5 other devotees. The temple architecture is simply breathtaking. We went just in time to catch shivling abhishek taking place. It was beautiful.Must visit as part of Udaipur trip.P.S. Do check out temple timings and distance from your hotel before going.

"This temple is dedicated to the Lord Shiva, was built in the 13th century by Bappa Rawal. The current black stone idol is believed to have been placed there in the period between 1472 to 1509 by Maharana Raimal. The grand and magnificent temple perfectly executed, the 50 ft. high Shikhar of the temple has a circumference of 60 ft. The sanctum sanctorum has four doors in all the four directions, outside of each gate there is Nandi (bull) statue facing the idol.It has since been built and rebuilt many times. It is a temple complex with many temples within the precincts but the presiding deity is Lord Eklingji. Situated around 25 Kms outside Udaipur this temple belongs to the Maharana of Mewar and all the activities Performing of Poojas, festival celebrations are done on behalf of the Maharanas. The Maharana performs the pooja personally with his family once every month. The Maharana's ruled Mewar kingdom as the representative with the Lord Eklingji. Hence they are not called as Maharaja's unlike in other erstwhile kingdoms. Photograpy is not allowed but the darshan was orderly and quick despite the heavy rush of people. The temple opens at 0430 hrs and closes at 0700 to reopen at 1030 hrs till closure at 1300 hrs. The evening Darshan is between 1730 hrs to 1900 hrs."
Eklingji temple is very big temple god shiva.Inside small goddess also there.like lakshiminarayana .we feel very happy to visit that temple and also enjoing by seeing harathy darsan . Do everybody to visit that temple
An utmost religious and pious Temple. Situated on a hill between Nathdwara and Udaipur. This place is a must visit. Read the history of this Temple.
Similar to Khajuraho - though much smaller -  this is a very enjoyable temple to visit.   Doesn't take long - it's small - and most of the faces of the deities were hammered off by the Mughul invaders so it's not as photogenic.  Worth a visit
"Keeping aside the religious angle, this temple is an architectural masterpiece. A collection of 108 small temples, ekling had the most amazing stonework and stone carving. If one does pay attention to the detail of the stonework here, one is like to really get blown away. Being close to Udaipur I strongly recommend that those interested in history, architecture and mythology take this short trip. Really worth a visit."
Dedicated to lord shiva also known as Ekling ji . It is the chief deity of Mewar dynasty till now the king of udaipur gives patronage to this temple. Some of the paintings in the sanctorum of temple are fabolous and drawn long ago where different forms of Lord shiva can be seen.…
