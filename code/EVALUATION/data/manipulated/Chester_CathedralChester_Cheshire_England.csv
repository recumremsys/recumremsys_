"Visited with my husband whilst on a city break. Entry was free and there were plenty of sanitisers and a one way system in place to ensure Covid safety. The toilets, shop and cafe were also open.  The cathedral is beautiful inside and out with gorgeous grounds and well worthy ofâ€¦"
Have visited a few cathedrals. This was free and lovely to walk round as part of visit to Chester but doesnt have the links some other famous cathedrals do so felt underwhelmed.
"Visiting Chester for the day and had to stop in at the Cathedral. Covid measures in place, so track and trace details were taken on arrival. Staff at entryway friendly and helpful. A beautiful building to walk around at leisure, taking photos and reading the various information. It was very strange seeing the cathedral with the pews removed as it makes you realise how vast the space actually is! A beautiful place, we spent around 30 minutes wandering around and then visited the cute gift shop."
I had only ever visited Chester Cathedral on school trips and for my university graduation. Decided to pop in on a Saturday afternoon and I was very pleasently surprised. I really enjoyed admiring the historic architecture and building techniques of the cathedral as well as the art which was exhibited inside. A really interesting place to go!
Really enjoyed our visit to this beautiful church. Felt quiet and peaceful. A must visit sort of place.
"Do not miss this if you're passing through Chester! Visited with my partner and young daugher and we had a fantastic time! The Cathedral is an amazing building which makes you stand and stare in absolute awe! The staff were all very friendly and helpful, and informed us of the hand sanitizer stations which were dotted around. Simply amazing building!"
"Free to visit, beautiful cathedral, fantastic stained glass. Dropped in whilst walking the city walls. Interesting newish detached bell tower. Impressive and peaceful."
We went here on 10/08/2020. Was lovely to walk about looking at all the old architecture and stained glass windows. There was no charge for entry but donations are appreciated. Covid precautions in place. Was a lovely way to spend a morning
"Looks majestic from the outside, not as impressive as some, but still, a pretty good looking Cathedral, we didnt visit it until after it closed, so werent able to look inside. For free, worth popping to have a look."
Went here whilst in chester to have a look at the cathedral. An amazing place with fantastic architecture. Easy to access and free. The current artist exhibition looked interesting as well. 
Loved our visit to the cathedral. Safe & sanitised. Really interesting building & faith building elements were encouraging too.
Good place to go to cool down.  The building is beautiful and the staff have done everything to ensure it was safeWhilst we were there there was an art exhibition.  Loved the Lego miniature on the cathedral.
"Beautiful building, totally awe inspiring.  Donations requested, but totally worth giving generously; friendly staff and track and trace in place.  Loved it, spent a good couple of hours wandering around and will definitely return."
"Was a lovely visit. The architecture was stunning and although I'm not a religious person, I love visiting cathedrals and taking in the sights. Free entry with donations accepted. A must visit if visiting Chester."
"OK I've been to a lot of British cathedrals,  but this one hits the ornate button. The organ is something special as are the choirs pews, the floor  the roof, the history... think you get it. Staff on the money with Covid-19 mitigating measures. Felt perfectly safe. The food in the cafe was excellent and the gift shop tasteful."
"Visited July 2019 - Large Cathedral situated in the centre of Chester, it is a magnificent building and well worth the visit for anyone on a day trip or city break. Centuries of history under one roof. Visited on a Tuesday afternoon with plenty of visitors. Among the attractions inside include the gardens, wishing well fountain and a scale model of the Cathedral in Lego. Also a gift shop at the end. Highly recommended."
