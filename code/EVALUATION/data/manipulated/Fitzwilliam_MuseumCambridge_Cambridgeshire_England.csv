"The building is very fine both inside and out. Booking a free timed entry online is easy and the staff are good at explaining how they are dealing with Covid. We went to the top and worked down with one of the best exhibits being in the 1st room; they had some old artworks and then examples of the work done by students studying painting techniques - the skill displayed is superb. There are plenty of very fine paintings from many different eras and far better than you expect from a museum outside London. There are old timepieces, furniture, porcelain and ancient artefacts including some excellent pieces from Egypt. We ran out of time and after a while you tend to get overloaded so we will be coming back again."
The decoration of the entrance hall is stunning and the painting collection on the first floor well worth the visit by itself. Saw some wonderful pictures by Sir Stanley Spencer
"Located in an impressive building, this is a free museum. Really helpful staff, with maps in multiple languages. Cost racks free to use. Larger bags can be safely stored away too. There are fold away stools around the museum which you can take to rest on to look round- it's a big place!Really interesting to look round- art, Greeks, Roman's, Egyptians to name but a few of the  amazing relics to look at. Great shop too!Definitely worth a visit whilst in Cambridge"
I love this Museum!! You can spend half day inside this museum and Free(I highly recommend to donate money). Make sure you enter from main entrance and see beautiful stairs.Walk upstairs and visit gallery 3 which just finished renovation and make sure you look ceiling as well.
"This is a very strong regional museum with a good range of galleries and a must-do for Cambridge.  Amongst others the Ancient Egyptian collection is important including a range of material from Predynastic to Roman including part of the sarcophagus of Ramesses III.  The galleries are well-displayed but it would be good to give this important material a bit more space, some items are quite high up.  Photography is permitted without flash.  Try to avoid school group timing, toilets at both ends of museum, lockers available, cafe may be best avoided (see separate review)."
"There is a bit of everything here. A lovely place to spend a day. Cafe was very good (covid safe). Loved the Egyptian section, and the items from Cyprus. Very well displayed."
"Immaculately kept, Variety of Collection, Not excessively crowded and.... free! The museum captivates you as soon as you walk up to the main entrance. Visited twice in a week! Must go. Leave a generous donation!"
"Visited on a Saturday morning. Ticket booking in advance was easy, and ensured the museum maintained a good capacity. There were one way arrows on the floor to help maintain social distancing. Great way to spend a couple of hours in Cambridge for free."
"Such a fantastic place to visit when in Cambridge. It never fails to stun with the antiquities, exhibits and even the building itself. Lose yourself for an afternoon."
"Visited on a Wednesday morning at 10.00. The museum was lovely and quiet with no queues and friendly staff. We had visited the Uffizi in Florence a couple of months back, and can say with absolute confidence that we enjoyed the Fitzwilliam far more. The quality and display of the exhibits were top class and the lack of people meant we could enjoy the ambience and building at our own pace without feeling under pressure. A far cry from being treated like cattle at the Uffizi. Forget Florence and visit Cambridge to experience this hidden gem and the treasures it contain"
"I think many reviews over rate this museum.  Yes it is definitely worth a visit and the short walk from the city centre.  Its collection is also both interesting and varied but this museum is not in the same league as The Ashmolean (Oxford) or Birmingham City Museum for museums outside London.  To be fair to the Fitzwilliam it is better than average for such museums - good but  not 'very good'.It holds a very good collection of armour and extensive ceramics, including many 20th century examples.  The Art Collection too is rewarding with a number of significant British and European pieces by major artists.  The relatively small Egyptian, Greek and Roman collection of artefacts are also of interest.  The small Medieval collection was my highlight with some lovely illuminated manuscripts and other pieces in a well presented display. However, the material is not always well presented and would be improved with more information and narrative.  Many pieces and works assume that the visitor brings quite extensive knowledge with them and the museum does not seek to 'fill in the gaps' to ensure the history, relevance and background are clear and accessible.  There is a need for secondary narrative.  Saying a piece is from the Second Kingdom without further explanation is not as helpful as it could be.  Saying a painting shows a particular scene from classical myth or 'history' would be more engaging if a brief explanation of the event were added.  The museum would benefit from investing time, rather than a lot of money, improving the accessibility of its collection to  general visitors.The cafe and shop are very good with a choice of drink, snacks and purchases available.  There are a number of other cafes and places to eat nearby."
Great exhibits from old masters to school children's work with lots of free information alongside. Innovative clear displays without over crowding the space available. The people on room duty were very helpful and informative. Building is a bit of a maze - Way Out signs a bit like a Las Vegas casino in that they were sparse!! Enjoyed the visit and the cafe/shop always is good value.
Easy walk from the colleges. Beautiful building and not too big to see everything. Loved the entrance stairs and ceiling. A must see in Cambridge.
This is the best free museum I think I have ever been to. Took the boys recently and it kept a 15 year old and 11 year old enthralled.
Some great archaeological finds and lovely paintings and ceramics to be enjoyed in a range of galleries. Greta shop and restaurant. Interesting story about the visitor who managed to smash some Chinese vases after tripping on the stairs during a visit. They were worth over half a million!!! Pieced back together again they are now out of reach.
"Open to public “ free” but leave a donation.  A brilliant collection, something for everyone; artifacts 3,000 years old, delicate porcelain artwork, old currency money, horses & knights, armor, weapons, huge painting, architecture.  Could easily spend 3-4 hours there."
"I very enjoyed the visit of this museum because you could see everything there. It is not only a museum of applied art but also of sculptures or pottery. The epochs of the works and their origins are also varied. The architecture is beautiful! Don’t hesitate to look in the area because the ceilings are worth it! However, I will not recommend this museum to young children because the visit is long and not interactive enough."
Loved this place. Manageable size and very complete and interesting exhibits.  The porcelain exhibit was amazing...and if you go ask about the three large vases..I found the staff exceptionally knowledgeable and helpful.  And its free!
Impressed with what they have for children. I'm glad that they are inclusive. Portraits and artefacts going back thousands of years and entry is free! Amazing
"Set in Cambridge in a stunning building, (the mosaic floors and stunning staircases and ceilings are beautiful), this Free to enter, (a £5 donation is 'suggested'), museum is great for any lover of collectables and fine art from around the world throughout the ages.  My favourite gallery was the one with original Monet's in, great to see these famous paintings in person.  There was also some interesting armoury, original etchings by Rembrandt and collections of some ancient pottery.  There is a cafe, gift shop, toilets and baby changing facilities, a bag check, lockers and audio guides.  Worth a visit even if for the stunning interior and exterior of the museum building."
"Do not miss this amazing (and free) museum. Schedule plenty of  time because the collection is massive! It's a beautiful building, too, well worth seeing. Pop across the street to Brown's afterwards, the site of the old Addenbrooke's Hospital."
"Had only enough time for a short visit but I was so pleased I made the effort as the collections are absolutely stunning. For me the highlights were the Egyptian gallery, the Mesopotamian reliefs, and the artworks produced by Monet, Gainsborough, Hogarth and Gainsborough. Free entry and staff were very helpful. Rembrandt exhibit was ok but much preferred the permanent galleries. Highly recommended!"
Wonderful museum to kill a few hours as there's so much to see.  Free to get in though it's worth leaving a generous contribution for the upkeep of this lovely building.  Very well kept with a wonderful marble staircase.  Loved the Whistler exhibition.  Good café and shop.
"Visited today and what a great place. They have a large amount of collections from many different periods of history and from all over the world. The amount of paintings they have is amazing. Make sure to visit the Greek section as they have some impressive pieces in there and golden ceiling with statues around the outside is outstanding. Younger children may find it a bit boring though. The COVID guidelines are being well managed also, face masks must be worn, one way system in place and hand sanitizer everywhere. The 2 ladies on reception this morning where brilliant and very informative."
"Spent about 3 hours here while on a business trip.  Think of it as a manageable British Museum with art as well.  Very good, but not overly detailed, descriptions of the items on display.  No big crowds to deal with, and you get to see a wide range of different things without needing to spend 2-3 days."
"This famous museum never fails to capture the imagination!  Have visted it several times but always see something we previously  missed.Admission is free, and the great staircase of the main entry hall always captures a spirit of grandeur however many times one visits!   Thoroughly recommend a visit to anyone, it is  right in the City centre with a extremely imposing palatial facade along side Kings Parade & city bus stop right outside."
"I read some deeply rubbish one line reviews here saying this place is not worth visiting and I assumed that I will be done visiting everything in under 30min.  How wrong was I?  This place is simply amazing and I highly recommend it as it should be the first place to visit in Cambridge and one day is not enough to see everything:- this museum is located on the southern part of the road packed with colleges (the name of the road changes 3 times) and at this moment in time the entrance is not via the main building as they are doing some restoring work, so you have to take the side entrance- the entry is free and you can make small donations if you wish so plus take a map of the building showing you what to see- spread on 2 floors at this moment in time, this is an amazing Aladdin's cave with items stuck so densely, plus unique items I have never seen or knew existed!!!!- a section dedicated to paintings on the first floor, with Canaletto, Rubens, Rembrandt, Cezanne, Monet etc- lots of medieval armoury as well as Persian, Ottoman etc; daggers, swords etc- several sarcophagus in their Ancient Egypt section together with smaller items- some unique China I have never seen anywhere before, some reminding me of the Habsburg porcelain in Vienna.  Simply stunning British made China!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  which I have never seen anywhere before and I never thought they existed- lots of pottery dating back to the early centuries of of the first millennium or even BC- lots of Chinese, Japanese, Indian pottery- Greek and Roman sculptures etc- you can take pictures but cannot film unfortunately- I had a peek at the ceiling from the main building and it looked simply amazing; once the renovation will be finished I am sure the entrance is going to look stunning- the staff is also very friendly; by comparison how stuck up and nasty the staff in London museums come across as they bark they 'orders' at visitorsJust refreshing, I found this place clean cut with also a great cafe, shops and toilets on the lower ground.  If I was a local probably I would spend hours every weekend here.  Do not miss it."
Had a fabulous visit to the museum on Tuesday 3 September. Wonderful collections. However the scones in the courtyard cafe were rock hard. How many times had they been frozen and thawed I wonder? Simply the worst scones ever! Bad practice and just not acceptable.
"This is a very interesting museum founded more than 200 years ago with a broad range of exhibits. Having recently visited China, we were interested in seeing the Chinese collection and consolidating our understanding of development from the Shang to the Qing dynasty. Most of the Chinese is on room and is largely set out chronologically with some anomalies in organisation. Nevertheless the compactness of the collection is helpful - there are probably only around 200 objects  on display which is quite helpful in terms of not getting lost in the detail."
"Its paintings are the least of this museum with many artifacts in it. Note, however, the wonderful Stanley Spensers."
"This is one the aspects of England I love: Free museums.  This activity I recommend after eating lunch. To walk around and digest the food because it requires time. It is an interesting museum,. one of the few that I visited. It reminded me of Victoria & Albert museum in London. Even though Albert museum has a vast collection, the similarities were striking. We enjoyed the time noticing various collections. Take the time to visit this place and enjoy!"
Spent a marvellous 2 hours in the Museum spending time in the basement with the Egyptian mummies etc and the many artefacts from all over the world. Lots of items held from Iran. Fine china and pottery room is exceptional. Great galleries of pictures and they hold pre- raphaelite and impressionist from many of the great artists.All free too and without the large crowds often experienced in London. A true gem!
"Visited for the first time and loved it! One of the best museums Cambridge has to offer, and the best part: it's free 😁"
Once inside you have the   breathtaking view of a vast lobby of a country house with a sweeping marble staircase.adorned with classical statues and   works of art. No you have not entered the   wrong building this is the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge. Allow plenty of time for there is much to see. A cafe on the ground floor canbe a good start! Maps available and are useful guides to  what to see. Whichever entrance you use you are in fora fascinating experience. Disabled access.
"Despite Corona rules this was a wonderful morning spent at this FREE Museum.An amazing collection covering every area of the world, art and cultural gems from every age. Leave time to make sure you see as much as you can."
