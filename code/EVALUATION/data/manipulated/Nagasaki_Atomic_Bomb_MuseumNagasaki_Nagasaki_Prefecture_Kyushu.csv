"Comprehensive presentation of the atomic bombing and it's aftermath with multimedia and static exhibits. Quite graphic in a couple of places but not gratuitously so, merely factual. Stands as a memorial and hopefully a deterrent."
"Visited with colleagues in October.  What  an overwhelming exoerience. Seeing all the death and destruction created by the bomb in just few seconds. , the after effects felt by people to this day..... It makes you chill to your bones. Spending few hours in the museum is highly recommended and also that you read the plaques , description on exhibits and the video clips."
"We take all our visitors here.  Tells the story leading up to the blast, with an ominously ticking clock.  Tells the story after the blast, or course from the Japanese perspective.  They think the war would have ended anyway within a few months.  Not mentioned is the possibility that there might have been a land war in Japan.  Expect to have strong feelings.  A great museum."
"Very well designed museum. Moving without too much gory details.Helps put in perspective the bombing, its rational and the effects on Nagasaki"
"This was a very interesting and sobering exhibition on the dropping of the Atomic Bomb with many gruesome photos. It was laid out in a factual way with real artifacts from the time. I learned much about the event that i didn`t previously know.  However I didn`t see any information which explained the events that happened in the years prior the the decision to drop the bomb.It is good to hear that Japanese children are learning about tolerance and living in peace, and they are encouraging this to be a worldwide initiative. Lets hope we all can benefit from this teaching in the future."
"Sobering , well done. Flows well. Doesn't glamorize any aspect of war and the presentation was politically neutral as could be done."
Fascinating exhibits and very impartial. It was done in such a way that the horror of nuclear war didn’t feel gory to read about but factual and respectful. Loved all the colourful paper cranes. A must do when in Nagasaki.
We are a family of four that recently visited the Atomic bomb museum. Having to read or listen to the English and Korean versions of the displays take quite a bit of time and our 4 and 5 year olds lacked the patience to get through the entire museum without becoming antsy. The hands on displays were entertaining for the moment but I suggest that you bring something else to occupy children if you really want to see everything the museum has to offer. The museum is very quiet and may be difficult for little ones to understand why that is so. The detail and care that the museum took to put all of the displays together is well worth the money and helps to better understand the events that took place in history.
"A must visit when in Nagasaki. Good explanations, visual displays and artifacts on display which memorize the horrific impacts of the Nagasaki nuclear bombing. Missing, understandably from a Nagasaki perspective, is the role of Japan in WWII."
"Not as informative as Hiroshima's atomic museum. But since it is a history that every human being should not forget, still worth a visit. The museum is on the hill. Take taxi if you go with elderly."
"to see the artifacts and how the people came together to help in such devastation. to see shadows in concrete of human remains. and the burnt bodies. was in hiroshima the year before and the affects on those lives as well. a strong christian faith is evident in nagasaki, that i believe helped the people overcome such a tragedy. gives me a new perspective as i hope it does in the world. never again another nagasaki or hiroshima."
"Visited this museum on a cruise port stop primarily to compare it to the Atomic Bomb museum in Hiroshima.  Although this museum does not have as many historical photos and graphic displays as Hiroshima, it provides a truer history of the Japanese involvement in WWII.  I was very disturbed by the Hiroshima museum's historical writeup about how Japan went into China to ""help"" the Chinese as it's an attempt to hide the historical fact that it was an invasion and attempt to take over China.  At least in the Nagasaki museum, there were at least a couple of displays using the terms ""invasion"" in describing the Japanese presence in China during WWII.  The museum also provided an inside look at what the U.S. was planning and why Nagasaki was bombed as an atomic target.  I highly recommend visitors interested in the atomic bombed cities to visit both museums to make their own comparison and judgments on how history could be manipulated..."
I’ve been to Hiroshima and this one in Nagasaki May not be as big and explicit but the idea of it all still strikes home. Be ready to walk uphill though. The hyper center is also located below which means you have to go up the stairs again.
"I knew this would be a confronting Museum and so it was.Haunting and so sad, the cost of the atomic bomb must not ever be forgotten. This museum is critical to ensure we dont forget what the city and people of Nagasaki endured.Compelling, achingly real and heartbreaking.Expect to be touched. Expect to remember this place."
"The atomic museum is the must go destination in Nagasaki. To see and experience second hand from survivor testimony of the A bomb blast is something that we all should experience. The major part of the museum centres on the bomb, the science of the bomb and most importantly the impact it had on Nagasaki. Being picky here but there is not enough information on the build up and decisions made to detonate the bomb... but maybe that is all difficult territory to explore. So read up before and discuss afterwards."
Visiting museum we know what happened exactly when the atomic bomb was dropped in August 1945. It was disaster for the people.
"Thoroughly enjoyed the museum visit, which can be accomplished in about 2 hours even with the Peace Park next door thrown in. There’s a QR code inside the museum which allows you to access an audio guide from your mobile phone. Had expected the visit to leave me terribly sad but displays were well curated and educational without being overly emotional."
The place is well designed with lots of information for tourists. Learnt a lot about the bombing of Nagasaki. Some of the pics are sad to look at with victims charred and burnt by intense heat and flash of fire.
"Educational, a jolting reminder of the importance of working at keeping peace.  Do visit the free remembrance hall next to the museum as well."
Makes you wonder how anyone could have done this? Moving and thought provking place you must visit if you are in the area.
"Let me start by mentioning the terrible fate of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, no 'but' on my side. However, the thing that totally offends me is the fact that in the museum there is (to the best of my knowledge) zero reference to the reason why these bombs were dropped. The atrocities of the Japanese in Manchuria, Korea and the rest of southeast Asia are not mentioned. For this reason I consider this museum a missed chance."
"Museums should be informed by the story of history, not partial history; advancing some great points while ignoring other essential points.  This is about the end of a war . . . an ending in horror for the nation Japan.  This ending is not presented objectively.  I get it that this is Japan so some tilt in the presentation is to be expected.  Yet the display says the bombs were dropped to save the lives of American soldiers.  This is true.  But it is just part of the truth.  Other nations’ lives stood to be saved, including, yes, Japanese. So the Japanese lives lost due to the atomic bombs were not in isolation.  Had the war continued conventionally, Japan was ready to continue the fight sacrificing many thousands of its own people.  How those lives would have added up, one battle at a time, we will never know.  But it is not totally unreasonable to imagine that more Japanese lives would have also been lost than those lost in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  As for the allies Americans were not fighting alone.  You would not know this from the displays here.  This was not a Japan-versus-the-United-States war, it was a World War.  Allies active in the Pacific theater also included Philippines, China, United Kingdom, India, Burma, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and others.  They all stood to sacrifice lives had the war continued.  There is nothing here suggesting why a then-belligerent Japan was fighting in the first place.  As this is a Japanese memorial mostly for the Japanese people, not visitors; perhaps they know their own history so thoroughly, the origins of the war go without saying.  For similar memorials in the US, I’m confident our own young people are not that informed of this history.  If you are interested in how a culture displays its own history, this might be a good visit.  Otherwise, you may also be disappointed."
"Having visited Hiroshima 2 years prior, this filled the missing pieces of the history jigsaw. I have been to many war museums and this one is very well organised and diplomatic. Strongly recommend a visit if in the area, be wary if it is hot!!"
"Was a very heartwrenching experience, reading about the peaceful days of Nagasaki and suddenly so many innocent lives lost in just that few minutes. So many young children, kids in school, parents at home ...The pictures say so much about the very sad impact that wars have on humankind."
Very sombre exhibit - be prepared. Reminds you why revenge war is never good although I sense there's a bit of downplay of the root cause of this -  the Japanese invasion into southeast asia. Well maintained museum with a good part of the exhibits neatly translated. The last part of the exhibit about US's role on making the atomic bomb is mainly in Japanese when 90% of the exhibits are well translated in English - wonder what they don't want foreigners to read. Wish they could have ended the exhibition by acknowledging the wrongs of the Jap invasion and how innocent citizen lives are made to pay for the price of the invasion. The very last photo of the young boy was simply heart breaking.
"Having been on a walking tour around Nagasaki and listened to the stories of the atomic bomb, we visited the museum and the whole experience was very sobering. There were some very good visual aids showing the effects on the surrounding area in the moments, days and weeks after the bomb.It is just to hard to describe the detail which the museum contains and it is definitely somewhere everyone should visit.One overriding memory is that after walking through all the displays showing the devastating effects of the bomb, there is then a display showing which countries still have nuclear bombs, how many they have and how often they carry out tests,It really must never happen again."
A really thoughtful presentation of a horrible atrocity.  Well laid out and very informative. It’s really a must see if in the area. Allow a couple of hours to see it all plus the park. Very sobering.
"I've been to both atomic bomb museums in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. You can't really compare the two but in my opinion the Hiroshima museum has more impact. Nonetheless, this one is sobering and leaves you at a loss for words. Be it the displays of ceramic roof tiles that bubbled and melted in the 3500c blast heat or the human bones that are embedded in a molten glass bottle, the museum does a good job of illustrating that this famous event, one that we have all read about, is really a tragedy that has a huge human element to it, one that you cannot truly appreciate unless you see it with your own eyes. The atomic bomb drop is a defining point in the history of this city, if you are going to visit Nagasaki then you owe it to yourself to visit this museum. Entrance is only ¥200."
"Stopped here on a tour from our cruise ship, and glad we did. I never realized that The three potential targets for a second bomb were Kokura, Kyoto and Niigata, in that order. But the day they bombed these sites were clouded in and could not be found. The plane circled a few times and couldn't see anything, then through the clouds they spotted Nagasaki and decided to drop the bomb there. So basically those people were very unlucky. Much to my surprise, the people there are very friendly towards Americans!"
Learnt about the impact of atomic bomb on Nagasaki. Paid 157 Yen for English audio set which was helpful. Entrance fee is 200 Yen and you can go up to the roof to see the actual site where the bomb was dropped. Highly recommended if you are in Nagasaki.
Explored the place with the kids and we all learnt a lot about the bomb that hit Nagasaki. Hope the kids remember the stories!
"Predictably you come away with a profound melancholy despite a certain lack of balance in how the story is told. Have never understood how the second bomb was justified (except by an inhumane desire to compare uranium and plutonium variants). But had forgotten Nagasaki was a secondary target with little strategic value, especially compared to Kokura, the prime target. And how only a momentary break in the cloud permitted the eventual drop. All that said the storyboards and the videos have precious little to say about the inhumanity which gave weight to proponents of the weapon’s use. Visitors from the Philippines and Korea with engrained family lore to factor in may find the presentation wanting."
Went as part Inspiring Vacations tour.WHAT AN EYE OPENER! the devastation that occurred with this event was extremely well portrayed in fine detail.Well worth the visit
"I found this museum to be very honest and informative, blending politics, facts, humanity and artifacts tastefully and honorably.  I would recommend getting the audio guide. There is quite a lot you can read depending on time you want to spend your interest level,but please take time to read all the exhibit info you can.  English was common among the written narratives, but can't say what other languages there were.  I learned quite a lot & was touched.  The origami tributes/prayers that are throughout are beautiful and meaningful.  The museum layout allowed for easy comfortable viewing with lots of ""elbow room"".  The air conditioning was great & appreciated in July!!  Be sure to go to the hypocenter park as well as the remembrance park adjacent."
"Having visited Hiroshima as well, there’s more of a sense of anger here- and the human cost of the bomb seems even more stark (although more died at Hiroshima). It was almost accidental that Nagasaki was bombed - whilst it was on the original long list of 17 targets - it wasn’t on the short list (which included Hiroshima and Kyoto), and it seems to have been added a potential second target to Hiroshima at the very last minute (just scrawled, in hand, on the strike order). Whereas the attack on Hiroshima was well planned and strategic, even General Leslie Groves, the head of the Manhattan Project (described as a micro-manager) years later couldn’t figure out when and why Nagasaki was selected, especially as it held a POW camp.Even on the day of the bombing it was the secondary target. The attack on the first target, Kokura, was abandoned due to ‘fog’ (although it could’ve been due to the smoke caused by the allied bombing of Yawata the previous day) and the attack on Nagasaki was almost abandoned due to real fog. The plane, the Bockscar, (most people seem to know the name of the plane that bombed Hiroshima- the Enola Gay- but not the one that bombed Nagasaki), was almost on its last dregs of fuel, when a gap in the cloud opened- and they dropped Fat Man. It didn’t even hit its intended target- the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works- but instead it hit the centre of the city- the bit where all the maps show the schools were. As the museum also shows, the Japanese government were about to surrender after the bombing of Hiroshima, the subsequent bombing of Nagasaki almost seems an after-thought- except for for thousands of people wiped out, due to the scrawled, hand-written, change to the final strike order."
