Was surprised that the Winter Gardens were open when I visited to see the CRUCIBLE. So went in after asking the staff member on duty if it was OK. Spent about 30 minutes  inside looking at the various displays of palms and exotic trees. Surprised how tall they were. Unfortunately the eateries and cafes were all shut. Took a few photos  while there.
"Went to the winter garden with my grandsons during the school holidays and we enjoyed our visit, the garden itself is fabulous and one of my grandchildren couldn't believe the plants were real, they had to touch them to see, the colours and care taken to look after them is great, we visited the museum and we loved the artist showroom with the different effects on the floor, good food and drink available, good place to sit and read, and warm. What's not to like"
Walked through on our way back to the hotel. The structure of this buildings is very interesting and the plants inside are lovely. Some of the shops/cafes around the edge looked a little ‘sad’ but I was interested in the plants and not the shopping. A very nice thing to have in the centre of a city
"Came to Sheffield specifically to find and visit this place. I knew where it was rougly located, but it still took a while to find it. Did not see a single signpost for it, or anything else either, for that matter. Nice, bright, clean and airy inside. Several exhibitions on at the moment and expressions of Sheffield life, past and present.It is small, but it's well maintained and clean throughout.I enjoyed my little visit.See photos."
"Nipped in before going to the theatre. What a beautiful and calm space, so important in busy cities. Plenty of seating to enjoy the atmosphere and great things for children to look at. A real sense of Sheffield pride is evident."
Didn’t even know this existed until my recent visit. Beaut location even in the dark Lots of bars and restaurants around the area to enjoy the views Clean and tidy inside like stepping into the tropics. Lots of lovely plants and tress like going into a jungle
Lovely little place. You go in and where the crucible theatre is and come out where the restaurants are. Ideal place to simple wined down and have a cuppa or read a book. Doesn't cost anything to enter.
"We came upon this by accident when looking for the art gallery and museum (which are across the road ).  Wonderful tropical plants and a nice calming atmosphere away from the hustle and bustle of the  nearby shops.  Includes an adjacent gallery of its own and of course the ubiquitous gift shop, but a nice spot to while away a few minutes, or even hours."
"I was quite impressed by the winter gardens.  Inside gardens with exotic plants. Seating all around. There is a café, gift shop and small individual art galleries inside. All free of charge."
"Popped in to the gardens for a quiet 5 minutes whilst the Christmas ma4ket was on all around it. A lovely calm  space with access to little shops, cafes and a gallery. Lovely!"
Visited last week with some friends. Was really surprised to find this in the middle of town. A very nice setting.
"We visited the gardens as they were next to our hotel and a restaurant we booked overlooked the gardens, which were beautiful. We chatted over lunch and decided to visit on our way to see the snooker at the Crucible opposite, when we saw a few snooker stars walking past and realised that this was the place the snooker stars were interviewed on the tv. We went in and saw cafe's and places to sit and lots of beautiful plants. It was busy but serene and a calming place. We had a walk round before watching the televised snooker interviews and star spotting, Tho this place is beautiful without the snooker hype. Looking forward to going again on our next visit to Sheffield."
"Loved it! Lots of NZ native plants, made me smile as i was visiting from my new home ( NZ) . Really peaceful, loved the small galleries etc in there too.Well done sheffield!"
"I was exploring this area of downtown on my own one afternoon in September.  There was a brisk wind and the temp was 63' that day. Coming from Florida, it felt very chilly and I appreciated the jacket I brought with me. The Winter Garden was a wonderful place to seek a reprieve and rest on a bench.  I enjoyed the mobile adjacent to my bench.  The greenery provided a restful pick me up.  I encountered a fat pigeon with a right foot amputation.  I marveled at nature's adaptation with the callous formation on his stump and how well he navigated with just a slight limp.  It didn't seem to slow him down at all. I imagined from his girth that lots of visitors gave him tasty morsels. I met a shopkeeper of a kiosk walk-in booth that was utterly charming. She introduced me to her elderly dad and we talked politics amicably for a good quarter hour.  The educational displays in the adjoining rooms were interesting.  Best part--it's FREE!"
"The winter garden is housed in a lovely modern glass building. It’s not massive but it’s clear see a lot of effort has gone into the design. The building a lot houses a nice modern gallery, cafe, toilets and shop. Big plus, the garden and galleries are free. Walking out one side takes you the side of the town hall, a lovely area of fountains and water displays which was very popular with families and people just enjoying the afternoon sun. Plenty of restaurants surrounding the area."
Found a pop up shop with gorgeous items to buy for cmas presents. Took some lovely photos and had a great coffee
"Our group walked through the winter gardens sbout 10.30 on a nippy Monday morning. There were several groups of young school children, very excited at their adventure. The planting is fabulous, giving a real sense of the exotic in this northern university city. It feels like a welcoming friendly place. Nice atmosphere and spacious enough for gatherings. We took several photos here and I understand many people come especially to see the elephant signed by........??? Look it up! It’s a real tourist attraction in its own right."
Been a few times the gardens are brilliant all year round. It is becoming the place for wedding photography. Inside here are a few shops and access to the museum. Currently the shops are Sheffield makers which sells hand made goods made here in Sheffield cards badges prints magnets and other goods. There is a cafe next to with a seating area under the branches of the trees  and views across the square to the crucible. The gardens are used when the bbc arrive late March early April for the snooker with the presenters doing analysis from the gardens. The gardens are also used as a  starting point for a city centre walking tour.  Just one thing to note the gardens does not have parking of its own. On street disabled parking is just outside but do not use any of the nearby loading bays even with your blue badge you will get a ticket.
Restful area to walk through. We. Had a fantastic serenade from a young Opera company advertising a forth coming event.
Lovely exotic planting. Pleasant place to sit and people watch. Went on a Sunday so not overly busy. Good organic cafe was open with excellent food  and a nice craft pop up shop. A great modern high vaulted glasshouse. What a good idea in the he heart of a city. Clean and well maintained. A little warm but on a very hot summer’s day.
"Visiting Sheffield for the day, I wandered through with friends and found the gardens to be peaceful and a total escape from the surrounding city. A really nice feature, and a place to stop and slow down. I wish my home city, Leicester, had something similar."
We visited a lunch time and it was obviously a haven for locals looking for a quiet spot to eat. Loved the physical structure but felt that the planting was a bit tired in places.
Nice area for a chill out. Visited at lunchtime and it was obvious that it was used by people as a lunchtime break area. Nice
"Staying at the adjacent Mercure it made sense to take in the winter gardens. Open, light and airy this is an attractive public space, enclosed from the elements. It contains some stunning species and attractive artworks. There is seating and a small café. Wish I'd had longer and a little more sun."
"Went in here for a coffee. There’s a nice independent coffee place in there. It’s a stunning building and the plants are spectacular, creating a peaceful little oasis in the city centre. There’s access to the museum (worth a visit) and there’s a great independent shop next to the coffee place selling locally made products. A lovely glasshouse in the heart of the city. If you’re in Sheffield it’s worth popping in."
"A nicely laid out and well kept attraction. It offers the opportunity to visit some nice exhibitions. We were quite taken with the cutlery exhibits. A nice insight into Sheffield’s industry. Go, you’all not be disappointed"
Loved the architecture and the lay out. Lovely place to relax and chill out - especially if it is raining as it was when we were there.
Had a packed lunch here and enjoyed lovely surroundings. Interesting plants and sculpture. Nice break from the rain
Relaxing place with a great atmosphere in the heart of the steel city. Beautiful in every season :) :)
Was heavy rain and around 10am so decided to walk up here. Really nice place. Great plants/ trees on the other side theres a cafe. Bit expensive. But thats the money side. I just sad down on a free bench and relaxed and people watched. Nice place. But should bring back the hole in the road.
"Having lived in Sheffield for around 15 years, I usually make a point of visiting the Winter Gardens every time I'm in the city centre. It's a beautiful, peaceful indoor garden right in the heart of the city centre and is a great place to go for a moment's peace in the middle of a busy day or to eat lunch. I love looking at all the unusual plants there and the occasional art displays. There is also a cafe so it's a good place to meet friends for a coffee."
"Sheffield have done a great job bringing nature into the town centre. It's right next to the crucible theatre. During the snooker weeks the BBC use the hall for interviews and practice tables. Inside there are trees , plants and flowers. The tunnel is an  arched glass dome. Being glass it creates it's own heat and in the summer it's boiling hot with doors wide open."
Beautiful areaPerfect if you just want to relax. Connects onto the millennium galleries. Few independent shops and cafes inside which are cute.
Excellent enjoyed our visit with  no complaints. Relaxing clean and ltter free. Plenty of eating places catering for all diets. A  nice place to watch the world go by. Would recomend it for any one.
This lovely indoor garden offers a nice break from the cold and rainy outside.  It is even lovely to go into on a nice sunny and warm day.  The plants inside are beautiful to look at and if you want to know more about them there is plenty of information on what you see.  We were there and there was a nice choir singing and it sounded wonderful inside.  It is a nice place just around the corner from the peace gardens and just adds to the feeling of the whole area.  Don't miss this gardens if you have anytime in Sheffield.
