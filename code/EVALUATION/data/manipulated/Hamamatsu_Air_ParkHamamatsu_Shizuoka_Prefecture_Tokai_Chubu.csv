Do you like planes? The free museum has a massive collection of them that you can view free of charge. Look to your heart's content
"i had so much for here and i dont even really like plans much. its free entry, people there are so helpful and stored our bags. you get to wear fun suits and take pix in the planes! get there before 4pm when it closes. it was awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Don't be put off by other people's comments - this place can easily be reached by public bus for a fare of around 500 yen each way on bus number 51.  The bus trip takes about 20 minutes, and then you just walk 50m to the first corner, turn left, walk for about 15 minutes on this street until it ends in a T intersection and then you will see the Air Park right in front of you.  The entrance is about 200m to the left when you come to the T intersection.  The very helpful staff at the Hammamatsu tourist info will tell you all about it if you drop in.  That's located in the JR Railway station.The park itself was a bit disappointing for me.  We went first to the museum part and only then did we find the display hangar (which was much better).  All the simulator rides were booked out by 10am, so really it was a long trip for not much.  My husband is an aircraft nerd, and he enjoyed it.  I personally thought the Shinkansen museum in Nagoya was better."
No direct bus ride to the place you need to walk a bit but then its free . The are quite a few static aircraft on display which is nice . The best part is you can rent a pilot costume and actually go and sit in cockpit of a fighter plane !!. Get your pictures clicked . Helpful staff . Over-all good experince.
Following the reviews of the Air Park we made our way their by public transport. It was quite an effort dealing with the bus system and then trying to negotiate the walk from the bus stop to the Air Park in the absence of any signs in English. Upon arriving there we found the place closed because it always closes on the last Tuesday of the month as well as from Tuesday to Thursday in certain months of the year etc etc. If the Park is really on your agenda I would suggest that you contact  them before going out in  case it is the wrong time of the year.
"The Hamamatsu airpark located north-west of Hamamatsu city is part of the Japan Self Defence Force facility. It is an active air force base so you will see jet trainers and helicopters in action while you visit this museum. The museum is located in an old hanger but has been modernised with static displays, models, videos, posters in one part of the building. When you walk into another part of the building, you will see an amazing collection of jet fighters from the Vampire, the Sabre, the Starfighter as well as Japan's own design jet fighters and many more aircraft including helicopters. This hall is absolutely amazing by the scope of the display and the fact that you can jump into a cockpit and pretend you are in Topgun. There is a fighter simulator which is fun with a closing canopy and controls like in a fighter but really simplified. The museum portion is over three levels with the third floor containing a cafe, library and more displays, At the ground floor entry is located a gift shop. The great thing about this attraction is that it is free however a cab ride is essential to get there. The price of a cab ride to and from Hamamatsu station should be between 2000 and 3000 yen. Finding a cab near the airpark is hard. Walk due east from the main gate to the airpark and you will come across a small shopping mall and there is a cab rank. Worth visiting if you love planes and aviation."
