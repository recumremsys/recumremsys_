"Had a great day at Sovereign Hill.  I had visited when I was 6 with my family, so this visit was very nostalgic.  Brought back many fond memories - the place has changed big time but the feeling associated to the visit, was strong.  Invest the time and see it all - it is so worth it.My husband and I shared a sausage roll from the bakery, you could tell it was home-made.  Very tasty.  Afternoon tea was had at the ""saloon"" - once again, we shared scones. The serves are big enough for two.The history this place holds is unbelievable. Thank you for an excellent day and fond memories.Tip:  purchase your tickets on line via RAA/RACQ/RACV you end up saving approx $7pp"
"This is our second time visiting with kids and the first time now that they are a bit older. We all enjoyed the mine tours (extra cost) and we also booked in for making the boiled lollies (also extra $20 per person) but that was a highlight for us and the kids got a commemorative tin full of their own boiled lollies that they made. We spent two and a half days here and found plenty to do. Dig deep to find gold, that kept the teenagers occupied for a while. We like the Cornish pasties at the Hope bakery which are half savoury and half apple pie. The gold pour was cool to watch too."
"We visited with our 9 year old and 7 year old.  They loved every second of the visit, and we were here for about 6 hours.Heaps of content which is not additional cost to keep you entertained and a great way to see what life would have been like nearly two centuries ago.Food was grossly overpriced and awful. $11.20 for a “hot dog” (cold) and cold chips is a complete rip off.  And a lot of the merchandise is quite pricey. We also did the photo room which was $79 for the sitting and one photo. Despite the cost it is still an excellent experience and one the kids will be talking about for years to come. Highlight for them was finding real gold and bringing it home in a bottle."
"Visited with our three children 4, 13 and 18 years old. We really enjoyed the atmosphere and the people in period costumes, it was like going back in time. We did a mine tour and gold panning. The place is great, so much to see and if you want to see all, you will need the 2 days (included in the entry ticket). It can also be very hot during the day, bring a hat. I must say that it is not a cheap outing, be prepared to spend some serious money."
"My partner and I got to relive our childhood visiting sovereign hill recently. Loved seeing the old buildings and stores but my favourite was still the gold panning. Make sure ask one of the staff to show you what to do. Once we knew, we got so addicted to it and all the tiny specks of gold we were finding that we ended up running out of time and coming back the second day. The second day is free with your ticket thankfully although really didn't expect we would need it. Make sure you catch the gold pouring demonstration and the candy making demonstration (you get to taste raspberry drops while still warm - amazing!). Also liked the mine tour and making a wish at the chinese temple. If you are a big kid at heart, I highly recommend it!"
"We visited Sovereign Hill with children (aged 9 and 6) and enjoyed a fun-filled although jam packed day!  We arrived at 10am, opening time, and proceeded down the Main Street to book a Mine Tour for later in the day. We then attended our prebooked Photography session, a fun experience taking us back to what it would be like dressing in the era, the photos turned out great, pricey but worth it! We then rushed to the sweet demonstration, yummy taste tester, and our Mine Tour which was very informative. Making our way to the New York Bakery for lunch, sitting by the window over looking the people panning for gold was a nice outlook. We then proceeded to join them in their hunt for gold and making it big, wishful thinking! We walked away finding 3 flakes of gold which we took home in a little glass bottle. Moving into the candle making demonstration and gold pour demonstration before rushing up to the horse and carriage ride making it onto the last ride before the end of the day. By this stage it was 4pm and we made it to the last blacksmith demonstration for the day. We were hoping to have a quite drink before leaving however most places were closing up by 4.30pm which was disappointing considering the Hill was still open until 5pm. We missed out on visiting a few places so 2 days spent at Sovereign Hill would have made it more relaxing and less of a rush. Both my husband and I had visited as young kids so our expectations were high and Sovereign Hilll didn’t disappoint. A fun, memory making day for the family!"
"I came here with my Dad while he was visiting from NZ. Overall it was a great experience, and incredibly well put together. However, at $50 per person just to get through the front door you will want to get your money’s worth. Make sure you go to as many presentations as you can, which will mean that you will want to spend at least 3 or 4 hours at Sovereign Hill"
"Had a lovely day out with the family, haven’t been in years. We decided to take our two children along. I must say tho may not return again due to the price, even for concession was too high. Plus the things you pay for inside end up spending over $200"
"Took the family here, it was a great way to spend the day, very historic and authentic. Both my boys loved panning for gold. Highly recommended."
"Had a great day there with my kids and siblings, something for everyone and the items you can buy there are pretty good value. However our experience was ruined by the wasps, couldn’t go anywhere without them landing on us, we had to ditch our lunch and run away and literally grab my son out of his pram and run because 6, yes 6!! Wasps were on my toddler son. I understand wasps are natural but sovereign hill needs to take responsibility for the safety of their guests and relocate them, we would have loved to let the kids play on the playground whilst we ate but it wasn’t possible. Let down"
Visited Sovereign Hill during the winter wonderland period last year with my husband. It was amazing loved every minute of the 6 hours we soent there. Have just booked tickets for myself and 3 friends to visit the winter wonderland again this year. Weve decided to stay the night and do all the activities dinner etc. cant wait
"Been along time since I had been here so time to take the family, booked online with RACV to receive a 10% discount. SH opened at 10am on the Friday, we arrived at about 11am. Plenty of parking. Walked out into the diggings and you can borrow strollers and wheel chairs. Always something going on in terms of displays and you are given a map to assist with planning. Great shops, lollies, foundary, candles, bakery, photography, bowling, horse ride, mine tours & gold panning. Staff are all in period costumes. Good gift shop. Great place!"
"We had an enjoyable day here with lots of information to be learnt through tours and experiences such as going down into a mine, panning for gold, watching the wheelwright in action, watching gold being poured, learning about candle making, watching school in action. My teen daughters particularly enjoyed the boiled sweet making process where you are offered a sample at the end. (We were excited to find out later that day that one of my oldest friends, a local resident of Ballarat, is a direct descendant of the Brown family who developed the business!)The entrance price for a family is reasonable for a day of experiences. (There are other things that you can pay for once you have entered). Try to get there as close to opening time as possible so you can take full advantage of the scheduled events. We kept an eye on the time and managed to get to most of the things that we hoped to see. There are places to buy lunch or you can take your own. We sat on one of the benches undercover in the main street to eat our own picnic. Take a raincoat if the weather looks dicey as you are outside for a lot of the time. We popped into the gold museum across the road (included in the entrance fee) at the end of the day, but we were quite exhausted by then and didn't get the most out of this part of the experience. This aspect is also less interesting for kids, although they had provided fun things to play with such as an old fashioned puppet theatre with puppets. Expensive entry, but you will certainly have a memorable day out. Easy (free) parking."
"Took the family here for the long weekend.An amazing experiance, kids learnt so much. Take 2 days and plan ahead to get the most out of demonstrations. Try the lollie making the kids will love it."
"All we wanted to do in Ballarat was to do a mine tour. We weren't expecting having to go into Sovereign Hill, entry over $50 plus another $7.50 for the mine tour. We entered not knowing what to expect but what a wonderful surprise,  stepping back into a town in the late 1800s, everyone in costume of the day. The Cobb and Co coach, another extra cost was a sight to see, as were all the shops and businesses of the day. Yes we did the mine tour eventually, very tourist orientated but enjoyable.  Tried our hand at bowling, watched gold smelting.  Only spent 3 hours there but could have spent the entire day."
"Would highly recommend, great day, grandchildren  had so much to do. They learnt about the early gold rush  period, actually panned for gold as well. Rode on the stagecoach and enjoyed old style ten pin bowling as well as many other attractions."
"This is our 2nd time here, laast time was more than 10 years ago. Seems like a lot more to see and do now. The gold mine tour is a must do, we paid for family of 4 ticket. But be warned some walking and darkness and interesting tram/train rides. Service at New York Cafe was slow, waited 40 mins for food despite repeated reminders. Red Coat parade and gold panning was also interesting. All in all a good few hours spent in a historical site. Buy your tickets in advance to get some savings. Entrance to the Gold Museum opposite was included and is worth a visit."
"Unfortunately it was pouring rain when we visited Sovereign Hill, however we still enjoyed the experience.  Was a good educational experience for all in our family, the underground mine tours are worthwhile paying for.  We also managed to find a small amount of gold when panning in the river."
"We hadn’t been to Sovereign Hill I’m over ten years and it didn’t disappoint. The gold pour is always amazing- the colour of the liquid gold is stunning. We did the labyrinth mine tour going down in the train- a wonderful experience. Walking up and dirk those dusty roads brought back such a feeling of nostalgia. Well worth a visit, again and again and then once more!!!"
Booked to take the kids to the Winter Wonderland and everything was booked out and they cut lines midway as they couldn't handle the volume of people.Very disappointed and staff werent quipped to deal with complaints and volume. Their excuse was we don't have enough people staffed - if you know this is the 'busiest day of the year' perhaps you should be more prepared!! won't rush back!
"Having visited Sovereign Hill a few times but never having seen the previous light show, we decided to treat ourselves to Aura recently.  (We also partook in the dinner beforehand which we really enjoyed by the way!)  As advised, everyone was 'rugged up' for the commencement in the theatre. It starts with the creation of earth (and therefore gold) so we all wore 3D glasses for this as bits of exploding stuff hurtles towards you!  After this we boarded a bus/train for a 10 min journey to their outdoor arena/theatre.  The indigenous story is told projected onto rocks (I think ... it was very dark!).  It is under cover but the wind can be very chilly. Then you move into the main viewing area for gold rush/Eureka part.  It finishes with the bus journey back to the start.To be honest I'm not sure how much the younger members of the audience would have understood.  There is obviously loud noises (gun fire) in the Eureka stockade.  However, worth seeing for historical purposes.  All staff were excellent!"
"A boyhood dream was to go here one day, well today was that day. Sovereign Hill did not disappoint. The exhibits were fantastic and the staff were exceptional. The gentleman in the gold pour exhibit was fantastic funny and informative. Highly recommend paying for the gold tour mine. We did 2 of them. Red Hill mine was also fantastic. So much to see and do. Don’t forget the gold museum across the road. The kids will Love it."
Went here with my parents and sister. The entrance ticket was 58.50 for general entry which includes the red hill mine self guided tour. The place was quite big and feels like you have gone back in time but definitely think its not worth the price.
Came here as a teacher on holiday! Was not disappointed! Very busy in holidays but a faulous experience.
"Turned up & laughed when they said our ticket allowed access for the next day too, I thought we would be there two hours maximum...how wrong I was. Lots of things to see & do, the staff were fantastic, all in period costume and in character, spent  at least 30 mins chatting to a guy about life in the goldfields, underground tours, wheelwright demo, panning for gold, gold purification & pouring demo just to name a few things. A definite must to visit if in the area"
"We first went and watched the AURA light show the night before we went to Sovereign Hill and wow, what an experience - a great 3D film about the creation of the universe and gold, a stunning outside light show about the indigenous history of the area and finally an outside theatre show about the more recent history of the gold mine and Ballarat - well worth the money. The next day we went to Sovereign Hill proper and had a great day out - watched the gold pour, sweet making, paid a little extra to go down the gold mine, went gold panning and loads loads more. Only slight niggle was that we found the food choice somewhat limited, but what we did have was delicious. Ended the day with a quick walk around the Gold Museum, spent about 45 minutes there which was plenty of time. The standout though were the staff, an absolute credit to Sovereign Hill."
"We'd been to the replica village at Swan Hill and a couple of others so hadn't bothered to check out Sovereign Hill on previous visits to Ballarat partly due to cost. Even with a concession discount, entry is still not cheap, but it does include access to the Gold Museum over the road which was worth a look.Certainly an impressive set up. Buildings authentic but in great condition.  Plenty of working displays and we even scored a tasty and good value lunch in the New York Bakery. Hard to fault really. Recommended!"
"Decided to take a day trip here while staying with friends. Had a fun day looking at history of the Gold mining times. Lots of interesting displays & people wandering around in olden day costumes. Not a cheap day out, though can fill in the whole day. Shops, machinery, shows lots to see & do."
"Our visit to this so amazing outdoor museum was the number one highlight when visiting Victoria. We thought the entry price was steep, however at the end of the tour we agreed the price, was well worth it.  You get two days entry on the one ticket however we were in Ballarat just for the one day only so the two day ticket was of no use to us.  As soon as we stepped on the main street we were transported back to how life was like in a gold mining town in the 1850s. Loved everything, how the staff were dressed in authentic clothing,  the working shops, the demonstrations, the gold pour, the Red Coats marching and firing, the panning for gold, the coach driven by Clydesdale horses and the Gold Museum across the road.  Loved every minute of it and we left with lots of well priced souvenirs to remember our amazing visit."
"We took a day trip to Ballarat from Melbourne excited to explore the area and Sovereign Hill museum.However, the entrance price stopped us in our tracks. For 2 of us - including a concession, it would cost over a hundred dollars?? Plus paying for extras inside. How is this affordable?Compared to other attractions around Australia (and the world) this is too expensive. Ballarat is not close to Melbourne.When I got home and researched the website again it mentions 'free educator pass' Being a registered teacher I could have gone in for free - this was not mentioned at the entrance. Being new to Melbourne I was not aware of this! Please be aware if you are a registered educator or student teacher in Victoria you can access at the entrance. If you are from another Aus state pre register online. I'm not sure for international educators.Looks like we will be making the trip back another day!"
"We attended our first ever Winter Wonderland at Sovereign Hill and what a remarkable experience it was! Sovereign Hill on its own is special but when coupled with the activities of Winter Wonderland it goes to another level. The light shows, the artificial ‘snow’, the theatre shows, the demonstrations and performances all combine to make for a most enjoyable time. We took advantage of the 2 days for the price of 1 and were entertained for the whole time. The weather was cold, icy cold, but this only heightened the experience. Loved it!"
We went there not really planning to go and we weren't disappointed. Spent a very enjoyable afternoon wondering around. The main street is straight out of the wild west! The mine tours are a must see and very enjoyable. There is a huge play area great for picnics too. Plan to bring a bit of cash but most of the shops have efpos. Horse carriage ride was fun.Lots of shops to buy gifts from the time and souvenirs
Traveling from the UK to witness and experiance Sovereign Hill was a real pleasure. This was not our first port of call but it should have been because the history and struggles of the old pioneers is such an eye opener. The sights and smells are all here to savour but what is the most rememberable is the staff and volenteers who make this place a visit well worth the trip.
"We went on a Sunday morning, glad we took a hat as it was a warm day. Very interesting, do the guided tour with the lovely Zerene, she’s a vault of information and funny too. Husband did gold panning, found a few specks. Had a ride in the horse drawn coach. There is a gold pouring demonstration which is quite interesting. Watched the lollies being made, raspberry drops are yum. There is a cafeteria on site for light meals. Don’t leave Ballarat without visiting here, it’s a wonderful attraction."
Have been to Australia 3 times now and each time I've been I've made it a must to go here. There is so much to see and do for all ages. Reasonable prices. Cant wait to go again
