It might be busy low down but climb and it soon quietens - we didn't heed the arrival early warning and it was busy but not crazy. Climb to the summit and you'll have lots of photo opportunities to yourself. Had street food at the bottom after which was yummy
Heard much history about the Torii gates and why such color- all thought about in a sensible way. Great instagrammable event.
"Has to be on everyone’s list of things to do in Kyoto to be sure, but the concern is mostly about the enormous crowds that flock to this site.If you can wangle it, it is well worth visiting the Shrine after dark as the crowds are negligible and the venue is just as incredible with the lights on.  It was easy to get plenty of shots without people in the images.Great venue to visit and it is free (and huge) - make sure you have comfy shoes on if you want to walk the entire trail!"
There is no place like it. Thousands and thousands of torii Gates on a mountain path. Come early not just to avoid crowds but greet some friendly cats. Recommend hiking up to the lookout.
"Nice Shrine.  Watched a ceremony which was very nice and interesting.  Went up the hill on the hottest, muggiest day of the year.  Should have brought a change of clothing, a camelbak water carrier.  Free parking is a plus."
"A beautiful long trail of torii, those nearer the entrance seems bigger than the ones in between the track. Walking in the direction of the torii are plain ""pillars"" of orangy red. If you turn around, you'll see inscriptions of sponsors on the other side of the torii pillars. Full of tourists, just have to move further up the trail and wait for pockets of opportunities to catch a nice photo without any photo bombs."
"My heart affair. Come early in the morning to avoid crowds and hot weather. Climb to the top, it's a beautiful path through the forest."
"This is one of the must visit places in Kyoto. Getting here is kind of weird with it being just a few blocks away from the city, but when you see it, it is unmistakable. Beautiful place to explore and take photos. When we went there were tons of food stalls that had a lot of delicious food as well."
This was part of our tour I was looking forward to. Was crowded of course but what can you do. Didn’t get to see all of it because of the tour schedule.
It’s close proximity to the Kyoto station. Went almost towards the evening but it was still crowded. But then again it’s free so it’s worth it unlike other places in Kyoto where you pay only to find that you are just walking around the places without even getting the feel of being near it.
Th is place is amazing. Went on a Saturday so very busy - markets are fantastic and the BBQ stalls are sensational!!!!
"I came here in the afternoon, and sadluy the stalls are closing down already. Plus the sun is setting so pictures are hard to take with phones. I suggest coming here early in the morning or while the sun is up. It's crowded here for people come and pray plus tourists gather to walk. The train station is designed differently. Try the inari here it's good. Oh yeah there's a lot of souvenir shops that sell cute stuffs. From socks to magnets keychains name stamp and furoshiki napkins."
"We got lost around the back of the mountain - we also lost the crowds! It was magical. Loosing the crowds was by far the best way to appriciate the beauty of the place, especially walking through the gates with autumn leaves falling. We too the path to the right. As the crowds thinned out, we walked through a bamboo forest. We passed lots of little shrines along the way. While we stopped at a vending machine, we found a clowder of cats. The track got steeper and steeper - it definitely took more than 30 minutes with kids. Looking down the gully, there was a breathtaking view. Reaching the top, there is a larger shrine. Travelling back down, we found the crowds again. We came across little shops, where the kids enjoyed icecream while resting and watching an amazing view."
"Saw this in the guidebook and thought that the red/orange arches were limited to one part, but no they stretch the whole way around.  It’s a long way and uphill too so you have to be fairly fit to get to the top - or very determined.  Great exercise with a good view with Japanese culture thrown in."
"We came after dark but I thought it was beautiful. Enjoyed walking around visiting the shrine. Quiet, peaceful."
"Visited on 2 January 2020 during the holiday season here and boy it was packed which in a way added to the experience.  Honestly it’s a hike up a mountain through 10,000 gates with a great view of Kyoto on the way up.  However it is very touristy now but still worth the walk.Tip: we did this with a private tour guide who parked nearby and explained the history of the site and showed us around.  Best way to do it instead of battling the crowds on the public transport"
"Took the 8am from Kyoto station and two stops later we were there. Very few people at that time which made it easy to see the shrine and then walk up. Agree with the other reviewers ... the higher up, less people. By the time you get down all the food stalls to the right are open and you can feast on many offerings."
"Visiting here is like visiting some great catherdal in Europe. You can feel the history, and the spiritual connection here to the mountain. It's open 24 Hours a day, so you can visit in the day time, the night, or early morning. Be warned, at night time there are monkeys (Aggressive) and Boars (Also aggressive ) That wander the area. It's nicer to go during the day since you can enjoy and experience the red gates. But also the busiest."
One of the busy shrines in Kyoto. Was part of our day trip on Kyoto Bike tour. Having a guide to explain the background of the many thousands of 'gates' was interesting. There are tens of thousands some you can walk through others just to hang up. Its commercial atmosphere does slightly detract from the principle of why it stands. Walk up the path and you do get a more peaceful atmosphere.
"Very, very busy around the entrance to the shrine but the crowds soon thin out as you ascend. A stunning site once away from the crowds, it makes for pleasant walk . Allow 2-3 hours to the top and back"
"Amazing!You have to be at the opening to avoid the crowd. Waking up early in the morning is the best. Because walking with nobody is the most relaxing thing you could do. Take some water in order to avoid overprice bottle.It's a good walk, but nothing's difficult. Just go early in the morning and enjoy!"
"Make sure to get there early before the crowds come! We started climbing before 7am and there were several people at the base and already climbing as well. We were in a little bit of a hurry so we hiked straight up and down, stopping only for a picture or two, and we were able to complete it in an hour and 15 minutes. The climb is tough - stairs on stairs on stairs! We lost most of our layers on the way up and that’s saying a lot since it was around 33 degrees fahrenheit that day. But if you are able to do it, it’s pretty neat. The only frustrating part was that the top of the mountain literally had a piece of paper that said, “TOP.” There were no rewarding views at the top, which was a bummer, so make sure to take the time and hit the lookout point on the way up or down for a nice picture."
Well I thought since it was November there weren't going to be that many tourists but....I was wrong.  You really have to go very early to avoid the crowds but even though it was really busy there are still breaks in the crowd for good pictures. Hike the whole thing and take in the beautiful sights.
"We spent 1.5 hours up and down. Reached Inari station late so was crowded at the start of the trek. Crowd start to thin as you go further up so leave the photo shoot to later part of trek.After the trek, we had a yummy tempura meal at Temupra Oe restuarant. Short walk from Fushimi Inari Taisha."
Such an amazing place to visit. Start of December was a bit quieter but still busy so would recommend going before 8am if you can. Look out to the sides of the main tracks as some more gates without the crowds worth a look!
"The Shrine with orange pillars - known as Torri Gates.Shrine is open 24 hours. We got there around 9:30 AM, not too crowded. Entrance is right at the JR Inari Station. Headed up towards the mountain on the walking path, take a photo of the map provided near the entrance for better path planning. Learned that this shrine is dedicated to rice and sake. Take your photos while heading up as coming back down the crowds grew larger, (triple the amount of people one hour later). Always be respectful, this is a shrine with worshipers. You will see a lot of steps but it is a very leisure walk. We could see the Torii Gates at night from our Hotel."
This should be on your list to visit! It's a lovely place to walk around and is a lot bigger than you would imagine. We got the train here and the station is directly opposite and about a minute walk away. Walking around this site is really nice and there were hardly any crowd's so made it even nicer. It does show a circle for you to walk around but the last bit is a path through the street so I would recommend to double back on yourself and go through it twice. Lovely place to visit
Got there in the afternoon. It was awfully crowded. Did not walk through the whole route as there is no time indication at various split points and was not sure if we had enough time. Street food around the temple was interesting though many are overpriced.
"Went there early morning, alone, and had two hours for myself. I believe that experience would be totally different seeing it packed with tourists, because this place gets really packed. This is a must. There is a lot a walk around, but it is so magical that you don't want to stop. Follow the path to the top, and don't feed monkeys."
"We visited the Fushimi Inari Shrine overall it was a nice experience but there are lot of other tourists however and it got a bit over crowded. Don’t get too close to some of the shrines as the caretakers don’t like it. Which is fair enough. The architecture was pretty cool and the climb to the top is a decent work out, they have yummy street vendors at the bottom which sell all kinds of local foods, a must try."
"I loved this place. It is quite a climb and we didn't reach the top. The crowds thin out the higher you go and the tori gates get less and less well cared for, but the atmosphere gets better and more peaceful. It feels like a pilgrimage. Enjoyed seeing all the shrined on the way back down and meeting the shrine cats. It did not feel over commercialised like many tourist attractions both here and many other countries."
"I found out about this attraction in Vlogs and Vloggers often show just the first part where you enter the first Torii  that leads to numerous more. What I found is that there is more to it and if you have a bit of time take the Mt Inari challenge and reach the summit. As soon as I get to path no 6 (I thought I have reached the top!) and realised it is only the base of the actual loop. I was already tired at this stage and the steps leading to path 6 was ardous. I nearly gave up but my daughter pushed me to get to the top and off we go. Between each rest stop are unique shrines, there’s even a lake at the top of the mountain. The challenge was at a certain point you will no longer have access to a rest room yet , I need to drink to replenish my thirst. So either you get to the top quickly or I had to just take little sips of water 😂. I am not fit and my knees were feeling it but I still managed to reach the summit in 2 and a half hours. Going down and back to the entrance was of course a breeze but it still took me a good half hour. Lots of mini shrines and hidden gems in little pockets so have fun!"
"Been here twice and on my 2nd visit, I finally had the time to try and go to the top. It took me a lot (I mean a lot of stops) to reach the praying area to the top but the experience was worth it (not necessarily the view).I love the Kyoto merch around the area as it captures ancient Japan."
"Don't take pictures at the beginning! Everyone does and it's congested. Just hike up a bit and you can take the exact same picture. People and organizations pay money to have gates constructed here for good luck. Some look old but I think most aren't that old because they end up being turned over. The colors are really vibrant. The hike up at certain points get strenuous. However there is a nice view of the city. At the top portions there are some shrines. However they are not particularly impressive. If you get tired, you're not missing much by not going all the way to the top."
"Don't be afraid by the crowd when crossing the first torris, it gets way better after passing the first shrine.IMO the 45 mins of climbing to the summit aren't worth it... There is a small shrine at the top but no view.The best point of view is the one close to the big stopping area that has a tea house and a restaurant. When you reach this area, there are some stairs on the left that are leading to a nice spot with less crowd."
