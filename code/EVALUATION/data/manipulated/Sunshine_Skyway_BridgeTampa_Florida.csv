Fabulous views and super fun drive across the sunshine skyway. One of my favorite landmarks in the country. Also love to fish under the bridge and cruise around the bay and river. Donâ€™t miss it
Always cross this when going across the bay to Sun City Center.  Watch for high wind warnings but mostly enjoy the view.  There is a toll to use the bridge
This bridge is very interesting and unique. Traveling across it gives you a great view of Tampa Bay and the activities on both sides.
Fun drive over the bridge. Plenty of places to get photos. Saw cool places to fish if thats your thing.
"Ok it is a bridge but a very cool one. Beautiful and well kept. You can pull off and fish on the beach, we saw folks boating and picnicking. No fee to cross the bridge which is nice."
"I know it is just a highway going over the bay, but it is beautiful and interesting. I always drive out-of-town visitors over the Skyway Bridge, then turn around and go back. It is interesting that the previous bridge was destroyed when a ship hit it, and the ends of the old bridge are still in use as fishing piers on both sides. Imagine the long drive around Tampa Bay without this bridge. It is an educational site if you're in the area. There is a fee in one direction."
Enjoyed going over the bridge for the views. be sure to stop at either end of the bridge for the view of the whole bridge and picture taking
Traveling over this gorgeous bridge provides a view of Tampa Bay like no other.   You can see city skylines and the beautiful Gulf of Mexico from a bird's eye view.
"Great view from bridge, we took bridge into Tampa area from Everglades National park visit. Seemed to be a direct route and the bridge was very nice with a great view."
"This bridge has a diverse history.  While on the long drive across you can enjoy the scenic bay area coming into Tampa Bay.  HIking trails line the road, as well as fishing piers."
"A striking modern bridge that is in sight for miles. Saves hours of time traveling down the west coast of Florida. Very reasonably priced, as well."
"This is the most beautiful bridge in the Tampa Bay Area.  On a sunny day, the view of the blue water is gorgeous!  Great bridge to take for scenic route drive.  Donâ€™t miss it if you are visiting the area!"
Beautiful drive on a sunny day. Water view was amazing. Clear blue sky and water. So peaceful. Sunset was amazing. Watching from the fishing pier is the best alone time. Very romantic also.
"We have used that bridge at least 15 times in past years. Always a WOW experience. Good way to appreciate the Great Florida landscape and sea view. Fantastic view. When you drive south, watch your right for the big US flag far away. This is Fort De Soto. Enjoy !"
"If you come to the Tampa area, you have to go over the Sunshine Skyway. Itâ€™s breathtaking in its majesty and worth the toll. Itâ€™s more than a bridge. Parks along the way are perfect for picnics or swimming. Donâ€™t miss it!"
Go over this Bridge Slowly to Take in all of the wonderful views!!  It is a great spot to get pictures with great water shots!
Rest areas on both sides. There is also a fishing roadway which was the old bridge. Tell each direction.
Took grandchildren for a ride and ended up on the causeway leading to this bridge. Had to pay a toll but the experience was worth it. The ride up to the center of the bridge was like goung to the top of a roller coaster. But the ride down was nothing like one. Perhaps a bit anticlimactic but exciting for us all to do together. Cheap thrill.
"Worth the trip, great views! Read up on the history and the collapse back many tears ago.Some say it's haunted."
Driving up or down the bridge one feels on top of the BayðŸ’›A wide open view that makes you feel on top of the world!!Best of all is going under the bridge ! Awesome when cruise ships pass under ...one can see the details and the armor that keeps is standing so beautiful..one feels like almost touching it but not really...is still way high. I have taken numerous fotos and is never the last.
A neat bridge because of the construction.  Very unique.  Don't just go over the bridge stop at the rest stops.  You could spend some time just taking in the views of the gulf and Tampa bay.  FREE LIKE ANY REST STOP. Just park and enjoy.
"Whilst on a driving tour around Florida it made sense to go over the SSB to avoid a long detour around Tampa Bay. It may not be a tourist destination bridge as such (unlike the Golden Gate), but it does afford some spectacular views, and is aesthetically easy on the eye. Traveling from north to south it suddenly rises up to an unusually steep crown (unusual to us anyway, I canâ€™t think of anything similar in the U.K.), and then sweeps down the other side in a long curve towards the southern shore of the bay. Simply spectacular stunning views of the water!"
"loved the spectactular view from the bridge. I am afraid of crossing bridges, but this one wasn't too bad"
"What to say about a bridge? I have been over it numerous times! The view is great!! The rest areas are nicer now and clean! Not many bridges are a destination like this one! We live about 60 miles South of it and always look forward to going to Clearwater because of it! If you like you can fish from the North or South on the old road! Or just  stop and take photos! Be careful crossing because you tend to look at the view all the time! If I miss our home state of Indiana,  I change my mind when I cross this bridge! Nothing like that up there!"
Picturesque highway with stunning bridge. Bridge was tolled at $1.50 each way cash or Florida SunPass if you have it. Be aware that the bridge could close in high wind situations.
"It is an impressive bridge, but still just a toll bridge.  Did not stop for more information due to time constraints.  The story of the original bridge is very interesting."
Passed over this twice on the way to/from Ellenton. A magnificent feat of engineering and fantastic views across the bay. Itâ€™s a bit hairy with the top down and you get the feeling of being on a rollercoaster. A must if you are in this area.
This is a good size bridge.  Don't go if you're scared of heights.  The view's are amazing. Nice afternoon drive.
"But then why not.  Rebuilt so it's gotta be safer than older bridge's.  Enjoy at sunset, its hard to not stare at the sky."
"Love riding south and watching for the boats. Checking out the fishing pier, heading south to our favorite beach.When heading north toward St Pete, after the decline, be sure to keep your eyes looking for the bunches of kite skiers! The colors are magnificent in their variety."
"This gorgeous span offers a fishing piers and rest areas to have a picnic, etc. The USCGC Blackthorn Memorial must be seen. Take a few minutes next time you go across to stop and take it all in."
Decided to take a different route back to hotel in Tampa after a day at the beach.  Well worth the $1.50 toll to cross.  Nice views of the bay.
"Visited the bridge and there was a beautiful h on one side and fish pier on the other.  Lots of birds at the beach part, jumping fish was a lovely suprise."
"Did not know you could rate a bridge, but here goes! We moved down here 2 years ago and the Skyway bridge is about 15 miles from us. It is 450 feet high over the Tampa Bay and is about 12 miles long. I go out of my my to go over it as it is a beautiful ride into St Petersburg over the Bay. No big wall to block the view and the cables are in the center so view is great! It kind of skips on islands to your destinations. Parts of the old bridge is used as fishing piers plus there are parking areas on the sides for relaxing and picnicking. Love crossing it!"
This beautiful bridge stands proudly at the entrance to Tampa Bay. I have been over it and under it many times. Be aware it is subject to closing in high winds. In the sunshine it truly glows...hence the name the Sunshine Skyway Bridge.
