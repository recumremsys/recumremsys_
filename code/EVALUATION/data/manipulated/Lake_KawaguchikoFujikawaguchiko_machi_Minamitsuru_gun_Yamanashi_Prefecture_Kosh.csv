Went to check out this place since I missed booking a tour of Mount Fuji. I hopped on a train from Tokyo and did a self guided tour. Lake’s pretty with great view of Mt. Fuji.
"Took a day trip from Tokyo and purchased a loop tour on the Red Line. One of the major attractions was riding the cable car uphills for a view of Mount Fuji with lots of photo taking opportunities. Unfortunately the day we got there was quite foggy and we didn't get such a great view of Mt. Fuji but had a great time exploring the small town and surrounding attractions, such as the Museum of Music History, which was part of the red line bus tour. It is advisable for anyone who really wants to have a thorough view of Lake Kawaguichiko to start early, arriving no later than 9-10 am. We took the highway bus which was a nice 1.5-2 hr trip from Shinjuku but there are also alternative routes such as the train. If you really want the full experience such as spending time in the Onsen might be best to spend at least one night."
"Was my favourite place of my trip. Lake Kawaguchiko has stunning views of mount fuji I stayed at fuji view hotel and it was amazing. We hired bikes for 2 hours and road around the whole lake, it is stunning.! A must do. Its super easy to get to as well! Just get to Kawaguchiko Station and its super close from there!"
"We went to  Kawaguchiko after three days in Tokyo. First time visit. We found it easy to navigate as Americans. Hop on/hop off bus tickets purchased at train station. We got lucky and went on a Friday. The lines were not bad to get tickets. When we left on a Sunday morning the line was enormous. But it is the height of Sakura season.   We stayed in a traditional Japanese Ryokan hotel and the experience was amazing. The view of the lake spectacular.  We spent a day touring around the lake. Views of Mt Fuji from many spots are breathtaking.  Only negative, the town it self appears a bit run down. Buildings look old and not well kept. Many buildings were closed and shuttered. But odd considering number of tourists who visit the area. But we were very safe and enjoyed ourselves immensely.Can’t miss Mt.Fuji and a nice contrast after Tokyo."
"Took the Red Line Bus from Kawaguchi Station to #9 stop where we took a boat ride on Lake Kawaguchi. On a clear day in autumn there's lots to see - lakeside accommodations, colorful trees, mountain ranges, and most of all, a splendid view of Mt Fuji. You can also buy a combined ticket that offers both the boat ride and the panoramic ropeway located just across the street from the pier."
Came down here for the day to view the lake and Mt Fuji. You can jump aboard a ferry which takes you on a trip for 20 mins and can bundle it with many other options.Also renting a bicycle is a popular way of getting around.
"Spent the day around Mt Fuji, unfortunately could it because of cloud cover . So our guide took us to lake Kawaguchiko jumped in speed boat and got the wind in out hair. My daughter loved . Afterwards we rented a pink duck paddle boat , that was fun and exercise. I could imagine we would have had a very unique view of mount Fuji from the lake. Definitely do it again"
"Went there from Tokyo in mid of November 2019. We could see the mount Fuji clearly, all day long ! We were so lucky, because the next day, we couldn't see the Fuji from our Shinkansen train on the way to Osaka, because it was a cloudy day and the cloud obstructed the view to the mountain. I suggest to check the live streaming Fuji view before going to the Kawaguchi lake to see the mountain.There was an autumn festival and the sightseeing bus (red line) run slow due to heavy traffic. Please get the tourist map, there are some bus stop to visit interesting places around the lake also good spot to view Fuji.I recommend to have IC card for taking the bus.There was a park next to the lake, where maple trees with colorful leaves during autumn season make this place good spot for taking pictures and picnic."
Stayed overnight in one of the hotels around this lake. Took a morning walk and it was beautiful and serene... before the day tourists pours in. You will not tire of taking pictures here. Lots of great views and photo opportunities.
"Get in a bus e.g. from Tokyo station and go visit this small town and see great Fujisan. Walk around the eastern part of the lake or hire a bike and tour the whole lake in a few hours. Visit a wonderful Ichiku Kubota Art Museum and see awesome kimonos. You'll get the best photos of Fuji on the road there. Please notice that if you are going to come back to Tokyo around 4-5 pm, buses might be full."
"Signed up for a day tour and lucky us to have a clear view Fuji san! The tour guide has mention that Fuji-san is always shy to meet people. Guess we are one of the lucky lots.Enjoying the blueberry ice-cream with the view of Fuji san just makes the trip so much more memorable.Seems like nothing much to do here, except to appreciate the beauty of peacefulness here."
"This was the last stop of the day long trip to Mt.Fuji from Tokyo, by Japan Panoramic Tours. It is a beautiful spot with the crystal clear water of the lake forming the foreground to the spectacular view of the snow clad Mt.Fuji.   There are some eateries by the lake side. Don't forget to try the blueberry ice cream."
"We took a bus from Tokyo to Kawaguichiko so that we didn't have to change train but it was a long weekend and the traffic is so bad that caused us 1:30 hrs more on the road each way .. so it was a bad decision. Once we got there, we took an advice to buy a sightseeing bus ticket (red and green lines), which was kind of convenient. But the bad thing is that everybody did the same thing and the bus was so crowded and the line was really long. Sometimes if you tried to get on the bus at a station in between the route, the bus was packed (especially the red line) so you couldn't get on and you had to wait for another 15 mins for the next bus to come. The green line runs every 30 minutes, you should plan your trip carefully. Try to pick the hotel near the city center or around the Lake if you go during weekend/ long weekend. Because, to me, bicycle seems to be the most convenient way to commute during the busy period."
Loved the quaint atmosphere and the unbeatable views of mt fuji. We spent a night here on a clear day and it's been unforgettable.
beautiful place. Check the weather before going. The predictions are very accurate. The lake was partially frozen in Jan
"We stayed in this area in an Airbnb. Very easy access to the station which had trains and buses. The bus routes give you the opportunity to eat a two day unlimited usage pass for 1500 and use the red, green and blue lines.  We used to travel around lake to hop on and off to have a meal and then head to ropeway. Was a beautiful area to enjoy the peace and quiet and just relax and take in the sights.  Lots of restaurants and shops. If you want to see Mt Fuji would definitely recommend basing yourself here at the lake."
"A beautiful lake with magnificent view of Mount Fuji. Was here a bit late, Mount Fuji was covered by thick clouds. Hope to going back there again with good weather!!"
In addition a good place for a base to get to mt Fuji if you are looking to trek/climb/hike.  Breathtaking views of Fuji all over town provided you have clear skies.  Does get a bit chilly in spring so make sure you are dressed warm and comfortable!
I went to Kawaguchiko Lake by taking Bus from Shinjuku Expressway Bus Terminal as it took approximately 1 hour 45 minutes journey with price 2000 Yen for 1 way. The atmosphere at the lake was so soothing and calm. Found 1 halal restaurant just apposite with the Lawson at the lake area.
"Well worth a visit ! Exploring Mt. Fuji and taking a stroll around the beautiful Lake Kawaguchiko, so impressive. Appreciating the beauty of nature and the ultimate panoramic view superb !!! I highly recommend this place if you’re a Nature lover !!!"
"One of 5 lakes around Fuji.  Probably the biggest.  Provides many great views of Fuji.  You can paddle, ride a speed boat or take a lake cruise to enjoy this place.  A walk around the lake is enjoyable with cool n sunny weather.  Many eateries and small souvenir shop surround the route.   You can find people fishing too."
Stayed in this area of Kawaguchiko for 2 nights to walk Mt Fuji. This lake was a beautiful scenic location to stay with many local restaurants and bars nestled along side the lake . Just below the magnificent Mt Fuji which reflected in the still waters. We can highly recommend this as a great location to launch yourself up the mountain. Easy train ride from Tokyo to Otsuki onto Kawaguchiko . Then the local shuttle bus up to station 5 . Only $aud32 round trip. From station 5 you can view the valley of 5 lakes including this one .
"It's busy in momiji ( autumn colour) season. If you stay overnight, chose a hotel with a view of the lake and mt.fuji. Upside down mt.fuji (mt. Fuji's reflection in the lake) is one of the attractions at lake kawaguchi."
"This is my second time visiting Mount Fuji but this time from a far, we arrived at the area just in time and luckily we saw  view of Mt. Fuji very clearly and from 2nd time  still gives me chill seeing it even from afar. We also got the chance to took pictures of other areas of the lake. Visiting this area i the morning is the best idea as we noticed that before 12nn the mountain has been cover with clouds already.  Worth the visit!"
"I found it very touristy but the lake is beautiful with Mount Fuji as a background even the snow-caped peak was covered by cloud, still majestic.  Went there end of March. Lots of tourists, it's very hard to get in the retro bus, so had to walk a long way to go back to my homestay. But the view paid off. Nice walk tho."
"Best spot for photo taking as you stroll down the lake side. Recommend to ride on Red Line bus and stop at bus stop number 16, the best spot as you see most Mt Fuji shots are taken. Picnicking can be a good option to spend time here."
"Perhaps the best Oasis away from the busy city of Tokyo to view both Mt Fuji and experience the Cherry Blossoms during the season.Do yourself a favour and hire a bike and explore this beautiful, quaint little town that serves up all things Japanese. The best part to stay I believe is the strip of hotels that include Hotel FujiGinkei. Once arriving at the station, grab a cheap cab ride to your hotel if you have luggage. There is a great restaurant nearby.The onsen will overlook Mt Fuji in this hotel precint which provide a great stroll amongst the lake. Spend two full days here and the best part is, it is only a 2 hour bus ride away from Tokyo for about $30 AUD. It is simply serene."
"Staying at a hotel on the lake it was easy to take pleasant and scenic walks to the Itchihi Kobota museum, across the bridge and to the town and the ropeway (without taking the buses).  There were great spots to photograph Mt Fuji too."
Our Family LOVED spending time at the Lake.  We had rather do lake activities than visit the Shrines.  Had a blast and hope to visit again.
"It will be a total waste if you don’t visit lake kawaguchiko when you are in Tokyo. This place is so scenic and you can see Mount Fuji from here if the weather is good and not cloudy. If you have extra cash, maybe you can consider to take a boat ride and i am sure that will worth every penny ;) You can take train or bus from Tokyo to Lake Kwaguchiko. If you are not familiar with the Tokyo train systems, i would highly recommend you to take bus to save your time. I bought bus ticket from highway buses online before my trip. Make sure you buy return bus ticket in advance as the seats are selling fast."
"A stopping off point for many travellers due to the station being close to Fuji. Get away from crowds with a stroll by the lake, particularly the North side (walk anti-clockwise round shore)."
"We stayed here for two nights. We could have stayed longer. Having nice weather makes this place, we have a beautiful day to cycle around the lake & stop to look at the many sights. There are plenty of accommodation options from budget to luxe. Getting to the lake was made a little difficult from the recent Typhoon, however usually there are plenty of options with trains."
the lake is very beautiful. you need to explore this area for at least a day full. try hot springs is a must
"Very serene with a great view of Fuji-San...the area has many traditional hotels, and sites. Get a hotel with a view of Fuji-san from a private Onsen and relax"
"Stay in Kawaguchiko to enjoy the town, the lake and the view of Fujisan.  Take the train to see the surrounding town and walk by the lake to watch the locals and their daily lives."
