"This ""hike"" (we are really only talking 1.6 miles total) is very pretty and views are gorgeous. But, it is one of the most popular hikes, so it is very crowded. Don't expect any serenity. The parking lot is small, so come early or take the available transit. Wear sneakers - even though you are on an island doesn't mean you should wear flip-flops as it can get quite slippery and it is fairly steep and definitely narrow. It is kid-friendly, especially as you can bribe with a delicious treat from the Dole truck at the bottom ;-)"
"The views are amazing! This was our first hike in Hawaii, and we did 2 hours after we landed. Crazy, but be wanted to wear ourselves out so we didn't nap and would adjust to the 5-hour time difference. And I am so glad that we did! We took a quick Lyft drive from our hotel on Waikiki beach, which is highly recommended since parking can be very limited. We were fortunate to have the ability to go on a Monday afternoon, which was way less crowded than usual. The fee is only $1 per person to enter. The hike for us for about 1.5-2 hours roundtrip with stops along the way and at the top. It was pretty east for the most part, rocky, but safe with fencing along. Some areas are pretty narrow so just be patient if people are coming the opposite direction. The entire way was just beautiful, lots of photo opportunities, but the views from the top are amazing -  all 360 degrees - mountains, ocean, city. Just wow. Bring water and a sweat rag. And there's some delicious treats at the bottom when you head. The pineapple whip with fresh pineapple was amazing. The fresh coconut juice was refreshing, but not sweet. This hike has left us a thirst for more to come!"
Honestly this is a pretty easy hike for a person who does hikes :) and the view is spectacular! The only not fun part are the stairs (stair master time) and the short tunnel towards the top. I read a review to stop and take a breather before going through it so I also recommend. Catch your breath then head on through!  We took a Lyft there and jumped on a trolley back to Waikiki. Fresh coconut and pineapple juice at the bottom was a winner!
We have climbed several times and it’s not a hard hike but can be strenuous If you are not in shape ! This past time we climbed when it had rained the day before and the walk was slippery and dangerous in sections. Make sure to wear athletic sneakers or hiking shoes no sandals and be careful ! Arrive early so you can get parking !
"We walked to the crater from our hotel in Waikiki and then did the crater walk. It is very popular but it is still comfortable on the track. The walk can be strenuous towards the top of the crater, but we saw people of all ages on the track. Take water and take sun protection. Looking out over Waikiki and Honolulu with the ocean beyond from the top is well worth the effort. Get yourself a pineapple on the way home."
Visiting the Diamond Head Monument was no only a great hike to the top which little kids can complete.  There were good opportunities to see the wildlife and a great views from the top.
"I was so looking forward to this hike but disappointed. There is one path up and down, so tight and there were literally thousands of people. Was a very slow go and the tunnels are just down right dangerous if you over 6' tall were a helmet. The lookouts are tiny and we were lined up just to squeeze in there for a few moments to snap some pictures. This needs some serious trail maintenance and maybe another trail head for the more advanced hikers."
We actually walked from our hotel to Diamond Head via the coastal route which was beautiful but definitely a trek. Took the trolley back to our hotel which is a great option. The hike itself was a climb with lots of stairs towards the top but well worth the climb with amazing views. Cooler day so it wasn't bad.
"Diamond Head is an amazing hike!! We tried to park in the parking lot, but it's so small that the lot was closed when we arrived at approx 7:30 am, so we had to park at a lot that was a 15 minute walk to the entry of Diamond Head. If you're walking in they charge $1 per person, if driving $5 per car. After paying the entry fee,  the hike begins with winding walkways, then you get to the uneven terrain and eventually the climb upwards and your journey through the tunnel. Once you get to the uneven terrain and stairs, the walkway is very tight. It's barely enough room for one person to walk. You will definitely get a good workout as you work your way to the top. The closer to the top you get, there are lookouts where you can rest and take gorgeous pictures. For the most part, everyone is moving at a steady rate. It took us 30 minutes once we started, to get to the top and it was definitely worth it!  The views from the top are amazing. It was very crowded at the top, but it was to be expected considering everyone was probably very tired and needed to rest. We stayed at the top at least 30 minutes. The sun was not fully blazing when we hiked, so hiking in early morning or late evening may help reduce fatigue.  Make sure to take some water and a towel (because you will be sweating).  Wear the appropriate shoes, especially since part of the hike is on slippery and broken up rocks.   Pace yourself....it will pay off in the end. Overall, I'm very glad I did the hike."
"This is a fantastic hike.  Its somewhat of a steep trail, but newly paved so much easier then it used to be.  Take water, wear a hat, Sun screen, and sturdy walking shoes, NO Sandles or flip flops! DAH !  You can use your cell pH as a flash lite in the tunnel.  This will be one of the most breathtaking panoramic views you will ever see in your life.  Its a must.  If you're a novice hiker just go slow, its so worth it!"
....but didn’t climb to the top. The wife was concerned she couldn’t make it. So we stood at the bottom and looked up. Guess that will count?
Great hike. Last bit was all stairs straight up. Took us about an hour but we were moving pretty quick and there weren’t any lines. I’d allocate and hour ... longer if it’s a busy season.
"The Diamond Head hike can be a very nice hike but if you are a hiker who does not like crowds this is definitely not the hike to attempt in Hawaii.  It's a fairly moderate hike so you don't have to be in great shape to do this hike.  There are many switchbacks so for most of the hike it is a gradual climb.  Towards the top of the hike there are vertical stairs. This is where people who are not in good shape will get winded.  At one point there is a section where you can choose to go up 99 steps or an easier route off to the side.  Once you get up there the view is spectacular.  You can see all of Waikik and the South shore coastline.  And you can see all of the crater and the mountains and valleys.  It is a great tourist hike, but with a lot of tourists there are lines everywhere.  Trying to get a picture without strangers in your picture is not easy to do."
Always wanted to hike up Diamond Head. They say the view is amazing. The view is amazing but it does take some effort to get to the top.  Almost nothing is close to smooth or flat walking up the trail. So make sure you can walk up and down unlevel surfaces.  There are a few places to sit down for a break on the way up.  There are lots of stairs but you can take one of two ways up towards the top. One with more stairs than the other. The parking lot is small so you may not be able to get in that way but you can walk in if dropped off. Mornings are really busy. You might be able to park about a 1/2 mile away and walk in. There is a stand that sells refreshments etc. MAKE sure you take water with you.
"A must experience hike while in Honolulu! Omg! I cannot express how outstanding this hike was. Diamond Head is great for anyone who wants to experience nature at its finest. We did the early morning hike 6:30am so we could watch the sunrise and it was incredible!!! The hike itself was a moderate hike, but I recommend to get there as early as possible because it can get hot really fast. Take the essentials; water, sunblock, a hat and some really good shoes. There is a food truck that sells acai bowls, water, hot dogs, pineapple drinks, and some other goodies. Nice treat to yourself after conquering the crater. There was also a nice little souvenir store at the bottom of the hill too."
"Was a good hike. Great view, once at the top. Came down and had some dole whip at the food truck. something different for us to do."
"As many others noted, I did this hike at sunrise.  It was pretty dark at 6:30 so I recommend bringing a flashlight or using your phone.  Don't forget to bring water.  It is an inclined hike but not bad until you get to the stairs.  They are pretty steep and there are a lot of them.  However, it was well worth the trek. The views were amazing. I highly recommend doing this.  The parking/entry fee was only $5."
"This was our second time hiking up to the top (our first was nine years ago!) so we knew what to expect.  There were a ton of tourists and we just looked past the huge crowds and enjoyed the beauty.  The views from the top are wonderful.   It's crazy hard to get a spot for a good picture at the top overlooking Waikiki and most people don't move once they find one.  It's easier to get pictures facing the ocean away from Waikiki.  We enjoyed some different view points along the rim before heading back down.  At the bottom we stopped at the gift shop and bought a certificate saying we had hiked to the top.  As a heads up, getting a parking spot is crazy hard.  We dropped everyone off and had the drive wait in line with the other cars to get a parking spot.  Took about 15 minutes.  It the lot is full they will make you drive back down to the lower lot and walk back up, but we chose to wait in line at the upper lot."
The view is spectacular. We walked from Waikiki beach up to Diamond Head. A very easy walk to get there. All sidewalks. Once at Diamond Head it's a moderate hike up to the top. Don't forget to stop at the snack shop to get some refreshments once your done.The hike is uneven terrain so just walk careful.
"This is our first activity during our recent trip to Hawaii. It's a moderate hike, though there are some steps that are a little steep. Wear good shoes and take water with you. There are a few stops along the way as well as at the top where you can enjoy the beautiful view and take pictures. And there are food stands where you can buy food/snacks including fresh pineapple and coconuts. Parking lot could get full when you need to wait for a parking space. But it didn't take us long because people just come for hiking and then leave instead of hanging around for hours. So the turnover is pretty fast.If you come on a Saturday, you can also visit the Farmers Market which is right next to it."
"I've this hike many times but took the four kids up this trip. Even the 8 year old did it easily. Go early, we like taking an uber there no parking fee and they drop you off right at the tr0al head.Dole whip, shaved ice, and snacks are sold at the base too"
Nice scenic hike!  Make sure you were proper shoes.  It rained a bit the day we went and it was slick.  Take water too if its warmer when you go. It is very crowded at dawn with all the tour busses.  We went about 9 and it wasn't too bad since we were before the second wave of tours.
"I’m not the athletic or outdoorsy type, but this was mostly an easy hike. Bring water. It’s a sloping uphill walk, then towards the top, you will encounter steeper areas, a 99-step stairwell, and a long, dark tunnel. We tried to get to there for the sunrise, but I couldn’t get my husband awake on time. By the time we got to the park (about 7am) there were already people coming down the trail. It was CROWDED when we reached the top of the crater (about 45 mins to the top for us). You won’t really have a quiet moment to take in the scenery and enjoy the view because the whole place is crammed full of people taking selfies. Not advising against the experience, per se; just do your research and find more opportune times to go if crowds are a factor for you. It was beautiful nonetheless. I got a Dole Whip on the way out of the park (there’s a food truck that sells pineapples and snacks), and that made everything better. :)"
"Awesome hike with phenomenal sights!While in Oahu this was highly recommended so we decided to check it out. Beautiful hike up the side of crater which includes a dirt path, an old tunnel, and steps. All of these were used by the military during ww2. Hike isnt to difficult and is worth the view.I highly recommend checking this out!"
"We really enjoyed our visit. It's a must-do in Oahu. The hike is quite long but well maintained. We loved the views. Parking lot is very small, but we waited in a line and there was a person there to organize it. We waited about 15 minutes to get a parking slot."
"The view at the top is very nice. The hike to get to the top is very tiring, it makes it worse that it is so crowded. There's people coming and going from all directions. There is no hiding from the sun while climbing up the trail. Very hot. There are a few rest areas along the way. Parking was a nightmare. Expand that lot, there is plenty of room. Overall - not too bad."
"That is a medium hike. For a previous hiking fanatic to now a homemaker, that was a decent hike. The tunnel is a bit tight but the view is worth it all. Water. Bring lots of water."
"We decided to do this early on a Saturday morning. I'm glad we did. This gets very busy, and there is limited parking. It's $5/car load. We previously hiked up to the top of Diamond Head 14 years ago, so we were looking forward to going again. Make sure you are prepared for the weather. It was a cloudy day and starting raining on us, but we had our umbrellas. Also, make sure you wear closed-toed shoes and take water to stay hydrated. The path is paved until you get to the base of the crater then it's rocky and you have to watch your step. The good thing is you can go at your own paced and people aren't trying to rush you along. There are 2 sets of steep stairs. I'm not in physically good shape, but after resting periodically I was able to make it to the top. When you get to the last set of stairs there is an alternate route without stairs. You just go to the left. It's longer, but it won't wear you out near as much. I would suggest going early to avoid heat, and try and go on a clear day so you can get the best shots at the top."
We climbed Diamond Head for our second time with friends of ours for their first time. We did not go as a tour. Some parts of the climb can be challenging for some people but there are lots of places to stop for a break along the way. Once up to the top you’ll really enjoy the views. Be sure to wear footwear for a trail hike and you may want to take water with you.
"It's not an easy walk, tons of people, but the view is worth it. Bring water! Also, the Pineapple Whip from the food truck is THE BOMB and you will want one after that long, hot hike up and down, trust me."
"We enjoyed our trek up Diamond Head - it was a warm, mostly sunny day. The 4 of us ranging in age from 59-66 all made it there and back down. No incidents! Mostly gradual inclines / declines on uneven terrain. So be sure to watch your footing so as not to trip or twist an ankle. Nice views all the way! At one point we were rewarded with a beautiful rainbow! Costs just $1- $2 each. Sorry I never paid much attention to the exact cost. Took us a couple of hrs I believe. We would do it again! Great views and good exercise!"
Great view at the top for sunrise! We got there early for sunrise. The climb was crowded with people. Recommend bringing a flashlight so you can watch your steps.
"Was hot, so we bought a dole whip at the start and ate it on the way up! Wonderful views at the top."
"After riding through a tunnel you arrive inside the crater of an old vulcano, there you hike the side upp to an old military installation with a magnificent view over the ocean and honolulu. Make sure to bring water and wear good shoes!"
"A beautiful view and nice little hike. Wear shoes, we saw a few people walking in flip flops which didn't seem like a good idea."
