"This place is great for morning walks. lush green area , fresh air, the morning aroma is great here. Come and enjoy this place.."
"Located in heart of city Cubbon Park is filled with green colour. Big trees , greenery , large space to walk and relax. Nice for morning walk and also to sit relaxed and chat. Very well maintained. Very nice place to visit whenever in Bangalore."
A dog friendly park with lovely old trees. Has lots of lovely old tress and has a lot of area to walk and do your own thing.
Beautiful and different type of rare trees. Kids will enjoy the beauty. Calm place.  Near by Vidhanasoudha good to watch.
Have been to this place with parents. We all enjoyed the nice nature and good place for evening walk. Nice ambience and good picnic spot also.
Amazed and surprised to see the level of greenery and cleanliness in this place. No wonder Bangalore was once city of gardens. Must visit in the lovely weather of Bangalore.
The main thing about this park is its pristine beauty and its central location in Bangalore city. It has some amazing trees and most of the plants there are legacies of the old British era when the park was originally designed and built. It's a nice place to take a stroll and get away from the city for a short while - and it is quite safe to walk in too. Having said that like all city parks it is poorly maintained so it's not uncommon to see trash piled up in some places and sporadic littering by tourists.
Good place to go. Enjoyed with train and aquarium. Very vast place. Children will love this place. Children play area is good. Restaurant inside the park is serving decent food.
"Cubbon Park is  one of the iconic place of Bangalore city spread of 100 acres of land exiting for over 100 years. Situated in the heart of the city right opposite to ""Vidhan Souda"", the legislative assembly of Karnataka state. The high court of Karnataka State is located at one of the many entrances of Cubbon Park.Place is filled thousands of trees of various species, and covered with greenery.Must visit Place.Nice to take a stroll in the park and also to enjoy nature and relax."
Not as maintained as lalbagh. But it is vast greenery in the heart of bangalore city. Kill summer by visiting cubbon park
"Great big open space in city on Bengaluru where you can enjoy a leisurely walk or go for a run away from the busy roads. Lots of eye catching flowering trees and some attractive flower beds. Several interesting red brick buildings to see nearby though not sure you can visit inside. Thereâ€™s even a bandstand thatâ€™s come all the way from Glasgow, Scotland. Seems popular with the locals."
Spent the afternoon with family after vising Vidhan Soudha and High court. Well maintained cool place in the midst of busy city.
"Relaxing time for every one in the family consisting varying age group. Huge park in the middle of the city you wouldn't miss it. Notwithstanding terrific traffic issues around, you tend to enjoy the lush greenery."
Cubbon park or Chamrajendra park is the best place for morning and evening walk. There is century old library where books of all subject are available. Seen people having photo session beautiful scenery around the park. There is a metro station.
"One of the greenest place in Bangalore. But you have think twice about taking family over there. Lots of lover couple  can be found here and there in there cosy positions. There is no signboard for parking etc. we struggled a lot for parking. Outside of this campus you can find children park, aquarium etc. Didnâ€™t enjoy much."
"Favourite spot for singles, couples , and families too. Filled with greenery and that too in the middle of the city makes it nearest to every part of the city. One can feel awesome on spending time here."
Nice place to walk at weekend when closed to traffic. Shaded with the trees and plenty of benches to sit and watch the world go by.
"Have been to this place multiple times. The Cubbon park is in the heart of the city, is a major landmark and near to other major landmarks,. One can go and spend the whole day with friends or family and do some outdoor sports /picnic sort of activity."
A large area that felt very safe to wander in.  Quite a variety of trees and then formal gardens.  Enjoyed seeing all the locals at rest and exercising there.
"I always loved this place. Trees here are so kind and welcoming. They fill you with positive thoughts. Very well kept and managed without letting Nature be an obvious pet of humans. There is a walking trail inside. There's pay & use washroom as well. Come here early in the morning, bathe yourself in the sun as you are nothing but a houseplant with more complicated emotions. ðŸ˜ŠPeople coming by Metro-Contrary to your belief, do not get down at Cubbon Park metro station. Get down ay B.R.Ambedkar station, Vidhan Soudha instead. The park entrance is right outside the exit."
Have always found peace here a lovely place. Has a very special place in hearts love to come here again and again
One of the famous parks in Banglore where everyone should stop and have a walk. Great place to explore the area. Try the rice craker with peanuts with it...Kind'a chili though. I'm not sure of the name ðŸ˜Š. You can find it in one of my posted photos here.
"go alone or go with your family or friends! large space with dense trees! curiousity generator place for kids, sit on the grass an enjoy the calm mother nature! a good place for photography also. what i like is i have yulu account, you can rent cycle n roam in the park. you will certainly remember your childhood"
"Cubbon Park is the Hyde park  or Central park of Bengaluru. Located in the heart of city it gas pretty everything to offer for a good picnic spot.  Greenery. Expansive open space for activities like frisbie, badminton, etc. Space for walks. Adjacent to metro station. Pet friendly. Talking food and soft beverage inside the park is allowed.  They also have a central-open- theatre kind of   space where folk musicians come to play (I have been witness to it multiple times, hence assuming it to be a dedicated space for this). It has huge peripheral area for parking but parking can be painful with one ways and narrow roads with cars parked on both sides.  The biggest problem is absence of bathroom in this large space. It can be very difficult for older people and patients who may need washroom at short intervals.  It is close to Aquarium and Bal bhavan which has a train running through it. Hence both places can be clubbed with picnic inside cubbon park.  It closes at 6pm, not sure what time it opens in the morning. But it's definitely before 6am. It's not very clean though, as visitors tend to litter as usual. But they do have staff to monitor. Since it's always busy with people , I think usual offenders tend to be wary of being watched all the time. Best is to reach there by 1:30-2:00pm. Or around lunch time. Then spend 2-3 hrs relaxing and playing around. And leave bt 530pm before everyone else leaves to avoid traffic.  Good option for picnic"
This is one of the famous garden in Bangalore it is situated beside the high court of Karnataka Vidhan soudha free parking is there. Is very near to metro station we can spend time with the nature with enjoyment. Very best place two lovers to spend time.
Good place for a family outing. Has a Toy train that apparently is most visited attraction. it's a lung space with some good play area for children. weekends are crowded. There are some dance and plays moderated at the amphitheatre. Has an aquarium and is separately ticketed.
Loved the park - weekend saw lots of people enjoying the park with friends family and dogs. Great place to get away from the noise and traffic
walked across Bengaluru for more than 7 kms and came to Cubbon park. Laid on the grass and had a revitalizing nap for an hour. Very good fresh air. Its the lungs of the city.
"Nothing brings back the charm and joy of old Bangalore like Cubbon Park. Located in the heart of the city, this place is a must visit"
"Cubbon park is an oasis in the middle of the city. So much greenery! It's a super place to come for a walk/run, see the library, relax on the weekend and even visit the dog park on Sundays. Makes for a great morning and very photo-friendly :)"
Bangalore used to be the Garden City though now you have to go hunting for them. This one remains right in the center of the city and remains a relief from the chaos of the city. Try to get to the library in the center.
Take a walk in this beautiful park. People just enjoying the simple things in life. There are attractions in or near the park such as a planetarium and museums. Well worth a visit away from the hustle and bustle of Bangalore.
"Cubbon park is the go to park for many-daily joggers, dog owners, activists and small group meet organisers, cyclist enthusiast, reading enthusiast, leisurely strolling people etc etc etc.It is a huge park and maintained very well. Reaching there also is easy as it is connected by the Metro. Also few stalls outside the park sells all kinds of tid-bits (juices, small bites etc) for the health conscious."
"Cubbon park is associated with how olden days Bangalore was. Though there has been unimaginable changes in the city, cubbon park has stayed the same. After going for first time in many years later, i did feel bangalore has not lost its glory. This is a park staying true to its fame.Last important info: Free two wheeler parking available, though not sure about four wheeler. Check this place atleast once."
"Cubbon park is one of the biggest parks in Bangalore. it is located in the heart of the city. A visit will really make you forget that you are in Bangalore. Area is covered with lot of large trees and greenery. If you love spending time without spending money, Cubbon park is the best place. Park is little crowded on Weekends and Holidays. It is also a good place to spend time with your family. It reminds us what we miss everyday in a busy city. Save tress and preserve nature. One last thing - Please do not litter in public places."
