Walked in from The Penny Royal (over bridge and along northern path) and back Zig Zag track. Toll track very easy with just some slight rises. Good interpretation.Zig Zag track steep and high steps in places but a good experience for someone that doesn‚Äôt really walk such tracks. Great views. Tailrace interesting.
Parked at the Cliff car park then walked the zig zag track then back up the easier gorge track. Nice walk and great views. The zig zag track is steep and has steps made of big rocks so it‚Äôs not exactly easy. If you want an easier walk stick to the paved gorge track. A must while in Launceston.
"Fantastic hike to the first basin and did the Zig Zag track back down. Very nice viewing platforms and old bridge. Didn't do the chairlift across as we had limited time, looked a good thing to do. Couple of resident Peacocks entertained whilst there."
"Has many levels of walks through and around the Gorge. Took the chairlift up to the top, then walked both side of the Gorge. The pool / picnic area was beautiful and a lot of families were visiting on this day. We parked in the car park and didn‚Äôt mind paying $6 for an all day park."
Went both end of the gorge. Crossed the gorge using the chairlift and visited the river end by boat. Both worth doing.
"Lovely place, we did the zig zag walk and then crossed the bridge and returned on the cataract walk. The zig zag was a little strenuous but well worth it, and made the leisurely walk on the cataract walk all the more enjoyable. Did the chair lift back across, that was nice a slow and fine for someone who is a little nervous of heights :)"
"Walked from the Kings Bridge to the cafe. Very peaceful, easy walk. Interesting signs on the way and a beautifully laid out reserve."
"Make sure you take the chairlift one way and walk back over the suspension bridge, walk along the easy track back towards town and look for the seal. Have some coffee and vanilla slice at one of the coffee shops with the beautiful view of the gorge. Lovely gardens with peacocks to look at make for a very relaxing time. Have a swim in the pool or just relax watching everyone else. Good for a couple of hours."
"walked here from our hotel, then walked the gorge to the swinging bridge. beautiful and very easy to walk"
"Visited late on a sunny afternoon, so cable lift and cafe were closed, but still a great experience. I wish that I'd brought my swimmers to enjoy the late sunshine on the lawn and free outdoor pool.I walked out on the flat path, over the cable bridge, then out to the stunning cantilevered Sentinel Lookout, back to the main area then back via the fun but strenuous Zig Zag track. All in all, a great way to spend an hour and a half - if I'd had more time I'd have carried on to Duck Rock and the Power Station. A magical place."
"Fabulous walk along the gorge starting from Trevallyn Street. End up at the Cataract Gorge Reserve, where you can take a dip in the water, swim in a pool, ride the cable car, have a picnic (free bbq's), play in the playground, walk other trails, go over the suspension bridge and more.You may be lucky and see the resident seal in the gorge waters."
Walked from my accommodation in the city to the gorge. Signage is quite good if you are walking and not driving.  If you have average fitness take your time. Enjoyed a coffee and cake at the cafe when I arrived. The toilets are in the rotunda.
"Isn't a great place, ropeway is reasonably priced. you can also walk to the other side by 2 different paths. Good for picnic. view is good. peacock sighting."
"Silly us. We misread directions to the Gorge. Driving a car up over the steep hill to the First Basin car park is a whole lot easier than walking. However, the manicured lawns and gardens were a restful place to recuperate, buy a coffee and eat lunch.  On my second walking visit for the day, I discovered the easy way via the gorge with nary a hill.  The paved walkway which hangs miraculously from the huge boulders lining the gorge commences at Kings Bridge where the South Esk River flows into the Tamar.There are some interesting walks around the basin and along and above the gorge.  Sturdy hiking boots are a must should the track to the Cataract Lookout be attempted.  Not for the faint-hearted.  But the view down the gorge to the city is superb."
"Walked from the Penny Royal into the Gorge, it is a reasonably flat easy walk with some nice viewing points along the way.We walked over the suspension bridge. The pool was very dirty (green) obviously not being used. The park has some great play equipment for the kids they especially like the ‚Äúhamster wheel‚Äù. We saw/heard peacocks along the way. We decided to walk back out the Zig Zag track, this track is a bit more of a challenge so may not suit everyone. (Steep in parts and stairs) Stopped at a viewing platform about half way to have a different aspect of the river. We enjoyed our visit and the walk."
"So close to centre of Launceston. Best place to take the family/yourself to run off/swim off excess energy. Short & long walking tracks, suspension bridge, swimming pool, natural water hole, playground, cafe, grassed area, picnic & BBQ spot. Pay $ for chairlift. Loved it, beautiful grounds, friendly & knowledgeable staff. Would go regularly if I lived in Launceston üòä"
"The walk up the gorge on the left-hand side of the river provided some dramatic views of the other (very steep and rocky) side.  Returning on the right-hand side made for a good walk, though hardly as hard as the signs indicated."
"Went here as we arrived in Launceston. Not too far so walked from our hotel and strolled the easier route through the gorge to the cafe and stopped for a snack [icecream for me!]. Pretty gorge with easy paths to navigate, suitable for all walking abilities and ages."
The Cataract Gorge was just lovely. It was a beautiful walk along the path with lots of walkers/joggers keeping fit. The scenery was relaxing and awe inspiring. Thinking about the Gorge in flood and seeing the historical pictures along the way made it a great experience.
Really enjoyed the visit. Parked up the street to avoid paid parking in the main reserve car park and walked in. Headed over the suspension bridge and walk to Penny Royal and back again. The walk was fantastic with lovely views and some informative plaques outlining history of note. A relaxing couple of hours.
Walked to Power Station. Some steep hills but great scenery. Tired the kids out which is always a good thing.
"What a day at reserve. Lift chair is too good. It‚Äôs a small ride but views are breathtaking. Swimming pool, cafes and walk on suspension bridge is unforgettable."
"The circuit around the gorge was not difficult, but did involve lot of small hills. There is a more strenuous zig zag hike that can be done in the other side of the gorge for the intrepid. The gorge itself was nice enough, though fell short of spectacular or memorable. Walking distance from the city center so would recommend walking not driving."
"This is a must when visiting Launceston- chair lift across the gorge and grounds is a delightful and scenic ride for young and old.  Do as little or as much as you like- walk the scenic tracks, swim in the gorge or just sit back at the cafe and ‚Äògorge‚Äô yourself on the tasty cuisine whilst surrounded by friendly and colourful peacocks .  Alternatively, take a picnic lunch and enjoy a shady spot in the glorious surrounds.  A wonderful, relaxing day out."
"Drove about 10 minutes from Launceston centre and was blown away by the views here. Have to say the pool is a random part of the scenery but it's a very family friendly place, somewhere to eat and a cable cart that goes across the river-  that was fun!   Good if you're looking for exercise as you can take the bridge across and easy if you don't want to over exert yourself. Saw some friendly wallabies,too!"
"A beautiful setting that is surprisingly close to the CBD. Loved the surrounding walks, swimming pool and kids play ground."
"Myself and my partner started at the basin and took the chair lift. From there we did a short climb to a viewing point then did the 15 minute walk to kings bridge from there we came back by the zig zag route. It's a bit steep but not difficult, ending up back in the basin where there's a cafe. Good visit and we'll worth a trip. However when we got back to the Carpark our car and many others had received a $25 fine as there is no signage I felt this was a bit of a tourist trap we couldn't even see a parking meter. Disappointed to See this happening In Australia as it's more of the kind of thing you'd expect in Bali or Thailand."
"This was the perfect activity after a long road trip to Launceston. We rode the lift one way and walked back across the wooden bridge. Easy walk. Wallabies and pademelons and peacocks to see at the end of the lift. The gorge itself was one of the more idyllic and impressive ones we‚Äôve seen. Recommended, especially with kids."
"Imagine my disappointment on arriving at the Cataract George, and there was no access for a disabled person to get to the tearooms and the peacocks we had enjoyed morning tea with 12 years ago. Due to my disability I could not walk down to the tearooms because of the steep slope, and the distance."
We had a relaxed morning at Cataract Gorge. There are walks of all varieties. Gorgeous place! We partially walked the zigzag trail and saw a number of wallabies and variety of birds. We also enjoyed the walk along the suspension bridge. Paths are accessible for all but as expected a few hills. The ‚Äúinclinator‚Äù allows for those less able bodied to avoid some of the hills and get down to lower level. We enjoyed a nice meal at the cafe. Cafe was clean and staff friendly. Meals enjoyable. Parking costs...we paid $2 for two hours and it is a maximum of $6 if you wish to stay longer.
Visiting ‚ÄòThe Gorge‚Äô should be a priority when visiting Launceston and even more so if you are a swimmer. The water ranges from around 18C in summer to 10C in winter and there are swimmers there all year. The fresh deep water contrast with the ocean that is more commonly swum around the picturesque South Island of Australia.
"Had a relaxing afternoon walking around the gorge. So many tracks that give you pleasant views around the gorge. Didn't do the chairlift but if you're thinking of doing it, it's $16 return or $13 one way for an adult. If you're lucky you'll see some peacocks. There's also a pool. If you want to swim in the gorge it looks like you can. The suspension bridge is pretty neat too."
A beautiful place to visit loved the lye birds in their natural surroundings. Enjoyed the chair lift which gave a great overview
"Have been there before, but this time I did a walk through the reserve a must do. The weather was prefect great facilities"
Worth having a look. There's a couple of nice walks. Recommend the chair lifts they are cool. Even go down there and have a picnic. There is a cafe.
