So much hype. So many rowdy tourist. Don't understand what's the big deal. No parking and difficult to get around.
The walls change every year.  Lots of new restaurants and shops in the area.  Sign up for a tour at the store.  It‚Äôs $20 and worth the money.  Ask for Lance Durham.  Lance is very knowledgeable and passionate about the art.#LanceDurham
Not to be missed when in Miami! Lots of very talented artists who put their soul on the walls ...Plan for 1-2 hours. Parking available at and near the site.
Brought 2 teenagers at night (7:45) and everyone enjoyed the art and funky atmosphere. Club scene on side streets was a bit intimidating but found somewhere to eat that was casual.
"Decided to check this out after de-embarking a cruise ship. So cool, such talent! Definitely worth visiting"
Parking on the street. So much variety daily did the outdoor area- went into one or two galleries. Several Restaurants nearby.
"Beautiful walls, there was a tribute to Kobe on one wall. Didn‚Äôt have much time, but just to get a few glimpses of what Wynwood is like I enjoyed.  One wall had a coyote and a Peacock which is seen often in Arizona."
"Must-do for Instagrammers. So much to see for free. Such vibrant colors and art happening all around you. People were taking their modded cars around to do photoshoots in front of their favorite pieces. Don't miss Cielito Artisan Pops when you're there.  We had a pineapple mint popsicle with chocolate and coconut on it-- such a nice refresher after a long walk. Really cute cafes in the area, too!"
It was a fun evening. Great place to look at street arts and dine. Wear comfortable shoes because it‚Äôs a long walk. Stop by El Patio for some Latin music and dance.
"Loved this, the art work and atmosphere of the place, there‚Äôs so many great walls of art and a couple of indoor area‚Äôs with smaller modern art pieces- all incredible. Out of all the places I visited in Miami this was my favourite. If after visiting here you walk a couple of minutes down the road there‚Äôs a place called Wynwood Market place. It has a couple of bars and food trucks, small pieces of art and crafts to buy plus you can watch graffiti artists creating artwork. I can‚Äôt recommend these places enough"
Loved this area of Miami - The walls are so amazing and then wondering round the streets looking at all the art work on the walls and the pavement.  Really enjoyed the few hours we spent here and would definitely recommend.
"Stopped here during a Big Bus Tour. Got there right before they opened, long line to get in. Once in the crowd kinda dispersed and you are able to see things easily.  Very impressive artwork that changes. There are also murals on the streets surrounding. Unbelievable that it is a free thing to do. Highly reccomend if you have some time to spare. There is a shop and a couple art galleries inside. Didn't go into the restaurant, but looked cute. Fun find."
We did a tour and this was part of that itinerary. There is so many tributes and graffiti and wall art all over this area. Great locations to take a Instagram friendly photo! Get your camera ready!
"Loved it! This place is super cool and interesting, they have murals from current artists and is just a great place to spend a morning or afternoon.Perfect for your instagram pics!"
A wide variety of art styles with very interesting designs. Foot traffic was steady as people were heading to eat. Encouraging to see the revitalization happening in the area.
Good place to visit for a few hours. Good eats nearby and the artwork is amazing. Parking is a pain though. Have to pay to park.
Based on word of mouth decided to pay this spot a visit. It's free and well worth it! Especially if your an art lover. Even if you just want something to do on a weekend in miami!
What an amazing display of art. Displayed on walls and in a gallery too. Restaurant on site. Hugely creative and a must-see if in town.
"This nice place displays some artistic works. Nice place to visit for free, where some graffitis can be seen. Spend some time  into the buildings with tech. painting. worth going."
"We highly recommend to come here over the weekend to skip the crowds. Pls also remember that the key graffities are opened up at given hours. If you are slightly too late, no worries, there is a lot to see around. Watch out for a few tourist traps parkings in the close proximity."
What a wonderful gift to an area.  Beautiful art and a great ‚Äúvibe.‚Äù I loved it all.  Don‚Äôt miss it! I loved the surrounding area as much as I did the actual walls.  The Pepto Bismarck colored butterfly location was my absolute favorite. What amazing creativity.
"The Wynwood Walls are beautiful. Had an amazing time, made all the more special with a super informative tour. Go and enjoy, and ask for Lance."
What a pleasure to find this treasure in Miami! The most beautifully creative graffiti art I‚Äôve ever seen. As special to Miami as the wonderful mural art is to Philly. Don‚Äôt miss it!!!
If your in Miami this is an awesome place to stop. The art is amazing. The graffiti museum was very helpful explaining art the artist in the neighborhood. Loved it!!!
Decided to go out to wynwood Walls based off of recommendations on what to do in Miami on trip advisor. We chose to rent bikes and bike from Miami Beach to wynwood Walls. Probably the biking itself and going across the bridges was more enjoyable than anything else. Wynwood Walls itself was not overly impressive to me. I guess it just depends on what you're into. Much of it just looks like graffiti to me. Some of it was very beautiful though. Definitely hit or miss.üòê
A definite in your visit to Miami!  Leave time to walk thru the different buildings that have been painted.  It will be worth your time.
Strolling around by foot in Wynwood and you cannot miss the Walls. Quite amazing and when you are tired you can find good restaurants everywhere.
"Easiest fun - go, see, enjoy ! Surrounded by a cool scene - of which the walls are a fundamental component - of people, sights, sounds and tastes."
"Street art is always big, bold, and in your face. Walls in Wynwood is one of the great street art experiences. Don't miss it!"
"It is a must while in Miami! The Wynwood walls area was vibrant and fun to explore. Lots of colors and local art work, also some tasty places to eat in the district. Loved it!"
"Not many free things you can do in Florida. My whole family enjoyed the art, parking was relatively close and easy even though is was one of the busiest travel weeks of the year in Miami. We spent about 45 min there, well worth the detour into the city. Driving there was pretty easy."
We started at the main Wynwood Walls commercial area and went through the various galleries and mural areas. Really enjoyed the diversity of artists that were represented there. We also walked the neighbourhood a bit to explore the murals everywhere else. Ended up at Wynwood Brewing for a couple pints. Would recommend the area and the brewery for a visit while in Miami.
Find a parking spot ( maybe hard to find) . Wear comfortable shoes as it is not limited to 2520 address. Walk around there is plenty of artwork on other streets
Very beautiful made for a nice afternoon.  Def worth taking a look.  Walking around the district is filled with very beautiful murals and nice restaurants
"Taking a tour of the graffiti wall art is well worth the  price. There are many types of tours, walking, small open bus, and different lengths of time. Our tour guide was very well informed on the history of the walls and the artists."
