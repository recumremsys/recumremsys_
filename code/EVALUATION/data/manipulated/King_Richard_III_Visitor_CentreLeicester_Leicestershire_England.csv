Live in Leicester but had never been to the exhibition before. Really well put together. Very informative. Enjoyed it. Cafe good too.
"Went to a networking event held here. I must say it was very clean, neat and atmospheric. Everything was laid out well and easy to navigate around. Not something for little ones."
Visited with colleagues for our team building event. Had never visited before and heard mixed reviews. We found it interesting and lots to read and fair bit to see. Liked the sculptures too. The video at the beginning could have been more interesting/interactive.Would recommend to someone visiting Leicester and wanting to know more about King Richard the third. A shame the site or company does not accept Amex cards!
"Very impressed with the visitor centre. I visited with two Australian friends and they loved it. Lots of information for read and very modern. The centre does not take a long time to get around, so I would recommend taking time to read the information as you could be out within 10 mins if rushed. Don’t miss out on the stairs as the centre goes up the stairs which is worth seeing and great for kids too."
Been here for private visits and took a group of primary school children here.A fantastic 'new' attraction in the centre of Leicester. The area has had a massive lift with Good King Richard moving to Leicester and all the new investment and development to match.I'd say a visit to the cathedral is a must to see the burial stone for RIII.
"Visited this centre on Monday, 15th April.  Absolutely brilliant!  I'm no history buff but it was interesting and very well presented.  Loads of information and visual presentation.  Would really recommend it.  Possibly not for very children but anyone over the age of about 10 would be able to understand most of it."
"Had a great time with my daughter yesterday - excellent displays and guides were friendly and knowledgeable - a special mention for the two young men on the front desk who were both welcoming and helpful. We found the whole experience both interesting and emotional. Came away feeling we had a real understanding of Richard and his history. We also went across to the Cathedral to see where Richard is interred, again a very moving experience. Very highly recommended to anyone interested in Richard and his life. We will definitely return."
"A really informative, interesting visit. Loads of information. Amazing to believe you can see part of the carpark through a glass floor section where Richard's remains were found. Had a visit to Leicester Cathedral to see where he is buried."
Very interesting and well worth a visit. Allow enough time to read all the panels. The staff were pleasant and helpful.
Visiting this exhibition was the reason for our trip to Leicester and it was certainly worth it. Interesting informative and surprisingly moving.
"Came here on a VERY wet Wednesday and spent two hours going round this thoroughly enjoyable exhibition. So much information and the staff/volunteers are so knowledgeable. Didn’t even had to check my watch at all, so interesting. The cafe has a good selection of hot and cold drinks and a good selection of snacks. Also spotlessly clean. The actual tomb is across the street in Leicester Cathedral. Best to visit the Experience first as it explains his life . Also, when purchasing tickets from the Experience, you can go back within the year for free!Brilliant, well done Leicester!"
Wasn't sure what to expect but found the information and exhibitions really interesting. The building is lovely and worth a wander around on it's own. The price is ridiculously good as you can come back for free anytime in the next 12 months!
Enjoyed our visit to the Richard lll visitor centre. Plenty to see and lots to learn. I was interested in what these clever people could tell from a load of old bones about how Richard had died and which wounds were inflicted after death. The guide was very knowledgable. We will visit again.
"A beautifully presented exhibition and exposure of the story of 'finding Richard'.  It was well presented, fascinating and full of interest.   The space over the area in which he was found was superb, very moving and had a great affect on us - I couldn't stop thinking about him.   Recommended as a visit for everyone."
One of the best visitor centres. Just a stones throw from the cathedral and tomb of Richard lll. Very informative. Well laid out. Lovely cafe. Friendly staff.Fabulous to be able to look through the glass floor to the actual grave where he was found too. Wasn’t expecting that!
Really interesting place and great history. Staff were all brilliant answered all our questions and smiled! Recommended for a visit.
visited with my 3 young children. i did look up on their website and read about having art and crafts activities but when i got there it was only a small table with 3 chairs in cafe for children to do that. there was too much writing on walls and my kids were not at all interested only in last room they got to stood on glass floor and did dressing up. overall it is not for young children and was disappointed as wasted one family activity which we did not enjoy and it should not be included on the stay play and explore package
A brilliant museum and well planned visitor routes. Used high ideas to show the background to the death of Richard and immerse us in the heat of battle.  The story of the dig and the science behind in identifying the remains was brilliant. Our grandchildren remained focused and thoroughly enjoyed it. The visit ended visiting the new tomb again with good explanations.
Fabulous day out. So well presented and made very interesting by use of historic artefacts and brilliant cgi shows. Lovely lunch in friendly cafe then up to modern story accompanied by interactive boards and reconstructions.    Add a clipboard and question sheet and the 6 yr old was in heaven    Thoroughly recommend it
"Do not miss a chance to visit the visitor centre or the Cathedral. I originate from Leicester and used to work on King Richards Road. there was a plaque next door which read 'Near this place lie the remains of Richard III'  and I always wondered exactly where they were. I can't believe I used to pass within yards of his resting place every day. I think the effort put into finding him was amazing and it does seem right that he remains in Leicester.I eventually got to the Cathedral and Visitor Centre this year and can't recommend it highly enough - young and old will find it fascinating.On a final note, take the time to sample the food in the restaurant it's delicious."
Well set out exhibition leading one through events and places and people.  Just the right mixture of visual info combined with information boards to read.The grave site of Richard was staffed by  a lady who answered our questions with great enthusiasm and knowledge. Thank you
"Visited on a September Sunday morning. Had some trouble finding the place due to a lack of signage. Not quite sure what to expect when we arrived. Pleasantly surprise on the upside. Upstairs exhibit on discovery of Richard III body a little self congratulatory. Knight fighting was fantastic – a little too realistic. Overall, worth a visit. Good value for money."
Visited three times now - love it. A lot of historical facts to read about and some interactive parts to have a go with make it a really interesting couple of hours.
"Our party of 36 friends and family visited the Richard 111 centre and had a guided tour by the manager.  Having a guide really made a difference, he was very informative and capably answere all the difficult questions we asked him.  He also managed to do it in the short timescale we gave him.  Highly recommended"
Went to this place by passing by guest. Didnt realised there is so much to see and do. Lots of free stuff as well as paid ones. I only had 25mins to spare but I was very happy with my first visit. I need atleast few hours to explore the place. I think winter time is the best to visit as less crowd and lots to do indoors
"A great mix of history and story of a truly remarkable modern day discovery. The staff/guides are very friendly and helpful. Very well laid out and presented. Good café there, my only complaint being that it was a bit on the chilly side (room temperature). I highly recommend that the visit be combined with a look around the cathedral, too, where there is a lot more to see and, again, very helpful guides. Don't miss the short audio visual guides in both the visitor centre and the cathedral. Overall an amazing experience."
Very interesting place to visit. So much information to look at and read. Absolutely fascinating. Need to go again as ran out of time to read everything. A great place to learn about Leicester’s king.
"very informative , lots to see and do. Gives lots of details about the wars of the roses , the battle of Bosworth and the death of Richard the third. Amazing to see how they discovered his body and the actual grave site. The cathedral is right beside the centre and you can then go and see the tomb , very moving."
"This visitor centre is superb! Lots of visuals and audio information. Excellent written detail too and chronology available. We had a little stop half way round for a light lunch, as there is a lot to take in. The upstairs exhibits which focus on ‘The King in the Carpark’ are excellent. Lots to see and some interaction required with the exhibits. The guide/demonstrator with the sword and weaponry is incredible, well informed and very enthusiastic. Engage with him!The cathedral nearby if impressive with Richard’s tomb centre stage. Helpful staff in the cathedral are on hand to inform visitors about Richard and the cathedral. A fantastic visit which needs a few hours but well worth it. I am planning to return! This part of Leicester is beautiful - with cobbled/paved streets, ancient houses, pubs, deli style shops and coffee houses."
"Been wanting to visit for a while. Went to Leicester in March 2015 to see King Richard III's procession through the city so ony took me 3 1/2 years to return!!!Parked in St Nicholas Car Park (£9 for 4 hours) had no idea how to get there, poor signage so just headed for the Cathedral Spire!The Visitor Centre is opposite the CathedralIts an £8.95 adult admission price (that also means that you can revisit for up to a year but they need photo/ signature id!) wonder how many people do????The lady on the ticket desk said there was a school party in but they were halfway throgh. When we walked in the kids were there watching a film, shuffling about with teachers telling them to be quiet etc. Then when they had finished they made such a racket! other visitors doing the SSSHHHHHHH technique  to deaf ears, even the centre staff did nothing!The short film is intersting, Very effective lighing on the throne with two roses laid on it.Theres a side room but There is a LOT  of stuff to read, in fact a little too much. It should have had a mix of both,( there are interactve screens you can press with interviews upstairs), but wou;d have been better to have footage of the dig that discovered him, procession etc. we walked into the second downstairs room and the kids there again being noisy so gave it a miss!!!!Upstarirs there are some more boards to read, few costumes, and recreation of his bones. Also a recreation of his head/ Then you go back down to see the actual burial site he was discovered in. Its got a perspex floor, and they superimposed through lighting a silouette of his skeleton on the earth   . Very eerie but effective there was a volunteer and few people in there, but nothing else, such as audio. Maybe quiet reflective medieval music would have been a nice touch??The cafe was nice and reasonably priced. Gift shop is as you enter, minimal stock and overpriced I felt.Yes pleased I went, NOT pleased we had to endure noisy kids. I suggested by email  to the centre that the children that vist be given seperate times when museum not open. after all they are not paying but visitors like me and others that day, so its really unfair.Opposite is the King Richard III Statue  thats lovely, and Cathedral where he is buried opposite,Enjoyed parts of the visit, more physical items needed to bring the story alive. would have given this 3 stars but seemed unfiar so it only scraped through as a very good as I was in a generous mood! The Cathedral asks for donations on entry."
"Wasn’t expecting to enjoy this as much as we did. Very well presented stepping through the historical and political context of Richard III time, his performance as a monarch, the story of the discovery of his remains and blended with the science around the discovery. Good interactive displays. Culminates in seeing the excavation where he was found. Cross the road to the cathedral and visit the final resting place."
Highly recommend. Fascinating to find out how the remains were discovered. Doesn't take too long to visit. Very central for visiting the rest of Leicester town centre
"We enjoyed our visit here very much; the displays give a good context to the Wars of the Roses and the upstairs exhibition, giving details of the archaeological dig and the scientific identification of Richard III's body are particularly fascinating. Being able to see the grave site is a moving experience, especially as you can then go across the road to see Richard III's tomb in the cathedral."
"I had heard about the centre and was interested in the story of Richard III's rediscovery, got a Groupon to attend with the kids and wasn't expecting much. Was pleasantly surprised by how informative and engaging the exhibits are, going right from Richard's family history and reign to the archaeological and forensic techniques used to find him. At each stage there are interactive/kid-friendly elements which keeps the whole family interested. Volunteers/staff are wonderful, everyone seemed to be chatting to visitors and answering questions. The children were also offered a 'quest' with various questions/activities to complete. They earned a badge for this at the end. There's also a well-stocked craft table in the cafe and a dressing up area at the end of the museum. Parking is limited but its well located in the centre of Leicester, and it's a nice stroll through the city to get there from public transport. Also don't forget to nip to the cathedral after to see Richard III's tomb.We really enjoyed our morning here, you come away with a greater understanding of Plantagenet life and times, but also an appreciation for the hard work and dedication of the historians, following the clues to a car park after 530 years. The centre is a fitting tribute to that achievement, as well as an interesting place to visit."
Covers history and the scientific extremely well.   Volunteer staff greatly improved experience with one-on-one description and info.
