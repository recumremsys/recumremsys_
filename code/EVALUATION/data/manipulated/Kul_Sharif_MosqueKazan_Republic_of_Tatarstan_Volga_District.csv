This may be a new mosque compared to others around the world but it's still beautiful. Took photos day and night. The interior is also impressive and its good to spend some quiet time in there when prayers are beung held. One of the symbols of kazan .
"Seems people are divided on this one, but for me it's one of the most beautiful mosques I've seen, particularly outside, day and night. Very photogenic in my eyes and ideally situated within the Kremlin."
"Heard a lot of good things about that Mosque before visiting it today.I must have taken 100 shots of it, while still could stopped shooting. All angles look good and with great lucks I saw new weds posing for professional shots with the Mosque as the backdrop.kazanians are so lucky!!!"
"Iâ€™m very well travelled around the Islamic world and have seen great many stunning examples of Islamic architecture of different schools and styles. While not without charm â€“ I was particularly fascinated by its slim beautiful minarets and most scenic location â€“ Kul Sharif was not the most impressive mosque Iâ€™ve ever been to. It is relatively new and conveys no ambience of centuries. But of course, keeping in mind we are in Russia, it looks fairly impressive as it is.My experience of visiting Kul Sharif was a bit disappointing. At the time of no service the mosque is turned into some kind of a walk-in museum, and as such loses its spirit completely. Thereâ€™s no division for male/female parts. All visitors are allowed to ascend the narrow stairs to the balcony to watch the mosque interior from up there. The balcony is small and becomes crowded fast enough. Compared to the richest decoration of the mosques in, for instance, Shiraz or Abu Dhabi, the interior of Kul Sharif is somewhat simple and restrained. When I was there, the main hall was almost unlit and looked grim. And that took away much of the interior beauty. You donâ€™t take your shoes off when entering Kul Sharif; they sell one-use boot covers for RUR 3 at the entrance. There are also skirts and headscarves, so even if you are not dressed properly for attending a mosque, you can use these, should you wish to enter. Of course, Kul Sharif is quite a prominent landmark of Kazan and cannot be missed. It provides for fantastic photo opportunities, especially from the outside, as a part of Kremlin ensemble. But I enjoyed modest ancient mosques in the Old Tatar Sloboda much more."
"Compared to the mosques in Central Asia, the Middle East and N Africa, this was nothing special to look at. The best thing was how relaxed it was inside. If only Islam was as tolerant around the world as it is in Kazan, the world would be much better."
"The mosque is gorgeous. Make sure you go there both in the day time and at night - completely different experience. There is no attendance fee, but if you find a good city guide in advance - you will enjoy the mosque even more!"
"This Mosque is extremely beautiful. Both from the inside and outside. There were many Russian tourists, and significantly a lot more than foreign tourists. Remember to dress modestly as this is a mosque, and to respect the culture, cover up your hair, shoulders, arms, and legs (for women) - in the winter, a beanie and a scarf would suffice.It was great for me because I understand Russian, however, if you do not speak or read the language, it can be slightly challenging."
"the mosque is picture perfect. what a beautiful building. in the sun light the outside shines. inside the mosque the chandelier grabs your eye. the bright blue, white and gold colours are stunning. we thoroughly enjoyed our visit. bring 3r per person for booties. headscarves available at the entrance. islamic museum was closed unfortunately which is my reason for deducting one point. we visited on a Tues and monday is usually the day places are closed."
"Given the relatively young age of this mosque, it is very beautiful. Make sure you go to the visitors gallery for the full feel of the place. I would imagine that Friday prayer times are very special, if you can time your visit."
It was the most beautiful mosque I've seen(outside). Free entrance. Go to left or right  upstairs - nice vision! Downstair museum is small and main parts of it are books - 200rub.  Wasn't interesting for me
"This mosque is large, stunning, over-the-top and worth a visit while at the Kazan Kremlin.  It is more about the architecture and decor than anything spiritual feeling.   Definitely walk up to the balcony where you see the interior of the mosque from up high.   Do not bother with going downstairs to the museum and paying to see some pages out of books or old coins.  Not worth it at all.  Head scarves like all the Russian tourist churches are provided for the women."
The mosque is beautiful on the outside. Do not miss the opportunity to go inside and see the beauty within. Climb the stairs to the tourist balcony and admire the stained glass windows and Islamic calligraphy.
"Completed in 2005 and formerly (I believe) the biggest Mosque in Russia, the Kul-Sharif Mosque is certainly worth a visit if you are in Kazan. Entry is free but you are required to pay 2 roubles for the some plastic shoe covers. The Mosque is truly breath taking and I recommend walking up to the viewing platform at the top of Mosque, where you can get a very good view of the ceiling."
"So much history, so much beauty!  I felt incredibly welcome. What a Beautiful Mosque. Be sure to climb Up to the Balcony to get a good view of this grandiose building.  A must see when visiting Kazan."
I have never seen such a beautiful Mosque before. I have been seeing image of this Mosque so many times but I never imagined I will be able to come this far to stand in front of this Mosque. It looks great with the blue sky behind because it's shining with white and blue. Go there with your camera to take good photos or else you will regret ðŸ˜ŠA must visit place in Russia I must say. I would also suggest to spend a days or two in Kazan to know more about the city.
"I am a fan of religious architecture, so this is the building I came to Kazan to see. It does not disappoint. From the outside, the mosque is stunning, especially at night when it lights up gold and green. Climb the steps inside to look down on the place of worship from a balcony. Ladies, your hair must be covered. Babushkas inside will do it for you if you don't."
The nightly view in combination with the Kremlin is Stunning when looking at it from the Most Millennium Bridge. Bring a tripod for stunning pictures. The Wolga river and Kazanka river will give a stunning background around sunset.
Beautiful and well-preserved mosque in the city of Kazan. Make sure to pay it a visit when visiting Kazan.
"Beautiful mosque. Not to be missed in Kazan. Right inside Kremlin. Has balconies for tourists to see inside, Muslim culture museum. Typical of Tatar style of mosque architecture, different from Arab mosques. Loved it inside, nice from outside. If you visit in an inappropriate clothing, the covers are provided for free. Recommend to see and visit."
"Very nice, you can walk around, even had an art exhibition.  Very pretty throughout. Watch out for guided groups who think they own the place."
Fantastic place to visit built in the grounds of the Kremlin. A must to visit and enjoy the beautiful painted walls and ceilings. Accept the dress code required for entering the mosque.
Certainly worth a visit. It's very new but built and designed with a nice touch. Make a good shot of the mosque from the tower on the city wall.
"walk around the place in the day and the night, its gorgeous. you can walk inside if you cover your head and be moderately dressed"
"Situated on top of Kazan's white Kremlin, with its blue and white slim architecture it is extremely beautiful building. Very pitoresque, visible from far away, even from the plane, in my opinion the most beautiful mosques (outside) which I have ever seen (and I have seen many)."
"Located inside Kremlin, impressive architecture, situated next to the Cathedral. The small stores nearby house nice stuff."
This is a must-go in Kazan. Lies within the walls of Kazan Kremlin. Take a short look in the basement where you can find cultural stuff about the Islamic history in Russia.
"Firstly, mosques are rarely seen in Russia. Then, at the time of writing, there are not many Singaporeans who have visited Russia nor are they familiar with Russia, let alone visit the city of Kazan. Nevertheless, I believe this will change in time to come. Whenever I share my photos with friends about visiting Russia, I will also include a picture of this place - the Kulâ€™Sharif Mosque. Kazan is a major city in the republic of Tatarstan and I must say, together with the Kazan Kremlin and other major landmarks such as the Suyumbikye Tower can be considered the symbols of Kazan. This mosque is not as big and grand as the Blue Mosque of Istanbul, Turkey. Nevertheless, one does not need to always be big and grand in order to stand out.The Qul Sharif mosque is big, spacious and modern( rebuilt in 2005 as a replacement to the original Kul Sharif mosque which was built almost 500years ago. It has its own beauty in the interior design and architecture. Inside the mosque, one can go up to the upper floor where you can have a nice view of the inside of the mosque. As with many religious sites, religious customs have to be followed but its good to know that thereâ€™s no major restrictions in camera use.All in all, if you are visiting the Kazan Kremlin, I would recommend coming inside this mosque. Recommended!"
"... both outside and in. Opulent, dramatic, atmospheric. Climb to the viewing platform inside if you are able, the views are breathtaking."
Beautiful mosque :) As a visitor you can go on the second floor. Take something with you to cover your head.
Located in the Kazan Kremlin complex the Kul Sharif Mosque is stunningly beautiful both during the day and at night when it is lit up.  A must see.
"Probablyy the number 1 landmark symbol of Kazan. A beautiful and sublime building. See it at dusk, floodlit and amazing."
It is literally one of the most amazing things I ever saw in my life! I was there on a business trip in May 2008 and had some time during the day to visit this mosque. It is very nice both on the outside as on the inside. And it is even more amazing in the evening with all these beautiful colors! To be honest I still remember this mosque as if I just saw it. Left a strong impression.
"The stunning Kul Sharif Masjid inside Kazan's Kremlin, was built to replace the fabled masjid of the Kazan Khanate, which was destroyed by Ivan the Terrible in 1552. It is the largest masjid in Europe outside of Turkey. The original masjid had eight minarets and some scholars speculate that architectural elements of the mosque can be seen in  St Basil's Cathedral in Moscow (8 minarets & a central cupola, atypical in Russian architecture). The interior is just breathtaking. Zoom in to see the splendour of the chandelier in the third interior picture. They switched it on for us but it was too blinding to photograph well."
"she is beautiful and I admire her. best kremlin out of Nizhny Novgorod and Vladimir. Don't delay, Kul Sharif Today!"
"Dropping by on a winter evening, it was a stunning experience being able to enter and experience the overwhelming atmosphere of this great mosque. Walking through the Kazan Kremlin the mosque is a unique landmark.  Nicely lit it attracts attention from far away. An absolute must see"
