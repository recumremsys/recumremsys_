"Visiting the Wildlife SOS bear and elephant sanctuaries in Agra was one of the highlights of my India tour early in 2020. In both instances the private tours were led by knowledgeable and caring staff, the facilities were excellent and the level of commitment and compassion towards the animals was inspiring. Each animal receives personalised care tailored to their specific history and traumas, and it was wonderful to see them living out their lives in such a wonderful environment. It was also so heartening to hear that the SOS program involves the retraining and employment of previous owners and their wives, and education of their children. This ensures that the families have other options and futures that do not include exploiting and abusing elephants and bears. It is not possible to just arrive at the sanctuaries, but entrance can be organised and paid in advance. I would highly recommend both sanctuaries, their professionalism and the security they bring to the animals in their care."
"I toured both the sloth bear and elephant sanctuaries run by Wildlife SOS on the same day. The experiences – especially interacting with the elephants - were more memorable to me than visiting the Taj Mahal. Each of these sanctuaries is worth visiting for the opportunity to see these animals up close. Wildlife SOS does commendable work and the staff were very friendly and knowledgeable about the care of and challenges facing both species in India. Walking with and feeding the elephants was a highlight of my entire month in India. Everyone should visit the elephant sanctuary before thinking about riding an elephant (you shouldn’t) as the life of a captive elephant is often unbearably cruel and inhumane. I’m thankful for the work of Wildlife SOS in rescuing, rehabilitating and caring for these magnificent creatures, and all they do for India's wildlife."
"Four of us travelled from Delhi to visit the Bear and Elephant Sanctuaries in one day. A long, hot day, and we almost missed the (we thought) badly-positioned 'WSOS' Bear Sanctuary Sign along the roadside (the signage needs to be clearer in relation to the access off the main road, the Bird Sanctuary, etc) but all was very rewarding when we finally got there. The dedication, care and concern of the Wildlife SOS Teams for the rescued bears is wonderful to see, and offers real delight as you witness how the bears are clearly happy and responding to good food, care and human affection. Do keep a camera with you - we were given a chance to take photos in one place even if it says you can't take photos generally (it might frighten the bears). Wear walking shoes as well - some 271 types of snake inhabit the same forest you are walking in!Try to go in the less hot part of the day as the bears tend to stay in the shade or down out of sight in the real heat. The centre is very well arranged and set up, with friendly, thoughtful staff only too happy to answer questions and show you around - and great fun as the bears snuffle your scent through the wire!"
"My sister and I recently had the opportunity to visit the Wildlife SOS sanctuary for Bears and Elephants during our trip to India. Whilst we went with high hopes to see the amazing work the team do, our expectations were exceeded in every sense of the word. From the moment we arrived and throughout our entire day trip ( we arrived at 9am and left at 5.30pm) we were walked through the entire establishment and explained the incredible work the team do there. We had the great fortune to see these beautiful animals up close, who had endured much hardship prior to coming to the sanctuary, to now be at peace and thriving in these beautiful surrounds of their natural habitat. It was also so great to hear the additional work the team does with the local schools and tribal families that would have previously been involved in the bear and elephant trades, and how they are providing additional resources to educate their children and provide work for the women ( some of their beautiful crafts are also on sale in the local shop)A must visit in my book... We will definitely return some day. Thank you so much to Rishik and the team for our unforgettable day with them and these beautiful creatures.."
"Visiting the Elephant Conservation & Care Centre in Mathura was a wonderful experience - we are so glad that our tour guide included this in our India itinerary. We visited in January 2020 and were shown around by Harendra Singh (Education & Logistics Officer), whose passion as well as his extraordinary respect for the animals in care was very evident. He described to us the personalities and the likes and dislikes of each elephant. At the time of our visit two elephants, Mia and Rhea, were out on their daily walk with their volunteer keepers. At fairly close range, we were able to watch the pair freely roam and forage in a large paddock.The elephants at the centre have been rescued from situations of abuse or neglect. The facility provides for them a safe peaceful haven, and it was inspiring to witness the caring efforts of the staff and volunteers. There is also a small café and shop selling interesting handicrafts, T-shirts etc.I highly recommend including this visit in your itinerary. It is magnificent to see the work going on and to hear about the successes that Wildlife SOS has had rescuing elephants and also the sloth bears in India."
Wildlife SOS is a haven for abused/neglected animals in India! I was with a volunteer group and amazed at what they are able to do in helping elephants and sloth bears! Will definitely plan to go back again to spend more time doing what I can do to help. Bless the workers and volunteers for caring so much!
"I highly recommend visiting and especially volunteering with the Wildlife SOS center, which is very accessible from Delhi, Agra and Mathura.  If you contact the volunteer coordinators (their contact info is listed on the website), they will arrange for your transportation from the nearest train or bus station.  Volunteering there costs some money, but they do justifiably need quite a bit of funding in order to maintain their highly respected and efficient operation, and volunteering includes accommodations and food.  This was the most powerful part of my month-long voyage traveling through India.  I learned so much about the history and current state of abuse of these magnificent, beautiful, worthy-of-life animals, and I learned even more about the most effective ways to change the system and the culture to respect these animals and care for them in the long term. There are several elephant rescue centers in the world, but only a small handful of such centers are well-respected due to their ethical practices. Some other ""rescue centers"" still allow volunteers to ride the animals or interact with them in ways that are unhealthy. This particular one is also effective because it not only rescues and cares for the animals, it also works at the governmental, political, and educational level to increase awareness across India to change the culture around this.  AND the organization provides employment opportunities and job training to the very individuals who were formerly earning their income by exploiting the animals. So, they intervene at all levels possible.  It is heartbreaking, beautiful, very important work. I highly recommend getting involved. I will carry this memory with me forever."
Had a pleasant morning visiting the SOS wildlife sanctuary. We were the only 2 people there and had a tour by a worker who was a friend of our guide coincidentally. Feel that they could attract a lot more paying visitors with some professional marketing help.
"I've just spent two weeks volunteering at Wildlife SOS's elephant and bear sanctuaries and can't recommend it enough. WSOS work tirelessly to rescue & rehabilitate elephants and bears used and abused for tourism and religion in India. The keepers seem to genuinely care for the animals and although they will never be able to be released back into the wild, this is the next best place for them after being in captivity for so many years. The animals spend their days eating, sleeping, bathing and playing and it is heart-warming to see them being allowed to just be themselves. WSOS also supports the previous owners of dancing bears and elephants and their families by hiring them at the sanctuary, educating them and offering healthcare. The women are supported to make items that are sold in the sanctuary's shops and the children encouraged to attend school. It is an incredible organisation not only for animals but also for the people of India, its economy and future.Please do not support the abuse of animals by taking elephant rides or giving money for elephant owners, regardless of whether it's at a temple or being used for religious reasons. Check out Refuse To Ride for more information and do your research before going to any sanctuary or zoo anywhere in the world."
"Recently visited the sloth bear sanctuary. I booked an Agra tour through Tripadvisor with I thought included tickets to the rescue centre, turns out it didn't and we just turned up (very confusing for everyone) We got lucky and they very nicely let us in and gave us a quick little tour.It was a brilliant experience, seeing the beautiful sloth bears with their scars from their lives of dancing and seeing how happy and relaxed they were was just amazing. The guys at Wildlife SOS are doing a great job. It was really interesting to hear about their stories and see some of their cheeky characters. Being a student vet nurse I was very impressed with the level of hygiene and care. We learned about their feedings plans and why they have their particular diet. Definitely worth a visit if you're interested in wildlife rescue. One of my India Highlights."
A unique activity to do in Agra - Very educational and eye opening. Had a great time as our guide showed us around and answered ALL our questions. Will be back to volunteer next time!
We visited both the SOS bears and Elephant centre (10 minutes drive apart). The work that they do is incredible and we now donate on a monthly basis. Each tour was very informative. My daughter is considering going back to volunteer for a few weeks. I'm hoping that more tourists become aware of these fantastic sancturies. Keep up the exceptional work guys!
"I am a great fan of WSOS elephant conservation centre since Raju was rescuedThis year I finally managed to visit the centre along with my sister who lives in Delhi . It was an amazing experience. We were met by Hari at the centre who really gave us a wonderful insight into the working of the centre. We also got to see the Ellie’s being bathed, frolicking in water, having foot baths and medicated foot treatments. WSOS is doing a Wonderful job fir these Ellie’s. So much love and care  is given. And Ellie’s are finally free from chains. Thanks for the great work you fo. I highly recommend   Tourist to visit and understand about these Ellie’s . Thank you WSOS 🙏"
"Today we visited the Elephant Sanctuary ran by Wildlife SOS. Located just off the NH2 near Mathura, was a well worth visit! We arrived for the morning visit (between 9am - 11am) during our trip to Delhi from Agra. There are 3  slots available (2 hours length starting 9am, 11am and 3pm) make sure you phone up beforehand to book and check availability. As we arrived the elephants were returning from their morning 3hr walk and it was nice to see  how open and peaceful the area they have for this is. We were combined with another 2 visitors for the tour and our guide was great. He was very informative and knowledgeable about all aspects of the projects they are working on and about the individual elephants.If you are concerned about visiting an elephant site that genuinely has the best intentions of the elephants at heart then this is definitely worth going and by doing so, giving your support. Their priority is to care and treat these abused elephants in the best possible way and this is reflected in the tour considerably. The actions this organisation are taking to improve, rescue and protect these gentle giants is phenomenal. Their efforts are truly making a difference. Well worth your support and a visit."
"Went to the elephant sanctuary in August with World Challenge - most amazing organisation. So sad stories about the elephants and sloth bear but I have full faith in how much the keepers care. One of my favourite parts of the trip (and it was an outstanding trip so that's saying something). Would highly recommend to anyone interested in animals and their welfare. We went for the 2-hour visit and with the very hot and humid Agra weather, that was long enough. Would recommend phoning ahead if you' re going with young children and some of the descriptions of the torture the animals faced are horrific and graphic. Overall an outstanding place and an amazing visit. (Btw my World Challenge had 6 adult and 29 teens and everyone thought it was incredible.)"
"Much ink is here on the value and purpose of this fantastic SOS for elephants and other animals in India.The outpouring of care toward the animals is palpable. Our guide quit a day job at CitiBank to do this full time--you know it is a mission with purpose.The thought that goes into each rescue is truly amazing. Rescue is holistic. Wherever they find an elephant being abused, they ask questions about the place where the elephant is currently being put to work.  How much revenue will be lost? What benefit did the elephant bring? What other issues is the village having? To rescue an elephant, not only was money offered, but perhaps also a well dug for the village. They leave the community better than they found it.The care for the individual needs of each elephant is fascinating. While one may need to go on a diet, other may be malnourished and need to be fed.Stop on your way to the Taj Mahal; take a day trip from Delhi! Get involved. You can come stay and volunteer.This is change in action."
Visiting the Wildlife SOS conservatory was both heart breaking and heart warming. Gaining insight into the cruelty that these living beings experience is eye opening. This organization is doing fantastic work breaking the cycle. It was beautiful to see how they are rehabilitating and nurturing the elephants in their care. I strongly recommend a visit to everyone prior to visiting Jaipur. I hope to visit again in the future.
"We arranged our elephant tour directly with SOS to visit while we were in Agra. We came in October and we were given a choice between 2 time slots, we chose the 10am-12pm 2 hour short tour. Give yourself plenty of time to get from Agra to the sanctuary. Traffic can get pretty hairy outside of Agra. We were in a small group of four people. When we arrived and we were shown a pretty sad video of the way the elephants end up imprisoned. Then you sign some forms and your on your way into the sanctuary. The tour was really interesting and educational. This group is doing amazing things for elephants and they have actually eliminated the practice of dancing bears in India!  While we were there the elephants were getting fed and the crew was bathing the elephants. They looked so happy!  We got some great pics and videos!Bottom line is that you should NEVER see an elephant show and NEVER ride an elephant. The statuary needs funding to feed, care and free these elephants from their sad imprisonment. Help them out by visiting!"
A very worthwhile visit and volunteering experience to Sloth bears and elephants. Keep up the good work.
"Such an amazing place for the rescued elephants. Vipul told us about the elephants, the work they do at Wildlife SOS and told us about the horrors these beautiful creatures had to endure. It was so amazing to see these animals safe and in a happy place. Thank you Vipul and everyone at SOS Wildlife for the amazing work and showing us around!!"
"This place is wonderful. Easy to arrange a 2 hour tour around. Our guide was so passionate about the bears and the work of the charity as well. Heartbreaking to see what these incredible animals just been through and how this continues to affect them, but through the hard work of the staff at the centre they can finally have the best care possible."
"We had a wonderful experience visiting the bear sanctuary from SOS Wildlife. Call or email ahead to make a booking - we didn't know but luckily our hotel did it for us. We can highly recommend to visit SOS Wildlife to understand more of the important work they do, and to learn about the animals. It was fascinating and very touching to see the bears so close, and that they trust humans again, after all they have been through. It is a highly professional organisation and they really care about their work. We were glad we used this opportunity to break away from sight seeing and to also enjoy the beautiful nature around the lake. Do visit and donate generously, every help is needed."
It was a good experience and very educational too. Was great to see that the elephants were so loved and beautifully cared for. Thank you so much
Visited Wildlife SOS and saw the fantastic and tireless work that the volunteers and staff undertake at the Sloth bear and Asiatic Elephants sanctuaries. Would definitely recommend anyone to pay a visit here to highlight the plight and persecution that these poor animals suffer   to supposedly entertain people and make a living out of this barbaric practise. Please never undertake elephant rides anywhere in the world and ensure that tourist authorities are told that this is unacceptable for tourist entertainment to hopefully one day ensure that these animals lead a peaceful existence.
"My husband and I were in Agra for a short visit and when we found out about the Wildlife SOS work going on at the Elephant Conservation and Care Centre, we just had to plan in a visit.   This was the absolute highlight of our short trip.  These beautiful creatures have suffered horrendous cruelty at the hands of so-called human beings and it was heart-breaking to see those scenes in the short presentation we had at the start of the tour.  Harry guided us outside to observe the elephants during their afternoon walk; we learned how each had been found and the progress they have made since being rescued.  When they returned to their well-equipped enclosures,  we learned more about each elephant as they were fed.   To see them now, bearing their scars but so well looked after and happy was such an emotional experience I can’t begin to describe.  The 2-hr tour was over too soon and I wish I could have stayed longer.  This organisation depends on donations in order to keep the Care Centre going and I came away wanting to give them all my money (I’m just sorry that it’s not practical).   Thank you so much Harry and the rest of the staff at the Centre for your wonderful work.  We had an absolutely amazing experience – your friends from Scotland."
"A wonderful experience seeing rescued elephants.  Starts with a film which is distressing and then a short tour with a very knowledgeable staff member.  The care for the elephants is clear, their wellbeing is at the heart of this sanctuary.   There's a great gift shop full of elephant and wildlife inspired items and I was happy to support this amazing place."
"This rescue centre was incredible, a must see for any animal lover. The site was beautiful and set well back from the highway, with acres of land all around. We were introduced to the project and then shown a short documentary telling us more about the state of elephant welfare in India and how the rescue centre is helping save abused elephants. It was heartbreaking and eye opening. We got to watch the elephants being fed and were introduced to the 10 beautiful females. The staff were passionate and knowledgeable. Go if you can, it was well worth the trip and the best thing we have done in India!"
"Inspiring Place to Visit and so Rewarding. Helped build bear climbing frames, cut food and feed them and paint the places they sleep at night. Loved every minute and was really pleased they were safe and no longercused for dancing. What was also great was some of the old owners who used them to dance were now using there skills and knowledge of the bears to keep them safe and well by working at the centre."
"Having been to India for some two weeks, four days spent with the elephants and bears .The staff were fantastic so caring and considerate it was breathtaking to see how these wild animals have come forward from their crualty they have been through neverless they are free now to live their lives from been in chains and torture with red hot pokers specially the bears and the elephants been beating to unatraul thing when they should been free, Thanking the wildlife sos India and agra. For a fantastic stay, Christine Baliley, England."
"The work done by Wildlife SOS for the Bears, Elephants as well as the other animal, birds and reptile species is commendable. One can say; Wildlife SOS plays a key role in the welfare of troubled animals in India. Being at the rescue centre which is a rehabilitation facility was truly mesmerizing."
My visit to the sloth bear park was a spur of the moment decision when I found myself with a free afternoon while on a month tour of India.  My tour of the grounds housing the rescued bears was one on one and my guide was also my teacher and I learned so much about the plight of these bears.  It opened my heart to the wonderful staff that dedicate themselves to running the park.  Bless them all.  This is something I will continue to support.
"We as a family enjoy wildlife. For us this visit was an awesome experience. The keepers and education officers are doing a fantastic job. Each bear has a story and it's worth knowing about each of them. Please do not expect a zoo kind of visit. You need to engage with wilderness and you will see the true sense and efforts of conservation. Mr. Rishik, the education officer made our visit a memorable one. His passion for wildlife is felt with every experience he narrated to us. It's therapeutic for children to understand how animals also need family to feel safe and live in harmony within the ecosystem. Would strongly recommend this place to all who enjoy wildlife. Superb experience. Do book in advance and ask for a guided tour to the place."
Helping out at the bear and elephant sanctuary was a very good experience and it felt so good to be able to help out the animals who had been suffering a lot prior to their rescue. I highly recommend volunteering at this sanctuary.
"Had a great experience at Wildlife SOS, the staff there are fantastic and take excellent care of these Elephants. Our guide, Harri, was incredibly knowledgeable and took time to explain the back ground of each of the elephants and the work Wildlife SOS has done to rescue them. They have a huge field for the Elephants to walk in twice a day and looking to expand so they can rescue more. The centre offers a small restaurant for snacks, cold drinks. There is a souvenir shop but there was no pressure to buy anything (a t-shirt cost 5 GBP). DO NOT take heed of the negative comments, the people moaning that you couldn't ride or touch the elephants have totally missed the point of the place. Perhaps you should go to the circus and watch them be abused for your entertainment instead? As for the donation, this goes towards the running of the place and is a pittance to most western travellers. I'm aghast that people would complain about this.All in all. I would recommend this trip to anyone and help make a difference to the lives of these elephants."
Special place.  So glad this attraction is here to care for the elephants in a humane way.  Thank you for your efforts.
