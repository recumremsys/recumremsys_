We did two of the tours offers. Our guide was very informative and had a fabulous personality. Found the whole experience great and learnt a lot
Attended the Fremantle Prison Torchlight Tour and it was a great experience. Our tour guide was brilliant - managed to tell the stories in a way that was very creepy and spooky but not overly scary. Was nice to touch on the history of the prison but this tour does focus on the more gruesome and scary stories.
"Interesting place to visit w did the behind bars tour and it was very good; our tour guide James, was extremely knowledgeable and gave some funny stories; he says that they have a church there and that it was consecrated which means you can legally get married... enough said about that sentence. recommend if you’re in Fremantle."
Toured the prison today. Brett was leading our tour. He was very informative and everyone held onto every word he said. While we know the prison was awful... Brett leading the tour was enjoyable. We are so glad we went.
"I was so impressed with the night tour that I went on a day tour, titled ‘True Crime’The tour guides are well trained/knowledgeable. The cashiers are friendly & very helpful. They have a gr8 cafe to chillax before & or after & they have a wonderful souvenir store which has an abundance of different items to choose from @ reasonable prices. Ohh how I thoroughly enjoyed my time here!!My heartfelt thanks to all the staff!!"
Took the basic tour and was shown around by a very enthusiastic guide. Lots of information to take in. Tales of some of the former inmates was particularly interesting.
We did two tours of the prison “the true crimes and “behind bars” tours. Both were fascinating. Was great to hear stories of inmates from over the years and have a good look around the prison at various sections including the gallows. For both tours we had Simon and he was a great story teller and very knowledgeable. He also makes jokes about people on our tour which kept every body involved. From memory the tour was $22 but the 2nd was only $10 each. Great value. Defiantly worth visiting when in freo.
Took the “true crimes” tour with Karl. It was super interesting and great to see the prison!!! Well worth a visit.
"I had the chance to do the four tours in one day and they were all as interesting as each other. I even got to have my own personal minder who made sure I got from tour to tour on time and not miss out on anything!!Each guide was so passionate and knowledgeable about what they were discussing. So much history but they didn't skimp on giving the most explicit of information. Each time I moved from group to group, the momentum of experience and attention to details did not diminish.I got to experience these tours with 4 very different groups of people and at no stage was anyone left out. Each guide made sure to allow each person ask questions but to also get them involved in the tour topics. At no stage did any of them falter with an answer and they each had their own quirks that made it such a great experience. Even the kids get a chance to be a part of the action. If you have a chance to make this a day out, do it!! I arrived at about 12pm and walked out the gates at 6pm and at no stage did I want to leave, look at my watch or want to be anywhere else. It was an amazing day out. Thank you to all the employees that made it a great day. I will be back to do the night tour for sure!!"
Simon was our tour guide and he made the experience really enjoyable for myself and our friends that had come over from the UK.  Thank you
"My wife and I did 2 tours, the Ghost Night Tour and the Art Tour (which occurs only a few times a year). My sister-in-law also did 2 other tours as well. I have done a few prison tours in different states and countries and this was one of the best. We were lucky we had Janine for both of our tours and she is a delight, as well as being able to tell good stories. It is an amazing building considering its age - amazing in it s preservation and size. This site is a credit to those who brought it back to life. If you see the opportunity to do an art tour - jump at it. The gaol has a variety of art that has been preserved, but this also art that is out in the open that can't be saved. Complicated story - but the guides will explain it. See this art before it disappears. Learn about the artists who are amazing characters. There is also an art gallery on site with art made by current inmates of other prisons. Well worth a look at."
"Took me 10 years to make it to the tunnel tours and it did not disappoint. We had an amazing time. Courtney was our tour guide, she was knowledgeable and hillarious. We couldn't have had a better experience. It was so much fun."
Went on the true crime tour the guide by the name of Ian was great and very informative! Would recommend this tour!
"Highly recommended! Convict n tunnel tour for sure. We started off with the tunnel tour and had to sign a waiver. This got us rather worried. We were also strapped into overalls and harnesses. This added to the level of concern. Word of caution, you will have to climb up and down a set of ladders but with the body harness, you will be very safe. The only concern is if you suddenly have a panic attack, you have no choice but to either push through or be hoisted up in a rather undignified manner I will add. Also, there will be small confined spaces where you have to bend over and walk, but only a very small stretch. Also paddle a small timber tinnie through the tunnel in confined and dark spaces. So if you have a strong fear of dark, small spaces, perhaps it’s a good idea not to sign up for it and ruin it for everyone else ( I did not suffer this issue, this is just a fr8endly reminder) the tunnel tour itsefl was very informative and in fact one of the highlights of our southwest trip. On to the convicts tour. One phrase, THANK YOU JANINE Janine was a fabulous storyteller. You could sense her passion and interest in the subject and her storytelling prowess added to the experience. The tour itself again was very interesting and informative. Loved visiting the prison and apparently the prison accommodation is pretty cool too. I didn’t sign up for it, but was told it is worth the experience."
The overall experience was great. Knowledgeable friendly staff lead the tours and shared the history enthusiastically. Be warned if booking back to back tours that you may need to rush off from the end of one to meet the next as they run into each other.
I want to come back again. Our guide was amazing super engaging and knowledgeable. The history of the place is fascinating and there are a number of tours worth doing. For kids I recommend the more recent history rather than the convict one as it is more interesting for them. Want to come back and do the “scary” tour but not appropriate for younger kids.
"Booked the Convict Prison tour which was excellent. Takes you through most of the prison and gives a great history of it. One tour was enough to get a good feel for what it was like. All tours last 1 hour 15 mins. That’s more than enough, unless you really want to spend more time there. The guides are very friendly and it’s very professionally run. A definite must when you got to Fremantle!"
"Loved the tour so much we went back for another the next day. Very interesting re history of Western Aust and indeed the rest of Aust. Very nice cafe, pleasent staff all round. The Tram stops here too. A must when in Fremantle"
“Behind Bars” and Convict Prison”  guide was very good brought it to life. Well organised timing of each tour. Only negative once you’d done one tour felt some of the prison you saw overlapped as the usage changed over time still well worth doing. There is a cafe in the courtyard. Need to be able to negotiate steps and uneven surfaces. Good value if you do two or more tours. Didn’t book in advance just turned up.
"Having already done the 'Torch Light Tour' (which was great) on a different trip, I decided to do the 'Tunnel Tour' on this occasion and wasn't disappointed although not for people with back issues. Starts with a climb down lots of metal ladders, a walk through the tunnels then a boat ride not to mention the climb back up. Lots of fun and interesting"
"We had heard good things about the tunnel tour from our friends but it was even better than expected! Mix of history, rowing around water tunnels in the dark and climbing 20m under the prison. Our tour guide Sarah was great and even threw in some bad jokes on the two hour tour.…"
"Having done the ‘behind bars’ and the night tour on previous visits to Perth,we decided to do the tunnels tour this time. We were not disappointed, excellent adventure, very informative and entertaining with our guide who had a great sense of humour. As previous reviews, you do need to be able to manage the climb up and down the ladders, bending and crouching in the tunnels, however our guide didn’t rush anyone and ensured everyone on the tour was safe and okayWell worth the money"
Did the basic guided tour which took around 90 minutes. Guide was interesting as was the prison itself. Would have liked to do the tunnel tour but the price was exorbitant. Having said that if you are visiting Fremantle you must see this attraction.
"great tour with a excellent tour guide named chris, highly recommended him very knowledgeable, & a happy guy in general with great customer service. Arrived at the correct time & from then the service from the front door to office box & pre booked tickets all great! The tour was amazing make sure ur not scared of heights ( I’m a little scared but said I wasn’t lol) my partner ditched me when it came to climbing down the ladder( bloody chicken he is) , so I went in alone .. I felt very comfortable with the guide and the other tourists at the time! Well completely recommend to anyone that’s wants to go that extra mile & take a look around. Very interesting place !!"
"My family absolutely enjoyed the behind bars tour. This tour is suitable for those with young children and those with mobility issues as there were no stairs to climb. The sharing of the history of the place and her personal stories made the tour great for everyone. The stories she shared captivated even my children. Walking through the prison cells, kitchen, gallows and yard took us back a moment in time. For kids who love to solve puzzles, there is a crossword puzzle sheet you can buy at the Gift shop. The answers to the puzzle can be found as you explore the prison and the information center. Some of the answers are from the stories that is shared by the guides as well. To enjoy the puzzle hunt remember to take away the smartphone from the kids so they cannot google the answers. I love the part where there was the actual sounds of the kitchen in action from the speakers. They activate the moment you enter the kitchen. It is sad to hear that children as young as 8 to 9 years old were also sent to this prison. To me it is a must go to learn more about the history of Perth.  There is much more to learn here as compared to going to theme parks in my opinion."
"There are 5 types of tours. We took the ‘Convict Tour’ for 2 adults and 1 child which amounted to AUD 56. There is a cafe just before the ticket sales office. Being my first prison tour, I thought the prison would be dark, dirty, creepy with bad energy looming around instead it was ok and clean.  Parts of the prison were undergoing some upgrade, the rest were maintained quite well and spooked up in deco for Halloween.  Looked like a ship inside and when you learn of its history, it would be quite an eye opener.  Some cells were opened to give tourists a gist of how they lived/survived in tough situations.  We went to the chapels, the flogging station, solitary confinement, gallery, all of which were really sad come to think of it. We were advised not to go for the Crime Tour bcoz of our kid.  We ended the tour in 1 hr 20 mins. Moira, our guide did a great job!"
"Visited Fremantle Prison and did the 'Convict Tour'. I learnt a lot about the convict history of WA, which I was quite unfamiliar with having grown up in Victoria. The highlight of the tour was all the stories we were told of the convicts who spent time in the prison - some fascinating characters and intriguing tales of escape. You get some information about the prison in the post-convict era, which was really interesting. if we had have had more time on the day, it would have been good to also do the 'Behind the Bars Tour', to learn more about the prison's modern use.We were offered a second tour for only $10 on the day (not sure if this is seasonal) - so if you have time available this might be a good option.Most of the tour is inside, so weather is not really an issue. There are several stairs to climb inside though, so if you have mobility issues, you may need to consider this."
"Had already done the behind bars tour and the torch light tour, so decided to do the tunnel tour. Glad we did as so different from the others our guide Debbie was great not only knowlegable but had a great sence of humour. It does require a bit of hard work climbing and bending but is definatly worth it, trying to steer the boat is harlious would recommend"
"Our group of four had a wonderful evening touring Fremantle prison by torchlight. Our guide, Janine, made everything come alive. She told the history of the prison, prison conditions, how prisoners were treated and the story of a few individual inmates. It was an amazing tour. Thank you Janine."
"Visited on  2/3/20,our guide Jane was very informative and pround of the fact that they are descendants of the British and Irish convicts. We arrived late in the day and would loved to have done the other tours. A must see in the Perth/Fremantle area."
"Worthwhile visit we did 2 tours,the Behind Bars and the True Crime. The second one starts staight away as the  first one finishes. Make sure you put enough money in the car park meter as the council are apparently pretty strict. If you have a NZ Goldcard you can get a discount for the Jail trips"
Came with my family (two kids around 12) and really enjoyed the tunnels tour at the prison.  Well worth the expense and Matthew was a good guide.  Interesting history and information and exciting in the tunnels and on the boats.
We took the ‘behind the bars’ tour of the former convict prison the opened in the 1880’s and was still being used as a prison in the 1990’s. a great insight to the conditions and daily life inside the prison from knowledgable and entertaining guides. There are audio guides for those whose first language is not English. Allow an hour and half for the tour. Visit the convicts cafe for food and refreshments after your tour. This venue is visited by the hop on hop off tram and is close to stop 3 on the blue bus route.
Had a very interesting and informative tour with a great tour guide. Well worth a visit.  The shop has great souvenirs.
Convict Tour. Great tour with Steve. Lots of information into the time when the convicts were building and then doing their time in this part of Australia. Loved it.
