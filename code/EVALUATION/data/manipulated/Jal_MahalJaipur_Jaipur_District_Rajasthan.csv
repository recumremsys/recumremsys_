"Don't understand what other travellers find anything great here. It is building/palace standing in a lake where 3 stories are below water but you can't go anywhere close to it. You can only see it from 300m or so from the road. You need a great zoom camera to get close up of the building, if you are lucky to have ""clear "" day. (we were not, as it was hazy even at 2pm ) So it can't be considered an ""attraction"" as per me."
"You can get dropped off along the side of the lake where there are viewing points to take photos of the Palace on the lake. There are many crafts being sold along here who want to sell you something so be ready to haggle. Don't miss the wildlife statues here of an elephant,‚Ä¶"
"Located admist hill and at centre of the lake , the place looks beautiful during the sun set. Its on the way to Amer. You can enjoy evening local brich here while relaxing feeing to lake fish."
Its just Amazing to visit Jal Mahal. Name of this Site says PALACE on WATER. You will find picturesque view & nice heritage  site
"Get to Jal Mahal early and you will see the mist on the water. Very serene, but right by a main road. It was built in the mid 18th century by Madho Singh I. Plenty of birds flock here."
A unique structure in water. Cannot go inside. Can admire it from distance. Surrounding water body is not clean. There are local street sale on the sides. Can visit on passing by to Amer fort
"This place can't be accessed but you can have a good photos at the time of sunset and sunrise. Went during Kite festival, this sky around this place is filled with kites. It is a really enjoyable moment but too crowded."
"We drove past here on out way to Amber Fort. not much to see, neither is it a spectacular fort. Taking a photo from the car is enough. They have many opportunities to stop and dress up in traditional attire and take a pic. Bargain for this."
Nice view and close by the city. Can easily be reached by tuk tuk. Recommend to see on the way to or from amber fort
Unbelievable monument. Just fantastic. Thinking that how people built this structure in olden days. Wow
"Good for a visit in the evening. The palace is located in the centre of a lake, no boat ride available to visit it. Can be observed from the pathway constructed around the lake. Beware of hawkers harassing you during your visit. Not a must visit, but you can stop for a few‚Ä¶"
Saw the Jal Mahal in passing on our way to Amer fort. Nestled in the lake it is a sight to behold. Crowds of tourists and vendors selling their wares and food throng the surrounding area. Looks very pretty.
"its on the way to amber fort. one does not need to take another route. the place looks beautiful during evening where you can watch sunset, flocks of birds flying. sit and enjoy while feed the fish of the lake"
"So along the promenade you will find many stalls selling all kinds of souvenir to tourists, many of the see foreigners and triple the price and try to get as much out of u as possible!! But...I came across one lady who was polite and not pushy at all(unlike the other stall holders) she sells the same stuff as the other stalls but her prices are not inflated like the other sellers and she didn‚Äôt see us foreigners as cash cows. I saw something I liked in another stall showed her a photo of the item she went off and within half an hour she came back with the item I wanted and 50% cheaper than the other guys. Seek for out if you don‚Äôt want to be ripped off."
Just a palace immersed in water. We stopped just for the picture. Place smells horrible and it‚Äôs full of people selling you stuff. Don‚Äôt think that is worth seeing.
Nothing great. Not allowed to go inside. A good view after dark when it it lit. Street shopping can be done here. Watch it on the way after returning back from Amer garh sound and light show
"Jal Mahal looks good in pictures and from far away. Of all Jaipur attractions, this was the worst. You can get down from the car, only to be confronted by hawkers, touts & crowds. It is dirty & as you near the water, the most disgusting smell assaults your senses! Unfortunately, I am saddened to say that the people around have little civic sense either. And it isn't worth getting down, for even a few pictures, because once you breathe in that disgusting smell, it stays with you! Admire the place from far, is my advice to you!‚Ä¶"
Palace on the lake. This is worth the brief and convenient stop to take in the view. I was told by my guide that it is closed to the public and only accessible by boat for private and important functions. Reminds me of the palace on the lake in Octopussy but this is not the same one
You can view the Jal Mahal from the road as well as from the Amber Fort. Built in red stand stone it is almost completely surrounded by water and looks wonderful in the reflection in the water. The towers on the corners and the covered wind room look magical in the evening too.‚Ä¶
It's interesting to drive by and see. Didn't go out to it but the history of how it was made is interesting.....look it up yourselves. 
Jal Mahal located in the middle of the city and a photo opportunity wont be missed. Currently closed for public visits but can be viewed from the main street sea wall. Stop over for quick photo session for this place gets busy.
We had to stop roadside to view the Jal Mahal which is located in the middle of Man Sagar Lake. It was built as theatre. It is a beautiful site from a distance on a foggy day. There were plenty of traditional handicrafts venders and sellers along the roadside.  SEE photos.
"As with  a few ""attractions"" and historic buildings in India, this is a view from the road only place.  Looks great but why do these things get listed as attractions?"
"Stopped off for some photos of Jal Mahal and the wildlife, great architecture. Make sure you keep away from the part where the water/drains flow into the lake. Great views of the Pelicans. Well worth a stop."
Jal mahal previously a duck hunting lodge for the king lies on an island in a large lake. It is inaccessible but can be viewed from the shoreline. Stinking discoloured water flows into the lake and food is for sale to feed  the birds and ducks around the area. Many pavement sellers offering the usual souvenirs regularly moved on by police. I thought the trip a waste of time. The government needs to clean this area to avoid it being ruined forever.
"What an impressive view from the shore of the lake. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs inaccessible and no visits allowed. Our Guide informed us it was being renovated and will be open end of 2021 as a floating hotel. Watch this space!"
This palace was built for the use of the royal family of Jaipur and is surrounded by an artificial pond . Can be reached only by boat . Is used by the royal family only twice a year . Is not open for visits of the public . 
Went to see the place and there was nothing wow... There was no way of getting in there but instead just take photos from a distance... The market in front of it was okay... 
"Seems that there is not the opportunity to go out to the palace, but only to photograph it apparently floating on the lake. Pretty enough, but a shame one can't get a closer look."
"It is now known as Taj Lake Palace. It is located right in the midst of Lake Pichola. Standing tall and beautiful in the middle of Lake, Taj Lake Palace is an 18th-century historic stay in the City of Lakes offering an ethereal experience of the era of kings and queens"
Looks like it would be an impressive location to visit if it was possible .  Visit in the afternoon when the smog of india dissipates if you want a nice photo.  
Go here in early morning to get a spectacular view of the Sunrise. Can spend good time in Eve. Get clicked in Rajasthan traditional clothes.
It is just a photo station.  U can't go inside..  u have watch it from road. Click few pictures if u are interested else u can skin this.  U can watch this from taxi also..  No need to get down
"On the way to Amber Palace you'll see the Water Palace on your right. Have a stop and look when you return. You only need 10 minutes, but definitely worth it.The man made lake houses this spectacular Palace which was only used for parties and gatherings."
"Our driver dropped us there for lunch during the way back from Amber Fort. We saw there have some good comments on food on a website. That‚Äôs why we gave a try. I forgot to take the pictures of food because I was so hungry and the food was delicious, haha. The price is inexpensive. Recommend it üëçüèº"
