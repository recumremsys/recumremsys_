"Interesting historical and winemaking  tour and extensive tasting of their methode champenoise and Charmat sparkling wines. Arranged beforehand for an English speaking guide which was great! Nice shop to buy bubbly and other items eg their own cheese. The site also has a hotel, lots of restaurants, a boat trip on the lake, art exhibitions and a park. Could be an outing for a whole day!"
Can highly recommend the wine tour and tasting. This winery has a rich history and has elegantly transitioned to a 21st century quality wine producer. Had an interesting experience in the virtual interactive art studio. All round memorable experience.
"A well worth while visit to this famous winery that has a long history. You might get lucky and find a person who can speak English otherwise presently it's all in Russian. At the end you get a free taste of 6 different Champagnes and prices in the shop are good. The area is now well developed and has a range of restaurants and cafes, a small market and the lake for a boat trip. Pick summer though."
