"Visiting family in Brisbane, we were advised to check out Southbank Parklands. Wow, what a place this is. Take a stroll along the Brisbane river, with its sights, views, activities and man made beach!Sat along side the river, under the views of the city skyline, is a hive of activity. A swimming pool and man made beach full of locals, tourists and visitors from all over. We came here 4 times in our 3 week visit. A great way to get some pool/beach time right in the heart of the city. Loads of local shops and bars, a huge variety of food options, meal deals, sweets, cakes and ice creams.We came back on a Saturday afternoon for the markets and the place was buzzing. Market stalls lined the central avenue, all of the bars were busy, all allowing kids in too. Live music at the plough inn and a real buzz around. Southbank by night has a real city feel to it. Great scenes, a very pleasant walk to the Brisbane sign and wheel along the river and still people in the pools at 10pm. I cant stress how good this place is. Possibly the highlight of our visit to Brisbane!"
Whether enjoying the sites of the city from the South bank cool lush gardens to lounging in a tropical lagoon. South bank has something for every one. Regular markets are held each week and a variety of entertainment can be found. Loads of food options in a variety of eaterys. Catch a ferry and travel along the Brisbane River to South Bank and have a great day out.
"South Bank Parklands is a ""must do"" when in Brisbane, beautiful park and ""Streets Beach"" right in the city... Awesome!  Easy access with the free... yes free City Hopper Ferry.  Open 07:00 - Midnight and it is free!"
Visited here with our Brisbane Greeter on our tour.  The way the South Bank was developed after Expo 88 is really beautiful and seems very successful.The beach area is unexpected and so inviting.  I wish I had time to swim or had my grandchildren with me.
"This is a lovely precinct of Brisbane, and def worth seeing if you are visiting.  Whether it is a day swimming at the 'beaches' and having ice creams or an after dinner stroll and hot chocolate, this area has everything you need.  Located very close (walking distance) to the city centre, it also is the area that has the Performing Arts Complex (QPAC) as well as Museum etc.  Well worth a a visit."
Impressed by the cleanliness and gardens in this area. Nice walk along the river. Ferry services available.
What a surprise to walk along this parkland.  So well planned and maintained.  Watched many small children with their parents enjoying the safe water areas.  A jewel in Brisbane's crown.
"Highly Recommended - Southbank and surrounds is a MUST DO when in Brisbane. A beach in the middle of the CBD where else but QLD. The entire area is an entertainment precinct with loads of restaurants and activities from seeing a show to outdoor cinemas. Swim at the beach or BBQ/Picnic on the grass, there is plenty to explore or just sit back & relax. DO NOT MISS Southbank Parklands"
"SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE- fancy a stroll along riverside paths with great river/city views and plenty of shaded seating to take off the load?- maybe some time at a free 170m long twin pool area along with sizeable beach zones (lifeguards/change sheds of course)?- does exploring or relaxing at several rainforest zones appeal? Or strolling thru the one km long ARBOUR? - or maybe riding a big ferirs wheel?- are historic things your jam? The abutments of the old Victoria Bridge are well preserved and notated at the north end of this 1km long strip of greenery and the MARITIME MUSEUM at the south end has no shortage of old boats and stuff.- picnic time? Lotsa grassed areas to spread out a blanket and don the old feed bag. Plenty of free BBQ grills.-free kids and adult entertainment – some regular, some special events.- some overseas culture? - the Nepalese Pogoda will be of interest- or maybe something in the adjacent precinct – an art gallery, exhibition centre, cultural centre, high end hotels, some trendy streets with dining, take-away, shopping yada.TIPS- I accessed from the city via the latest version of the VICTORIA BRIDGE but it is possible to come in by ferry or by bus (the adjacent precinct has bus stations). No doubt that area has parking and I saw a few bicycle racks within the parklands. Online sites will  have fuller access info.- there are 3 ferry piers for SOUTH BANK – each for a different ferry service. I used the 3rd most southern where the free CITY HOPPER ferry calls, to exit. The MARITIME MUSEUM also has a stop.SUM UP – this is a good one, an area where a person, couple or family could spend most of the day at minimal or even no cost."
"Right in the heart of Brisbane City is this well-designed family area, with a supervised beach, swimming lagoon, play areas, gardens, walks and eateries all along the banks of Brisbane river. You can easily spend the day here walking, swimming, take a city cat on the water, explore all the nearby museums and art galleries and choose from a plethora of eateries. It is beautiful at night too with the city lights shining onto the water. There is also QPAC centre, live music at nearby restaurants, markets, a cinema, and tons more. I love the Mexican a street back and near the Brisbane wheel. Check out the tourist info centre for more details and any special events happening in the open amphitheatre in South Bank. The only drawback is it does get busy but there is always somewhere to lounge around and watch the sights of the river and city."
Took my granbabies for a day out to the Southbank Parklands. Was a lovely placed to spend the day.Will go back again.
I was impressed by the nice pool and beach and view. The gardens were lovely. Nice area to walk through. Was expecting shops but there were only a few restaurants really. Definitely a must see . Nice little parks also and some lizards hanging about.
"Travelled to Southbank for a very restful afternoon, plenty of open spaces, large beach area fully supervised, coffee shop and many small eateries available. Don’t take a watch and just vege out. You will come back so refreshed. Southbank markets always worthwhile to visit when on."
Cross over  the river from the CBD via bridge or City Cat and enter the quiet gentle walkways of the South Bank. Walk amongst the cultivated herb gardens or bimble through the rainforest finally relax in a deck chair close to the lagoon. This area has been tastefully built to give a quiet area close to the CBD.
"Great eateries from cheap as chips to a higher price range. Take in a show at QPAC, check out the Museum, splash around the beach and pool or just sit at one of the many eateries enjoying a coffee or something stronger, and just relax and watch the world go by. Great place for date nights, family picnics or just enjoy a stroll along the river.If you can travel in by bus saves trying to find a park because this can be difficult especially on a Sat night. If you drive in be prepared to be patient."
This is a very nice calm place. Reminds you of Miami a little bit. The options of the pools is really cool. They have a salt water and a chlorine one. A lot of nice restaurants along the strip and music. Great place to take family of all ages. Also great place for photos.
"South Bank Parklands was a welcome change of pace and atmosphere from Brisbane's CBD shopping district. Vibrant and full of life, this amazing area offers something for every member of the family to enjoy. Kids can relax at the park or pool patrolled by the amazing lifeguards. Take a scooter or e-bike up along the river paths to immerse yourself in Brisbane's delightful river views featuring stunning locations to take photos back toward the CBD. If it's more adventure you want there are jet ski tours, kayak tours and cruises to sate all lifestyels when exploring. After you've had enough exploring, take the time to dine on the culinary treats offered up by the plethora of restaurants and bars available in and around Grey Street. There's something to suit everyone's tastes and did I mention gelato?"
"Southbank Parklands is an amazing site for all family. Great outdoor attraction, free and designed for all ages. Visit Streets beach on a hot day, and then head to Flowstate to experience amazing surround relaxing music to end the day. Take a pic at Brisbane sign and check the city from up high at the Wheel of Brisbane (paid). If you're feeling inspired, go watch a play at Queensland Arts Performance Centre, and then enjoy a beautiful dinner in one of the restaurants around Southbank Parklands. Its a must-do!"
"An oasis in the midst of a bustling thriving city! It was pretty packed when I was there, but that didn't prevent me from taking a refreshing dip in the cool, clear, aquamarine water. Parking is expensive. Best to Uber it. Lots of cool restaurants and cafes, and small markets to browse. A lovely day out. Returning again soon."
I had great day strolling around Southbank before and after a show at the Lyric Theatre. Caught the City Hopper from Eagle St Pier to Southbank and wondered through the market and a festival that was on at the time. The Bouganvilea was in flower that covers the arched walkway and it was so beautiful. the gardens were so lush and green at the time and it was a lovely sunny day. lots of families were about enjoying the bike ways and picnic areas and festival. After our musical at the Lyric Theatre we walked back to the Emporium Hotel overlooking Southbank and the River and had a cocktail the rooftop bar and took in the beautiful city and river lights
"Be such, lagoon, swimming pool, beautiful park area. What’s not to love about this place?! Just visit."
"Have been here several times on each visit. Love it! Great place to catch the City Cat and enjoy a scenic cruise up the Brisbane River at reasonable cost compared to the organized cruises.  Many restaurants, kiosks and a public swimming area too with lifeguards and change rooms. I especially enjoy the riverside walkway in the evenings. Benches along the way to rest up. Interesting Nepalese peace pagoda and access to the wheel of Brisbane."
"The parklands at South Bank is one of our favourite places to visit when we are in town. There is so much for kids to do, swimming, market and food.This time we took the kids train and the girls love it. Welcome to BrisVega."
"Visited Southbank for a meal, which was great and then stayed to enjoy the great surroundings of the river and the large Southbank Pool. Just such a peaceful place, this is really one of the diamonds of Brisbane."
"I was amazed at the fantastic swimming pools that are at Southbank. The weather was on the hot side so it was crowded and I didn't have swimmers, but I very much wished I did. Looked very clean, some pools are geared to kids/infants, children and adults. Coffee and eateries are close by but pricey."
Great location to wander through. Grab a bit. The Brisbane eye is a great attraction. Catch a free ferry city hopper
"Crossing over the pedestrian Kurilpa Bridge to the South Bank I walked past several cultural institutions to the Parklands area, always with great views over the river to the CBD with its skyscrapers. En route I saw the Ferris Wheel, the Nepalese Peace Pagoda with its intricate woodcarvings and the Streets Beach with swimming pools and sandy beaches.It was a beautiful sunny day and a lot of people seemed to have a great time, also at the many restaurants, bars and cafés. I don't remember having seen a similiar set up, especially with the beaches, anywhere so close to a city center. For nature lovers there is a small rainforest left and I saw quite a few - for an European - interesting birds. Back to the northside I went over the also pedestrian Goodwill Bridge."
Lovely spot for a walk along the river with the forest area and the amazing beach and water play.  Well maintained and the arbor walk is wonderful. Walking under the shade on a very hot day was quite pleasant.  Can't wait to return with my family to spend the day splashing away.  Highly recommend a visit.
"Following a lunchtime function at QPAC we decided to just wonder around and enjoy our city from Southbank. It was wonderful to sit for a while to observe the river traffic as well as the pedestrian traffic and finish with bite to eat in Grey Street. So beautiful, we love this city."
Beautiful weather.  Great selection of food and drink.  Shade.  Free pools.  This sort of area should be made.mamdatory for every city in the world.
"Absolute fantastic place for your whole family. Just in the center of the city. Great to spend your whole day. Eat, chill and have a great time."
"On our recent five day trip to Brisbane, we walked over the bridge to the South Bank Parklands to walk along the river.  We live in Cairns, which is beautiful, but can I just say that this area in Brisbane, the parks, walkways and river are just gorgeous.  The lagoon pool is well set out for all ages, with lovely sitting areas.  It is right on the Brisbane River overlooking the City.  There are amenities, restaurants and bars all around this area.  Spend a whole day or just a few hours but don't miss it."
Had a great day out here.  Brisbane is very lucky to have a place like this within walking distance from the city.
"Staying in South Brisbane South Bank offers both a leisurely walk plus many, many options for lunch and dinner from cheap snack bars, fast food or good restaurants. After Covid19 is no longer an issue it will offer walks along the Brisbane River, strolll in the gardens and live entertainment."
Great place to cool of in the heart of the city. It was 39°C when we went so pool was awesome. Great for all ages. Changing facilities not great. Were ok but may need more and maybe a little bigger. Worth a visit as it's free. Good day out.
