"4 floors of 4 centuries of weapons, majority produced in Tula. We had a very nice tour with Margarita. She speaks fluently English and knows the museum very well. Must do in Tula! P.S. try the pies in the cafeteria, they are very tasty!"
"This is a newly rebuilt museum of small arms and Tula-made automatic cannons. Yes, some of products of KB Tochmash from Moscow are on display, but are much less annotated.Tula effectively owns Russian auto-cannon market with its GSh brand, so it is no surprise this brand is showcased more prominently.For firearms history buffs, like your truly, this museum offers a look into designs that competed with AK-47. See all the bullpups that never made it through trials. Browse displays with all the generations of AK down to the latest -12 and -15. An extensive exposition covers the history of Western arms, too. There are displays on WWI machine guns, on Browning handgun designs, and on antique muzzeloading firearms.Given the current (summer 2019) construction on M2 highway, the best way to visit from Moscow is to take early morning express train to Tula, and a cab to the museum, rather than spend couple of extra hours stuck on a highway reduced to a single lane. Couple that visit with a walk around Tula Kremlin, and you make a day trip out of it."
"Visited the arms museum in Tula, Russia. Went with a group of 2 others and had an english translated tour. Very informative and one of the absolute best museums I've ever been to. Many different decades covered as well as many different types of weaponry. A definite must visit if going to Russia."
"Another must-see place in Tula. Located near the Upa river, this museum is one of the favorite places to take photos by tourists and weddings. Inside you will find a lot of ancient and modern arms from Russia and other countries. One the first floor, near the entrance, you can buy some souvenirs and Tula gingerbreads."
"very good collection of weapons dating from 17th century and up to date, good descriptions. situated in the city centre"
"An extraordinary collection brilliantly set in a contemporary museum space. Solid information displays, in Russian and English.  Word on the street has it the new floor with displays on weaponry since WWII is now open.  Time for a return.  Tula offers a second collection, largely sporting firearms, at a smaller display within the charming and well-preserved kremlin.  An appealing community, the historical armoury of Russia since Peter the Great so designated this metal-working (samovar) centre around 1701.  The State Museum is, however, the jewel in this crown.  Enjoy!"
"Every Russian weapon of recent vintage on display and some going all the way back to old battle axes. Seemed to be family entertainment since it was a Saturday night and half the town seemed to be there with their enthralled. children, or boys, anyway."
A very interesting Museum. A lot you can learn about the history of weapons. But perhaps the strongest impression I got at the stand of toy guns. When my husband took a shot of them for ten minutes and couldn't stop. And of course another shock this weapon under a microscope. Be sure to visit this Museum. You will get a lot of positive emotions.
"If you're into wars, guns or military-related topics, you will love this museum. You can find the most famous weapons used throughout history in Russia. You can take part in shooting simulator. Didn't impress me, because I hate guns, but it's interesting. It's always good to learn something new"
