Most of the rides and water play area is covered in the ticket. It is a good place. There are rides specific to children and elders. Choosing of rides depends upon your apatite to thrills.
Nice water park. Spacious. However the quality of the water is questionable!!The tower ride was superb. Some of the staff very helpful. Some indifferent. Drive from Bangalore to Wonderla was very nice. Made a pit stop for some local breakfast.
Definitely Wonderla is a great place to visit with family and friends. There are many rides and water sports to enjoy and once can enjoy over the the week and weekend with offers. Now they also offer stays. There are some drawbacks like - check on quality of food vendors are serving - check on how people are entering the water and more frequent clearing /cleaning of water. I have seen especially ladies coming with open hair and lot of oil and entering water area. - some rules on how to enter water like tied hair etc. Rest other drawbacks can be managed and adjusted but if people are coming for water games they expect clean water.
If you like adventure this is the place in Bangalore to try :) So many awesome rides including water rides and rain dance and wave pool. Food is Ok but you are not here for food . this place is for fun only for fun. Do not expect any thing else .
This is  one of the most fun place to visit with friends and family. One of the most enjoyable park. Go only when weather is good.
The park name says its wonderful. thank you wonderla we love it. And the best place for have a fun with friends and family.
"An excellent amusement park with very good facilities. Helpful staff, good locker facilities, drinking water and toilets in many places. Many options to eat are available and you can even prebook them. The rides are maintained well. The water park is also good. Thrilling rides. Enjoyed with my son and hubby. The VR show of adventurous of chikku was also good"
Very good and adventurous to spend full day there. Enjoyed rides and water ganes. Be there at 11 and enjoy till evening 6 or 7
"Enjoyed all water rides. Request to provide extra wave rides, reduce speed of roller coaster, more RO purified drinking water facilities, additional dress changing rooms."
"Wave pool was good, big slides named branded kraits is also good. Food was also ok. Overall I must say wonderla is wonderfull"
"Visited Wonderla in December 2018 along with friends. Liked the dry rides most of which were well maintained and well staffed as well. Didnt venture into the water park, so not much to comment on that. Quite clean and well maintained. Few areas of improvement :-Few rides werent working when we went there.-The park closes in evening around 7, probably you can extend the time to 8 as many prefer to come little late to avoid the scorching sun.- need to have a longer and higher roller coaster as we see in some of the international parks, - i was looking for some First-aid help, couldnt figure out where its available, maybe make it more visible/ accessible- Lastly, i dunno why, but saw many employees protesting outside the main gate when we were coming out in the evening. Not sure what the issue was, but maybe something related to to HR. Overall a fun filled experience. would visit again."
Went for a day trip to wonderla with family and it was loaded with fun. The water rides are exciting. My family had loads of fun in the water slides. As it was a weekend there was some waiting time for the popular water slides. However the fast pass tickets came in handy and we were able to complete some rides multiple times. One day is not enough to enjoy all the water games and rides. Enthusiastic travellers are advised to stay a night at the resort and enjoy all the facilities and rides over the complete weekend.
"Time well spent with family. Has good options for all ages in terms of both land and water rides. You can spend a good amount of time in wave pool itself. As a family we liked the following rides - Rocking tug,  Crazy wagon, Termite rides, Dungeon ride, Sky wheel, The lagoon and Wave pool. Other rides have a longer wait time.Place is clean and well maintained. Liked the concept of the EZPay band which one can top up money and use through the park instead of carrying the wallet around. The storage locker facilities are good as well. One more thing to appreciate is that all juices, ice cream, biscuits etc., are sold at MRP price"
"The rides are really good and unique. More fun Everytime. Well maintained too. Compared to other amusement parks, this one is the best."
"Have visited amusement parks across globe and always yearn for a water park that is well maintained. Wonder la , Bangalore is one such gift for Indians. Until metro train extension is not open, alight @ Mysuru road station and take bus #226 ( right outside the station). The volvo 226 goes directly to park and regular ones stop @ main road ( 3 Kms away from gate). It took a solid 90 minutes from MG road. So start early to arrive at gate by 10.30 or 10.45. The dry rides start @11 and water rides @ 12 noon. BUY FAST TRACK tickets. This will ensure you have a strategy to do all rides (even multiple times @ leisure) by 6 pm and take the volvo back to Station. Water slides are the hit and hence you will find folks going straight to water side, first. If you buy Fastpass, then do the dry rides between 11 and 2. After lunch, do water rides between 3 and 6. Some days , regular queue in water slides can snake to 60 mins wait. Food is good, facilities are neat. Lockers and swim wear rentals were available. If you have, recommend you get ur own. There are a few sit in shows on dry side. You can do those after lunch for a win-win"
Really nice place for family trip. Had a enjoyable and unforgettable moments . Staffs are so humble and i would recommend my friends and relatives to visit wonderla atleast once.
"Wonderla Amusement Park looks like a fully equiped amusement park, but the rides are quite outdated and slow for modern western standards. We were visiting on a sunday and bought fast track tickets, which wouldnt have been needed. It costs double the price, and mostly we had to wait until they startup the machine. Nevertheless the water slides are quute fun and the fairy wheel provides good view. If you dont expect to much you surely spend a great day. Make sure yiu check out the rain disco. You will feel like in a bollywood movie üòÑ"
I love all the rides üòç. It was such a great day . Having more water rides .love the roller coaster ride. Food was amazing.
Enjoyable place !! Avoid weekends to avoid rush !! Fast tracks are best so that you can escape from long q !!
"I have given party to my friends here. They have rides for everyone. Be you are with kids or elders, all will enjoy being here. Few rides will definitely give Adrenal rush and worth trying!! Specially one with high drop!!"
Ridiculously crowded place with poor attention to safety. Its a water park¬†where everyone is fully dressed. Anyone wearing proper swimwear is stared at and ends up looking like a sore thumb.¬†¬†Worst....Very bad experience. .poor security ..poor maintenance of swings..negligence of staff.on report to staff they start fighting with us.than apologies.¬†¬†Need to take strike action they don't have humanity. I DON'T KNOW THAT SECURITY NAME
Kick ass place... Been there with friends..the more the merrier...  just awesome place... I wish they extend their timings a bit... No point having all those lightings if they close by 6 PM
"Hey guys, its really nice place to have blast and more over if u like difficult and different rides, this one is best place. Have fun !!!"
"We enjoyed so much! Every single ride and slide was absolutely amazing. The wave pool was brilliant. They had nice timings for kids, couples and ladies separate from gents, which was really nice on their part. Thinking of making our visits a monthly thing."
Enjoyed my visit to this place with friends. It was an awesome experience. Specially loved the lazy pool. Did not feel like leaving this place.
This is truly the best amusement park in South India. One of the first branches of Wonderla (they later setup one in Hyderabad).We went here earlier this year. Located between Mysore & Bangalore. Its a good day-out option if you love adventure & water sports.Good option for young kids as well.
"Recoil is the best...üòÇüòçit's a feeling of breath taking drug.....it's tht enjoyable ride. Same goes with maverick and y scream. Wave pool is the most time wasting water pool. Rain dance is just amazing, u should go there even if u don't like to dance cuz u automatically start enjoying thtüòçwonderla is wonderfully architectured.MUST VIST. life time experience."
"I had visited this place with my friends and colleagues. If you are adventurous, this is an awesome place to be. The rides are just super thrilling and then there is a section for water slides and water theme play area. Waterpark has a huge buildup area and has clean facilities for changing and bathing areas. They provide locker facilities too. One can buy swim costumes at a reasonable rate from the inside stores. If you are planning to go on a weekend, do prefer to buy a fast track pass, else you will end up waiting in the long queue. Food court has decent food quality and taste at reasonable price. A must goto place, if you are in bangalore for couple of days. The pleasant weather acts like a cherry on the cake. Torally loved the experience. Drawback/ Things to take care: If you coming by cab,then getting a cab back to town could be an issue. Do make arrangements before hand when planning to visit this place. We had asked the same cabdriver by which we came. to pick us in evening. We paid a little extra  to him but it saved us from pain to search for the cab in that area."
"Excellent park..Overall very clean and the staff is also very helpfulWent on a weekday - the crowds are lesser. However, they close some of the water park activities when the crowds are lesser which may not be ideal...Food items / locker system etc. are quite nice and reasonable.overall , excellent experience..will visit again"
"Its a must visit place. Its well maintained, the service staff are polite and helpful. Neat and clean and not much crowd (maybe because we went in the midst of monsoons). Enjoyed all the rides and pools."
"Having visited multiple times theme parks in Chennai, this one is definitely better but much costly than the ones here. Maybe here they need to raise little bit to have better maintenance and new rides. Rides seems to be fresh and not looking old.The recoil was a great centre piece of fun for youth and old also but big crowd as always. Paying fasttrack is an option but then the ticket price goes for a toss.Had food in Chillies and it was good lunch.Definitely worth visiting once."
Entire day was fun at wonderla. Nice to spend time with family with lots of fun and thril rides. Enjoyed.
Had an wonderful time in this place with full family friends for the full day. The food the water games the crowd everything was perfect
Awesome rides n tides. Spent every minute to cover up rides as much as possible but still few left. Had full fun. Well maintained place too.
"Wow its a mind blowing, ultimate , superb, fantastic, power booster place. What a time i had here today. Would like to thank wonderla administration for such a fantastic process and arrangements. Food was superb. after having the lunch we thought it will be heavy n we wont be able to make other activities but it never let us to feel that n we ve became even more active after it. Quality n quantity both been taken care so good.  Keep it guys n will be returning soon for another great hospitality. Thank you :)"
