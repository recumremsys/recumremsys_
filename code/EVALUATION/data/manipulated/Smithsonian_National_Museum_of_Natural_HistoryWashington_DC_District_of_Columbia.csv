This museum houses many of America's treasures. There is something for everyone: a mix of artifacts for intellectuals and popular culture. Give yourself at least 2 hours because the museum is huge!
Don't miss this must see museum.  Very well done exhibits and phenomenal specimens of our natural world.  Something for everyone.
This is one of many must see museums in the Nation's Capital. Being a Marylander we take these venues way too much for granted. It has been a while since I had visited and this time I took my grandchildren who loved it. The new displays and up grades are excellent and the interactive sections for children great. There is bag screening so you will wait a bit in line especially at 10 when the building opens. It is no worse than an amusement park so take a breathe and relax. You will enjoy your visit I guarantee you.
"I have a special interest in minerals and have visited mineral exhibits all over the world.  This one is the best.  Displays are state-of-the-art with superb lighting and labeling.  Outstanding gems are here.  The emeralds, topazes, and diamonds are particularly good.  The Hope Diamond is displayed in its own room and is worth it.  Recreated mine settings are well done.    Great for kids of all ages.  I easily spent 2 hours here."
"Such an amazing place to visit in DC. So much to feel and learn about Ametican art and history. Feel like  coming again and again it's so beautiful and attractive in it's own way. Painting  pieces of art,  sculptures are breathtaking. Can spend hours and hours in the Museum. Cafeteria is an addition to its beauty."
"Visited several Smithsonian museums, this was our favorited. The fossil and dinosaur rooms were remarkable. Spent about two and a half hours, should allow more time. Also interesting were some of the older exhibits which effectively displayed the questionable ethics of earlier archeology."
"It's free as it's a Smithsonian Museum. It's very popular with families and children and is very child friendly. The dinosaur and geology exhibits seemed to be the best areas from my perspective. There are very few if any actual fossils on display - they are mostly casts of originals. But this does not detract from the visit as it's an excellent exhibition. In the geology area they actually have quite a bit of very expensive jewellery including the Hope Diamond (bit dull actually though could be due to how it's displayed) and Marie Antoinette's earrings - well the diamonds from them anyway. But some of the quartz, topaz,  meteorites and other minerals are actually more impressive to look at than the Hope Diamond etc. so take your time over these. Quite colourful and some glow in the dark! They also have some moon rocks on display of course. This area is quieter than the dino area but still fairly busy.Better than some other natural history museums I've visited in the past but this one may just be more state of the art, and the others may also have been revamped in a similar way. Didn't bother too much with the stuffed animal bits. But there were fewer than I was expecting and I've seen elsewhere. These museums have I think moved away from just being a large storehouse of stuffed animals and rather boringly exhibited rocks in recent years."
"While it didnâ€™t make me weepy as the American History Museum did, it is still a great free museum for anyone interested in nature and the Earth. Take time to see it if you can while you are there. Many cities make you pay for similar, not as good facilities. 2013 visit for me."
Love this museum. The history shown here is very educational. Go on time in order to view all levels. So much to learn and appreciate.
"From the National Museum of American History to the National Archives, there is something for everyone here. Carefully curated and expertly preserved, the exhibits are informative and beautiful. Be sure to wear good walking shoes and carry as little as possible. There is a lot of walking and each museum has a security checkpoint at the entrances. The museums are for all to enjoy and they are free of charge. Allow yourself plenty of time to truly explore."
The Smithsonian Museums were wonderful to visit. So many things to see and learn about. I only wish we had an entire week to explore this museum. Be aware that mostly everything in DC shuts down at 5pm so get an early start.
Our family - including two young adults- thoroughly enjoyed wandering through the large museum! There is something for everyone - from the prehistoric era to gemstones to special exhibits. Take the time to read about the displays to broaden your knowledge base.
"Exhibits are interesting, numerous, and free! Learned a lot today by attending the museum. Great time to go, as much quieter in January."
"This museum is great for all ages... Today, we enjoyed seeing the Ocean exhibit, the Mammals exhibits and the Gems. This museum is very informative and tastefully done. Lots of displays which really allows you to absorb the information. The ocean exhibit is wonderful and we never get tired of seeing The Hope Diamond and all the gems & minerals. Great museum for young & old. Enjoy!"
"A good museum, if have never been to other Natural History Museums.  Best attraction is the Hope Diamond.  Enjoyed Ocean Hall and Deep Time sections.  Mummy/Egypt display very limited. Sort of confusing to find your way around to the different wings.  In our opinion, the Field Museum in Chicago offers much more & if you want to see fossils and Dinosaur skeletons, the Museum at Black Hills Institute in Hill City, SD is fantastic.  But, in all fairness - to be a 'free' museum, it is well worth your time & you could easily spend all day there."
Fabulous museum!  So much to see. Allow a couple hours to see everything.   There's something for everyone in here!
This place is huge and has such a range of amazing exhibits and displays that a full day can easily be devoted to it. Make sure to not get dragged down reading every description but really take the time to enjoy what catches your eye.
Unbelievable place.  A must see for anyone visiting New York.  Fantastic exhibits.  Spend the whole day there t ok take it in or two if you can.  Well worth it!
"One of the most popular museums in the Smithsonian umbrella, there is a good reason. From grade-schoolers to old folks, this facility is truly fascinating. Look, one really needs to block off several hours at least for this in depth visit.  There's just a LOT to see and learn. I really can't say enough about the quality of this Museum. Stand in line but go in there."
"This is a huge museum and you could easily spend several days here. We went twice and spent a total of around 9 hours and didn't see everything. The exhibits are good but seem dated. I felt like I had to work harder to learn here than at other museums. I didn't really feel this museum works well for folks that like to casually walk through and learn somethings, or the read nearly everything type (which I am). Don't get me wrong, there is more than plenty to see and it's worth a visit. Maybe I was just expecting more from the Smithsonian, I'm not sure."
"I spent 3 hrs in here. There's so much to see and experience. There are lots of interactive displays that one can play around with. Loved the cool camera that shows how you could look if you were one of the earlier homo specie. There's ocean, gem, human history, mammal, butterfly section. It's free entrance, has restaurant, rest room and free Wi-Fi."
Spent a couple of hours here and again learned things I did not know. Lots of displays regarding fossils of dinosaurs along with many other animals. Discovered the many similarities between mammals skeletons. Very educated and kids love it all.
"The museum is well organized, eclectic and has so much to offer.  Leave at least 3 hours to go through.  Well worth the visit."
I have always wanted to visit the museum. I focused on the mammal and bird exhibits. Did not disappoint.
Give yourself plenty of time at this museum. My college age daughter was fascinated! We spent 3 hours looking at the exhibits and could have stayed even longer. I thought the pathways were tight upstairs for those with strollers.
Took my children years ago to the museum to see the dinosaur wing. The new wing is 1000 percent better. All ages will enjoy the exhibit. A must do when in DC!
I work nearby and this is my go to relaxation place.  Visited the new Dino Hall exhibit and was kind of disappointed.  Even though the Dino exhibits are much better I prefer the old Dino Hall.  The old hall was very clear that you entered and moved along the exhibit by the geological timeline.  The new exhibit focuses mainly on fossils and it does not seem to follow a timeline.
Had not been to this museum in many years and was pleasantly surprised with the new look. We especially enjoyed the interactive exhibit encompassing human evolution. This exhibit alone was a great and quick lesson in our human evolution.
Allow yourself at least 3 hours in each museum!!! There's so much to see in each on and in order to enjoy it give yourself time so you're not rushed!!! This is one of my fave Smithsonian's!!! Such a wide variety!! The mummy was cool and the wing about all the natural stones and gems was beautiful!!  Also the squid is huge!!!
Was very fortunate to have the opportunity to visit the newly opened Deep Time exhibit before hours for a special tour.  This is very impressive and well done.  Also walked through the outbreak exhibit and saw the Hope Diamond.  This is great place for families to visit.  Not to be missed on your visit to DC.
Went there in 2016.  A cute place to learn the history and the wildlife.  We went to the mammuals area and it was nice.  The Museum is nice and secure in case any bad guys tries to sneak in.  Anyway it is a great museum
"Been here a couple of times...always come back for more. Extensive displays, well laid out, great use of space. The gemscare amazing!"
"I was expecting many fossils and exhibits, but felt underwhelmed by offerings at museum. Was glad to have finally experienced, just wanted more natural history"
"The Natural HIstory Museum's bright new Fossil Hall is an amazing place to see.  It is a bright space and effective fusion of science and education.  It is science communication at its best.  The hall makes very effective use of dioramas, visual technology and fossil displays in natural poses.  It is nicely designed by period and separated by different habitats.  The hall very effectively illustrates major evolutionary challenges in emerging from the water, returning to the water or in flying.  Similarly, the Ocean Hall's exhibits illustrate how we know of certain events in the earth's history, how climate is reconstructed and the impact of changing climate over time or other disruptive events, including asteroids.  The museum is large and even a day will not allow someone to cover it fully.  Take it in bits and see gems and live butterflies one day and the Fossil and Ocean Halls another.  Spectacular!!!"
This is one of the best museums to see.  Get there early to beat the crowds and lunch is a must-do for the entire group.
