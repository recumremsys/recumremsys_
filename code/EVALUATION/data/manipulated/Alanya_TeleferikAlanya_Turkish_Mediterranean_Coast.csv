"Went on a day trip to see the castle and took the lift down, its a fairly difficult walk down to lift from the castle(which was interesting and offered fantastic views) Had our 81 year old father in law who is very fit finding it difficult to walk on the downward sloping decking. I would also advise that you take the lift down rather than up as the walk up to the castle is very steep. seen lots of people turn around or having to stop for a breather."
"It is an experience worth trying! Going up to that mysterious village and the Castle by Teleferic can not be compared with going there by bus, car. We went up by Teleferic, walked around, enjoying the historical sights, and went down by foot."
"So lucky to go on the Cable Car from Damlatas to the Castle on the day it opened. Never been on a Cable Car before so it was a bit of a wow! moment. Great views all the way up (and down)!  Very clean, very new and very reasonably priced.It is a bit of a schlep from the Station at the top into the Castle but it's a good walkway and feels very safe. Loved it!"
Took the cable car up only 16 tl 20tl return. Took the dolmus down but a nice stroll down if you prefer.
Took a ride in the cable car upto the castle on my parents recommendation and it did not disappoint. Start on kleopatra beach and stops just below the castle. Lovely views up and down and a lovely view overlooking the harbour from the top. Also air conditioned cars so nice and cool. Would highly recommend
"Did the cable car twice, Once on a return journey costing 36TL for two adults and the second time one way costing 28TL for two adults.On exiting the cable car on the upward journey there is a steep walk up to the 'Central' point via well maintained wooden stairs with many resting places on the way up, The panoramic views over Alanya are outstanding. A mini bus is available as part of the ticket price to take you the rest of the way to the summit of the castle. It costs 20TL per adult to get access to the castle and it is a must to get  the views.Taking the one way trip gives you a different perspective of the cliff & castle as you have to walk down the opposite side from the cable car entrance, Again well kept wooded walkway some of the way, The rest well maintained Road @ pathway with some restaurant & bars along the way."
What a view you get!  Did a return journey which was 28TL i think one way was 22TL Glad we did this as takes you up near the castle and you get amazing views!
"Saw this advertised and thought why not. Got this ride on our second last day, takes you up to the Castle & is worth the effort if you are into a bit of history"
We took a one way ticket and walked through and down back to the town. It's open until 22.00.. but a nice walk is  recommended ... beautiful view. Make sure you take the trip up little before sunset.. tickets are not expensive.. there is restaurants up in the castle area..
"Easy and cheap way to get to the castle. Went up with my wife and kids to visit and enjoy the view, but with +40 degrees we where VERY happy we brought water.. It was HOT up there. The service on the Teleferik was nice and friendly and everything went smooth."
"Exciting experience!I really enjoyed our ride, even a baby in a stroller was completely satisfied!what I would suggest doing is:Take funicular in the morning ans spend the whole day in a castle. DO IT! This is a great way to get near the top of the mountain an there is an entrance to Alanya castle with lots of great places inside! dont be afraid - there is a number of completely authentic caffees and you will not be left hungry. After you have seen all the spots in the castle - you can use funicular to get you back =) if neccessary"
"This is new and we elected to use it having been unable to locate the no 4 bus which goes up to the castle.  The departure point is by the garden near Cleopatra Beach and not far from the Damlatas cave.  We elected to go up on the cable car and walk down which is an option as well as a return trip.  The price was fairly cheap, I think 18 TL return and a bit less for one way.   Very fast and slick. Note the cable car goes most of the way up but does not go quite all the way to the castle,  there are steps to walk up from the top station, about a five minute walk uphill but great views so frequent stops for photos. Worth noting for anyone with mobility issues or children in a buggy etc though,"
Thoroughly enjoyed the cable car ride to top of castle where you can see the whole of Antalya from with stunning views of ocean and town. Well worth money. Don‚Äôt pay the excursion that operators charge for Antalya city tour get bus into Antalya and book it your self works out way cheaper. We went at right time so we managed to see sunset from top. Quite a lot of stairs to climb when you get to top so people who struggle with climbing a lot of stairs might want to avoid going to top unless you just fancy cable car ride to top be back.
"Travelled up in the cable car yesterday.  Time of year meant no queues or crowds. An adult return ticket was 18TL and a student ticket was 10TL. It is a relatively short journey to the top, but beautiful views over the Taurus mountains, the beach and the castle. Be warned though that the walk at the top after you leave the cable car is significant to get to the castle. Even if you don't intend on visiting the inner castle, it's still the same walk to move on, or you just go back down in the cable car. There is a wooden walkway with handrails all the way up, but it's quite a walk and has occasional steps. There are benches along the way for rest stops. At the end of the walkway there is a free shuttle bus that takes you either to the entrance of the inner castle, or to the arsenal. We chose to just walk back down via the footpath, which starts by the k√ºlt√ºr evi (culture house). It is a gorgeous walk down, but very rocky and unsteady so proper footwear is advisable, but you get to explore the cobbled streets of the beautiful old houses. When the footpath crosses the main car road you can choose to walk down to either the cable car starting point (turn left), or to Kƒ±zƒ±l K√ºle (cross over the main road and continue down) which is the start of the liman. Highly recommended!"
Taking a ride with Alanya Teleferik U can get one of the best Alanya must see! The best seaview from inside and from the top. Not very expensive. Worthy. Basicly no queues! Everything goes fast and fine!
"Took the cable car up to the castle.Price was very reasonable, return trip is 28TL per person. When we went the queue has huge as all the coach trips had turned up, no need to worry, buy your tickets and they will call you forward ahead of the queues.Views are stunning as you ride up and down and is well worth the money.Beware that once up the top it's a long hike to the castle up some very demanding steps"
Take you to the castle with a good price and enjoying experience. The trip is short and the teleferik is not very high about the surface.
"This attraction by the looks of it was built in the last ten years and is competitively priced, which means the footfall is high. Do not let this put you off because the wait time to get into an eight person gondola is minutes. Once inside you are whisked bobbing up the mountain to get out on a route to the top via newly installed wooden pathway. Beware health and safety freaks some parts at the top are works in progress and there are pieces of wood and holes. Personally I did not mind this at all and there were little kids playing with pieces of the wood constructing little shelters. The views even on a day with clouds was stunning and the air temperature was nice with a breeze. On top of the views and the fact this incredible fortress dates back to before the Ottoman Empire  and was used to store ammunition‚Äôs for centuries it also has a beautiful mosque you can visit a swanky restaurant plus traditional tea rooms and a few street vendors selling reasonably priced trinkets. If you are visiting bustling Alanya you must visit this super attraction."
"Alanya Telefrik is a very nice thing to do in Alanya. We took the ""Alanya Sunset City & Cable Tour"" with ""Tours of Alanya"". They ignored the English speaking group members and focused on the Russians. We felt lost and disrespected. The trip went over the planned time with 1 hour which ruined our dinner plans in the evening. We don't recommend to take the trip with them. Otherwise, the best parts of the trip was the jeep tour in the city. You MUST do that if the weather allows. Being up in the Castle, the view and the nature is a very nice experience too. Think about having snacks or water. And bring your best knees :).We had our 4-years old boy and ha made it up to the top."
"It‚Äôs a 10 min elevator to heaven. ( if u get the weather right ). Went up at 09:30, instead of taking the tourist paths, I took the ‚Äòother‚Äô paths. Found myself walking around, what felt untouched paths and looking at scenery never once looked upon by human eyes. I stopped at the Gardenia Bar at the top and bought a breakfast Mojito. ( be prepared to pay ‚Äòtown‚Äô prices ) the view was unbelievable. Take your time and don‚Äô rush. Go with no timescales and you‚Äôll enjoy even more. ( 1 mojito and 2 beers to be exact ) üòÅ"
"Went on this Twice, day and night, 0ne way trip is 14tl about ¬£2, round trip is 18tl. Went one way during the day and walked around the castle and citadel, then walked down to the harbour, not for the faint hearted, hard on the old legs, but enjoyable with plenty cafes on route."
"Going up, visiting in the castle area and coming back down only 18 liras. Nice, quiet and fast elevator. Easy to find next to street."
To get to the cable car is a stroll on flat ground. Turn right when you come out of the port. When you get to the round about take a left turn and walk to the end of the road. The cable car takes you to the top for a scenic view to the castle. Alternatively you can take a bus or a steep walk to the castle.
Located just beside the old castle in Alanya. Take you to the top with a wonderful view over Alanya. You can take the cabin car down again or walk which is nice.
It was ok the view is beautiful. Don‚Äôt book a tour for this. You can do it on your own it‚Äôs much cheaper. Also at the top you can visit Alanya castle but be aware it‚Äôs a lot of stairs and un even ground.
"Had a few hours to kill so too a trip upto the castle onnthe hill.A round trip ticket is 20 lira each, takes you up to the top ans back down. You get to walk roundbthe Castle remains and take in some awesome views of the resort and harbour,. Well worth a visit"
It takes less than 5minutes to go up on top of the mountain. Not expensive and have a nice views from the window. Big cabins which allows to enter 6 - 8 people. Have a seats inside. Glass windows from top tobottom. Have a air condition inside.
"Takes you straight up to the castle with a nice view on the way up. Once there you can walk through the palace, have a drink at the restaurant up there and enjoy the spectacular view. Ether you go back with the cabin or you continue through the castle and walk down the hill back to town. It‚Äôs about a 5km walk but downhill all the way and nice places on the slopes to stay for a drink or a nice lunch oerviewing Alanya harbour, the red tower and the east town of Alanya."
"For the best experience, go both during daytime and in the evening to get two different views of Alanya. Do bring good walking shoes.. a lot of the best views from the Castle will require some walking and climbing of the walls..."
"Before going, check the exact time of sunset in Alanya. Going up the hill in sunset is amazing.  Be prepared that before going down you have to wait as there will be massive crowd waiting to get in the cabin to go down as well. Price for round trip is 28TRY."
Took Kids onboard and they enjoyed it. Very nice view 28TL Adult return and 22TL child. Worth it üëçüèΩ
"I took the ""teleferik"" two times when I visited Alanya this June. The first time we took it late in the evening. Of course it's more to see when the sun is up, but it's a nice thing to do in the evening too. More comfertable temperature and not that much tourists. The second time, we took it earlier. When the sun was going down. Much more tourists and much warmer! But again, much more to see. Not reccomended wheelchair users or so, because of the path from the teleferik and up to the castle. The ""sad"" thing about this teleferik is that the whole tour is over in just a few minutes. Maybe 5-6 minutes or so. It's cheap dough, 14tl for one ride, one way. Enjoy!"
Was not keen to do this but it was a great experience . The views are fab on a good visibility day. Frequent trips and well worth the money
"6/11/18 - We three middle aged British guys had just seen the town's main three sites (Red tower, Shipyard and Dalm Caves) on a combi ticket each for 12.We had heard about the cable car (we came from the East side) at the helpful and friendly tourist office nearby. We were told the return trip was 14 but on our arrival to the modern engineering structure it was actually 20. It seemed like a semi commercial venture judging by the price (given the combi ticket to the main attractions was only 12) but it was an exciting prospect to view the western and northern part of town towards dusk (it was nearly 5pm) and get to the top of the hill with the castle (although it was to close at 5:30 so just the trip and wander round was enough. We had already walked all the way from the harbour in the early evening before but had missed sunset and views of the west.The waiting area had posters explaining that every evening from 6pm till 9 was live music. I wondered how they would do that! Upbeat music was playing in the waiting area.As it was off season the queue to board was short and small groups and families had a cabin to themselves. We were hoping for the same but a woman joined us who turned out to be a very amiable Polish woman who we bumped into a few times and chatted more.The slow process around the gears gave way to a swift 5m/s to take us the 161 altitude difference and 830m journey over nearly three minutes. Yes it was spectacular! A ventilation window at each roof end allowed better photographs to be taken and many were! Was struck by the sheer number of satellite dishes in the rooves of the buildings, along with the solar panels and water tanks.We disembarked safely at the top to be greeted by more music. Thankfully the journey was devoid of lift muzak! The journey to the castle was via a long wooden quite busy walkway with people returning too. It ended at a castle gate and in we went through various parts of the lower castle. We had seen signs saying the castle closed at 5:30pm although I had checked the signs below saying the last return cable car was at 9pm. We had time for a drink, wander, sunset and peak at a few things although we ew the castle was about to close imminently.We made our way past a posh restaurant (no prices), synagogue, big old photos of old Alanya as a working town and early tourist resort, and up to the castle which was definitely closed by 5:35 along with all the tourist shops selling things and a cafe. We could have had a nice beer watching sunset at 5:52 but that was not possible (the authorities would probably put an end to that)  so we joined a score of people watching from the crenelated walls and made our way back to the cable car through the (sometimes badly) signposted way. We got to the lower castle gate which was closed! A man told us to go back to the mosque and take another path. We four (along with our new Polish friend) followed his instructions to find a dead end at the back of the posh restaurant (which offered lifts down at 11pm) and another person told us to get the dolmus (minibus) Past the mosque. I had read somewhere that the dolmus accepted the return cable car ticket. We found a coupe parked up, one with a few people in already. In we went and waited fifteen minutes till 6:30 when the bus left to take us the winding road back down to the cable car base. Unfortunately we had to walk the breadth of the peninsular back as well to get to our apartment in the East.We were rather cheesed off that we did not get the return cable car down to see the sea with dusk colours. On our return the cable car was still running, presumably with people just wanting the ride, view and maybe the climb to the top up to the castle gate. We were not made aware that that part of the lower castle we had had to walk through was closing at 5:30. A sign on the first castle gate saying simply ""This Gate Will Close At 5:30 - Please Use The Dolmus Shuttle Which Accepts The Return Ticket After 5:30."" As a result a 5/5 rating is reduced to a 3/5 rating as we missed out on half the trip!I just found the cable car as 'Alanya Teleferik' on TA. I also found it was #1 attraction! One image from last month October shows the journey us 14 one way and 18 return! Prices must go up off season to pay for the electricity I think! It was nice to have space though!"
Used the teleferik twice to reach Alanya Castle from Cleopatra beach .Ten lira one way (2 ¬£ ) or fifteen lira return .Breathtakingly scenery at a excellent price . Still a bit of a hike to the top but worthwhile .
