"These slightly modified words by Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson may easily be applied to this Soviet clunker-ship.Commissioned in 1952 and decommissioned in 2000 this light cruiser of Sverdlov class was turned into a museum two years later.I always feel sad when I see such relics of yesteryears Everything's in the past, just memories left, fading present, desolate future. She urgently needs renovation. Formidable at a distance, the ship is shabby and rusty at closer look and even more forlorn once you step on board. The entrance fee is ridiculous but you may visit her only in a group so be prepared to wait until a sufficient number of tourists assembles.The tour is naturally in Russian and rather formal plus they don't show you most interesting places like the captain's bridge and the engine room (maybe because there's nothing left there?). Rather strict rules of behavour apply.It's interesting that Russian commander who gave the cruiser her name never won a single sea battle and never even took part in any. Appointed commander-in-chief of the Russian army in 1812 he lost to Napoleon the decisive battle at Borodino near Moscow then left this city but later outmaneuvred him and made La Grande Arm√©e leave it in the most inclement weather - merciless Russian winter.Never defeating the French, hardly having won a combat in his life he got a rank of field marshal, the highest possible military order - St. George, 1st grade - was nicknamed ""Napoleon's victor"" and by and by turned into one of the greatest military leaders of Russia of all times. History is a tricky lady...As to the ship, make up your own mind. Dubious impression. Selfies at the quay might be a better alternative."
Old military battle ship turned into a museum..Worth visiting. Enjoy the beautiful view from its masts and the excursion was good.
"If you are not on an organized tour, just wait until a group comes by and ask to join them.  The cost is 150 rubles.  Tours are in Russian language, and you can take a lot of pictures.  Living quarters are like stepping back into time, or watching the hunt of red october.  In the officer's recreational room there is a wooden pannel with red square and Lenin.  The guide will offer to sell hats, pins, magnets etc. (so you will have to sit through a presentation of his items).  On the kiosk just outside the boat they sell tee-shirts for 300 - 350 rubles.  She had a simple one on the table, but she has plenty other interesting ones hidden. (cotton quality is not that excellent though)"
