"Do explore the moon-like landscape of this unique and ancient area when you are in the region of Cappadocia, Turkey. There are hundreads of chapels carved into the hillside and the first religious colonies found here dated back to 373AD, is truly an unforgettable and memorable experience."
Surely a must visit if in the Goreme area.Many examples of early Christian art together with cave dwellings.Please note that there is a very interesting church just outside the main complex which is probably the most interesting? Visiting this church is part of the Museum ticket
Interesting and informative place understand the development of Cappadocia.  Do not miss the different churches dug into the caves that were later decorated with Byzantine paintings.  It was interesting to see how the cave diggers mimicked the decorative patterns and architectural features of the Byzantine Churches.
This is a very historic landscape.  So many things to see and do.  Get out and explore.  The old cave dwellings in the park have some ancient fresco style paintings on the walls that are many centuries old.  You must plan a hot air balloon ride also!  It’s magical!
"Discovering Goreme National Park was amazing. Various tours take in some of the main sites and viewpoints. However if you like hiking and clambering over landscapes this is an absolute must. There are numerous valleys to explore. Lots of great threads and information on here which we used on a daily basis. Views are breathtaking and I lost count how many times we  simultaneously said ""Wow!"". The popular tours and the valley walks are fairly easy going and trainers are sufficient but if you fancy going a little 'off piste"" it can be hard work especially considering the heat. For this I would recommend hiking shoes/boots or trainers with very good soles as you need traction on some steep declines."
"Don't miss, if you are in Goreme area, do not miss it! Pictures give a small idea of the real thing, live experience is a must do!"
"Open-air museum, our guide said, and it really is. The important amount is sites of interest. Wear comfortable shoes and sun protection."
Had a great time viewing the churches in the Goreme national park. All are interesting.  some are well preserved and others have been renovated.  Worth paying the extra to see the dark church which has some of the best paintings. The caves with tables and cooking pits are also interesting.
All Cappadocia is lovely. Deserve to go everywhere. Sometimes a little bit boring because everywhere are tourists and everybody stops the car near the rocks and you cant took good pictures for memory.
"This is a not to miss when in Goreme. The cave churches and frescoes were amazing. Built into the landscape of the area, the UNESCO World Heritage site is a gem. Be prepared to walk uphill and have a hat and water."
Must visit! Stunning vistas with interesting rock formations. Lots of history and culture. Enjoyed the frescoes.
"Cappadocia Turkey is an amazing valley of fairy chimneys and homes and churches carved into the rock.  Goreme has amazing churches on various levels of the rock, many with lovely murals and paintings.  Be sure to allow time to visit as you do need to climb up and down to see everything, but it is so worthwhile to do so."
Visited the Göreme National Park on FourTrack; it was a great tour and scenery was beautiful. I highly recommend it.
"Open air museum is an interesting title to draw you in. Shows a lot of the history of the area and how much of their life was based around religion (Christian, banned at the time) and the lengths they would go to, to hide it. I haven’t given it 5 stars as I just feel there is more that can be done to enhance the visitor’s experience. Felt a bit restricted in options."
"Great place for pictures and also to learn about history. Best to go with a tour guide who can explain the various stops and the history behind them. Panaromic views are a joy to look at. Remember to wear a good pair of shoes as place has rock surfaces and some slopes, but very walkable."
"You came here to see a place like no other , interesting , unique , intriguing , one that will remain in your memory for sure as it is all that and more . Enjoyed every minute of it and surely you will too ."
Beautiful park where you can have a good idea about how this place was few years ago. Don’t waste the opportunity.
"A must see for all travellers.. Jaw dropping landscapes and amazing scenery.. Hike around the valleys, e.g. Pigeon Valley and enjoy Turkish tea amidst the red terrain..Just do it.."
The park is definitely beautiful but there are other equally beautiful places in Göreme. Check it out if you have time - we did it as part of the red tour package.Try and avoid tour bus crowds by going early am. Better photo opportunities elsewhere
"Incredible place for hiking and sightseeing. Best if combined with the underground city in Kaymakli and Dervish ceremony. We hired a local, certified guide Zafer Hoca. He is retired English teacher, very knowlageble and nice.His number is 05367260968. He directed us to the Dervis Evi, a small place of worship Southeast exit from Goreme for the authentic performance (not a restaurant). Euro 10 pp. Starts at 6 pm, after the ceremony they dance for a while and let you take pictures. Tel. 90 384 343 20 80, 90 532 486 32 54."
"Part of Red  tour. It's amazing place to learn history. Fascinating place to visit. Very photogenic. Apple Church was culmination for me as frescos were just stunning . Can't take pictures inside Chapels and Churches ... but surroundings are just amazing . Wear comfortable shoes, lots climbing , high steps, bit tight on the staircases - but it's stunning ."
Self guided tour of cave dwelling like churches and homes.  Plan on about two hours to see everything.  Go counterclockwise once you enter the grounds.  Signs outside caves give brief narrative of what you will see in most places.
Went to the Outdoor Museum with a private guide and so worth while. Incredible to think that an ancient population lived in these caves. Definitely worth a visit
"See how people lived a thousand years in these churches/monasteries. A place like no other so definitely worth a visit for the uniqueness and stunning views. Try the Turkish coffee in the little cafe, they make it on sand - it's really good and I don't even like coffee!"
"Wonderful place to visit. Takes you back 2000 years. Interesting to see how early Christians stayed and spread their religion. Excellent frescos. If you are in Goreme., this is a must visit place"
"Perfect place for hiking. Beautiful view. Very interesting land formation. Make sure you have hiking shoes, no flip flops or high heels."
"Goreme National Park is full of early christian history. The place is always crowded. There are toilets at the entrance. Use it before going inside. There is a museum shop also. Take atleast a water bottle with you. There is lot of walking around inside and a little bit of uphill walk also. Lots of old churches with fresco art. The churches were carved out of the rocks. Good place for photography. I was surprised that so many people were smoking inside. It should not be allowed. Yes it is not a closed space but still its a heritage site and smoking should not be allowed. Going early morning makes no difference, the place is always crowded. Take a camera along and enjoy."
Seeing is believing it was absolutely fantastic and well worth the long journey to get there. If you are within 6 hours by road it really is something else. You should book a hotel for 1-3 nights to make the most of your time there.
Forgiveness of nature to the industrious people who appreciate it. Pass Natural history course so much funney.
"Stretching a vast area with hills and mountains, Goreme National Park remains so close to our hearts. Our guide was always helpful that he explained about the rock formations  and nature made art work on such mountains."
"the open air museum has a very chap entrance fee and it is totally worth it. the landscape is amazing and the views too. in the rocks, there are houses, churches and rooms that it is amazing how people made them! go early, avoid the crowds!"
"Goreme National Park is the star attraction of Cappadocia.  The various frescos inside the churches, combined with the breathtaking landscapes, are amazing.  Allow at least 1.5 hours due to lines that must be endured to enter the chapels.  Enjoy!"
Such unique and wonderful national park to visit. Had to see it at least once in your life time. You can rent a car or joint a tour group. Nice local people as well.
This is a must visit area. It will take your breath away. The cave dwellings are ingenious. Making dwellings out of rock is sheer genius
"The open air museum portion of this park was great!  There are numerous churches carved into the cliffs and fairy chimneys and inside are ancient frescoes and in one case, even a skeleton of an actual saint.  Climb the stairs and check them all out."
