Granted all the beaches in Iceland have black sand but this one has the really cool squared rocks that look like pylons. Even though it was raining the day I was there it was gorgeous. I only wish my tour had a bit more time to spend there.
"Since we were just staying down the road, I visited this Black Sand Beach multiple times and there is NEVER a bad time to visit.  Even in the pouring rain.  Yes tourist everywhere, but like Bees to a beautiful flower, this place is magnetically irresistible!. Must get a photo on the hexagonal basalt columns.Walk the beach. Check out the inverted caves. Just sit there and absorb the vibes."
"Black Sand Beach is a wonderful place to go when in Iceland! I went with a tour group, but would have loved to have extra time to explore. Don't miss it!"
This place is one of the best ones we've been to in Iceland. The landscape is surreal and beautiful. Go early mornings or late afternoon to avoid tourists. Specially on the summer. Watch out for the sneaker waves. They are really dangerous.
"If you are in Iceland, you should go to the Black Sand Beach. It has the Irish Pillars like the Giant's Causeway in Ireland. The sand of course is the volcanic rock. There are cool rock formations in the ocean nearby. It was super windy there. Make sure you dress appropriately!!!"
The beach is beautiful. It’s a nice stop in your ring road your. There is a restaurant and pay toilets in site. Good parking. Lots of good photo opportunities. Easy access from Vik. Make sure to make it a stop. If you’re not eating a 30 minute stop is plenty.
"I think people are confusing this black sand beach with Reynisfjara Beach. Based on the map, this is the one in Vik, behind the N1 and the Kronan shopping center. Tour buses stop here, so between the shopping center, the gas station and this beach, parking can be tough. The beach is a short walk from the parking lot. It's a nice soft black sand. When you look to your right you see the Reynisdrangur sea stacks. Gorgeous view of the beach, sea and the sea stacks. If you turn around and look towards Vik you see the little red church on top of the hill. Be sure to go to the church to see the beach and sea stacks from above."
"Visiting here felt like a visit to another planet, the rock formations, black pebbles and the coastline are like nothing I'd ever seen before. This is truly a unique landscape and unforgettable experience."
"The rock formations are what is really the draw here along with the small caves. Be ready to greet a lot of other folks; tour busses galore! But I still did manage to get a couple of pictures without people in them. It was a misty and overcast day which lent itself well to some cool photos. There is a large parking area, I did not see any facilities anywhere, although I believe there was a gift store or cafe. Wear good shoes, the rocks and sand can be a bit tricky to navigate. If you are a Bon Iver fan, this spot was used in the video for Holocene, which he won an award for."
This is one of those places you must see in Iceland. The beautiful basalt columns right next to the ocean with the rock formations in the ocean and the gorgeous black sand.... just beautiful. Serene. Try going later in the day or early morning to minimize the amount of people.
"Honestly the rock formations here are incredible.  There is a cave (that was in GoT for fans out there) and around the cave more jutting out rocks.  They're in such unique formations and patterns, it really is cool.  Oh and the sand is black.  It was kind of crowded when we went, so hard to get a picture by yourself, but I definitely recommend.  Going at low tide is best so you have room to walk around the beach and get close to look at everything.  From the wet sand, it looked like the water came pretty close, I'm not even sure how much you could see at high tide."
"We came here on a day trip from Reykjavik when we visited Iceland back in November and it was one to remember! Vik is a seafront village located in the southern part of Iceland, The drive for us was long, I believe about 4 hours and it was good and bad at times. It was so scenic yet desolate; Images that you see in movies or find on postcards. That day was a bit scary driving as the weather conditions were a bit rough. On the way, we stopped at the beautiful waterfall, known as Seljalandsfoss, which was spectacular! The gentleman in their souvenir shop warned us about the road conditions on the way up to Vik. So glad he did because it was dangerous at times. There was a snowy, ice storm and if you are not used to driving in conditions like that,  it can be uneasy. There were no barricades on some parts of the road and there were ice lagoons on each side of us. I almost had a panic attack because I couldn't see and one turn, we were in ice waters. All I kept telling myself was ""Black Sand Beach better be worth this drive"" and it was! We got here a lot later than anticipated so we did not get to experience the town much as we had to head back that night. The little we did, was awesome. People are friendly and helpful. Such a quaint little place. We parked in front of the beach in their parking lot and headed down to view this amazing spot. The water was calm, yet mysterious. Standing on the black sand, which was created by basalt lava was different. The rock cliffs are beautiful and unique. The Reynisdrangar stone pillars and the huge basalt columns are definitely a sight to see and are home to the Puffins, which weren't around at the time. This is not a tanning kind of beach, more of a viewing one so don't expect to see beach chairs. One thing I researched that I found interesting and scary that I never knew about were these waves called Sneaker Waves or sleeper waves. Its a large coastal wave that can appear out of nowhere without warning and drag you out to sea. This beach is known for it so I was very cautious of walking around close to the seashore. People, please do your research on these dangerous waves as there have been tourists who have died. On a better note, this beach is known for Games of Thrones filming some of their scenes so if you're a fan, you will appreciate it. Weather can be very unpredictable so always be prepared. It was really cold and windy that day but it still didn't take away the feelings and beauty we took from it. For anyone who is travelling to Iceland, I highly recommend visiting the town of Vik i Myrdal for some Black Sand Beach beauty..This beach is definitely special!"
"After dinner in Vik we went to the Black Sand Beach where the Puffin colony is.  The puffins were cute to watch flying in and out from the cliff where they were nesting out over the ocean.  Were there about 1/2 hr, made a nice walk"
"Now “Black sand beach” does not necessarily refer to the world famous one which is Reynisfjara, Voted one of the top 10 non-tropical beaches in the world.… But that is a magnificent beach to visit. It is right off the ring road, it is free, and it can be crowded.  Seeing dark black sand for the first time is very cool! The basalt columns make this place even more special. Don’t turn your back to the waves as they can kill you!  You may even be able to paraglide and land on that beach with a company in Vik called True Adventure which I highly recommend!"
Incredible unique scenery in this beautiful part of Iceland. Took a few hours to drive down from where we stayed near the airport. Driving is never a chore and you see so much of this great country by doing so. I would highly recommend anyone visiting Iceland to hire a car and to visit this particular area. Please note photo is from a couple of miles out from the Black Beaches.
This beach was one of the nice things we saw during our 10 day trip. We spent a few hours here and got some very nice photos. One thing you must look out for are the waves. A few people have been taken into sea by the waves and some of those sadly died. Make sure to always keep an eye out for the waves and if you have smaller children to keep them alert and be alert for them.
"We were lucky. That day we visited Black Sand Beach (Reynisfjara) it was sunny. And warm. And not that windy. So unlike the Icelandic coast. BSB would be impressive even on a cold, windy, overcast or rainy day, but it is staggeringly beautiful under blue skies. Many kilometres of black sand to walk. Soaring cliffs that are home to thousands of gulls, terns and even puffins. And, of course, there are the basalt stack rock formations that everyone loves to climb on. (It's quite straightforward, but easy to find yourself much higher than you imagined.) Well worth the stop, especially considering the BSB are not far off (6km) Highway 1, Iceland's ring road."
Be sure to visit this beach when you’re in the area. It has very geometric rock formations on a cliff above a beautiful black sand beach.  You can see the big sea arches in the distance.
"We spent a bit of time here over 3 days--it is so dreamy. Go very early or very late and avoid all of the crowds. And stay away from the water! The waves are crazy--I can't count how many times I saw people almost get hit by sneaker waves because they were too busy trying to get a selfie. If you want to explore all of the beach, consult a tide table before you go."
"On our tour of southern Iceland, Vik is as far south-east as we went, and it was totally worth it. Our trip to Iceland was full of firsts as it is such a unique place and the black beach is up there. Let's face it, where else are you going to find one. We spent a good while just…"
"Originally we thought that this was the black sand beach right off the town of Vik, but we realized the main entrance for it is on the other side of the mountains (closer to Reykjavik).  The basalt columns were unbelievable. A must stop.  Go early in the morning to avoid the crowds, which get overwhelming"
"Stopped at this beach to see the basalt formations and black sand. The stop was good, not extremely awesome but a good representation of volcanic basalt formations and of course, black sand. Didn't visit the tourist center but did use the restrooms. There is no charge for using the restroom even though there is a credit card machine next to the door. Just open it, it's free."
"This beach with the black sand, basalt columns and rock formations was a must see for us. We got some awesome photos at this place. There is plenty of parking and pay bathrooms. Didn’t realize it at the time, but if you’re facing the water, there is a puffin nesting place close to the rock formations to the right. You probably can’t get close enough to see them well though. And also probably a significant walk to get there."
"AVOID PAYING TO SEE BLACK SAND BEACHES!! These beaches are everywhere, easily accessible and a place you do NOT have to pay to get to or to see. Please heed this warning! Iceland is expensive enough. This is one thing you absolutely do NOT have to pay for to do.Black Sand Beach found near a gas station, tourist shop and grocery store. Fabulous photo ops everywhere you look. Don't Pay!"
"This is a nice black sand beach. There are so many sections to this beach, with great photo opportunities. There are some caves that look really nice inside. There is a car park, a souvenir shop/cafe, and toilets. Watch out for the waves."
"On our trip back along the south coast back to Reykjavik we were told we should stop at Black Sand Beach, even though it's a small detour. We were really glad we did. This beach is black sand - as the name suggests - but it has the most massive waves we'd ever seen. Granted it was a very windy day but it was stunning to see. It's a very short walk to the beach from the car park.The waves are so powerful, and a bit frightening each time they suddenly shoot up the beach towards people. Beware the section with no footprints! Apparently the beach area sort of just drops away which is why the sea is so fierce. There's a rock formation in the sea and against the cliff that is well worth seeing too. Although parking is free it isn't the place to stop for food and the toilet because you have to pay for both and just for a pasta dish it was around 2600KR (£16)."
"We came here on a windy summers day in August. We actually got confused with another black sand beach on Google Maps which is near the Solheim plane wreck. This is the actual Black sand beach which is further east to the plane wreck and puffin colony. Here you can find ample parking, and even if not, there is loads of space up the road to just pull into the side of the road leading to the beach. There is a small cafe there so you can buy some nice coffee to enjoy in the cold wind. The basalt columns are pretty awesome. I understand they belong to the same family as those found at the Giants Causeway in Northern Ireland. You'll find hordes of tourists climbing these stacks for the perfect instagram shot - yes, we did the same thing too. There is evidence of erosion on the stacks, probably due to to many tourists in the area. The rocky nature of the beach is gorgeous. You can find many cool shapes of rocks and pebbles most probably derived from the volcanic matter. Further down the beach are the rock stacks - absolutely amazing. Do walk down the beach to get a better sight of these formations. The colours of this sight are purely awesome. Do give this area a visit if you are in the vicinity. A note is that you can't reach the black sand beach from the puffin colony / lighthouse area and you will have to drive around the mountain and Vik to reach it."
Really unique place where the sea transitions to pure black sand and immediately to hundreds of shiny black basalt columns. Visited on a day when it was misty and rainy giving the place a very special atmosphere. Well worth the visit.
"Almost got mixed up and did not see this beach and the stone walls and caves that face it. Pure black volcano ash sand beach. It also looks out too offshore spires that are picturesque. Need to be careful at the shore line, the waves at high tide are strong and they warn you about “ sneaker waves” that will pull you out to sea if you are not paying attention."
"The beach has a special atmosphere. It is like from another world. Not just a sand is black from old lava or so, but your are between basalt special formation of rock with kind of basalt broken columns and weird, strange, beautiful rocks, cliffs in sea close to beach. Added to that, you have a huge sea waves coming with a such speed you cant escape sometimes. Some people were completely wet. A size of waves are hig a few meters, very impressive. Whole beach has as well small pieces of basalt or so stones with an interesting shape(s). Doesnt matter what a weather is, you will always keep in your heart such amazing and exceptional experience and views, feelings."
"This is a must see in Iceland.  It is like being on another planet.  The rock formations are spectacular, the sand is amazing and the history is very interesting.  Leave at least 1.5 hours to explore and get all of the amazing pictures."
"Only ~11Km from Vik, the rock formation at the Black Sand Beach is stunning.  There are also numerous cave structures for photos.  Sneak waves are extremely dangerous so stay clear of the water."
This is e erything it promised to be. The views are stunning and so are the rock formations. Arrive early or go for sunset to catch some amazing photo opportunities. However it does get busy with coach loads of people all wanting to take pictures of the same things.
"Stopped on the way to Hunkubakker , our stop for the night. Parking is a zoo. Somewhat overrated , with busloads of touristas on the beach , even in heavy rain. Interesting, but so much of south Iceland is visually stunning as well. Worth a stop if you can beat the tour busses there in the morning or late afternoon.  It's free, but the restrooms have a fee, and the credit card scanner did not work."
"Adding this to our trip from Reykjavik made our trip almost 3 hours but it was worth it! This beach area is incredible! Black sand is really found at any beach in Iceland but this beach has the coolest rock formations! You see columns like in the picture above and there are areas with rocks thin on each other reminding me of Mica, the rock that's thin and looks flaky.  Lots of areas for great photo-ops and places to hide. It is very crowded (even at 5pm) especially probably in summer cause it's light out all the time (21 or so hours of daylight). Definitely better than any pictures of it and worth the drive! As we read though in a few places, DO NOT GO TO CLOSE TO THE WATER! We read that one person a year or so dies because they are a tourist and didn't listen and went too close and got pulled in."
