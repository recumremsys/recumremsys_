A wonderful place to visit. Walking the capitol grounds is peaceful and relaxing. Very nice indoor tours when it is open.
"Had a very nice walk around the grounds.  Lots of statues, memorials and history to look at. Beautiful grounds, A nice visit."
"The Capitol grounds and building are beautiful. Took a wonderful tour of the Senate and House chambers. The guide was very informative.What wasn't discussed were some of the material presented such as the poster of all the African American elected legislators between 1865 and 1900. Back when Negros were allowed to vote. But legislation, intimidation and terrorism stopped that until the next elected official in 1966. Coincidence? Outside, the most prominent commemoration is a huge status for the Confederacy installed in 1903. Clearly a statement to put Negros in their place. Was shocked it was still there along with the plaque claiming it was in response to Northern attacks and no mention of keeping slavery and discrimination as stated in the Confederate Constitution. Such propaganda! I guess enough Texans still believe it to stay in such a prominent place. There's an African American statue on the other side of the walk which seems like a concession to commemorate their contribution to Texas, but that hardly makes up for a statue that celebrates being able to buy, sell, rape and lynch Negros. Glad I learned this as a visitor to Texas before recommending Texas as a place to locate a new office. Surprised so many technology companies around with such values supported by the Capitol. That said, we really enjoyed learning about Texas history and values. Fascinating."
Did not go inside but the park is very nice for a walk. Lots of monuments in the park. Great for a lazy weekend afternoon.
"Did the tour inside the capitol, our guide was great. The tour was short and sweet, worth doing. The building is beautiful. There are multiple things you can see outside. We were there for about 45-60mins.  I recommend seeing"
"Loved walking the grounds and seeing all the statues and reading about the history of Texas. Very fun, love bringing visiting friends here"
"Took a free 40 minute tour of the building inside, and loved hearing the history of the building. The guide was very knowledgeable, and the inside dome was breathtaking!"
Walked here from our hotel and enjoyed touring the grounds.  Lots of statues and plaques to explore and learn from.  There was a crowd of people rallying for a cause with the center walk as a congregating point.  Plenty of trees for shade on hot days.  The building itself was remarkable and fun to explore.
This capitol building is huge.  They have lots of free tours throughout the day so you can learn about the unique features of the building and some of the history and symbolism.  Be sure to check out the visitors center at the edge of campus as well to learn some more.
It has been years since we visited the capital. Took the tour on a Sunday and it was awesome. I love my great state of Texas.
We briefly stopped at the State Capital as part of a driving tour. We were shown inside and the grounds for about 10-20 minutes. It really was beautiful and it was interesting to hear the history. Pay attention to the entrance door hinges!
Took the kids by to walk the grounds and take the tour.  Lots of history and the tour guide was great.  The grounds are expansive and there are a lot of photo opportunities outside.  It was decorated for Christmas for this stopover.  Did not think the kids would have been interested but they actually loved it.parking was free on the weekend in an adjacent parking structure.
A impressive state capital. It was interesting to hear the history of TX from on of the guides. Also to see how they add extra room without changing the capital. Be sure you go to the neww office wing.
"The capital building is pretty cool and you can self tour or join a guide for a 30 minute session learning covering the rotunda, house chamber, senate chamber, courts and resource library. Large grounds with multiple monuments from the Civil War through WWII. Street parking on Congress Ave is easy.  Take a walk on 6th Street (4 blocks) and grab a drink and some food."
"Free tours are available and the guides are very knowledgeable.   I very much enjoyed the tour of the Capitol and Texas history.   The Capitol itself isn't all that ornate compared to others I have seen, but you know you are in Texas.   I did learn that the congress is only in session every other year so when they are there is a lot to get done.  Makes you wonder why other states they work year round when Texas covers 2 years of work in 140 days."
"Wandering about the grounds is nice; wandering about the inside of the Capitol is even better.  Take time to discern the six flags that flew over Texas, and why one (on the floor of the Rotunda) is significantly larger than the other five.  And spend time in the Senate Chambers and House Chambers, opposite each other on the second floor.  (After all, with the legislature meeting only for two weeks, every other year, someone ought enjoy the atmosphere in those resplendent rooms.  Why not tourists?"
"The Texas State Capitol building is an impressive and beautiful building from the outside.  Going inside we were able to see both chambers, though they were empty when we there.  An impressive place to visit."
"We arrived from the North entrance taking photos of several statues/monuments after going through a security check we walked through to the South entrance having a look at the old vault before going on a your with a guide which is a must do you learn a lot more doing this they are free so would definitely recommend we had a lady called Georgia who had a sense of humour and very informative. Took about 45mins to do the tour.we came out the South entrance which technically is the main entrance,more monuments great photo opportunities amazing building one of my husband's highlights in Austin and other parts of the USA we have travelled to."
Take one of the guided tours as you learn a lot of interesting facts about a Texas. It is a beautiful building with detailed architecture. Well worth the trip.
Visited the state capitol and was lucky enough to see the changing of the guard. Within the historical building it was a pleasure to see so many service men and women proud of their roles and the traditions they embrace.The building itself is magnificent and the access granted to the public is incredible. Some wonderful works of art are exhibited and to see the various debating chambers was a real privilege. A must see when visiting Austin!
We visited the Texas State Capital building in September 2019.  It is a beautiful building with amazing architecture.  Take note of the hinges on all of the doors!  We toured the House and Senate chamber and viewed many historical portraits lining the walls.  Every Past Governor’s portrait hung in the rotunda.  What I found to be nice also was the fact the building is visible from the University of Texas....very similar to the layout of the Mall in DC.  If you like architecture it’s a must see while in Texas.
"The Texas State Capitol is a must see if you’re in Austin. The architecture is in incredible, and we really enjoyed learning more about Texas history. It’s free to get in, you just have to go through a metal detector. I would suggest getting there early in order to beat the crowd. Make sure you wear comfy shoes- there’s plenty to see!"
"This is always an interesting point to visit on a trip to Austin.  Last weekend there were women there.  The annual Women's March originated on the capital grounds.  Seeing an opportunity to make sales, many Girl Scouts were there as well with wagons filled with cookies."
"It is well worth your time to visit the state capitol while you're in Austin. Admission is free, and you can walk around freely or take a guided tour. Learn about how the state government works, sit in the galleries, and see pictures of every governor that has served."
I wanted to learn more about the state of Texas. There is a free guided tour in English every hour on the hour I believe. Takes around 40 minutes to cover the inside of the building and recommend doing this to gain some insight into the history and how the governing system works. Interesting but not fascinating. For more history you should visit the Texas history museum in the grounds
"Visit to Austin is not complete without seeing the Capitol. It is majestic, towering and impressionable. Rich history and quite a professional and insightful guided tour. Make sure to undertake the guided tour. Subsequently, after the tour, take time to stroll around the building. Strive to appreciate the finer details in the decor and on the walls. For parking, we were fortunate to get street parking, however, don't stress go one-two streets in north or south of the Capitol, you will find one. In addition there are public parking in the area as well."
"Marvelous visit. Guided tours. Everyone was pleasant and helpful. History. Art.  What else do you need? Well, I really liked the capital grille. I spent a lot more for a lot less while visiting Austin. The food was excellent fresh and tasty. There was a huge variety. And it was reasonably priced. I highly recommend the frozen yogurt."
"The pink granite structure is as vibrant today as the day it is opened. Stop and go inside. Explore the chambers, hallways, and grand staircases. Peak inside some of the offices. Be sure to visit the gift shop in the new addition."
"I took my daughters to see the Capitol in Austin Texas this past week. It was a great experience all around for multiple reasons! It brought us together as a family in our great state of Texas’ Heart! Family first and Foremost! Second, it involves a lot of learning both Historically and for my family as a whole. Back in 1986 the Goddess of Liberty which sits atop the capitol was remastered in pure bronze. I was blessed enough to have a small involvement in the process. My grandparents family business, Dell Ray Bronze, was awarded the job of remastering this awesome piece of History. I was able to watch the entire process from start to finish despite being around my children’s age at the time of the process. I remember it vividly and will never forget it! Go check out some History and take the family to enjoy some true Texas History! You won’t be disappointed!"
Visited here for about an hour.  Street parking is available a block away. We just strolled the grounds and saw the building from the outside as we didn’t have time for more. The building is large and visually impressive.  Children had a nice time climbing trees and playing on the grass. Nice place for a visit.
"The free organized tour had just started when we arrived, so we quickly joined in.  Tour guide was a young, brunette gal and she was very entertaining!   Loved all the interesting tidbits of information she imparted.   Don’t think we would have enjoyed a self guided tour nearly so much.Highly recommend"
"Toured the capitol for the Halloween tour.  Beautiful architecture and worth looking around. When not in session, it’s more of a museum than a capitol. Tour guide very informative."
"The interior is stunning, the ceilings are beautiful! Did a self guided tour, well worth planning a visit!"
"Enjoyed the visit to the State Capital. Learned quite a bit about a Texas history.  Worth a visit. The building is very impressive.  Took the free guided tour which was about 30 minutes or so.  Gave 3 stars only because I think the visit is more reserved for people who are looking to learn something about the history of Texas. Other than some older paintings of Davey Crocket and the surrender at San Jacinto, there are no earth shattering historical artifacts that are part of the tour."
Took the free small group tour and it wasn’t interesting.  Maybe the down mood of the tour guide colored the feel of the tour.  Didn’t see anything very interesting except the inside of the dome.
