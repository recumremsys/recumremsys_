"Beautiful beach, lagoon and really hot weather. Nice relaxing place , you can have views of the magnificent mountain in front of the beach, islands not far. Chamarel where you can have lots of activities is 10 mins drive. We choose to take the sky parachute from this beach. Was unforgettable experience."
So you have some areas of the beach which have crystal clear water while in some areas it is wavy and full of rocks! It is honestly the best beach in Mauritius for me.. It has scenary view over the mountain and the beach! Surfers and kindsurfers might enjoy the wave on the other side while kids and parents may enjoy the blue clear water on the other side.. It is the perfect place to relax. Note that there are no closeby shops and restaurants so make sure to bring enough foods and drinks..
"Wonderful beach hidden away in the south of the island, you can get there by car, bus or taxi, plenty of parking available. Beautiful sandy beach, peaceful, with beatiful clear blue water. I visited in May/June 2015 and water calm suitable for anyone, in December 2016 water a bit rough but still ok for confident swimmers; though weather had been rough so that might be the reason the water had a current at the time so if you have children swim with them as it changed during the day! You can take your own food or buy food and eat at cafe which is clean & has clean toilets. There are also public toilets and sometimes stalls where you can buy food. Access to the beach if looking on a map is next to the Lux hotel, if you have a family it might be worth checking out local hotels and b&b's for more reasonable places to stay so you can spend a whole day here! This is my favourite beach on the island, beautiful views, water & sand; can be very peaceful. It is a very safe location, clean and once again amazing views of the coast and the hills. Take your own chairs, mats, as well as towels I don;t think you can rent them there, take a umbrella if you want to relax on the beach and remember suntan lotian as if there is a breeze it can seem cool but the sun can be strong! Great for children and people of all ages, couples, families and groups."
"The travel brochures show a perfect white sand beach and it is just that! Swim, walk and just enjoy."
One of the best beaches in Mauritius with glorious views of sunsets. White sand beaches have a special appeal and visually the Le Morne beach does not let one down in that regard. It can however be hard on the feet as there are a lot of stones and coral in the sand. Do wear appropriate footwear for this one lest you hurt your feet.
"The Beach is located next to Beachcomber Dinarobin resort. In fact in Arabic before Europeans ""finding"" the island it was called Dina Arobi, which can be translated Desert Island or Square island. We stopped here to cool down after climbing to Le Morne Brabant and hiking back from there.Beach is very nice, at parking lot was a food truck selling food. Also public bathroom is available. Consider wearing swimming shoes because of the corral.Cross the street is the Slave memorial park called ""International Slave Route Monument""."
"Has to be seen to be believed. Absolutely glorious. White beaches, stunning mountain backdrop, crystal clear water..."
Great trip and le morne beach is stunning and well worth a trip or 2 even. Do hire a car and drive around and visit at different times of the day. Morning and evening is best as it gets busy with locals trippers during afternoon.
"I've read a lot of great reviews about the dolphins swimming trips in Mauritius but after taking a trip this morning,I find it hard to imagine how anyone can class it as 'one of the best experiences in my life' or 'totally unforgettable'...?! For me, it was quite the opposite. Don't get me wrong for the very short 3-5 seconds you 'swim' with the dolphins it was really nice, but it takes away from the experience when there's more swimmers than dolphins and when there's anything from 9 to 14 boats swarming around the ONE school of dolphins!  I asked the skipper if they Govt limits the number of boats which are allowed to swim around the dolphins and he said 'no', there can be as many boats as people like.In order to be fair - Dolswim as a firm were efficient and well-organized (this is, after all, a well-oiled machine with hundreds of tourists going out probably per day);  the communication with the company via WhatsApp was prompt and they got me on a trip after only booking the day before. Dolswim, from what I understand, is perhaps one of only a few companies which limits the number of swimmers (2 people from each boat at anyone time) to swim with the dolphins. Sadly, some other companies and private boats, allow the whole boat to jump off (sometimes up to 10 people from one boat, where we had only 2). This is a credit to Dolswim, but the experience for me was not particularly enjoyable. It's pretty frantic with the skipper shouting ""go go"" for us to jump in so we can get our 5 seconds (maybe a bit more if you're lucky) with the dolphins. Obviously, they are wild animals and move pretty fast, so if you have any notion of this being some intimate experience with you and dolphin spending quality time in the water, then you'll be disappointed. I knew this would be the case but didn't think the sheer volume of boats would be surrounding the animals. Watching the dolphins from the boat was honestly more enjoyable.Skipper & crew were average. Nothing bad but also nothing good to say. ZERO and I mean no information was provided on the dolphins, other than 'they are spinner dolphins'. That was it - no education, no little nuggets on their species, behavior, etc.Snorkelling was about 15 mins and uninspiring - saw a couple of black&white fish and some brown corral.Would not recommend."
"Nice beach not overcrowded. Take care, like everywhere on Mauritius, there is a big difference if you visit this beach on sunny day or cloudy day. Uncomparable feeling. There is also a lack of restaurants and bars. If you are lucky, you'll find some truck (mobile restaurant) with simple snacks and juices in a nearby park.All in all, you can spend a few nice hours on it."
"Le Morne Beach is probably the most beautiful beach of Mauritius, because located between the awesome Le Morne mountain and a magnificent lagoon with blue colors and not deep. However, after more than 10 stays in Mauritius, we noticed that the sand starts to miss more and more ! Specially around Dinarobin and Le Paradis Hotel, it easily lost 2 meters of height since our last stay 4 years ago. Nature and erosion is removing this beautiful sand to put it more and more between Ile aux Benitiers and Le Paradis Hotel. Enjoy the beach now if you can, because nobody knows how it will look like in 10 years...I will soon post some photos for you to see how it looked like in December 2017, you can also check my previous photos of 2013 and check the sand level difference.So, enjoy and see you there as soon as possible for me to come back ;-).otterboris (#wherethehellisboris)."
"Not the Best Beach to bathe, almost all the time it is windy. Has a lot of corals and algae.BUT it is an amazing place to look at and has the most Beautifull and romatic sunsets."
"Took a taxi to Le Morne for the day from bel ombr√© took about 20 minutes.. Wow what a stunning place.. We lazed around the public beach next to Lux Le Morne.. Beautiful beach stunning water, swam relaxed and ate a super lunch at the cafe on the beach.. Took a walk too.. Such  a relaxing  stunning place.. Next time I want to stay here.."
Getting here was a little tricky for us but somehow we managed. It is a very nice beach with Le Morne mountain in the background. Beautiful place to spend some time. Sunset in this area is stunning.
"Le Morne beach is a beautiful long white sandy beach with brilliant blue waters. The current is not strong here, so is good for swimming, however, the beach is not the best for snorkelling as there is simply not much to see underwater.Le Morne itself is slightly out-of-the-way, so you would have to plan to go there. We went in a hire car. Parking for the beach is easy, and we got an insight into how the locals relaxed as many were having BBQs on the day that we visited.There are many snack stalls near the beach, we would recommend a fresh coconut.Beautiful setting with Le Morne Brabant as a brackdrop."
The beach here is perfect if you want a get away from it all quiet experience. With the large Le morne mountain as a backdrop and beautiful clear water that us calm enough to swim in its a joy. Don't expect restaurants and bars - there's one at the end of the beach which is great but otherwise it's just paradise beach
This public beach sits between lux le morne and Dinarobin and is definitely worth a visit. Surrounded by pine trees it is a relaxing and beautiful setting.
Really good beach. Recommended to visit ...... weekdays better than weekends WC praticable.....the hotels around provide you indirect security so you can stay till late.
"This beach was great, turquoise waters and nice sand. Nice little diner on the beach, serving simple but good dishes. Beware very strong currents even only a couple of meters ashore. We did an hours trip with a glassboat, and had great views of corrals and fish"
"We have spent ten days in Mauritius travelling around and spending the afternoons on different public beaches. And this one was the best for me. Open sea, the view at the mountain when I was swimming, very peaceful and quite, just great atmosphere for relaxing day out. The sand was beautiful hot and the water warm so I did not want to come out at all. There are few stands with refreshment and an outdoor hotel restaurant. There was also a wedding on the beach which looked so romantic. I really loved it!"
We reached here late in the afternoon and stayed till sunset. The beach was not crowded and one could have privacy. Very nice scenic and clean too. Loved the beach.
I liked the drive around Le Morne I think is one of the prettier parts of Mauritius. The Beach was lovely and clean. There is a memorial across the road from the beach with the big black and gold gates. Take a drive around the other side where all the kite surfers are and you can drive all the way around the bottom of the big hill. We drove from Flic n flec sown to Le Morne then up to Charamel falls and the seven coloured earths then back down to Rochester falls then on to Gris Gris back through Curepipe and back across to Flic n flac. It was a lovely  day trip. Caution not all the fuel stations are open on a Sunday so make sure your fueled up.
"Le Morne beach is one of the best beaches in Mauritius.  You have access to plenty of shade, a little restaurant called Emba Filao, and toilets (if you're a paying customer at the restaurant!)  Protect your feet in Mauritius--we do have stone fish, especially in the hotter months.  Paddle or swim out for unbelievable views back to the beach and on to Le Morne Mountain (with an incredible, but sad history)."
"We spent and afternoon on both sides of the beach at Le Morne. One at the public beach, which was so-so. One at the south tip, which was very nice. The best, for my family, was just chilling at the kite surfing beach, where the water was at most knee deep. Watching the kite surfers was quite relaxing. The beach there wasn't the best, but it had some stretch to lay down, chill and enjoy the sun, and wind. Spend hrs there on the last day just to relax."
"To do PLEASE: Submarine in Port Louis, Catamaran, South Tour.. Stayed at Riu Le Morne (Riu Creole if you have children). You go back home refreshed with a new experience. You can drive your Scooter under water (Yep, you read correctly)! ‚ù£Ô∏è"
"This beach is a stunning piece of Mauritius. Classified as a World Heritage Site, thus kept in pristine condition. the diving here was stunning and the coral beautiful."
"I've been lucky to travel widely and have seen many lovely beaches from Australia to the Caribbean.  This one takes your breath away.  You can walk half a mile into the ocean in clear beautiful water, the beach is never busy but the view backwards at the shoreline when you are in the water of mount Le Brabant is the most amazing backdrop.  Don't go to Mauritius without seeing the south coast and the particularly the south west.  It is stunning.  Fantastic sunsets."
"Surrounded by all kinds of beaches, Mauritius surely has a lot to offer for a beach lover! Le Morne beach is absolutely one of the best, especially in January/February (when I was there for a short stay), when the weather is fine, and water is crystal clear blue. We spent two days on the Le Morne beach: one day just relaxing on the sand and some snorkeling, the other day we did horseback riding on the beach, and swimming with the horses. absolutely extraordinary experience! I'd definitely recommend to stay in an airbnb in La Gaulette. Fair price, easy access to all the destinations in the southwest (15 mins drive to Le Morne beach, right behind the major route to Chamarel etc.), and close to a big supermarket.Follow my Instagram ""ambswang"" for more pics from traveling the world!"
"A trip of a lifetime.. Rented out a boat from SOLEIL.. You can see them at the beach.. Two skippers tata and franco""francois"".great guys.. High waves and rain didn't stop landing a 45kg yellow fin tuna after an hour and fifteen minutes fight"
"A really beautiful beach. Judging by some of the beaches we saw from the coach from the airport, this could be one of the best on the Island."
"Spend  a full day trip on √Æle aux Benitiers , including 2 and half hour dolphin watching , snorkeling . Our boat captain might swim and guide you , and swim with dolphins ."
"We came here after the hike at Le Morne Brabant and it was so refreshing to just dip in the water. There is public toilet to change and I'm taking off a star because the condition is pretty bad for a nice beach like this. Otherwise, surrounding area is clean, sand is soft like most beaches we are used to in South East Asia and water is crystal clear. Be warned though the public food stall only starts operating from noon onwards so you may find yourself starving for a bit if you've worked out earlier during the hike."
"Le Morne combines a palm fringed, white sandy beach with  offshore coral and the looming beauty of the nearby mountain. Snorkel a few meters into the sea with countless fish. Although there a a number of high end resorts along the beach, a few public beaches ensure effective access along the stretch. Public beaches have toilets and shade. When you are bored with sunbathing you can watch kite surfers do their thing at the far end of the beach.  Very busy during weekends with happy locals enjoying a party vibe. Have this UNESCO listed area to yourself during the week."
"Do not go to Maritius if you want to travel and see the history. It is pure relaxation, welness, great food, sun and the ocean."
Pretty much ticks all of the boxes. Take your snorkel and your water shoes but just keep an eye on all of the kite-surfers while you're swimming with the fishes.
