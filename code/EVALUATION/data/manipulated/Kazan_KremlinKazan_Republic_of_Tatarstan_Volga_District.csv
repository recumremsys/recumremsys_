"There are few places where you can visit a cathedral and mosque in the same square. The history, the varied architecture are unique. You can spend hours, or do a quick walk-through in one hour. Do consider a trained guide who will enhance the experience for you."
"Referred to as white Kremlin Lots of historical places all in one surrounding That has got to be quite a unique setting of anywhere in the world! A highlight of KazanMosque, churches in close proximity and the unity in religion across Russia was astonishing did not expect that üòäLoved Kazan üíù"
"You can spend a whole there in Kazan Kremlin just visiting all the museums (9 total), churches and mosque. Make sure to visit the National Museum just across the street as well."
"seen/been to lots of Kremlins in Russia. Kazan s is the most structured, beatiful as a pearl, preserved carefully, planned in detailed. Very well organized museums, exhibitions inside. Deserves several hours of attention"
Nice place to have a whole view of the city and also visit few historical buildings. Don't have to pay any entrance ticket
This is the main attraction to the city. It is well connected. Pretty much in the centre. Don't miss it.
"be sure to visit. You can touch the history, very clean and well-kept area. very close to caf√©s and restaurants, observation decks."
Must see when in Kazan. Take your time to stroll around and enter the churches and the mosque. The church has very nice painting of many holy men.
"Was amazed how clean this place was. Lot of interesting history here and was very suprised when we see the big moske inside the walls, really beatiful."
This is one of the most important cultural places to visit while in Kazan. Do not miss it as there are museums and cultural treasures here.
"very pretty, not crowded and just seems untouched by tourists. Walk around in the day and by the evening lights."
"Great Kremlin to walk around, free admission. Very nice architecture and spotless square. Make a point of visiting the Mosque and other sites around."
"Main historical monument in Kazan by Kazanka river in the very centre  of the city. Free access. Excellent view  from  the walls to the city. Prepare yourself for long pleasant  walk. Everywhere you may find the benchs, rest, have your drinks."
"Almost everything you want to see in Kazan is right here: Orthodox churches, the Kul Sharif Mosque, and half a dozen little museums in the vicinity. The Kremlin sits up high and provides amazing views of the city on three sides. Bring a camera and be sure to come see it at sunset when the mosque lights up."
The Kremlin in Kazan is worth going to. The Qol≈ü√§rif Mosque and the museum in the basement is educational. Walking the Kremlin is interesting and we decided to go to the Kremlin several times. Be sure to go to the museum of the history of  Tartarstan statehood in the Kremlin. The history timeline (in English) in great to understand the Mongol period.
Very beautiful place!  Had a very nice walk there with my husband. Love mixed architecture there. Also if you are looking for souvenirs this is the good place :)
Don‚Äôt miss it. Very interesting place to know some of Kazan‚Äôs history. You will find a mosque besides a cathedral. Nice views of the town.
"Didn't expect that there are more great buildings inside the compound of Kazan Kremlin (let me call it a ""Castle"").I kind of walked around the Kul Sharif Mosque and the nearby on my first day but decided to return after I found out that there are lot more attractions included inside the Castle.The tatarstan president's residence is inside and so are the Hermitage Museum, the National History of Tatarstan Museum and the Annunication Cathedral.Too much to see in just one day. So, I suggest more than a day be alloted for this castle alone."
Walking around these area is amazing. The view of the city is breath taking. Take confortable shoes because from here you can walk everywhere.  Take your camera and be ready to take some great pictures.
"Kazan's +1000 year history has been very well preserved in the main, and a trip through Kazan's Kremlin is a great place to start one's appreciation of the city. In the company of a very knowledgeable and well-spoken guide we (a small group of us attending the FIFA World Cup) had a very good tour through this striking landmark. The blend of great architecture, the mix of Muslim and Russian Orthodox places of worship, and the parks along the Volga river which bisect the city makes this an easy place to be and from the Kremlin one can see the postcard perfect views of the city below.  This is not just a single tour of old buildings, but within the Kremlin there are tours within tours, including the famous Mosque, the original city walls and the original wooden buildings. Everyone was welcome inside the mosque, and for those (many) football fans, men and women alike not suitably attired, they were well prepared with suitable wraps so anybody could enter. From the Kremlin the tour didn't stop: names, places and people so often heard of, came alive as we toured beyond the Kremlin walls; Katherine the Great, Ivan the Terrible, the academy where Lenin was educated, the many statues and parks dedicated to Russia's greatest poets, musicians and performers, made this tour an absolute pleasure, and I was disappointed when the tour was declared over. There are many beautiful parks and avenues that make Kazan a wonderful city. Having had mix reports about Russians being rude and unfriendly I could not been more surprised by the welcoming smiles across the city. English is a barrier, as most speak no English at all, but somehow we always managed to get the directions needed, the menu order right, and naturally we were blown away by the efforts made by the city for the World Cup 'invasion' Well done Kazan, a return is certainly planned."
Simply - a must do. Spend many hours over several days visiting all the attractions within these kremlim walls.
being in Kazan you will not miss it. in the nightime when light is on - very attractive. enjoy romantic walk.
"Situated in the downtown Kazan, easily accessible by metro and busses. A must visit while in the area."
"Loved the Kazan Kremlin (Fortress), in parts had an almost late medieval feel to it.  Very well preserved with amazing views over the city and the Volga river.  Can easily spend 2-3 hours exploring the complex, the Mosque was especially nice."
"A beautiful sight to behold, the Kremlin is undoubtedly a top sight in Kazan. There are quite a few things to see there including churches, a mosque and a few museums. I was lucky enough to visit a small but very worthwhile exhibition of French Impressionists at the Kazan Hermitage. The guide we hired at very reasonable cost proved to be a wealth of information. Take your time to thoroughly enjoy it, of course weather permitting...we had our share of bad luck having endured minus 25C but still enjoying it greatly."
"Make sure to arrange excursion to go around with somebody who will be able to tell you the most interesting and important stories. You can pay for the guide on the gate if u want to listen in russian language, but in other languages might have to book in advance."
"Situated at the top of the hill. As you approach the Kremlin you see the white walls in the distance, which look superb. There are plenty of attractions inside the walls such as the Mosque and some museums. Unfortunately it was raining whilst we were here, so we didn't spend as much time as we'd have liked."
must visit KAZAN & Kazan Kremlin while you are in Russia . It is a very beautiful city where you would want to come back. Thank you Kazan for hospitality. I would definitely come back there soon.
"The Kremlin is where it all started. This was the former fortress of the khan of Kazan, conquered by Ivan the terrible in the 16th century and rebuilt as a traditional Russian Kremlin with an orthodox cathedral replacing the former mosque. The Kremlin today contains a museum of Tatarstan's history, a beautiful art museum with local and Russian painters (especially good collection of Kazan born painter Fishen, a real discovery for lovers of Russian turn of the century-painting) and a museum of Tatar Islam. With a modern mosque built inside the Kremlin the site now reflects the dual Tatar/Russian character and history of Kazan. The mosque itself is worth visiting as a example of modern gulf state style bling, but not especially interesting otherwise. The Kremlin has no good cafes or restaurants. Be sure to eat and drink before coming here."
"Nothing like a Moscow kremlin, plus they local big boss sits inside this structure, so about a third of the area is not available. Watch out, there is very little shade, and no public restrooms that i could find here."
"Constructed as a fortress, there are several buildings to discover and appreciate. I could be kind of unfair with my selection, but the buildings I liked the most were the Qol Shariff Mosque and the Annunciation Cathedral; they look awesome from every point of view, and their interior are pretty nice. For R$100 I accessed the mosque museum; it is a small room with several articles, maybe written documents the most of it; it would be helpful to have signs in English to get a better understanding of things. Next to the Annunciation Cathedral there is a nice garden, and in the middle of it, a monument dedicated to the architects of the Kremlin is found. There are other buildings that look great, and have different purposes, like the Governor‚Äôs House, the Syuyumbike tower, and so. There are also some squares or small plazas that look nice, too. The view of the city from some points of the fortress is magnificent. I visited the Museum of Weapons Spirit of the Warrior, it was small, just one room exhibiting mainly ancient weapons (X-XII centuries??) like swords and spears; I kind of liked the little figurines illustrating the tartar warriors on their horses; the admission ticket costed R$250 which seemed high to me. The surrounding area of the fortress is nice: buildings, a garden and a river embankment. At night, the towers look very nice with their lights on."
"Although I doubt many people would go out of their way to visit the Tatar capital of Kazan, the world games will bring many there. Once there, walk around the Kremlin and visit a new but interesting Kul Sharif mosque near the Volga river. The University has an old library with lots of historical documents. Tolstoy and Lenin studied there, and supposedly others who discovered lots of stuff 'first'. The city is also very proud of its deceased bass singer Chaliapin. Getting close to the asian part of Russia might seem exciting, but big cities are still big cities."
First sitysight of thw region. Welcome to have your mind about wonderful Kazan. Better to visit in summer
"It was a delight to see the coexistence and tolerance on display in the beautiful site. Photographing at night is the best I found a piece of smooth marble to rest my camera on in the courtyard, that is how I achieved the perfect reflection. The streets are safe and spotlessly clean I walked for hours at night with never an incident."
"Visible from far away, the Kremlin with its unique skyline is a landmark you can't miss. Walking up from the city side, you enter through its ancient gates. From there you can choose several routes,  passing the mosque, church, president house and numerous other old buildings. When visiting the city you should not miss this impressive location with lots of history and thick walls which protected this area for ages."
