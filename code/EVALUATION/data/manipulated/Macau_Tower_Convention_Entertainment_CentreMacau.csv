Have to go to the top and enjoy the amazing view of Macau from the top floor. They have a lot of activities like bungeejumping and sky walk over there. I would recommend to go in the night to see the beautiful city of Macau with all its lights.
"Once the tallest free standing structure, now ranked 20th, Macau Tower offers a 360 deg view of Macau. Add a few hkd in the standard entrance and have buffet dimsum snack and complimentary use of the interactive telescope. Come here in the late afternoon and stay up to the night to see the amazing view of the hotels and bridges. As always 6mop is the bus fare from the Cotai strip."
"Buy a 135HKD ticket to reach the top to see a spectacular view of the city of Macao and neighbouring China districts ! And if you love Adventure sports, this is a place where you can try the Bungee jump and Sky walk at 233 meters above !"
"This tour attraction is good for visiting! In the 58/F Zone you can see both Macau SAR and Zhuhai city. In the 61/F zone you can see the view more amazing . When I join the skywalk ( extra payment), I can enjoy walking outside the zone and see the view more clearly ! Also it is a special experience in my life. Come and enjoy!"
Nothing much in Macau but this tower where you are transported to 58th floor and can catch a bird’s view of the city. They also have bungee jumping for the adventurous type. Do visit if you happen to be in Macao. Ticket cost for adult is approx 160 HKd and kids 65 HKd
This is a must see placebin Macao. From this 338meters high tower yuu cannsee whole Macao as well as a part of mainland China. The platform and the restaurant on the 60th floor rotates and you can enjoj in the view while eating from a rich buffet lunch. Be careful not to get yourself a heart attack since from 61th floor people are doing bungy jumping infront of you.
"What makes Macau Tower unique is its location on the edge of the Praia Grande, the Skywalk, the AJ Hackett bungy jump and the Tower climb. You have to have a deep pocket or credit card and a big heart to do one of the above activities. Alternatively, you could get your heart racing by walking on the transparent glass floor on the observation deck floor. We were fortunate to have gone quite early in the morning and there weren't that many people there yet so we spent as much time as we wanted there. Having been to similar structures in Toronto, Auckland, Gold Coast and Melbourne, I rate this one pretty highly thanks to its view."
Great place to visit while in Macau to enjoy the city with a 360 view. The glass flooring on which you stand once you reach the top gives you goosebumps! Make sure you visit during the sunset. The evening is so beautiful with all lights propping up slowly around the city
"I highly recommend Macau Tower, it is absolutely a great place to visit with stunning views! Avoid weekends when it is really crowded. It can be fun to watch the bungee jumpers jump off the tower. Overall worth the price of admission!"
Visited here as a 'must see in Macau' very touristy- and very much like any other tower and observation deck anywhere else in the world. Still good to see. The view is beautiful and really helps you understand the layout of Macau. I would recommend a visit if you have not been to Macau before.
"Have you ever gone to the Macau Tower? There is a 360 buffet restaurant where you can see the whole view of Macau, that is gorgeous. The afternoon set is delicious. The salmon with black truffles is very nice. And the waiters are very friendly. The most important thing is that you can see the whole view of Macau or people bungee jumping! But it is a bit expensive. However, if you want a cheaper option, you may want to choose Cafe on Four, on the forth floor in Macau Tower as well. The most delicious thing in the cafe on Four is the coffee ice-cream. Is not too bitter and not too sweet, and kids will love it too. You can also enjoy your lunch there.  After finishing your lunch, you might want to watch a movie, so you can enjoy your film with tasty snacks like popcorn on the same floor as Cafe on Four. Wish you have a great day visiting Macau Tower!  If you have a kid, we recommend you to go to Toys R’us on the second floor; it’s very big with many special things to see, so we recommend you to go to Macau Tower."
"Being 338 meter and higher than eiffel, it is a world famous place. It said to be the highest place that offer sky jumping. The cost is also exciting more than 2000 hk$. Taking pictures through glass floor and sky walk outside need some courage. Art scatches displayed at ground floor are telli g the spectrum of the whole town in one place."
Best place to see at night with lights illuminated all over the macua. Have the choice of bungy jump & sky walk around the top periphery of macua tower. Joy to walk on the glass floor.
We enjoyed the 360 degree view of Macau city. Walked around inside the tower on glass surface but didn’t have the nerve to try out the bungee jumping or the skywalk in the open .
"A place full of adventure for adventure lovers. Just beside the sea which looks dark yellow here, a contrast from hong kong where it is blue... the tower is a man made marvel standing tall on the reclaimed area of the Macao island. Bungee jumping is the most adventurous part of this visit. Want some adrenaline flush, do it. Nice place with a restaurant at the basement accepting HKD and MKP both. Must go place"
"A great experience to have a view of Macau. It only cost us MOP 135 each person, for access to the indoor (58th. fl.) and outdoor (60th. fl.) area. And....you could see a breathtaking view of Macau bay area. They also offered outdoor activities such as budgee jumping from the top fl of the tower. Found some cool t-shirt from their souvenir shop. The price is reasonable with the product quality and unique design."
Have been there once with family and had amazing experience and great view from there. You can dive from the top of the floor.
Was on business event in Macao Tower.Food was nice but the most incredible is view. Highly recommend to everyone who is not afraid high views and good terraces.
"The view from the observation deck was pretty amazing! Walking on the portions with the glass flooring can be nerve-wracking but once you get used to the dizzying heights, you will surely appreciate the breathtaking Macau skyline. This is truly a wonderful experience that you must not miss when you visit Macau."
Pick a clear day to do it to benefit from views of the 3 main bridges. Its expensive for what is basically a ride in the lift. There are 2 viewing platforms and you can get coffee at the small stall. For more money you can visit the resteraunt or do one of the adrenalinefun things to do
Visit the 62nd floor and what a view. Look out on to the city. Try the sky walk or bungee jumping if you dare!!Shops and eateries on the ground floor along with rest rooms.
"The view from the top of the tower is great. It's not free though, so check the prices before you come and consider pre booking the access ticket. Once you're up on the sky deck there's a bar and restaurant, glass floors, great views across Macau, and the Hackett Area for their bungee/skyjump/tower walk experiences. These are all very expensive, so look out for some online deals first. But, the sky jump was an incredible feeling and I'd recommend it if it's on offer. Overall, apart from gift shops and food, there's not much in the tower for tourists to spend time with other than admiring the view. Recommended as part of a day trip to Macau, but it won't take up your whole day."
this was probably most well organized and quick ascend/descend at a tower ever across the world. wonderful views at both Macau and China. loved watching people walking on edge and getting ready to jump off. friendly staff
"I am afraid of heights but Macau Tower is a must see when you go to macau. I bought the ticket online via klook.com around almost 200k (IDR) per person but they have senior citizen (more than 65years old) price which is cheaper and children fare. When i enter the tower just go straight to the ticket counter to exchange the online ticket. Go to the lift to 61 floors. The view was amazing, you can do bungy jumping but too expensive for me hahha around 6million (IDR), sky walking cheaper around 1,3 million (IDR), or you want to climb the ladder up to highest part of the tower. I didn't do all of them. I just explore around which is enough for me, especially the glass bottom. You can take picture and see the road from 233 meters. So excited"
"Had the best buffet lunch, excellent choices with amazing 360 views from 60th floor. You can bungee jump too! Great staff, recommend a visit"
"Since we are doing the day trip in Macau, we wanted to visit this viewing tower to have a good view of the Macau city. However when we reached there, suddenly it became foggy and so we do not want to spend the money up. The tower price is not so cheap and there are selling quite a lot of souvenirs. Spend some time there and the next visit I will definitely want to try the sky walk or bungy jump."
Had a wonderful evening at Macao Tower. Me and my husband took skywalk.Location nearby Cotai area.Can get restaurants.Nice view in the evening as can see Hong Kong and all islands nearby with 360’ view.After 8 no shuttle service. Need to wait for cab or public bus. Had a hard time waiting for bus as drivers are not friendly.
"Had dinner in Tromba Rija and its amazing, hope to try the skywalk next visit and bungyjump. The only thing is shuttle buses are not too convenient from other hotels"
"My wife and I took the trip to the top of the Macau Tower...inside only. You get great views of Macau and you can watch people ledge walk and take selfies and if you're lucky, get a video of someone bungy jumping. Lots of room but few places to sit, relax or get a cold drink...but still worth the trip up. Found a nice restaurant on the lower floor."
Excellent view at 60 floors high! The elevator is so fast. Haha! We went to the observation deck after our tea time at the 360 Cafe. Just in time for sunset. We also stayed for a while so we could see the view at night. I guess it's the best time to go there. Commuting to Macau Tower is not hard. There are a lot of buses and shuttles that pass by here.
"Opted for the included Telescope & lunch buffet price. Great value for money spent.From the observation deck, fantastic way of viewing the whole of Macau including bridges & other areas outside the centre. Watched people doing bungy jumping."
"Had a really enjoyable experience starting with the ride up as  the elevator rises and the ground falls beneath you. The attractions outside not for the elderly or faint hearted,  but offers thrills nonetheless to the spectator. Also enjoyed international buffet lunch at the revolving restaurant. You meet all sorts of people and nationalities visiting this iconic landmark. Budget at least half a day for your visit to enjoy all the sights and attractions."
Had been here on a clear & bright day. Mesmerizing views of the city in 360 degree. Amazing tower which offers skywalk & bungee jumping too.
Last stop on our bus rides - paid to go to viewing platform  Foggy day so not such great views as they could have been.  Went up to the Outside viewing deck (where the bungy and skywalks happen).Casino shuttles pick up from here so use them to get where you want (eg City of Dreams / Studio City etc)
Been to many skyscrapers around the world but this one is little disappointing. It's was like Macau doesn't have any attractions like a good skyscrapers so they made this . The view for up their is also not that great. Save your money for Macau Paris and studio City view avoid this.
