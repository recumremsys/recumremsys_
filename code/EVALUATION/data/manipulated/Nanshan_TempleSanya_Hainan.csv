"This is a really wonderful place to visit.  Don't think I e seen a statue that stands so tall and in such a wonderful location in this beautiful cultural zone.  The statue is reached either by a 10-15 minute walk, which can be difficult for anyone that suffers with the heat, otherwise there are buggies that will take you straight to it, but the walk is lovely and a shame to miss.  Statue is located on a little island in the water reached by a short walkway over to it.  You can go up inside and walk around just below her feet but the queue to do this was quite long the day we visited.  There is also a nice village to visit with temples etc. which we were unable to do because our son had back problems and was unable to walk any further that day.  A very spiritual experience and again, stopped a number of times by Chimese people asking to have their photographs take with us.  How lovely."
It's our favorite attraction among all. Looking the construction beauty of the temple and Guan Yin statue is worth it.
"The Buddha is located in the middle of the sea & the view is magnificient. We enjoyed the sightseeing of the whole place & you have to bear with the hot sun if u happen to be there during summer.I felt so refreshing and have a calm mind after visiting the place. You will not forget this experience once you visit this place. I do not mind to visit again when I have the chance. There are a few small shops that sell food (eg icecream, souvenirs etc)I did not go up to the top level of the temple as usually very crowded even during weekdays. Do visit the place on weekday and not on weekend."
A huge temple complex dominated by a Goddess overlooking South China Sea. Take plenty of pics of shrines and pagodas on your way to the various Nanshan highlights.
It is such a touching and heartfelt space to be in. The temple is actually a huge park filled with buddhist wisdom and path. It is a joy to be in such a space. Spend at least half a day to be suffice to see most of the highlights within.
"First of all that’s not a statue/monument of Buddha! So please stop saying it’s a Buddha statue. Second, don’t buy overpriced tours for hundreds yuan, because this place is easily reachable by public transport. So, entrance is 108 RMB (seems like 1 RMB per 1 m of the statue, haha). Bus from the downtown of Sanya to Nanshan Temple is cca. 10 RMB. You can choose from many public transport routes using Apple Maps. As for instance, you may take following buses from the downtown: 16, 30, 25, 57. Your destination would be “NanShanSi” bus stop, which is just around the touristic parking lot of the Temple. What you’re gonna see when you enter: Guanyin monument, variety of parks, Nanshan Buddhist temple, Worship square, and I think that’s all. Well, the monument itself is really fascinating, but don’t forget you’re in China. Since showing off and persuading you to buy useless trinkets are cast in Chinese culture, be prepared to take a “fancy” picture with the Goddess on the background, to dine and pay three times more than a usual price; and many other things you wouldn’t want to do. Proving that’s a “commercial project” for attracting money from tourists, but not an authentic Buddhist temple, you’d find an exposition of gilded Guanyin statuettes inside the hall of the main Guanyin monument. We’ve been told everyone can pay around 5K RMB and his name would be engraved on the bottom of the statuette and placed into one of the exposition rooms. As I’ve seen hundreds of statuettes there, I could imagine how much money were accrued by these means. To conclude, I wouldn’t recommend this place since it’s quite expensive, considering it’s not an authentic religious place."
It's more of a tourist attraction than a real temple. It's too commercialised and money oriented. Don't expect to find peace here. But some interesting things like the lotus fountain. And nice view from the top
"""Hey! Let's build a three sided statue and then not let people see all three sides without paying 88RMB more!""Despite having a walkway all around the bottom of the statue which would have made for great pictures there is a bar and a policeman stopping you from enjoying the full experience.Most disturbing was the blatant blackmail surrounding the endangered Sea Turtles which you can ""release"" for an exorbitant amount of money.  This activity is illegal and these people should be fined."
There are people everywhere.  Welcome to china.  I accidentally stumbled upon a secret place to see the statue.  Go to the treehouse.  Go to the end of the end.  You will find a beach with nobody.  You will see the best view at least without 346 people in the background.  Remember don't tell too many people.
"The area is just huge. The temples is so nicely built. We spent more than half a day here. The access is easily accessible by wheelchair as I had no problem pushing him around the whole place. Only thing is when exiting the place we have to push him up the slope just takes away all your energy. Senior citizen gets in free. Don't buy any praying offering like joysticks at the roadside leading to the temple. We got tricked by our tour guide into buying those at the roadside thinking it would be cheaper. The temple have already banned all joysticks from outside since don't know when and we could see that many people got tricked too as the rubbish bins is full of dumped joysticks. But besides that, this place sure is worth another visit if I'm there again."
Good sunrise and sunsets family photos at many locations here. Had a great time walking through the temple.
"The majority of the  temple was completed in 1988 and is home to many Tang dynasty replicas. The main statue is of the of Buddhist Guanyin Goddess of Nansha, was built by 108 monks over the 1999 to 2005 period. Seems like a metre of statue height for each monk who worked on the project."
Seeing the massive Guanyin on the sea really brings peace to the mind and soul. The crowd wasn’t too bad when I went on a Saturday. The ticket is 120ishRMB. Not cheap. Do consider if it suits you
One of the “AAAAA” tourist spot in Sanya.  This place was hot and a lot of people. I highly recommend coming early. Remember no pictures once you get into the temple. They will watch you like a hawk.  There is quite a walk to get to most of the destinations.  Remember this place is vegetarian only so remember to eat something if you absolutely want some meat.
"Saw 108m tall Kuan Yin Bodhisattva.The statue is 3-sided. We were able to see only 2 sides.However, the place is rather commercialised.At the main entrance, we paid 150 rmb each.To see the 3rd facet of Kuan Yin Bodhisattva, we have to pay another sum."
"Interesting attractions with quite a few temples. They have a very nice vegetarian buffet at the restaurant. However, the whole place is man-made.We wanted to visit the viewing gallery on the floating Kwan-yin Bodhisattva statue but were told that we will need to ""donate"" an additional CNY88, on top of the CNY150 that we've already paid. Felt pretty cheated, and decided to not go up the viewing gallery."
"Be prepared to walk a distance from the main entrance to get to the temple and viewing the magnificent South Sea Guan Yin Statue.Be prepared to wait in long line / queue to get into the temple. There are not hundreds but thousand of Chinese tourists and foreigners waiting in line patiencely and orderly to get into the temple. Bring along a foldable umbrella or hat to shield yourself from the hot sun while queueing.Prior to getting into the temple, you will be informed to take off your hat and S show of respect when inside the temple. they is only one entrance and one exit point. Every visitors once inside the temple walk around viewing and preying in an orderly and quiet manner. There was a sense of tranquility and peaceful feeling while in the temple. No-one seem to be on a rush. Worth every minute of time spent in the temple. By the way, no photography allowed inside the temple. Another must visit attraction."
"Visiting Nanshan temple really complements yr Hainan visit, beautiful Buddhist temple, gardens, awesome vegetarian restaurant and the three face 165 m tall Buddha statue in the ocean. The place is visited by some 4 million people per year, expect some crowd."
"We came here during summer season. The weather was really hot. But we do love this attraction. The buddha statue is fascinating, standing along the sea. Must come if you are gonna travel to Hainan. Visited on Aug 2019."
This is the Southernmost temple in China. Located in the Nanshan Bouddhism  Cultural Park. It has beautiful scenery and can be considered the second most important attraction there after the lone Guanyin standing out by the seaside.
"This is meant to be a religious and cultural destination but it feels more like you are getting fleeced at every step of the way (buddha meets disney). Having said that, I do enjoy visiting and have made the trip several times. Try to go early before the crowds arrive or before it gets hot."
"We were on a tour and didnt realize it took us more than 160km from Qionghai to this temple. Extreme hot sun but you can easily buy the straw chinese hats made for beating the heat!Long walk from entrance to the temple with many devout followers of the ""Goddess of Mercy"". There is also a buggy service / tram ride available for a few dollars per pax. Recommended for families with young children / elderly. As i am not a Buddhist follower, i just admire the sea view and magnificent rocks.. buy a Magnum ice cream and enjoy the long walk."
Quite beautiful grounds. Statue is 108 m tall and has three sides to it. Surrounding grounds and temples are worth seeing.
"The Nanhai Guanyin statue in the Nanshan Temple is very amazing. It is very tall and stand facing the sea and the land. It has 3 sides. There are also many interesting places to visit and walk around. Me and my girlfriend took a 1 day tour there. Its far from the place we stayed and with the day's tour, tour bus and tour guide is provided so any inconveniences are avoided. Be it you are a believer of Buddha or not, this place is a must go if you are in Sanya."
Went with tour group. Very impressive statue of Guanyin. There's free joss sticks provided and you can donate any amount of blessing.
Paid my visit to this temple as part of my second visit to Hainan island. The kwan yin statue in the middle of the sea is the biggest I've ever seen in my life. The temple is very very big and it almost looks like a maze. Weather is hot during my long visit @ May - June though.
"Among the attractions on Hainan Island, I would rate this attraction as the best among all of them. The admission charge is not that exorbitant at RMB 150 as compared with some other attraction. We stayed at an apartment at Dadonghai and we took the public bus no.16 to the attraction. However, we realized that public bus no. 25 that ply the same route at a cheaper fare. One must understand that the holy site of this Nanshan Buddhism Culture Park covers an extensive area and include many other temples, pavilions, beach, pagodas and parks and it would take more than 3 hours to cover most of the attractions. Bearing this in mind, it is thus prudent to arrive at the temple early so that you can cover most of the attractions and have the time to enjoy your vegetarian lunch at the restaurant if you so wish.Exploration by foot in the Cultural Park is physically taxing but a number of the pagodas and hill parks are located off the main road and only through leg work could one locate them. I do not see the necessity to take the tram but for the disabled, the aged and the tender young, I would suggest to take the tram. I was astounded by the impressively stunning and intriguing beautiful tall statue of the Guan Yin. The fine statue sparkles in the cloudy sky amidst a scenic background of mountains and sea.  I came to understand that the standing Nanhai Guan Yin is the tallest of its kind in the world. There are free guides provided by the temple and they help to explain the ritual steps and how one should conduct oneself when praying to the Guan Yin Goddess. No photography in the temple but one can explore freely around and view the many deities at the ground and upper floors. Unfortunately, on that day of my visit, it started to rain and thunders were heard and due to inclement weather, we were not allowed to take the lift to the upper floor to touch the feet of the Buddha for blessing.I climbed up a hill and visit a pavilion on top of the hill. From the hill, I was able to view the gorgeous panoramic view of the Nanshan Temple. It was stunning and spectacular and I like the serene atmosphere at the hilltop. The beach with the many boulder stones and rocks also project a beautiful picture of the Guan Yin statue that extends to the sea. The Nepalese Temple, the Longevity Village and the God of Fortune Temple and the many Luohan and Buddhist sculptures that studded around the cultural park added much interesting feature and dynamism into the area. I like this holy place though it is a bit of commercialized."
"This is a popular tourist area and you can't avoid crowds. One plus point is they do have several ticketing counters and this makes the purchasing of tickets a breeze. When you enter the huge area, you will be greeted by many booths renting you a audio device for a relaxing self guided tour in the park. We looked at the map and decided that to walk the entire area under the scorching sun is too much. Just as we were discussing our route, we were pleasantly surprise to find a booth that rent a buggy with a driver. We quickly grab the offer and took the ride. We took the buggy for 4 pax and off we go. On the way we saw crowds heading at all directions. Our guide was friendly and provided an overall introduction for the park (in mandarin). The guide was also more than glad to answer any queries. Entrance fees and token for donations were the extra cost if you want to visit the interior of some of the locations. The plus point for taking the buggy was that we were given priority queues at these locations, much time was saved!The highlight of this tour was of course to view the majestic 3-faced Goddess of Mercy at the far end of the park. Sitting on the buggy, we by passed all the tourists who were walking a long distant on the bridge. We went around the exterior of the statue and were really close to see the craving on the statue. All in all, we are just glad that we decided to take the buggy ride. We cut the visiting hours more than half, save ourselves from the tedious walk and were under shades most of the time. Do remember to request your buggy driver to stop at points for photo taking opportunities."
"Can you believe in a country that only 10 percent of citizens are religious and yet they charge so much for an entrance fee to a temple. The entrance fee to the temple is RMB 150 and this does not cover the shuttle to bring you around and the tour guide fee. If you are wearing a comfortable shoes, please help your self to walk a little because the statue is not far away from the entrance. There are some vegetarian restaurant inside but not recommend to eat there. Don't buy any souvenir because it is not worth it.You can take a bus from any location in SanyA and it will cost less than RMB 17, but in a peak season the bus could be very crowded as the conductor love to squeeze people in it. The area that I stay is in Tianya, and it cost me only RMB 5 to reach nanshan, however some buses does not reach to the gate of temple, you might need to walk another 2 km or you just pay a motorcycle rider RMB 10 to bring you to the temple gate."
"Don't let the entry fee put you off! Once inside the area there is a lot of different things to see, we went off the main track and found beautiful lakes and gardens. There is a wide variety of different temples to explore and the main attraction is really good, you are able to touch the feet if you really want! She represents good wealth and is a national treasure so very popular with the Chinese (I wouldn't go during a national holiday). We went with our boys and they also enjoyed the experience. We didn't pay for shuttles- the hill climbs aren't that bad and there are things to stop and look at along the way."
"Overpriced, overcommercialised theme park. An unauthentic temple experience that disappointed me. Tourists were unconsiderate. Drivers of the tour 'trains' honked loudly all the time, disrupting the peace of the area."
Visited this place on October. The time visit was a public holiday in China. The crowd made us have to walk very far and wait for very long queue.The entrance ticket can be purchase online or on the spot when you reach there. Will suggest to take a car tour in as round trip to the whole area.
Having seen Guanyin satue from the air flying in it was well worth a visit to see it up close.  The park surrounding is very peaceful and lovely to walk around.
"Absolutely must visit place in Hainan as a big part of chineese culture and just a very beatiful and big park!it will most probably take the whole day to check and visit all location of the park. Get ready to long walks, numerous photoshots, put on light shoes, get a hat and grab eough water! Sounds frightening? Don't worry, you will need all this to walk trhough the park and finally meet the Guanyin Goddess! No words to describe the views from the top of the statue, but come early to avoid 40mins (which is worh waiting) queue to the temple entrance!Of course the Statue and the temple at the basement is the main sightseing, but not the only!You must also visit the Golden Temple and the Longevity valley, and many other locations! All this will make you day wonderful and fill you with pure chinese culture!"
"Was a nice outing to what is a fairly large complex. Views are stunning. Bit crowded by ticketing area, however it eases up from there. Paid around RMB120 each way from Sanya Bay"
