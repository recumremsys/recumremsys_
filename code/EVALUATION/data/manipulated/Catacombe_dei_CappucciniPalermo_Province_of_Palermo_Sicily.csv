Very powerful place to visit. Makes you really consider mortality. Absolutely fascinating. At only €3 for entry its well worth a visit. No photos allowed which is only right showing respect for the dead.
Found this on a website of top things to do in Palermo so went along. Very interesting somber and different place to visit. Makes you think of your own mortality and not for everyone I would think and not for young children. One  feels that you need to be reverend and quiet on a visit.
"The museum has the biggest selection of mummies in the world and you experience a different type of just a simple visit to a museum. The mummies are placed in a every single wall of the catacombs and are categorised according to the sex,age or social status. They wear their own clothes (even the cappucin monks) from 16th till 20th century. Don't forget to visit the room with the 2 year old girl that her body has remained almost intact from 1920! Sometimes it gets a bit scary but you won't regret it for sure. The ticket costs 4 euros."
"An absolute must when in Sicily! The whole experience is eerie and intriguing. For just €3 is well worth it.  Is not very well signposted though, we walked along this never ending street looking at the map,asked a local and there it was,just 20 m in front of us."
"This site is just a few euro to enter, and it is well preserved and managed. Expect to see literally hundreds of full skeletons in era dress. There is also a section of deceased children fully dressed in their age appropriate garb. We did not stay long here, as it was not our taste.  Given a second chance, I would have skipped it altogether.  Not in a particularly convenient area either, and cabs on exit were nonexistent."
Ii was very scary. I could not finish my tour. It is awesome for those who like scary staff. Taking pictures are not allowed.
Place in Palermo You must visit. Hundrets of corpses / skeletons makes You feel strange and thrilled. Especially mumies of children and infants. Some of them so well preserved... We were seriously moved after the visit. Don't miss it!
"Take the deour, get lost in the slum area of the city and find this place, it is worth it.  Again, small and you need maybe 30 minutes to see it you you walk slowly but very cool."
"Visited April, couple of weeks ago, 3euros per person if i remember rightly. awe inspiring, eye opening visit if you can, you will never see anything like this again."
"Visited out of curiosity, only a few euros to get in. Underneath the church you find rows and rows of skeletons some of which are in remarkably good state of preservation.  Beware there is a section for children and babies. Some have been hung from the walls, some are laying on shelves. It's an interesting look at how a previous culture dealt with death."
Very bizarre place. The only interesting part is how the dead people are dressed in that period. Rest I found full of dust and very gloomy and dark.  Management don't want you to take pictures as you have to respect the dead people. of course is right but then they want you to pay to go and see it. As well they took some pictures in advance for the advertising of the place..i don't honestly I know why I decided to go...
3 euros entry fee. closed b/w 1230 and 1500hrs.it's morbid yet sad to see all those bodies. the bodies however have been preserved so well. they're divided by societal classes. the children were most disturbing.
"Easy walk from the central district. Just map it first. Only $3 euros each. Read up on it first on Wikipedia. Found that helpful. Some say it is musty and smells, we did not experience that. It is much more ""stinky"" outside with all the smokers and from the dogs peeing and pooping on sidewalks. Found it interesting inside. You will probably spend no more than 20 minutes walking through it.  Might not be a good place to take small children, could be creepy for them. We also found it interesting to walk through the cemetery just to the left. It is free to walk around in there and different than ours in America. Also on the walk to the catacombs we found a cute little ceramic store with great prices. It was on Cappucini. You can watch the family painting the ceramics right there. It has been open for over three generations. Enjoy!"
"It's eery but very interesting . You can see human bodies in different states of decay, some still with human hair intact. Read up before or later on the story of the young girl who died of pneumonia but is still well preserved"
"Different culture explained visually. Great experience, and so different from the where I am coming from. Do it, try it and bring some friends."
Do not miss this catacombs if you are in Palermo. Everywhere skulls bones. Nice experience you will see how you will be look like 200 years later.
This is a must visit when in Palermo. Forget the high priced tours ... Entrance is only 3 Euro... and the Catacombs are accessible by a leisurely walk or taxi. Historically... fantastic...  just remember... it is a crypt
"This is the busiest we have seen anywhere in our 3 days visiting Palermo. 3 Euro per person- paid to a monk- will get you to see at least 8000 dead remains including “virgins, professionals, clergy” and other interesting categories as described by the attraction.When the original cemetery was full the answer was to dig deep and created a new area of “storage” - the first being in 1599; Silvestro of Gubbio, he was mummified. In addition to the 8000 I should have said there is at least another 1200 mummified remains as well.Lots of coffins- open and closed. Very dusty remains. Goes on and on and on.Interesting place and has you thinking about your own mortality.O and the last person “buried” - actually fully preserved in a sealed case is Rosalia Lombardo (aged 2) who died of pneumonia. Her father arranged this and the body is further preserved for all to see. Ummmmm! Whatever your thoughts, it will be sometime before you forget this attraction.Well worth a visit!"
"Situated north of the main hotel district, this attraction is slightly difficult to locate, so ensure that you are conversant with the map when you set off - by bus and foot is entirely feasible. The mummified / skeletal bodies are slightly musty and the subject of intermittent illicit photos. The decaying dress is intriguing and let's face it, a composite reminder that tempus fugit. I would recommend hanging around outside one of the cafes in the road approaching the Catacombs, several Capuchin monks strolled past and made an interesting photo assignment - but I would be over-stating the opportunity to say they were cooperating !"
Do not miss this place. Maybe the only one in the world of this kind. Bodies were preserved using a different method. Some stay in very good condition. Amazing. Not the same feeling when you see it live than in a photo or video. You need a car to get there. Located away from…
"A bit bizarre Place to og, but the curiosity caught up With us. Be aware of People that will watch Your car for Money if you park in the area. Its free parking so no need for that. We chose to move tha car further away, not possible to know what that People will do. Hence not a particularly Nice area around the entrance. We paid 3 EUR to get in, it was Worth it. A special look to walk inbetween dead People on Exhibition like that. I must say, i picked up some  energy a Place in there, but surpisingly calm energy even so many destinies on display. I highly recomment for those who seek alternatives to churches and fountains."
"It is a bit far from the center but it is worth the visit. Although we read about it before, we were shocked when stepped in. I don't know why, but we thought that there must be a short ""warm up"" to prepare ourselves to this extraordinary experience, still there isn't. Be prepared for this trip!"
"This is an amazing display of corpses, most incredibly well preserved. A must see for us although others many wonder.It is important not to consider walking here, as we did. This is not a good idea as suddenly big roads with many people around turn into very run down areas where my wife felt very uncomfortable. Get a taxi for E15."
Following a recommendation we toured this site. It is very confronting units presentation.Think carefully before your visit.It is odd in its presentation of young children and may not be appropriate for your young children.
Taking of photos are not allowed. Kids are allowed as long as not scared of dead people/skeletons. Short walk from Normanni. Sending of postcard is available.
It is a really interesting place to go if you haven't been in catacombs before. You will be disturbed by the quality of the mommys. Don't look at them too long ;-)
"Incredible to visit, very confronting. Do not recommend for children at all. Avoid walking here as the road is very narrow and busy."
"You can take your time and see everything in 45 minutes. Preety cool in a dark tourism way. It's a bit outside the historical area. Could have done with more information on why, when and who. I think they were more interested in selling their guide. Note the times are 9:00-1:00 and 3:00-6:00."
"Decided to walk there from the centre of Palermo- took me about 25 min and got lost but people were happy to help. I think I was lucky because there was nobody there to charge for the entry. The sight was really striking, especially a little girl whose body was so well preserved it looked as if she was asleep!"
It was interesting but I wouldn't recommend anyone to go out of their way to see this unless they are really fascinated by this type of attraction. The place can be stuffy and claustrophobic but luckily our visit was at an off-peak time with just a handful of people there so I didn't feel the full effect of claustrophobia. Not to be disrespectful but the continuous walls of corpses got repetitive after a while. What I didn't expect was to be so affected by the babies. Having family and friends who have experienced this loss hit a bit too close to home for me. Also not a good place to go if you are dealing with death and loss as it is all quite sad and morbid.
A fair walk out of the town and unfortunately just timed so they had closed. Visited the interesting cemetery attached with Ornate crypts housing families. 
"Well?? What do you expect to see!! It's very well advertised and near top (attraction?)of Places to go in PalermoIT was their choice !! & everyone entering should know what to expect, get real fellow travelers please!!Read the history its always been about money making (by monks!!)that's why it was stopped hundred years agoAs an attraction its sort of  weirdly fascinating, If you think its disrespectful or repulsive,save yer money!The clothing styles from early monks through to approx 1900'sIs interesting, and the history of how it started with just the monks and developed into a money making procedure for monastery  only the rich could afford before stopped by city council and the different types mumming procedures are evident as you go from eldest to newest (little girl in crib) Is it disrespectful?? Remember most of the town's people mummified here paid lots of money to be put here in their best gear,not to be put in a grave like 99.9% of less rich people in PalermoAnd most importantly it was theirs or their families choice to be quite literally left ""hanging a around""  for eternity!And if medical science can ever bring you back to life, then these guys are surely first in que,! If by chance they ever wake at least they will be with their mates not trapped in a box!You pay's yer money and you make yer choices in life (death)Enjoy!!"
I have been too so many catacombs but this was the only one that I seen mummies face to face.  It's not scary at all after all.  Definitely recommended. 3 Euro per person.  The Catacombs is closed from 1230 - 1500 and we have to come back the next day.  Open from 0900 - 1230 then 1500 - 1700.
"Visited today by myself since I could not get anyone to visit with me. It does not take a lot of time, so if you are short on time it is a good choice."
"Only €3 but when you’ve seen one skull wrapped in material you’ve seen them all. Slightly disturbing, and nothing to help guide you to different areas in English, so I didn’t know what I was looking at. Skipped the queues and left pretty quickly...."
