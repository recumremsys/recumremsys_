Easy fast stop to The Holy Cross.   15 minutes to see church and the view. Parking lot is small but turns over quickly.
Beautiful church and an amazing view.   Easy access.  Watch time though as they do not open until 9am.  We were a little early and had to wait outside the gate.
"great spot to check out, views were great, nice and quiet and respectful inside the church. shop was downstairs. wish the drive up was open at sunset, probably would have a great view. great place to stop and see."
Very easy to find and access. Drive up to a parking lot and easy incline up a ramp to the chapel. Great views of Sedona both outside the building and through the windows of the chapel. Down the stairs is a gift shop - that chapel itself it quite small. It’s picturesque and add to view and you have a must do during you visit to Sedona.
"The Chapel of the Holy Cross is stunning.  Awesome views, very peaceful.  Be patient with parking - the visit can be fairly quick - but worth it.  Very easy to find."
Beautiful church in a stunning environment.   Easy to get to but could see it busy on the weekends.Great overlooks of the Sedona hills.The church is small but really cool.  Check it out.
"Beautiful experience at the Chapel of the Holy Cross. There are two parking lots - one lower and one upper - both are extremely limited. During the hours of operation, there are golf carts that will take you up the hill as it is a pretty steep. You  don't need a ton of time here. You will see some great views of the red rocks and the inside of the church is beautiful,but small. Downstairs there is a small gift shop. Be sure to take a picture from the lower parking area so you can get the front of the church."
Gorgeous church!   Helps one feel the grandeur of God’s creation!  Must see.  Go early small parking lot fills up quick. 
The view  is breath taking of the mountains around Holy Cross. The cross it self is also well worth seeing.  Park up the hill as high as you can to reduce your walk.
"parking is difficult. the way up is steep. but the view of the area and the chapel itself is worth the effort. Park on the flats before the driveway and wait for one of the two golf carts for transport. Be sure to tip, properly."
"Definitely a must see for the view. The chapel is beautiful as well. Beware parking can be limited and a tight fit when busy, but the chapel does have some folks with golf carts to give visitors rides up/down the hill. (We tipped our driver.) Also there are no public bathrooms at the Chapel. So go before. Otherwise your option is a port-a-john by one parking lot. I would advise getting there early when they open. The gift shop is nice, and please don’t take photos in the shop. (There are signs posted asking folks not to but I still saw several people whipping out their cell phones at every corner.)"
"Quick trip that everyone should make. The chapel is small but so powerful. Grab a brochure and read and really take a look at the statue. So peaceful, powerful and beautiful."
A must see spot. Very prayerful. Very interesting architecture. A really nice gift shop. Don’t miss this spot
Chapel of the Holy Cross is a very modern building with a great view through window with cross.  Great views from plaza outside.  Park below and hike up or try for a parking space above or wait for one of the guides to pick you up in a golf cart -- all depending on how much energy you have.  Spend a few minutes to contemplate how you came to be in the midst of this wonderous creation.
Went to see the chapel in the Red Rocks as well as take a short hike. Gates don't open till 9 on a Sunday. We parked at the bottom and walked up. The chapel is a must see! I love Frank Lloyd Wright architecture. After opening there are golf carts available to take you up to the chapel but we walked up. On a Sunday in January the crowds were minimal. We liked that. We also found the chapel trail and took a short hike. I would definitely recommend this as a must see if in the Sedona area.
Chapel of the Holy Cross is a contemporary Catholic church built into the side of the rocks.  Follow the parking lot to the top for easy access without walking too far and take in the sites around you.  The church inside is actually very small with a beautiful cross made of wood.  There is a small gift shop in the basement of the church with a few items for sale.   This is a good stop just south of Sedona.
Do not miss this on your way up to Sedona. I’ll beautiful chapel in the mountains hills. It was just lovely!
"Easy to get to. Not alot of parking, may have to walk abit. Worth the time. The view is outstanding. Take your time and relax and enjoy the views."
An unexpected chapel in an unexpected location.  Fascinating architecture and history.  Magnificent views.  Stop an visit this place.  It’s worth your time.
"Views at the top are breathtaking.   Stop at the bottom and get the full view then drive up the hill there should be parking.  At the very top was a handicap lot, which we were thankful for."
The simple beauty of the Chapel is surrounded by God’s glory - The amazing view of the red rocks. Right off 179 easy to get to. Don’t pass up this beautiful place.
I was pleasantly surprised. Very beautiful place. Had a place to pray & light candles. I took full advantage of that. The scenery is the most beautiful.
"Visited to light candles for my list parents. It was a beautiful and moving visit. You may have to park a ways down the road and walk up, depending on how busy it is."
Amazing architecture gracefully executed with a spectacular view. Sit a while inside the chapel to enjoy the peaceful environment.
We parked at the very bottom and hiked up.  Nice jaunt up the hill.  The chapel is beautiful.  The views outdoors are incredible.  Stopped there on our way to Sedona and was a fantastic spot to start our vacation.
This is a must see while in Sedona and “free”.   Interesting story about how the church came to be and it is appreciated more if you read about it prior to going.   The Crucifix inside is quite spectacular.  You do not have to be Catholic to go inside but I was disappointed by the lack of respect for “quiet” by the many tourists and parents not preparing their children prior to entering the worship space ...the gift shop downstairs had a nice selection.  All was open on 12/24 and they even gave golf cart rides if you did not want to walk up the road!   Looked like lots of parking but still was almost full on 12/24.  Highly recommend visiting ...
"I felt blessed to have an opportunity to visit. It’s awesome view, awesome calmness in the air. Take some time to sit in the church to enjoy the ambience."
"Stopped by enroute to Flagstaff from Phoenix. Detour through Seasons was well worth it, and this place was beautiful. The chapel itself has a magnificent floor-to-ceiling crucifix, and the panoramic views of the mesas and other rock formations are breathtaking. Worth a stop if you're in the area."
"Quick stop - maybe 45 min? - the longest was spent looking for a parking place- some down below and some up top, you just circle around and come back, people directing traffic were helpful. We walked from below, a little steep, person with knee issues in our group ended up getting a ride back down in the golf cart option. Worked well. Totally worth it for the views and the chapel is so beautiful. Don’t miss it!"
"We expected the chapel to be larger as it looks very large from pictures and as you approach. We arrived to fins many cars already parked and had concerns about the drive, parking and walk as my husband wears ankle braces and I have cancer. We were able to find parking and a volunteer immediately showed up in a golf cart to transport us to the ramp leading in. Although there were many people as we approached the entrance people were quiet and inside I could sit and pray although there were many picture takers. I none the less felt as if I was the only person there and in fact most people did not sit down or go down the small aisle. Made for a very pleasant experience."
For sure the spirits are here. Catheral is a beautiful shrine to the site and God magnificence. Gorgeous red rock.  Expect a crowd so go early in the morning.
"This is a must see if you are in the Sedona area.  The Chapel is awesome and you must go inside.  They have golf carts to take you up the hill from the parking area if you need assistance.  Parking is a problem as it is at most places especially on the weekends.  The mountain behind is incredible.  Look for the eagle, mushrooms and the mitten.  Just a great site."
"Parking is tough but there are folks to help direct, be patient and you’ll eventually park. A pretty good walk up a fairly steep incline. Seems many folks were spiritually overwhelmed and were having quite deep feelings inside the church. Surrounded by the beautiful rocks so very picturesque. Inside there is a huge art piece, I think bronze, of Jesus on the cross. Many tours stop here, I’m glad I went."
"We were told this was a don’t miss, the outside is beautiful and inside too.  Parking was rough and the walk is all up hill. Wearing masks, due to COVID makes it a little harder to walk in the heat. Great pictures were taken and I would recommend"
"While in Sedona, we decided to visit the chapel.  How beautiful! Altough with COVID restrictions, we couldn't enter without masks, we were still able to enjoy the interior from a distance. Felt peaceful and serene. Great view too."
