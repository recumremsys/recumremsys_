"The landscape of the Devrent Valley is completely unique, with its fairy chimneys and tall rocks forming shapes such as a camel, seal, dolphin and snake. This is the lunar landscape for which Cappadocia is famous. Wear sturdy shoes, practical clothes and take a hat and water, as it's really hot during the day. You don't have to be an experienced climber, but you do need to be sure of foot and in relatively good health as some of the terrain can be challenging and slippery underfoot. Fabulous spot for a hike amongst some incredibly unusual scenery!"
Also known as Imagination Valley. Filled with unique looking Fairy Chimneys resembling animal shapes. The area is full of tourists who come for photography. Worth visiting only if you have extra time to spend in Cappadocia. But I would not prioritize it over other landmarks.
Traveling to this place in Aug heat was bit difficult but we had great experience here. All these are supposed to have fallen during volcanic eruption many thousand years ago and they hit the earth so hard that it created great foundation for themselves.But One question. How come so many structures and so similar in places were created? Was it just a natural phenomenon? Even man designed structures cannot be so huge and unique with similarities. The structure resembling a Camel was probably damaged by people....Nature or God is truly a great Artist.
"We walked through it about 30-45 minutes. It was very interesting, quiet, peaceful.Historical.  Guessing what the shapes look like is fun."
"Cappadocia covers a huge area and it is daunting to know where to start. It is divided into some fantastically named valleys and bounded by the towns Ürgüp, Avanos & Nevşehir. 5km north of Ürgüp you drive through Devrent Valley (Imagination Valley). This is one of the largest and most open areas to explore. On either side of the road are hundreds of eroded volcanic structures, each capped by a blob of hard rock. They have been given names such as the cobra, dogs head, alligator, and the most famous one - the camel. The camel is directly opposite the coach park and currently has a fence around it. The smooth walkways between rocks are steep in places and would be challenging for older travellers or those with mobility issues. Note - you can only walk around these - none of them have been converted into houses in this area."
"A must in Cappadocia. Forget what the guides tell you about the rocks, use your imagination and find your own look like rock formation. This can be challenging and funny. If you come with family, try playing: I see a ..... Another gift from nature. Thank you."
"Great stop for tour groups, rental cars and anyone in the area. Get out and walk around, take lots of pictures and wonder how long it took to get this way. I stopped twice, once with a tour group and a second time in a rental car. Either way it is easy to get around to see some of the many sites in the area."
Most visit place if you are in Cappadocia . Try the Turkish pistachio ice cream for about 10 liras . Best ice- cream ever.
