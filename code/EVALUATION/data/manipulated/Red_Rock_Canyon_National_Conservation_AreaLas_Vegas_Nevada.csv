"1st Time to Red Rock, the rain deter me from taking a hike in one of the many trails within Red Rock Canyon Conservation Area. This is my 2nd time and determine to do at least 1 solo hike. Took the TurtleHead trail and oh man I have underestimated the difficulty for my own physical condition. Over still a wonderful 3 plus hour hike in less than 10 deg weather conditions. It's a great place to visit and take a simple hike."
"Highly recommend the Fossil Canyon Loop Trail for a fairly gentle 3.7 - 4 mile hike (our phones didn’t agree) through a canyon chock full of rock walls covered with fossilized coral and all of the critters caught in it when time ran out.  We also saw a jack rabbit, lizards, chipmunks and a baby rattlesnake.  Come early, bring water.  There are a few areas where you need to go slow and climb up some steps, but nothing too difficult.  Parking area is off the main road.  No public restrooms."
"Visited early Sunday morning and watched the film in the visitor center before driving around the 13 mile loop. Stopped at a few of the parking lots to check out the views, but did not have time to hike to the petroglyphs. Used the Senior Pass for National Parks for free entrance."
Rented a car for the trip so that I could final make it out the Red Rock! Simply Beautiful! 13 mile scenic drive was breathtaking and had a great flow of pace to enjoy the Mountains. You must visit on your next trip!
"Great park, full of gorgeous scenery.  We did the Calico Hills hike, starting from the Calico 1 parking lot, and ending about halfway between Calico 2 and the Sandstone Quarry lots.  Did a small scramble up some rocks for fun -- would be lots of fun to climb if you have the time.  Was there with young kids, was great for them."
We have been to Red Rick several times in our two years living in Henderson. We have a National Park Pass so it’s free to get in. This week we hiked Calico Tanks trail. It was rated moderate and my husband and I who are in our late 60’s had no problem but we are very active people. The 2.5 mile trail has many places that require boulder climbing. There is a descent elevation change so you feel like you are exercising. The trail is not a loop. Ends at a beautiful viewpoint looking out over the entire Las Vegas Valley. On the way you pass by two “natural tanks “ both which had water this time of year. Plenty of shade. Trail well marked and there were many other hikers even tho it was a Friday morning. The Canyon has a 13 mile scenic drive for those who choose not to hike. The scenic drive has several overlook stopping areas. One way driving so you have plenty of time to see while driving. Red Rock Canyon has a beautiful Visitor Center with gift shop and Rangers to answer all your questions. There are hikes for all levels of difficulty and even rock climbing areas. Don’t miss this beautiful park while visiting Nevada.
"Took a drive around the scenic loop and it was beautiful.  Not crowded during our trip (probably due to the cornoavirus shutdowns).  We also had beautiful, crisp weather.  Summer would be brutal! Must see if in the Vegas area.  Beautiful views."
"Wife & I visited Red Rock Canyon in mid-March 2020. 5 1/2hrs length of visit.  Looking to do some Hiking.  Arrived on Saturday morning around 10am.  Sunny low 50's. Breezy/Windy up in elevation. (*Suggestion - purchase the Annual National Parks Pass $80 - saves on park entrance fees - esp if visiting alot of Nat parks/Nat rec areas).  Visitor center has good history info and great little gift shop w/quality items (some gift shops can be ""way too tacky"" with tourism items).  Trails:  Grab a Trail Map as you come into Park. The road is only a ""ONE WAY"" traffic.   Note: the trails closer to road will see more foot traffic as they have easy access.  We hiked two remote trails.  I highly recommend the ""KEYSTONE THRUST"" trail, its 1.2miles in to the end.  Great Views at end of trail.  Warning: The elevation goes up 370ft - its a good heart pumping exercise - Bring water - its a high desert environment - same is true for alot of the trails that have elevation.  See many people not prepared with water, not a good idea as it leads to headaches/upset stomachs.  Also, be cautious of uneven terrain.  Our next trail was the LaMadre Spring trail - its an old canyon road with loose rocks.  A moderate difficulty - uphill elevation 400ft - 3.5miles in & out.  Nothing too spectacular trail though but great views...the ""springs"" at the end of trail are not as impressive as one is lead to believe. Picnic area:  We did spend time to have lunch at a picnic table area, About a dozen tables.  A few families using them.  We did find that 1 out of 3 restrooms (vault toilet) were available to use others locked. Bring Hand sanitizer/wipes.  Road traffic:  Just wanted to mention that vehicle traffic gets heavy through out the day.  Speed limits range from 15 to 30mph (posted)...expect people to pass along the left as slower traffic is viewing the scenery.  The one way road allows plenty of passing.  They do have staff to assist with directing people if parking areas are ""overflowed""...They do allow parking on the road.Hiking note:  Some trails are difficult to average person.  Recommend that wearing adequate footwear for uneven terrain.  We have hiking boots and carry gear/supplies for Hiking.  My wife and I are experienced hikers.  I did notice people wearing ""flip flops"" and High heels ""dress shoes"" - yes, an older lady wearing 3inch heels on a hiking trail.  Crazy to see here ankles twisting walking over rocks, etc....she was leaning on her male counterpart."
"This is a beautiful natural area. It is an easy drive from Las Vegas- no tour arrangements are needed for day hiking. Or, if you have a 4x4 you can drive a mile or so further up the drive. Only one disappointing comment- there are good signs and info markers until you go past the paved road. Then you are on your own to find the sights. Bring water. Wear a hat."
Had an amazing drive through the scenic route. Gorgeous and awe inspiring! A must do site seeing venture when in Vegas.
Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area from Las Vegas is a quick and easy 45 minute. Going around the park is free unless you want to visit their Visitor's Center where you pay their entrance fee. There are a lot key points to stop to take photos or to do some short hiking. Highly recommended if you are visitor of Las Vegas.
"Red Rock Canyon:   If you are not interested in our  weekend hiking adventures then just skip my next three posts #9-11. We rented a car and spent Friday morning hiking and driving Red Rock Canyon. We’d driven it many years ago but had not hiked. It is a 13 mile one-way road so if you want to hike you must do the hikes in order or you will need to complete the driving loop and start over again. All visitor centers were closed - sometimes a store is open in the parks but we did not stop at this one. We were out of Vegas about 7:45ish after picking up our car and passing the 'Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area’ at 8:15. In 10 minutes we’d parked at Calico Hills to begin our first hike. The temps were not too bad yet — we loved the dry air being from a gulf coast state. We enjoyed the #1 hike. Beautiful views and not too hard….. to a point. There was a steep section near the beginning of the trail but nothing we could not handle. We’ve just returned from extensive hiking in 3 NP this August at high elevations. Loved the formations we walked past and the views. We stopped for a bit to watch some rock climbers — braver than us!  We got to the end of the trail to find a ‘wire basket’ of rocks marking the rest of the loop. It had taken only about 30 minutes to this point even with watching the rock climbers. The rest of the trail required rock scrambling and I told my husband I was not ‘going there'. I am afraid of ledges without railings and did not want to wear out the seat of my pants ‘scooting’ like I did last year in Utah!  He said he’d go on forward and I could back track - fine by me!  I enjoyed going down the steep section of trail on the return and got back to the trailhead about 10 minutes before him — he told me I had made the right choice for me!By 9:15 we were back on the scenic drive to our next hike destination. We stopped at several overlooks and took our time as I videoed and photographed the amazing scenery. We arrived at our next trailhead, the Lost Creek loop at 9:40 ready to stretch our legs. It is also the trailhead for the loop hike Willow Springs. There are a few markers here and there but sometimes it was very confusing which rock to climb! This trail begins flat and then turns into ‘rock climbing’ — we had forgotten our walking poles at the condo and really wished we had them on this trail. — there were several sets of ‘stairs of rocks’ without railings that would have been nice to have something to hold on to — especially coming down!  My husband offered his hand so I took it coming down as a mental thing - no way would he have stopped me from falling if I’d tripped. The walk was ‘moderate’ in my book and it was a fun trail. We have no idea where the ‘loop’ part was so we just came back the way we went…..at least we knew that part of the trail!  We had met some locals at the end of the trail and it was all dried up and rocky. They said the snow melt would fill up that section of the creek. It really was ‘lost’.  Beautiful views and as I mentioned, a fun trail.We next stopped at the Petroglyphs Wall trail — only about 0.1 mile to a mountain side with petroglyphs and information signs. It was interesting but nothing one has to see unless this is an interest of yours — you can see petroglyphs on a few other trails. The road to this walk turns off the main scenic drive and is a rocky, dirt road…..nothing our rental was in danger of getting harmed by driving on it - just a heads up. We were only here about 12 minutes — as we just walked in and out — took a few pics of the petroglyphs and did not tarry. By this time it was heating up as it was 10:30.  The only other trail I was interested in was a ‘boardwalk’ so it would be easy enough. At 11:00 we arrived at Red Springs Boardwalk. It was a nice 1/2 mile boardwalk in pretty scenery. I did not actually see the ‘spring’ but there was quite a bit of greenery around so there was evidence of a water source. The information signs along the way were interesting and explained a lot about the types of rocks we were seeing. If you have mobility issues this is a nice flat walkway.We headed back as we had only water and snacks and we were getting hungry — we arrived back in LV about 12:30."
"A beautiful drive or hike.  Have been on numerous hikes thru here, in numerous canyons - absolutely stunning!"
"This place is so cool! My wife and I took the short 20 minute drive from the strip in our rental convertible on our most recent trip to Vegas! There is so much to do, from miles and miles of hiking trails, to rock climbing, to bicycle tours, red rock has it all! Driving the scenic loop with the top down on the convertible was absolutely breathtaking! It was a nice change of pace from the hustle and bustle of the strip! My wife isn’t very outdoorsy, so we chose to just take some pictures within close range of the car at most of the stops. We did however, hike one of the short, easy trails. We both really enjoyed the experience and agreed we could see ourselves coming back to do some of the longer, more difficult trails on our next trip. She enjoyed Red Rock more than Valley of Fire because the trails are well marked and the dirt/gravel trails are easier to navigate compared to the very sandy terrain at valley of fire."
"I am by no means a serious hiker, but the trails in Red Rock were fun. They rate them into three categories and give you some details about elevation change, distance and terrain so you can make an educated decision. The landscape is beautiful and interesting. Some trails are better marked than others. Make sure you have water and good shoes if you decide to hike. Otherwise, there are some good vista points for pictures. Overall, this made for a very nice detour from other Vegas attractions. $15 per car or free with America the Beautiful Pass ($80 for annual pass)"
"None of the pictures does this place justice. I am so happy we left the strip and drove out to Red Rock Canyon! It was the highlight of our Las Vegas trio. Bring water, a snack and proper clothing."
We rented a car for the day and drove over to Red Rock. Took about 40 from Flamingo and was 15.00 per car to enter. It's a winding 13 mile drive around the Red Rocks with several trail heads to explore from. The entry rocks at Calico are stunning and awesome to explore. You can watch others climbing and repelling along the rocks. Just a nice day to spend away from the hustle and bustle of the strip.
I lived in the LAS Vegas are and I have to say that this is an amazing place to visit.  The views are absolutely stunning and the hiking is awesome!  It is just a short ride from the Vegas strip and well worth it!  Explore outside of the strip!
"My wife and I had a great day, walking through the different trails within the park. The information center and the parks introduction video, is a must see to set the foundation of what you will be visiting. Wear some comfortable shoes!"
We were pleasantly surprised with Red Rock Canyon. It was only about 40 minutes from Las Vegas! It was easy to find and well worth the effort. They provide you with a map that showed us  places we could drive and where we could get out and walk! It was so nice to see the rock formations up close and to walk on trails and see cactus. Bathrooms are plentiful throughout the route. There is a gift shop and park rangers were there to answer questions! Loved it!
"A definite must if in the Las Vegas area.  Scoot  City is a fun way to tour the park. Riding the three wheeled  scooters to see the park is a blast, and moving keeps you cooler even though it is hot outside."
We went in the end of July to see Red Rock Canyon. It was so beautiful. It is Hot in July. Bring lots of water. But highly recommend
"Visited here today with D-Tours. Lucky enough to just be me and the driver, Darren,.The trip was amazing and Darren was very informative and really helped me enjoy the scenery even more.Highly recommend. Definitely worth a visit and lovely to be out of the city for a while."
Went here for a 1/2 day visit.  Did a few nice hikes.  Really beautiful.  Please note that you can use your America the Beautiful National Park Pass here.  I didn't know that and it cost $15.  Oh well.
"Awe inspiring, raw beauty.  We took the Red Rock Scooter Tour (see review) and LOVED it!  Be aware distances in the desert are deceiving so plan hikes carefully or take a guide.  Several public restrooms along 13 mile loop."
This is the perfect places to take in the Nevada topography. You can escape the overstimulation of the strip and recuperate with some wonderful hikes or drive the 13 mile road  to take in the sights. Bring along a picnic lunch.
Went there to go hiking.  Very beautiful!  Large range of hiking trails from short to long and easy to difficult. Highly recommend.
"Visited here with an e-bike tour from Las Vegas (see my review), and loved it. The park covers 200,000 acres managed by BLM, and staffed largely by volunteers. Geologically significant, it’s very popular with rock climbers. The main road is one way and can be traveled by car, motorcycle, bike or other vehicles. It contains many hiking trails, springs, and high desert flora and fauna. Great 1/2 day excursion from Las Vegas."
"Red Rock Canyon is well worth visiting. Choose a cool and/or overcast day and you will enjoy yourself a lot more. The Pine Creek Loop trail is nice and quite interesting, and the Calico Hills are spectactular.We went back the next day. If you go twice, the price of admission equals the annual pass. Something to consider."
"Beautiful! Worth a 1/2 day or full day visit. Plenty of hikes for all levels of fitness. GET THERE EARLY!! The line of cars to enter the park was very long, unless you arrive by 9 am. You may even need to arrive earlier at other times of the year. (We visited on a Saturday in February.) The parking lots within the park fill up too, another reason to arrive early. Remember to dress in layers. The weather varies depending on where you are in the park. For example, Ice Box Canyon is cooler than other trails. Nice Visitor Center with vending machines and bathrooms. Several places within the park with picnic tables."
Definitely worth the trip to see this area. The colors are awesome. Have also toured several years ago by motorcycle. Took a tour this time which was good as weather was cold and windy.
There are a lot of different trails you can hike throughout red rock.  I wish I had more time I would have gone on more hikes in different areas.  Bring water and maybe even a lunch and hangout for a while.
"I came ‘this close’ to booking a tour here with one of the companies.  We had gone with Desert Tours to the Grand Canyon, and had a great time on that tour.  Looking at the descriptions of the Red Rock Canyon tours, though, I saw that they only allowed 30 minutes ‘on our own’.  So, I rented a car for $60 and took my family out to the park.It was a 40 minute drive from our hotel on the Strip, a very easy trip.  The fee for the day is $20 per car.  We packed a picnic lunch, and sat in splendor at a site at a midway point on the Scenic Drive.  We had lunch after going on the Calico Tank hike, which took about 2 hours, with my 7, 9, and 12-year-old boys.  This hike was a little strenuous for the younger boys, but they managed to just about keep up.After lunch we drove a little further along the Scenic Drive to another site where we went on two shorter, easier hikes.  The photos I took with just my iPhone are stunning.  They look worthy of National Geographic.  I can only imagine what an experienced photographer with serious equipment could produce.If we had taken the tour, it would have been about $480 for my family, depending on the tip to the guide.  Renting the car for the day, paying admission, and packing a picnic lunch cost a total of $100.  The best thing, though, is that we had hours and hours to hike and weren’t on anybody else’s schedule.  It was such a great day that we did the same thing two days later, but went on hikes that were adjacent to the Park.Our trip was in late February, when the daytime highs were in the upper 60’s, just perfect for hiking."
"wanted to get some fresh air on our junket to Vegas.   Looked up this place and off we went.  Frontal weather discouraged longer walks but we stopped at the calico hills and the petroglyph wall for a peek.  Definitely worth the 30 min drive from downtown and $15 vehicle charge, which allows you to drive the 13-mile loop at your leisure.  More than adequate facilities at multiple stops, picnic areas and well marked trails.  Will be back in better weather."
"Red Rock Canyon is a great escape for all, locals and tourists alike. It is a beautiful area where you can enjoy the surrounding mountains of Las Vegas. Lots of hiking trails are available. Things to consider. Go to the Visitors' Center first. It is worth stopping by. Once you come out from the park's scenic loop, you have to re-enter if you skipped it hoping to catch it later. There is the narmal national park fee that is charged. Bring water if you plan on spending time to walk some of the paths. Bring a jacket even if it is a warm day in the valley. The elevation and the shade will make it a bit chilly. Be considerate of the park and do not litter. Enjoy yourselves and the beautiful scenery."
