"Beautiful, historic, walkable, enchanting gardens on the squares. We came in February 2019, and everything was in bloom. Walked this over two two days with kids 9 and 13, moved the car a few times. We did an overview of highlights on day one, then day two I let the kids pick where to go. We learned a lot! We put on several miles walking. I recommend finding a place to pay to park (it‚Äôs only $1-2). Be careful where the cobblestone pops up from tree roots; my son managed to trip. I would like to come back with my husband for a long weekend."
It‚Äôs easy to walk all 22 squares in the Historic District and well worth doing so.  Simply stunning.  Hop off the Old Town Trolley tour and walk around if you are not staying here
"Savannah is beautiful, is easy to navigate, and just exudes history. A must see southern city! Don‚Äôt miss All the statues, the parks, and all the delicious food."
"Loved the beauty of Savannah, it's history and it's lovely squares.  Many people walking (with or without pets), all seem happy."
This town is beautiful in landscape and architecture. Had a lot of history. The hop on hop off was beneficial in seeing a lot of the town. Excellent restaurants.
"I love this city.  Walking around this area was wonderfu--the architecture, the climate, the moss on the trees. We were there on a day when not all businesses were open (New Year's).  I would've liked to see some of the antique shops and restaurants.  I love every square foot of it."
"Fascinating place. I could live here. The Squares were charming and beautiful. Took several tours, including the Hop On, Hop Off which was a good introduction to much the city had to offer. The Shrimp and Grits at the Public House were inspirational."
"So many beautiful outdoor spaces.  Each square has its own story and piece of history.  All are beautiful and well maintained.  Stroll through, stop for a picnic or to people watch."
"Walking the streets of Savannah is a trip through history, so many amazing houses, churches and museums, so many delightful squares and parks. So much food and drink. Do the bus tour, then take a walk around. Pop into the small restaurants, the local businesses, take in the sights, sounds and smells of Svannah."
"The most beautiful and historic cities! This is a must visit while in Savannah... If you can get a hotel in the district, you'd be doing yourself a favor! Walking on the historic roads were very enchanting... My favorite place to visit..."
Great for walking. Interesting of all squares and what is around it. Lots of revolutionary history and civil war history. If you drive you will pay to park everywhere. Take the shuttle or park at a central location.
"Built around ""squares;"" beautiful parks, really, with ancient oaks and spectacular fountains/statues, Savannah is really a must-see.  By all means, take the trolley tour (we prefer the white one - Old Savannah Trolley Tours) and save steps and parking hassles.  The narrated tours are well worth the money, and you can hop on/hop off at any of 15+ stops.  The churches and historic homes are everywhere, and each has a story.  Stay in the historic district if you can afford a splurge, but you should visit Savannah.  The people are very friendly and polite, and Southern charm prevails.  Oh, and the FOOD!"
"Check it out!  Savannah‚Äôs Historic District is great for all kinds of travelers!....Business, Family, Friends....There is plenty to see and do!  Take a walk down Jones Street to see the stately homes.  Check out all the squares.  Stay in a B&B to enjoy some Southern hospitality!  Relax on a Hop-on-Hop Off tour to truly understand the rich history of the area.  Go for a meal at The Olde Pink House.  Tour the Telfair museums.  Shop, eat and sightsee or party with friends on River Street or City Market.  In my opinion, save your money and skip the ghost tours!Whatever your fancy, you‚Äôll find it in Savannah!  Kick back and enjoy!"
"Old Savannah is beautiful, charming, and rich with history. Walk from square to square and visit Forsyth Park. It's a magical place with the Spanish moss and gorgeous architecture."
"My husband and I were absolutely enchanted by Historic Savannah!  This place is amazing!  It is soooo beautiful, the locals are friendly, the food and drink is plentiful and it is very easy to get around.  There is a lot of information such as maps, transportation guides and local advise to make your stay overwhelmingly remarkable.  I would highly recommend Savannah for couples who are just looking to have a leisurely vacation.  Set your own pace.  Research the sites and head out for the experiences!!"
"Savannah has it going on. Terrific trip very historic city. The Historic District is very rich in lore, history and culture.  The houses are beautiful and what you would expect from Savannah.  Take the Ols Savannah tour and experience it for yourself."
Charming and fantastic walking city!  Loved strolling and exploring the many squares.  It is truly picturesque and enjoyable.  Food in general is great.  Be sure to buy a parking pass from the city or possibly hotel.  The hotels closest to River Street charge an excessive daily amount....$35-40/night.  I bought a 2 day metered parking pass for $24.
"The area is just gorgeous and lovely. So many little shops, great restaurants, activities, and amazing B&Bs and Hotels to stay in. Looking for the Old South? Here it is..."
"Great city and very walkable. A lot of great places to eat and drink. Took a river cruise, visited Tybee island and ate at several restaurants."
"Highly recommend a stroll thru the historic district. Feels safe, epic history lesson and near the river area for an afternoon beverage or meal!"
"A lovely experience, big thanks to John! Go Hawks! Also, √ç loved the massage and service and playfulness"
First time visitor...great and interesting history. Stayed at a Hampton Inn close to the river...very easy walking city. Beautiful homes and parks.
"Visiting Historic Savannah was reminiscent of a visit to New Orleans garden district.  Beautiful architecture, delectable food, delicious libations and outstanding hospitality!  A great place for couples and families alike. A definite must add to any bucket list.  I will be returning one day. 3 days was not enough to savor the southern spirit there. Relax and stroll the beautiful tree lined streets.  Take picnic in one of the lush green squares. Have a fabulous dinner and one of many outstanding restaurants.  There is something for everyone."
Stayed at the DeSoto in the middle of the Historic District. Great location could walk to many attractions. Beautiful homes and buildings in the area. Note there was a lot of renovations at this time of the year.
took land and sea tour through historic district.  architecture is stunning and stories very entertaining and educational
"Fabulous restaurants, unique shops and gorgeous historic buildings and gardens. Loved the park squares. Of course, the riverfront is the highlight with the factor's walk  being my favorite."
"seeing the historic side of savannah was beautiful. There is so much history and beauty here and so many amazing ways to tour. We did the Adventure tours in motion with Carolyn as our guide through the town. Riding the Segway made the tour fun, but allowed us to get around a lot faster than on foot so we could see as much as possible. Def recommend site seeing savannah!!"
"My husband and I absolutely love Savannah and the historic district is part of the reason why. With so many squares, unique homes, and local businesses, it's an awesome place to visit. We recommend that you take a map, but don't use it unless you have to. Half the fun is wandering around and seeing what you stumble upon. Enjoy!"
"The area is lovely. The architecture that has been preserved is amazing. The iron work, the balconies and the stone work that has survived and become more charming with age. Enjoy Savannah on foot, in a horse drawn carriage, on a ped-i-cycle or on one of the Old Savannah Tours. It is a trip worth taking."
Beautiful city. We took the hop on hop off tour with Old Savannah tours. Loved the characters that entertained us!
"Savannah is totally unique full of character and characters. They have a Halloween for dogs, would you believe? Called Waggaween and involves hundreds of dogs of all shapes and sizes dressed in fancy dress...I kid you not! üòÇ The streets are amongst the prettiest I‚Äôve ever seen anywhere in the world and Monterey Square is worth a visit just on its own. Great choice of eateries - our favourite being The Public"
Was everything I had hoped for and more! Hope to return sometime.  So much History and seems every house had a story. Our Trolley guide gave us so much information and then we returned to just walk around and take pictures.
Beautiful & charming city. Have a great time visiting the historic district and some of the trolley stops.
"Historic ain't a misnomer.  Architecture, history, parks, squares, statues, museums, film locations, Revolutionary and Civil War monuments and cemeteries. historical markers, well maintained and authentic famed residences and buildings.  More to see than you shake a stick at.  Clean, safe, many easy ways to get around, great food everywhere.  Truly a special place and not too touristy.  Spend a day or week or two. Well worth a visit."
This is where you want to stay when you come to town. Be downtown by the river walk... This is a beautiful place and many sites to see along the architecture of the city and the trees! OMG
