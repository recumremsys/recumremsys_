"Beautiful and peaceful place to visit and really happy for the visit!üòçüôè Dhyanalinga is a Yogic temple located 30 km (19 mi) from Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu. India. The temple was consecrated on June 24, 1999 by Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev, a yogi and mystic. The temple is consecrated using prana prathista and is dedicated for meditation. Silence is maintained inside the temple. Dhyana is a Sanskrit word which means meditation, and linga means form. Dhyanalinga is claimed by the owners of the temple to be a powerful and unique energy form created from the distilled essence of yogic sciences and the first of its kind to be completed in over 2,000 years. According to Sadhguru, the Dhyanalinga has all the seven chakras fully energized to the very peak. The Dhyanalinga Yogic Temple offers a meditative space that does not ascribe to any particular faith or belief system!üòçüôè"
"Visited the much talked about Aadhi Yogi statue of Shiva.  It was a beautiful drive from Coimbatore.  Passed by villages and there was a mild drizzle.  The parking is opposite the Dhyanalingam.  You can hire a cow cart to visit the main ashram from the Aadhi Yogi statue.  It is Rs. 10 per person.  The statue is humongous.  You can buy theertham for Rs. 10 and the purohit will pour it over the lingam for you which is right below the massive shiva statue.There are several shops inside the main ashram.  The sukku coffee was good.  You will need to submit your mobiles and footwear before entering the main ashram.  There is suryakund (for men) and chandrakund (for women) where you need to purchase a ticket to take a holy dip in it.  They are located separately and is massive in the waterfall.The entire ashram is spread over several acres and situated at the foothills of Vellingiri hills. There is good cultivation of coconut, grapes and turmeric all the way to the site.Please don't litter and keep my Coimbatore clean. Do visit Aadhi Yogi - he is just too good!"
Travelled in April . Very divine place which gives a total feeling  of solace . Feels nice to sit in the temple for hours .
"In my experience one of the major tourist attractions in Coimbatore, the best place and showcases calm and peace. Being in the foothills one can feel the vibrance. Check for the crowd information and during public holidays and weekends, its typically very crowded. If you are a visitor to Coimbatore and have a day left, you can visit and get home, many taxi and hotels offer packages to this place, so getting to this place will not be difficult for an outsider. It's safe all the way"
Isha Yoga center in coimbatore is a wonderful place to visit.. esp the Dhyanalinga temple. Helps you meditate in an extremely calm and peaceful atomsphere
"Must visit , would be going every month till the time in Coimbatore. Guided meditation  is a life time experience , you don't feel like coming back. What a place"
"Thank you Isha Foundation. This place is something which will make you understand the meaning of eternal bliss. Located about 35kms from Coimbatore city, you not only have the absolute Peace,but also you get to kno yourself. The mesmerizing and gigantic ADI yogi statue, and complete eternal peace inside the Dhyanlinga temple, and a pure bath in the chandrakunda sets your soul free.A must visit, infact one of the thousand thing you must see before you die.Thank you Sadhguru."
"One of the good place you must visit during your trip to coimbatore. Well maintained and well managed by dedicated volunteers that shows how well temple can be maintained.There are lot of yoga training classes available and you can get enrollee yourself and it is worth  trying. Spend some quality time inside  the temple .If you can visit during Mahasivarathiri time then whole atmosphere will be different and you can feel the difference. If someone wants to stay inside the campus, it will be possible by doing reservation through online."
"Visited here during a business trip to Coimbatore and was stunned by the peace and tranquility of the site.  Yes it is becoming commercialised but so are many visitor attractions around the world.The temple visit was, although not a particularly religious person, energising and relaxing! 15 minutes of contemplation where I thought of nothing but my mother who passed away 20 years ago.The Shiva sculpture is enormous and awe inspiring and although busy very well worth a visit if ever in the area.Made my trip to Coimbatore so much more enjoyable."
Visited the ashram for a couple of nights. Ashram is spacious and surrounded by hills that give it a cozy and energetic feel. A decent cafeteria for the non-meal hours food requirements. Huge ground with distinct activities through the day like games etc. What is most profound is feeling the consecrated places. Take a dip in the Suryakund/Chandrakund and sit in the presence of Dhyaanlinga. First day I did it without the dip and felt very silent. Second day I did it after the dip and in about 30-45 min after that I experienced immense vibration with awesome stillness. It is difficult to put it in words. But that effect lasted for a few days after it. Definitely a place for inner transformation if you seek an experience more than regular social life.
"The Dhyanalinga Temple is one of the most peaceful places at the Isha Center in Coimbatore. The absolute quiet inside the dome can make even the most distracted person meditate. A bell rings every 15 minutes, signaling people to enter or leave the temple without disturbing anybody. Make sure to bathe in the Kunds before entering the Dhyanalinga for an even more meditative experience"
"Charmed by the image it has, took a day oof in Coimbatore to visit the place. The large statue of Lord Shiva looked charming from a distance itself. The Velliangiri Hills give agreat background for the statue. Once we reached the approach road, e realised that it was a Singur with religion to back it. Blatant misuse of good agri land. Beyoud the 38 m high statue of Lord Shiva, we are supposed to walk or hire a bullock cart to reach the main sanctum. The pond on the way, Nagaraj, Linga Bhairavi and Shiva linga are well placed. But no spiritual or religious feel is there. We took the bullock cart back. We realised it was a sort of bonded labour for both the bullock and the cartoperator who hardly get a break during day time. Altogether a disappointing experience wasting half a day and a few litres of petrol."
Walking in barefoot after meditating was so special. And on the new year! loved all the sights sounds and people.
this is in isha yoga centre... u can go there for a day. very peaceful. avoid taking children as it require no noise.
"Located in the foothills of veliangiri hills , an hour drive from coimbatore is a place not to miss. Isha foundation manages this temple and peace and serenity are at its peak. If you are a meditator ,this is the place for you. You come out of this temple as a different and new personality."
Very serene and spewing positivity. Rejuvenating experience and makes you meditate and find inner self.
"A wonderful experience. The complex is 1500 acres . A huge Shivlinga established inside a tomb, a place for meditation and peace. A holy and satisfying visit. A must visit. Keep 3 to 4 hrs minimum whilst visiting from Coimbatore. No camera mobile etc allowed."
was there for a yoga course of 7 days so got good chance to visit the place. Nice to be there for good time.
A place for all spiritual. seekers. The total. environment and ambience takes you to different plane.Meditationbecomesso easy that. youfirget the entire globefor a whilem Dhyanalinga and bhairavi are a must.
"Isha Yoga centre is a very healthy & spiritual Place. Built for spiritual awakening. It has meditation halls, separate spiritual bath pools for men & women & a huge Adiyogi Pratima nearby. So peaceful & divine..."
"Very peaceful, it attracts you like a magnet. Puja done twice a day is simply awesome. No elaboration here but touches you to the insides. Grace is there, but are we ready to receive it , is a question . Felt the magic for sure üôè"
"I visited this place long ago & had different memories of it.Now new temples added and everywhere priority access for people with money. the more you spend better the priority will be.Most part of the temple is silent.  full credit for maintaining it.  the place is architectural wonder.  should visit once when ever anyone is visiting Coimbatore.  it is bit far from city and we have to travel thru many villages.  lot of greenery around the place.We loved canteen.  tried cookies, plum cake, bajji and coffee.  all were very good."
"It's inside the Adiyogi campus. It's amazing place. Do visit it, it's a walk to.the main Campus. So pls be aware  "
Wonderful place and spiritually positive . Do visit to relax yourself in spiritual way . They also have a stay available where you change yourself completely .
Amazing !!!. Very quite and serene ambience with an INSIDE CAVE  concept. The series of oil lit lamps placed surrounding the LINGAM creates a divine illusion. Keep sufficient time in hand for this place.
The energy and calm in this place is something else. Attending Nada Aradhana in the space is another level of experience. An experience that must be had.
"Was lucky to have 6days at the Isha Ahsram hence visited the Dhyanalinga many a time. It is a must visit if you are a Shiv devotee or looking for a spiritual journey. Words cannot do justice to the experience so it is best to keep an open mind visit the venue and take in the vibrations and blessings.On the other side there are few things like when u enter the dhyanalinga do try and take a dip before, in the Suryakund or Chandrakund for ladies it is supposed to enhance your experience and it def did mine so thats the 1st step.Secondly the devotess can give offerings like Dhoop (some thing like incese) or a lotus flower or a plate of oil diya( lamp) and flowers. All of these are priced very reasonably so thats ok too.Once you enter the gates on the left is the Patanjali statue which is BEAUTIFUL, opp to him are many carvings of tales and their explanations in English and Tamil.Visitors are congregated here and once the bell rings you can enter the Dhyanalinga (dome) inside is a Shivling on top of a snake. From here each soul will have a different experience of and from it so do visit and experience it for yourself.Remember it is has not much to do with Religion you will be able to feel the vibes irrespective of whatever religion or caste etc you may belong too. May your spiritual journey begin in grace peace and harmony.Om Namah Shivay."
"Amazing place. Must visit. The place is different to any place you may have seen in terms of architecture and what it has to offer in terms of stay, food, even drinking water somehow tastes better and of course the temple. I totally recommend it. Do meditation in the Dhyanalinga without fail. I highly recommend you visit this place - whether you are spiritually inclined or not."
"The Dhyanalinga Temple is part of the Is a Yoga center located at the foot of the Velliangiri Hills on the outskirts of Coimbatore (approx. 30 kms from Coimbatore Junction and 35 kms from airport). It is a beautiful space to meditate with a large cavernous chamber housing a commensurately large Linga in the center. Private meditation spaces are stopped out from the wall of the chamber in which one can get seated in siddhasana or ardha-siddhasana and meditate to one's content. Owing to the acoustics of the chamber, even the slightest sound gets amplified."
"Loved every bit of the visit. Spend couple of hours to get the real experience. The chandrakund, Mercury lingam, meditating inside the main temple are the key features here"
Lovely visit to this place. It is very calm and peaceful. Beware of bees though. We narrowly escaped a bee attack.
"Visited in July, and the first stop was the 112 ft Adi Yogi statue of Lord Shiva. One word to describe it, Majestic!The drumming was a bit off but, that is what the Lord likes! The next stop was the temple. I had my 80 year old mother and I found it a bit difficult but we made it to the sanctum. The arti and the pooja style was different and the atmosphere was divine. I bought a locket made in combination with mercury and wearing it felt good. Then I went to the Lingam, and the atmosphere was divine and I will visit again, hopefully. The place is well organised, a lot of believers and it is nice to see them walk purposefully in their attire and observe their methods. Overall, a very good experience and a must see when in Coimbatore."
No words can describe the grace of this place. With the blessings of Sadhguru visited this place in May during inner engineering retreat. Haven't had any such experience in the past.  Must visit place for spiritual seekers
Recently visited a good spiritual calm place. Has improved a lot from the initial days after the gigantic statue of Lord Shiva being there.  There is a positive vibe in the environment.  A peaceful place to visit and stay.
Although Coimbatore  is a little difficult to reach from Chennai or Trichy I decided it's on my do list.The center is on immense property  and the Dyanalingam very accessible once you follow entry procedures.Freedom to visit or to meditate is a plus as with all the different areas of the center.However to see for myself the vast areas of beautiful forests of the Vellagiri hills. cleared and devastation to its plant and wildlife to make way for concrete buildings for fun and fare in the name of godly bliss was unpalatable for me and my Two cents worth.
