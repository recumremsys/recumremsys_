"In Noida if you talk about premium & best shopping destination.....then it has to be DLF Mall Of India. It has a wide variety of brands which stands ideal for all the sections and class of people.... Starting from H&M to Gant, Superdry to Bigbazar, Miniso to Max, and has an incredible food court with ample food outlets along with PVR multiplex.... Now, if you wanna have a day out with your kid then the fun city has the widest collection of games and your kid will have a blast....Smaash is a must go place where you along with your family and friends can have a great time and it's loaded with lots of arcade games and in house food zone and believe me it's awesome.... For vegetarians Shree Rakhna restaurant is a good choice... All together a big thumbs up for DLF Mall Of India.... Cheers"
"It is the place to be. Happening, exciting, international shopping experience!!! haven for foodies too. Both the eating options in food court as well as other fine dining areas have multiple options though the food court is a bit crowded at times."
DLF mall of india has totally changed the mall experience in Noida! You name it and you get the brands you want in terms of apparels or dining! This mall attracts crowd from all over Noida and delhi and the place is well maintained in sector 18 Noida! Speaks quality time with your family or friends here!
"This mall has nice adventure sports including zipline, skiing,sledging. Is India largest snow adventure park in the mall. I am always stoked to go in a snowing amusement park with a ticket of only Rs1150 per head."
"Huge mall. I went for ski india.It was an ok sort of experience. Mall is good a shopper's paradise. Wide variety of brands .Many activities, smaash ,funcity, snowworld, pvr all available.Food court is good and huge . Only card payments at food court or u take a swipe card and load cash in it. It can be avoided i mean cash should also be allowed. Parking management needs improvement especially on weekends."
"Thank a lot! Its the biggest and very famous mall in Noida, secto 18. I got everything which I wanted to buy that day. I like KAMA Ayurveda shop there!"
Good and great place for dine and shopping. Avoid Made in Punjab for third class buffet dinner and service.
"Excellent place with lot of shopping and entertainment options. Be it funcity for younger kids or smaash for older ones. Lot of multi-cuisine eating joints. A day well spent, just avoid Sundays when it is extremely crowded."
"This place attracts people not only from Noida but from Delhi also . Beats select city , saket .  A place for the families and bachelors both ."
"A big competition to GIP mall and a lovely place to hang out, you have several options to spend time here, ski INDIA, smash! And many others. Top brands. Take out 5 to 6 hours and enjoy the day here. Food court here have several options to dig in. You will not feel Bored."
"This mall compares to the malls in south Delhi. Shining show rooms , big brands, too many good places to eat, lot of fun things for kids to enjoy specially skeeing . Also parking is also quite huge so u never follow issues like in gip"
Visited two times and realized that most of the shops belongs to foreign brands. Mall is really very big and spacious. Number of co-curricular activities can be found here. Overall a must visit place
Great mall. Has a lot of international brands and can be visited for buying toys to furniture. Very huge. Should visit with family and friends onlyðŸ˜Š
"We went to DLF Mall of India as had heard a great deal about it. The experience before entering the Mall was not that pleasant as we wasted around 45 minutes on the turn for the Mall as the vehicles ahead of us were crawling. Well, we entered the Mall and I must admit that the decision of going there during a weekend was not at all unwise. The stores of almost all the regular and premium brands are present at the Mall. It looks so huge and impressive that I cannot explain in mere sentences. We kept on walking and entered one store after another. Be it Lifestyle or Zara, the collection is latest and truly amazing. The people were moving from one store to another like a swarm of bees. We entered Lifestyle store and there was a long queue outside the trial room for which you require a great amount of patience. One floor after another had different stores for apparels, watches,artificial jewellery and others. The food outlets were not less in number and again had a long waiting list. We finally settled for Shree Rathnam and devoured our meal.We had entered the Mall at 16:30 p.m. and it was 22:30 p.m.when we decided to head back home. It was an experience enthralling and somewhat tiring as you have to walk and walk and walk more..."
Best thing is that every time you enter you feel something new in the entire mall. Starting from dress es to restaraunts. Everything I find a new cafe here.
LWonderful mall. Most relaxing. Gives u wide variety of Merchandise to choose from. I love being theRe even for cup of coffee
A great place for Noida crowd to hang over. Taken over from GIP. During weekend remain over crowded. Parking during weekends is an issue.
"has a great exterior , looks stunning from the outside. The place has various options for brands for shapping and stuff. The place is neat and hygenic. The place has a gaming area for kids. Had a nice time with my family. The place is vice and is a must visit."
Undoubted best mall in noida.. But parking is a major issue here.. If u planning to go there using your own vehicle... Yes it's very crowded all the time i visit this place.. It has got evrything u need.. Party plaaces.. Eathing places.. Food court.. Movie theatre. Gaming zone... Branded strores.. Multi brand retail stores.. Ski Noida.. So all in all its a best place to hang out and shop..
"It is the best mall across Delhi NCR. You can call it shoppers paradise, food island, gaming zone, cafeteria hub, shoe bazaar, dessert station, dating arcade to name a few. It is the largest mall in India in terms of retail space with over 450 retail outlets.  Has one of the best theatre with 7 screen PVR that includes 4dx, playhouse, PVR XL etc. With capacity of around 2000 car parks and facilities like free shuttle, security arrangements like International malls, washrooms on every floor, concierge services etc there is no doubt it is truly MALL OF INDIA."
"Visited the Mall once again on 04 Oct 2019. Its as good or better than I visited earlier. Quality of shops and brands is very attractive. Its a huge mall and it is difficult to find/ locate the desired shop without any help. I had visited Reebok, Adidas, Nike, Decathalon, etc. Ultimately found what we were looking for.The food at Vango on 03 floor was excellent."
DLF Mall has now become the weekend destination for serious shoppers of Delhi NCR. The place if you want to watch a movie or eat out with your friends and family. Or maybe just a window shoppers who want an escape from summer heat and pollution. The place has top brands but sure it is for moneyed who want to shop in the comfort of Air conditioned environment. The Mall is quite large and it will take you a while to figure out where is what. Do not forget to note down your parking slot in the basement parking and floor otherwise you may end up spending an hour in searching for your vehicle. A great place if you are a lazy bone and want everything under one roof.
Malls are good place to hang out esp when itâ€™s too hot outside. Buying big brands at mall is not a wise move. Why India has to charge so much higher? Stay with local brands to make smart decision. It took us 2-3 visit to understand what this mall had to offer. Itâ€™s always a challenge to buy on need vs buy on deal. Retail Therapy needs an escape too.
"Went there to shop to take advantage of the seasons sale. Well organised and the mall maintained its quality which was missing in Noida. One had to visit Select in Saket, glad DLF did a good job"
Biggest mall in Noida. Located near to Atta Market. Huge Mall with lots of shop. A gaming center is there at the top floor. Food court is also present at the top floor. Huge shopping market Big Bazaar located in the basement. Cinema at the first floor. Lots of shops on each floor where you can do shopping. Also electric auto  drop and pick-up to metro station
"DLF mall : A general and standard I can be seen in this and every DLF mall. Shops , appearance , location is good however being huge in size parking is mess . Crowed everytime .. however all leading brand's shop are available here . Eteary is bit costly in food court.. than nearby malls like GIP etc ."
"Visited this Italian outlet located on the 3rd floor at DLF Mall of India, Noida for lunch. We were lucky to find our table soon for the five of us. Since this was a meeting of two friends and families after a long gap, there was much conversation on the line. However we found ourselves drowned out in the noise of guests at the eatery hitting high decibel levels.The service was good and food was average. We ordered two varieties of pizza and baked pasta with bread. The desserts were delightful as you'd expect from a place specialising in bakery items. We enjoyed our cheesecake and mango tiramisu thoroughly.I was delighted to see that they had not levied a service charge in the bill and I was at liberty to tip my attendant at will which I gratefully obliged with."
"It has everything for kids - a play area, hamleys, smash and a mini snow park When it comes to shopping it has the maximum number of stores in Delhi ncr. Go there for a huge variety of restaurants as well Mexican, Italian and Indian, they have it all!!"
"Itâ€™s easily the best mall as of now in NCR. Do well to keep your standards high. Great brands, good ambience, ample parking etc"
It was a business trip and we thoroughly enjoyed. Think of a brand and it's there. Very huge space and is a great tourist attraction.Food lovers will just hit the spot as all lucrative foodie restaurants all around. This place is a must visit if you are in NCR.
Placed far better than competing malls and overall it is a good hangout zone. Security is unnecessary hassle. I think they should avoid too much frisking...
With so many malls in the same area one needs to be careful with directions to reach..... Complicated to reach.Has a nice place to keep kids occupied in the top floor. All paid rides.Nice food court.Easy to be enjoy.Needs to be careful about rush time as it gets pretty full and then exit is time taking
"Went to Dlf with bunch of my friends. First of all, I was impressed by how they have managed parking for cars. This mall has most elites brands from all over the world.  You can also find some mid range brands like big bazar and pantaloons as well. Top floor is occupied by food court area and kids areas for vr games and rides. One of the main attraction points in this mal is ski india which is artificial snow area where you can ski and play with artificial snow"
This Mall is one of the biggest and best Mall in Noida. It is well maintained and we get almost every brand available in the market. The crowd is also very good and there is always something interesting happening in and around the Mall. Keep it up. Thank you.
