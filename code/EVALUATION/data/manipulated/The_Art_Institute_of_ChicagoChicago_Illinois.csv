"Loved this museum. We were lucky that the Andy Warhol’s exhibit was there and we were able to see it. I believe it’s like $7 extra. It was amazing well worth it. Do get there early there was a 60 min. Wait when we where leaving! What a delightful place. A big collection of Monet, Van Gogh and even works by Picasso! There was so much to see that I will be back."
"A friend and I wanted to see the Warhol exhibit before it left, but were worried about the lines and the standing because I have bad knees. So I bought a membership, which got both of us in for ""free"" with no extra exhibit fee, and no fee for hanging up our coats, which is a great plus in Chicago. I entered through the Modern Wing, since I couldn't do the old entrance stairs, since there are Soooo many. Then I got to relax in the members lounge, and was delighted by the attitude of the staff there... Very friendly and welcoming. We ate at Terzo Piano, which was also charming with off-beat dishes to please the jaded palate, before heading to see Warhol. Should probably have gone to the exhibit first, as it was pretty full when we got there, but by hunt and peck I was able to see everything I wanted to see without having to follow the crowd. Lots of great items, and a wonderful overview of his long and varied career. Wish the gift shop had had more items... like a copy of the Marilyn they were actually exhibiting. Ah well. However, my phone was unable to produce a narrative as we went along, even though the app did load well. Just couldn't hear it. Would have loved a little brochure to walk around with... but I'm old and old school, so that's just me. Haven't been to the museum in decades, but will be back to see the Thorne rooms and the Armor exhibit when my knees are better. I would recommend not trying to see everything, but just cherry-pick and enjoy yourself. New feature of valet parking... which I like, but didn't open until 10:30, and by then, I had already parked."
We went to the Art Institute specifically to see the Special Warhol Exhibit which was quite large and interesting.  Loaded with political commentary and famous Warhol images.We also took in The Impressionist Wing which is extensive and a highlight of the trip to Chicago.
"We loved the current Warhol exhibit!  Seeing it was a great way of getting out of the weather and seeing wonderful classic Warhol paintings. After our early tour of the Warhol special exhibit, we toured the remainder of the museum for a great comparison of art through the ages."
"The membership was definitely worth the money.  It was great to ""fast pass"" the lines for the special exhibit. Be sure to go down stairs for the model house, paper weight and photography exhibits.  Unfortunately -- the coat check lines were super long at both entrances."
Loved our visit to this museum. We got a family pass so we can come back. Too much to see in one visit!
Please allow sufficient time to see everything. We were there for just an afternoon and had to select the displays and exhibits to see. 3 floors.  Several cafes through out for food and relaxing. Probably should watch what time of day you arrive. Look at their guide for peak times. Open late on Thursday.
Saw the Warhol exhibit with family from Belgium. It was AMAZING. I forgot how much I enjoy gooing to the AI. Also had a coffee and snack at the little cafe. Prices reasonable and snack was delish. I will be back to see other exhibits. Such a great place to visit in Chicago!!
What a fabulous place to visit. We were fortunate to see the Andy Warhol exhibit. Learned so much   Developed more respect for his numerous talents
"We visited The Art Institute toward the end of the Andy Warhol exhibit, so the crowds were insane.  Personally, we were not interested in that particular exhibit, so we did Skip the Line tickets to get in quickly and then meandered around at our own pace.  Was neat to see the few well-known pieces, as well as other lesser-known but equally beautiful pieces.I enjoyed it, except for two major disappointments:  1) the Prints and Drawings section was completely closed.  I assume this is where I could have seen some work by Old Masters; and 2) we felt lost most of the time, and we are typically good at reading maps.  Just found this museum to be very difficult to navigate, and brochure didn’t help much!  We ate lunch down in the basement cafe.  Food selection was good and we sat at the coffee bar and I had a latte with my lunch.  I recommend going just a little before the lunch rush to avoid the long line just to get into the cafeteria.  We got right in, but when we left, the line was all the way down the hallway.  Would certainly go back, especially if the Special Exhibit was of interest to me."
"Great collection of Warhol art. Besides viewing popular Warhol pieces we saw some rarely seen videos, home movies, written correspondence, sketches & more. He was talented & conflicted. Shout out to all the employees & volunteers that helped us to locate different exhibits within the museum such as the  Neapolitan Crèche.  It’s a large building—wear comfortable shoes."
"We went on a Saturday when we arrived and despite being packed we still enjoyed the Impressionist and Medieval collections greatly. The City Pass was a necessity to skip the very long line for tickets.I stayed in Chicago the entire week for week and planned another visit Wednesday night because there was still so much I wanted to see. Paying the additional admission was worth it. Got there just before 5pm and when I left at 7pm the line was out the door. Tips: The modern wing entrance seemed less busy. Plan your route, it is a huge place and hard to get to some areas so take a moment to have a plan. Coat check is nice but requires more waiting in line. So if possible try and travel light for your museum visit."
"For the size of the museum and the quality of the art pieces that they have, the admission price is definitely worth it.  Had a great time.  Was surprised (and pleased) that the museum allows non-flash photography of all their artwork.. even the highly famous pieces.  Very much liked that."
"The Art Institute of Chicago is fantastic. There is something for everyone. Also it is part of the City Pass which adds to its value. Of course, the iconic Impressionism exhibit is amazing! The modern art section is equally expansive. There are helpful docents positioned through the institute. They are knowledgeable and very pleasant; yet they do not hover or act condescending. We were only able to spend a couple hours viewing the great art. Beware if you are not an Illinois resident the ""Free Admission Day"" does not apply to you. This is a lovely amenity for residents. As an out of state visitor, you will need to pay admission. The good thing about the City Pass is that you go to the front of the line and receive the audio component."
Great adaptation to new normal.  The museum kept visitors distant but also let us see the incredible works.  Making reservations online was ok.
Visited the art institute again but this time I went with the tour guide.Awesome experience with the help of the guide... I never knew the details of the paintings without the guide.I would strongly recommend to have the guide with you if you want to understand more about the paintings and artists!
"Went for the Warhol Exhibit, which was exceptional.  I’ve been here a couple of times because their collection is extensive.No matter how your taste runs you should be able to find something that interests you and some things that may make you scratch your head ( I’m looking at you cubism)."
"We went to see Edward Hoppers works, but there is so much more. You need a day. At least. And now the Warhol exhibition is on! Go now!"
"The museum is a must. Don’t miss the miniatures downstairs. The “skip the line” cost, to me, is worth it because it eliminates any possible delay."
One of the best museums ive been too. Lucky alao that their was a special exhibition of Andy Warhols works. Had a great time enjoying the magnificent masterpieces especially George Deurat painying.
"Went to the El Greco show.  It belongs in the “must see” category.  Beautifully presented.  Enough verbiage to provide good context, but the show was the art not the text.  Main focus was religious art - as it should be, but a smattering of other works also presented.  Color!  Emotion!  What a master!"
"I grew up in Chicago and studies art history so the Art Institute was my playground. The museum offers many art forms: paintings, statues, sculptures, photographs, and other media. Having seen a special Monet exhibit in Denver, Colorado made me want to revisit the Impressionism gallery in Chicago. Surprisingly, there is a limited Andy Warhol exhibition show there. Such a great opportunity to visit a world class museum, and the Art Institute is a gem!"
"Great, great Impressionistic paintings.  Museum was started when they were inexpensive.  Modern art is just as good.  I’m not a fan of the Old Masters, but they are well represented.  Do not miss the Chagall wall.You cannot do the Museum in one day, so be selective.Best time to visit, Sunday afternoon - when the tourists fly home."
"A must see in Chicago.  Take the time to wander through all the exhibitions to be enchanted and inspired, and then pass by the gift shop for a delightful souvenir of your visit and/or the city.(Lunch at the top also excellent. . )"
"A top tip is to go to the Willis Tower first thing before the crowds. You then benefit from getting the savings from a combination ticket with the museum (USD 49). After giving yourself the vertigo-induced willies from jumping around on a piece of glass 1000 feet up, you can then mosey over to the museum for its opening around 10.30 am. Voted the best museum worldwide for just about the last half decade. It really does have an outstanding, extraordinary permanent collection. It has the full set of iconic paintings made familiar from numerous reproductions. Endowed with the best collection of impressionist art outside France, we spent two hours here before de-sensefication set-in. We hardly scratched the surface of this amazing place."
"The Andy Warhol exhibit ""From A to B and Back Again"" is one of the best special exhibitions I've seen in some time at the Art Institute. It is large enough to feel important, but not so large as to take up an entire visit. The exhibit costs an additional $7 over the price of admission. Go before lunch during the week to enjoy the lightest crowdsThe audio guide is also highly recommended. You can rent a device onsite or download the latest (turquoise) app and listen on your phone with earbuds for free. The descriptions by curators and fellows provide helpful and fascinating context. Even if you think you know Andy Warhol and his iconic works, I think you will come away with new insights and a deeper understanding. The phone app also works for some artwork outside of the exhibit. There is a fine dining restaurant in the Modern Wing with views of Millennium Park, but I prefer the multi-station cafe in the basement where there is something for everyone in a pleasant well-designed space overlooking the courtyard. The AIC has two gift shops that are different enough to warrant spending a few minutes in each."
"Take your time to enjoy and don’t miss this treasure! The current Warhol exhibit had just opened and it is an extensive collection of the artist’s work and career including videos and some of the advertisements he created. The museum treasures range from “American Gothic” and a collection of Georgia O’Keefe paintings to the Impressionists with several outstanding Monet’s. Don’t miss the breathtaking Chagal stained glass windows, created as a gift to the United State!"
The regular and special exhibits are amazing. The gift shop has great gifts for friends and family. Have not been since Covid
"If you only have time to visit one attraction in Chicago then head on over to Michigan Ave and visit the Art Institute of Chicago. With such a large and well-rounded collection of masterpieces from ancient to contemporary time there is plenty for everyone to enjoy. On top of that, the “El Greco: Ambition and Defiance,” and “Monet and Chicago” exhibitions were stunning, well curated, and representative of each master’s portfolio. Bravo!! Getting tickets on-line in advance is a must, especially for the Monet exhibit. I realized I would need plenty of time to thoroughly enjoy everything on display and so I scheduled two afternoons to allow sufficient time to see it all. I only wish I could share more photos with you of this excellent collection. Truly one of the US’s greatest art museums and Chicago’s greatest asset."
This was a great visit and even our teenagers enjoyed it. Walking distance to so many other things. What a great resource to have in the Midwest
"It was an impromptu visit so we had to line up to get tickets. Thankfully, the line wasn't long at all.First, I want to point out that the building itself is quite beautiful and it is located near the Millennium Park, which is convenient for those who want to visit that as part of their Chicago travel list.The place is quite huge though and it will be difficult to see everything in 1 day (without rushing). So best to get a map and choose which collection you want to see and plan accordingly.What I love about this place is that it has a diverse collection. Yes, there are the Monet, Van Gogh, and other well known paintings by these artists but there are also other types of collections displayed. I was able to visit the floor where they had these Byzantine artefacts, another dedicated to medieval armour, and a photography exhibit. Be prepared to walk a lot. Also, there are eating places inside but they are quite small and don't serve a lot of variety in terms of food. For lunch, I ended up having the last can of rose and a muffin since that's all they had.Overall though, if you like art and history, The Art Institute is worth visiting."
Best art museum in the world.  Go see it.  Really good modern art section as well as a good section of impressionist paintings.  Entry through the modern side usually has less lines for entry.  GO.
"The Best museum of Chicago, with great exhibits, even if you aren't fan of the art, you're gone love it. Came whith time because the lines are big. General admission $25 usd"
Entering this place it’s like you are accessing history and art. I’m a lover of art and this place was huge. There is so many things to see. I am a little sad because I had to run to the airport so I couldn’t see 100% of it. If you are going make sure you spend at least 2/2.5h inside! It is worth to go!
This is an exceptional museum on every level (although it is not that easy to navigate!).  We were particularly impressed by the American Art Collection.  The Chagall windows are not to be missed.  And the miniatures collection was quite fun.  We did NOT leave ourselves enough time – I would suggest 4 hours minimum – and did not attempt to do the Warhol exhibit (having seen plenty of Warhol in other museums).  Parking tip:  Downtown Chicago is incredibly pricey but we purchased an advance reservation through Best Parking at the Grant Parking Garage that was quite reasonable.
