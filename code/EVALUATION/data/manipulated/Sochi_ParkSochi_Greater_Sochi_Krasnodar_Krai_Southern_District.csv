"Busy, colourful, noisy, fun and most differently Russia’s version of a theme park. They do it well. Try it with an open mind and I’m sure you will enjoy. P"
"Loved it, a lot of fun. Innovative rides, good stalls to buy from an amazing atmosphere. Stroll for hours soaking up the atmosphere, worth a visit. The staff are ultra friendly, I loved it."
"The park is a good attraction for kids and teenagers in the region of Sochi. The moderate price for the entrance includes all main attractions. They are not exceptional but good and the fun factor is high. Depending on the numbers of visitors and waiting time, a family can spend one day in the park. The restaurants provide the expected quality level, however, the waiting time was quite long (even there were few customers) and the personal was not quick or very attentive. This leads to our lower rating for the overall impression."
"Visited the park in the long weekend to go on the roller coasters. Wasn’t disappointed, it was a fantastic day. Not very long queues in the morning. Afternoon was a short wait. Purchased an all day pass including the ferries wheel. Most things are in English and staff very accommodating and helpful.  Ate lunch at the roller coaster restaurant."
"It is a must while in Sochi. Shows are good. Dolphins - unforgettable to swim with (and not super expensive), kids loved it.!"
"I wasnt expecting a Disney-ish themed park at all, but I had so much fun regardless. The place is very affordable, the decor is very dramatic but not tacky at all. Try it, you will love it."
"We visited the park with kids at the range of 3 to 16 and all enjoyed it so much! Every age has attractions to do and  you just cant get enough! So fun! it is very new, so many fun rides and even a small petting zoo. You do need to take into consideration that many of the instructions are in Russian and only few staff members know English. Be prepared to use google translate and hand gestures :) or take a Russian speaking family member with you"
"We walked around and just enjoyed watching people scrimming getting up and down and upside-down! I guess they were happy and had a lot of fun. Seems that this park is not very large but it is only such park in Adler city area. So, have fun!"
It was a great time but with only two roller coasters and a disappointing elevator I expected more from the park. Felt so sorry for the Dolphins and seal at the show. Good park for toddlers but not adults.
"Yesterday we went to Sochi park. It's a little bit difficult to find the parking area by car. We parked (free) at another spot next to the Sochi museum (metallic cubes) and went to the park by feet. We payed 3000 ruble -15% discount from aquarium. 2 adults and one child under 5 years. We were allowed to take photos and videos everywhere in the park.  At the entrance we were informed which attractions didn't work. Don't expect to visit Sochi park and everything will work... We never had to wait long to take a ride or get something to eat. The entertainment for small children was really good. The rides were safe and cool. I really liked the ""science house"". My daughter liked, dancing and singing with the entertainers. Sochi park is ""expensive"" for Russian standard. But it's a nice trip."
