"This temple with its ancient scriptures and sculptures is a must when in Abu. However, the entrance to this temple leaves much to be desired. Shoes and cameras not allowed. Has to be left outside which is not in proper safe keeping. You just have to trust."
"Do visit these temples, the work inside is beautiful. There are 5 temples inside, but its more of an architectural property than temples."
Had visited this Jain temple in Mount Abu a long back ago. This temple is a popular tourist attraction and is sacred to the Jains.  This temple was built by Jain ministers during the 11th & 13th centuries AD. It is know for it's extraordinary architecture and marvellous marble…
"Dilwara TempleIt is Pilgrimage Place of Jain's and popular tourist center of Mount Abu. The beautiful Dilwara temples are carved between the 11th and 16th centuries in white marble and intricate marble carvings reminds you the carvings of Orcha and Khajurao. The temples are dedicated to the Jain Tirthankara’. Brief of about TirthankaraIn Jainism, a Tirthankara is a saviour and spiritual teacher of the dharma. The word Tirthankara signifies the founder of a tirtha, which is a fordable passage across the sea of interminable births and deaths, the samsara. According to Jains, a Tirthankara is an individual who has conquered the samsara, the cycle of death and rebirth, on their own, and made a path for others to follow.  Digambara sect believes all 24 Tirthankara to be men including Mallinatha. Our Visit, We visited the temple around 12.00 noon.  Since it was February, the weather was pleasant at Mount Abu. The temple was more chilled than the outside temperature. The ambiance was peaceful and serene and gave lots of peace to mind. We spend almost an hour because every pillar and ceiling was full of carvings with so much of perfection. I lossed in thoughts of these divine artist who have crafted these beautiful carvings long back when there was no advance engineering and amenities. How must be the pure soul of such amazing artist? A Big Salute to those beautiful souls.Temple Name 	Dedicated to 	Tirthankar	Built in 	           Built  by Vimal Vasahi	Shri Adinatha	1st	                1031 AD	          Vimal Shah , Minister of                                                                                                                   Bhima I, the Chalukya King                                                                                                                   of Gujarat Luna Vasahi	Shri Neminatha	22nd	1230	                    (Vastupal and Tejpal )Porwad Brothers, Ministers of Virdhaval, the Vaghela ruler of GujaratPittalhar	Shri Rishabhadev (Shri Adinath) 	1st		Bhima Shah, a minister of Sultan Begada of AhmedabadParshvanath,	Shri Parshvanatha	23rd	1458	Mandlik and his family Mahavir Swami,	Shri Mahaviraswami	24th (Last Tirthnkar)	1582	Painted by Sirohi in 1764Amenities Facilities are available for bathing, which is mandatory before puja is performed for the idols.

"Visited last year, this world heritage site. There was very huge crowd, well managed by temple trust. There are self appointed Guides who don't charge anything (though everyone gave in the end)...They explain everything quite properly and in an interesting way. Photography is…"
"Located 2-3 km from city. Camera & mobiles, bags are not allowed in the temple premise.  Temple is open only in the afternoon for visitors. It is jain temple has beautiful statues of Budha. The ceilings, doorways, pillars and panels has minutely carved ornamental designs on…"
Good carving worth visiting it. Having a great history and manamgement and admin of the temple is taking a good care of it.
"The Dilwara temples are an architectural wonder. I tell all my friends to visit this place first, even before the Taj Mahal if they are touring India. These are very old Jain temples in Mount Abu. Don't be fooled by the exterior. It was meant to dissuade marauders from attacking and destroying the temples. Once you enter the rooms you will be blown away by the hundreds of thousands of marble sculptures that adorn the walls and pillars of each room. In fact, as you walk from room to room, you will find that each room is more spectacular than the last. The details in these marble figurines are mind boggling. You can actually see the fingernails on each tiny figurine. If you have time for one spectacular attraction when you visit India, make sure this is it."
Dilwara Jain temple is a must see visit in Mount Abu. Built more than 1000s of years ago the architecture of this temple is a marvel sight to see. The entire compound comprises of five temples and each one has a unique character and beauty of its own. Photography is not allowed…
It is a really beautiful temple. Has the best marble carvings. Beautifully made and the architecture is very impressive. The place is maintained and guides are provided by the temple 
Very good architecture and big temple. It opens after 12:00 PM in case you are not JAIN. Maintained very beautifully
We were 29 members of family.  Visited Dilwara temples during our visit to Mount Abu. Amazing sculptures 
"While the temples are a place of religious importance and have an important place for the Jain sect, they are also a testimony of how rich the art and architecture of ancient India was. Build in solid marble with such beautiful engravings and decorations that one cannot resist appreciating. The vast complex houses several temples and one must give adequate time to truly appreciate the effort taken to build these."
"It is not just religious value to Dilwara Jain Temple but  it is historical value to these temples, which should not be forgotten and every Indian should experience. Carving is marvellous. Only drawback and shocking thing was Priests / Poojaris asking for money - which should be banned. It is never done in Jain Temples. Trust should look in to this matter. I am sure Jain community is financially strong enough to support welfare of such temples."
Very good and old temple. Must visit even if you are atheist. No entry fee or loot. Priest are the guide only. They do the batch processing. Listen them carefully to understand each thing 
"There are total 4-5 temples which needs to be visited. Process: - You need to deposit your phones, belts and money bags in the locker area where they charge Rs. 5 for each thing you keep.- Then you need to put your shoes in the shoe keeping zone at the rate of Rs. 5 for each pair of shoes. - You will be asked to wait until there are lots of persons in queue to make a group. - A guide is assigned for the visit to 4-5 temples. - This guide explains you details/history of the creator, jainism and other care-takers before entering each temple. - At the end he asks you to pay any amount of money you want to pay as donation, be it Rs. 10 or 100 or 1000. - ExitOver all the temples are well crafted by the skilled labours. Operations time: 12:00 pm to 5:00/6:00 pm (for non-jains)"
"Loved to spent time and gaze at the fine art repeatedly. It is amazing that the temple that looks so ordinary from outside , is a masterpiece from inside."
"Situated in a small town beyond Mount Abu, it can be easily reached from mount through shared and hired cabs.  The carvings are detailed and very well done. They come as beautiful floral patterns though some what repetitive. There are no signages inside or audio trip. The…"

Standing On the outside you can never imagine the beauty that lies within .. The Dilwara Temples in Mt Abu are definitely a masterpiece . The intricately carved marble temples have to be seen to be believed. The highlight was also the temple pujaris who act as guides and give us…

Woh!What a temple. Got stunned by the sculpting construction made at that time. It is a lifetime achievement to see such a temple.
The finer details and intricate carvings at Dilwara jain temple on white marble is worth watching.  They do not allow us to photograph inside the temple. Beautiful piece of architecture. enjoyed our visit. A must visit in Mount Abu.
"Why no entry is allowed in shorts, capry, 3/4 th. Did lord mahaveer instructed like that? Guard tried to stop us but we had to pursuad him to enter."
A must visit. I have never seen soo much variety of carvings done soo beautifully in every corner or the temple. It's a true gem of a place to visit. Do not miss this visit.

"visited the dilwara temples and they are just amazing. that such precision was executed so many years ago is a marvel by itself. they dont look great when oyu see form outside, but once inside i was just spellbound."
"Enshrining the divinities of Jainism, this temple is nothing less than one of the finest architectural marvels of Indian workmanship. The simple outer facade of the temple belies the intricate marble carvings inside the temples, not to mention the magnificent statue made of Panchadhatu weighing north of 4 tons. The grandeur of this temple complex and spiritual ambience makes Dilwara Temples truly one of the must visit places at Mount Abu."
