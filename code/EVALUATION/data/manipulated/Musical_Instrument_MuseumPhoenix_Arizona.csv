Very well done displays. Loved the audio tours of each area. Long dunno might be to much for young children but the do have interactive areas which children of all ages will enjoy.
"So many musical instruments from around the world. Separated in regions. A head set tour that describes many of the exhibits as you walk to them. Educational, entertaining and fun."
This place is gigantic and you probably need 2 days to see all of it.  The mechanical instruments exhibit and the artist ones are awesome.  Playing different instruments was really fun too.  The way they have the audio system set up is so cool all you need to do is walk by an exhibit and you start hearing about it.  Definitely worth stopping in to see this place
"Excellent Museum. The guided tour was fantastic, with musical accompaniment to pair with each instrument. Enjoyed the musicians' hall of fame, the mechanical instrument section and various countries' unique repertoires! I even got to play a theremin (it was on my bucket list!)."
"Fantastic exhibits, amazing acoustics, clean and contemporary, we love the MIM and have seen at least a half dozen concerts here. Probably the best designed music venue in the southwest. Looking forward to seeing our next show there."
We have visited the museum several times through the years and always enjoyed the new exhibits. MIM has exhibitions of musical instruments from around the world. Takes a full six hours to see.
The MIM is the most beautiful museum you will ever see. Guided tours too! Resturant starbucks. Events for children Concerts too. Preepare at least4 hours to see most things.. Reasonbly priced
Great museum with so many interesting instruments. Everything is laid out nicely with plenty of space.  Allow at least a couple of hours to see everything.
You will LOVE this museum!  Take advantage of this amazing museum!! Take the kids or go alone it will be worth the visit!!
"A Special Event at MIMSince their opening, we have each been to the Musical Instrument Museum (MIM) several times. My wife and I attended a special charity event there, but got to see almost nothing of the museum, itself, as we were in the auditorium. My wife attended another event, but it was similar - almost no time to see the museum. I, on the other hand, did take family members, for a complete day at MIM, and did get to see nearly everything. In June, we got to see much more of the museum, while attending a business dinner on-property.The evening began with much of the museum’s exhibits available to us, so we took the time to explore - something that my wife had not done before. We spent almost 2 hours in the main exhibits area, which features so many common musical instruments, including exhibits on many of the musicians, who made them famous, such as Ravi Shankar and his Sitar, and Wu Man’s Pipa.The museum building, is architecturally interesting, more so inside, than on its rather basic exterior, and the exhibits are all well displayed, lit and many feature video monitors, playing the music of either the featured musician, or the featured instrument. We were given headphones, that tied into the videos, by proximity, so that one could privately enjoy the audio portion of the program.Though we only had the one large exhibit hall open, we easily filled the 2 hours, before we retired to the interior courtyard for a reception, and then dinner, catered by the museum. The service for the meal was very good, even with a portion being buffet-style, while a portion was served. Now, I do not know if the catering was done by the same staff, which cooks for, and serves meals in the little restaurant on-site? I should have asked.Even with our somewhat abbreviated visit, we both enjoyed the displays, and I think that at least two, had been added, from my previous visit, in 2017.Now, my wife and I just need to spend a full day at the MIM, and take it all in, plus dine at Café Allegro - make a full day out of it. Predicated on my visit with family (2 youngsters in the group), I would suggest at least 3 hours, with 4 being an ideal."
"Took family members who were visiting for Christmas, and everyone was really pleasantly surprised at what a cool and well done museum this is.  If you haven't heard of it you may be expecting some storefront in a mall, but this place is huge and really well laid out.  There are exhibits from every region/country in the world with a well curated explanation of the tribal or other roots or histories of the instruments on display, plus videos throughout showing the instruments in use.  It is also in a way a great geography lesson, as you see variations of certain instruments as they change from region to region.  Give yourself at least 3-4 hours - probably more.  The Africa room alone took well over an hour.  And don't miss the artists recordings and interactive exhibits on the first floor."
"The collection is separated by region and country. There is so much to see I would suggest the two day discounted tickets. We didn't and now have to return soon to see the rest of the collection. There is also a 'Hands-On' room where children, and adults can try their skill on various instruments. Come early and plan lunch in their cafeteria. The MIM is now our go to attraction when out of town guests visit."
Great one of a kind musical instrument collection displayed perfically. Great helpfully staff of mostly volunteers. You get a headset for the tour so as you move from exibate to exibate you listen to the sounds of the various instruments and cultures. Don't miss the cafe it's also outstanding.
"This museum is only 10 years old but has a fantastic collection of instruments from around the globe. They have an amazing auditorium that they book musical acts from all over the globe in. Very interactive, so kids love it. Allow a full day and soak it in because it's way better than Nashville or Graceland or any other music museum I can think of."
"This is one of the most amazing museums you will ever visit. Something for people of all ages. We send all of our company there, and each time they rave about their experience. Don’t plan on a quick in and out. Too much to see and experience."
"This is by far one of the best museums around. Interactive, fascinating, interesting. Entry fee is a little high but worth it. Don't miss this treasure."
More instruments than you could ever think of. Very unique. The layout is great. Listening as you walk through the museum is the best. Put on their earphones and enjoy
"So much to learn about from all around the globe! Interactive parts, and guides pleasant and have inside information. Go see and hear huge organ at 12 or 3. Restaurant on premises have great choices but get there before 2 for best selections. Mesquite sourdough rolls very unique! Gift shop seemed overpriced."
There’s so much to see.  Be prepared to spend hour and hours.  Every  genre of music and musical instruments  one can imagine and more.  Fabulous collect.  Great facility.  Several trips are required to experience the entire collection.
"Pick up your guidePORT headset and start upstairs in the most amazing display of musical instruments, all pegged to country and area. The headset automatically connects you to the music appearing on the flat screen TV as you position yourself at the music notes symbol  But the sheer number of instruments and displays just takes one breath away. We will return again and again."
Enjoyed the Museum but there is a bit too much information on display for my Wife. Obviously the Staff loves the subject. I enjoyed it mostly.
Plan to spend at least two hours here.  Loved the exhibits and memorabilia.  You get a headset that allows you to hear music as you stand at each display.  Food at the cafeteria was good as well.  Check their calendar of concerts before you go.
We loved the museum and were amazed at the variety of instruments and the number of instruments and the fact that they had some from just about every country in the world. And the videos were great and really gave you a taste of each country’s music. Very neat place. Don’t miss it if you like music and like museums.
"Be prepared to be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of exhibits. You will find a physical and video exhibit for almost every country in the world. They are divided into geographical regions, e.g., Africa, Middle East, Latin America, Europe, U.S., and more. If your time is limited, pick 2 or 3 of the ones you are most interested in. If you're not alone, pick a time and place to meet up, because it's likely you'll be moving along in different places at different paces."
What an amazing music museum. Loved the fact that the exhibits were so interactive based upon the headset that you were wearing. Great to see the music from around the world represented. Music does bring everyone together. You might think since this is self guided there is no one there to assist you - LOL - there is someone around every corner there to answer a question or direct you. Be sure to take a moment to go into the “touch” part of the museum where you can play an instrument - or try as in my case. It was great! A definite must when in Phoenix!
"Wow - what they have done is phenomenal. A journey through the WORLD by music. Instruments for almost every country, with videos for almost all (you get headphones with your ticket), including some with the exact instruments on display. We spent all day, going in around opening time, taking a long break for lunch, and going back in the afternoon and we couldn't get through it all. Had to rush through the US section. There's a hand's on section where you can play some instruments - was pretty fun. I am not a heavy follower of any music style or any particular bands and this was intriguing, educational, beautiful, historical and just plain fun. Also did the special African Mask exhibition, which was quite interesting and well done, but if you're only going to be here one day (they do have 2-day tickets), I'd skip that and focus on the rest. Plenty of parking."
"Very unique. We spent 3 1/2 hours there and didn't even see half of the museum. Divided up by areas of the world and then countries. Also has an experience room where you can try out instruments. And the artists room, where you can see old performers and their instruments is a must see. Highly recommend."
This is a World Class experience!  It is worth an entire day.  See it all and get the two day pass because you can't see and understand it all in one day.The actual instruments combined with the AV expereience is very special.  GO and STAY a long time
"My friend and I had a wonderful day at the Musical Instrument Museum. We started in Africa which had a myriad of different exhibits.  Loved the Beduin & Israel exhibits very much. Also saw si many variation of the same instruments. For instance, cymbals, the Ud, & some costumes too.  The staff was so friendly and helpful.  The food was delicious and sitting outside was so relaxing."
"Don’t miss MIM if you are in the area.  Allow all day to wander through the museum learning about the instruments of different countries.  Fascinating place, well done exhibits and helpful staff.  Plenty of parking."
The MIM is rated as the top tourist event in the Phoenix area and it’s easy to understand why. You’ll receive a pair of ear phones and as you walk from one exhibit to the next you will hear the instruments of that country. There is a special exhibit this year on Congolese masks and instruments. But the absolute best is to attend a concert in the gem of a theatre with 299 seats and every seat is surrounded by delicious sound! Don’t miss it. There is a concert almost every evening .
Totally surprised by the MIM. As you enter you are given a set of headphones to use and when you enter the space where various notable musicians are displayed the video starts right up - no glitches - host excellence. There's a room next door that allows the guests to play various instruments. Get ready to spend 3-4 hours there. Music is the language of the soul.
We missed this special place for several years as the thought of this specialty museum did not appeal. How wrong was this! Ended up with two full days and still 1/3 to explore. The video clips of all the instuments and performers number over 1200. Every internationally known group and solo star has a concert video selection. Incredible history of every musical genre from origin to current performance use. Beautiful grounds and in house food and drinks to rest between visual and audio stimulation. Head sets pick up show at every display. Best ever!
"From the historical perspective of music around the world to current music this place has something for everyone! Don't miss the hands on exhibit- The Experience Gallery, where you can try different instruments, great for kids and adults alike!"
"Looking for something different to do on our annual visit to AZ.  This was a really cool stop.  Can go through in a couple hours, learn something and have fun."
