Went here not knowing what to expect. Great show with makeup application and dance explanation first before performance. They also give you a written storyline which helps you follow it. Good A/C in the theatre too! 
A must see if you are in kochi. Highly recommended kathakali show. It is Drama and comedy like of show. come if you have some spare time.
The center offers martial art and  the khathakali dance performance. The martial art start at 4 pm followed by make up session for the dance then the dance performance. The full program cost Rs 700 as a package or 350 for one  session only. The center has also a small musuem that shows the dance costumes and hands movements. The martial art was ok. The dance performance was really amazing. Make  a reservation if you want to sit in the front row. Dancers invite the audience to take photos with them if they want. Overall great experience.
Went to see an Indian dance performance with our tour group.  Saw the makeup session prior to the performance. First part of the performance was one person showing expressions then he and another performer acted out a story. Rather bemused by it all.
"Wonderful artist, lovely perfomance. Kathakali at evening 5 to 7. Also yoga is nice too. Thank you ,that we enjoyed, will recomend highly"
"The place is located very near to Fort Kochi. We went an hour before the Kathakali show starts. Seating arrangements were good. We saw the makeup preparations of the dancers. I think, people must not only go to watch the dance form, they should watch the makeup preparations behind it too. It was an awesome experience all in all."
This is a must do while in Kerala. It is a fascinating show. The costumes and makeup are exceptional. Buy your ticket a head of time and ask for a seat in the front.
"Amazing place to watch a Kathakali performance. The ambience of the place sets the mood before the show. And you get the opportunity to watch them put the elaborate makeup before the show. The organisers even arrange a demonstration right before the show - a sort of 15-min crash course into understanding a Kathakali performance. They have a different story each day of the week, so you can go back for more. Am curious to attend some of the other things they offer...classical music, martial arts performances and yoga classes"
"Great place to see the Kathakali. Make-up from 17.00 hrs, you also can come a bit later. From 18.00 hrs the Kathakali starts with an introduction and explanation which I really liked! Last half hour are two scenes from an original play. Make up is beautiful as well as the…"
"The show starts about 5pm with 3 male actors meticulously applying g their full face makeup, well worth watching  then at 6pm there is a 10 minute explanation of Kathkali with one actor demonstrating the mime features then about 6.15pm the dance starts with gorgeous costumes and mesmerising mime.I don't often go to cultural displays but this is one I am really glad I went to. It finishes about 7.15pm. Book a day or so before and try to get some of the numbered seats in the stalls close to the stage. If you can't, then the upstairs seats on the side nearest the stage are almost as good (unnumbered upstairs)."
Recommended for kerala cultural experience. Artists were makeup with vivid  and high contrast colour painting. It's combination of two or more classical arts
"This is probably the closest you will get to the older cultural/ art/ dance experience while in Cochin. In a well maintained center one is able to even see the way make up is applied and the costumes put on . The performers are genuine artists and the commentary done well in English. It is an authentic experience , reasonably priced, easy to get to and a must for any visitor keen to know the culture and arts of "" God's own country "" . Make it a point to spend part of an evening there"
The experience and immersion into the Kathakali dance and its preparation and principles was amazing! Loved the explanations of each aspect of Kathakali dance.  The performance itself was good and the duration is perfect for those who are seeing it for the first time. It is…
"It’s a fantastic attempt present Indian Classical Music, Dance and Martial arts for tourists in an easy to understand light presentation. Full of clear information, each act is complete in itself and makes one feel proud of our Indian culture. I hope every state can create such lively cultural centres, which combines live performance with some good introductory learning. It’s a small beautiful place and has activities almost whole day. Refer to their website for details & book in advance for free."
This kathakali was so amazing to watch this program . The artists are awesome & expressions are mind blowing . All the best all those kathakali artists .      Thank you
"Don’t go for the Kalarippayattu: they sell you the ticket for one hour but they give max half an hour show, full of interruptions. When asked about this, the staff will awkwardly smile with their stare lost in the void, as they kick you out of the theatre. Go somewhere else."
"My parents and I had a really interesting experience at the performance of the Kathakali dance. Was some confusion with the seating. We booked 2 months prior, but because of groups, our seating was at the balcony, so I was a bit disappointed. But the kind crew offered us a better seating , which I would like to say thank you to them!!!The applying of the makeups was interesting on it's own. After that came a demonstration of the gestures and it's meanings. Then came the performance, which was nothing I've seen before. They handed out previously the story in translation. Also, the whole programme is a great photo opportunity.Overall, it was a great and colourful night, would recommend to go and see the performance for yourself!"
Went here last night and really enjoyed the show. It is a must to attend the make up and explanation otherwise the show does not make much sense. It is also quite interesting to see the transform and to learn all about the movements
Went to this show in Fort Cochi. Started with actors putting on makeup right on the stage in front of the audience. Fascinating process. Then a demonstration in full costume and the performance. Costuming fabulous and the play was interesting. A great option for entertainment in Cochi.
Awesome and inspiring. This is what I can term the performance of artists of Kerala Kathakali Centre. Reach the theater early to witness the artists put on their makeup. It is indeed a treat to see them get ready for the event and gives you an understanding into the effort and…
"This was a very reasonably priced show which covered watching the performers prepare (absolutely recommend being there for this), a fabulous description by the narrator of the history, hand and eye gestures (wow!) demonstrated by a performer, and then an hour long performance. This is local to Kerala so do try and get to it if you can."
"This dance drama belongs to the coastal state of Kerala, the skilled traditional dancers in elaborate costumes, accompanied by drums and voice, were preceded by unique face painting, which is highly symbolic and defines each character type. Human, god-like, or even demonic qualities are represented by the stunning makeup, costumes and eye movements.  Humorous situations add to the enjoyment.  Be sure to explore the center, a museum with several rooms, many large carved statues, even a decorated long boat."
"I would highly recommend going to see Kathakali traditional dance if you get a chance when you are Kerala. The performance was split into 3 sections; make up application, demonstration and story dance. I found the first two the most interesting. Seeing the actors/dancers transform under their make up was fascinating and the demonstration was informative, with the various subtle face & hand gestures being explained to help you follow the dances that follow."
Went there for experiencing the Kathakali performance. It was quite an amusing performance. Must visit.
I booked online for the 5pm Make Up then  6-7pm Dance Show.  It is so fascinating.  The make up and costumes are so elaborate and well worth going early to see it all come together.  The actual dance performance goes by very quickly.  It's all about the eyes! Loved the whole evening.  The theater has no air conditioning so prepare for a warm evening and you'll need to bring a bottle of water.  You are given a paper with the story for your understanding.  This type of theater has quite a history.
simply awesome Show. Highly recommended must watch also watch martial arts karali . Get photo clicked with artist
"The kathakali performance was powerful and a privilege to witness. Extraordinary grace and emotional intensity - vivid colours, masterful control and almost superhuman attention to detail. Mesmerising - must be seen. Directly afterwards we attended an Indian classical music concert at the same venue. We are musicians ourselves, and we were shocked by the brilliance of the musicians performing. Breathtaking virtuosity of the highest calibre. We were so impressed that we came back another night, and were even more blown away the second time. Must be seen. This isn’t light entertainment - it demands concentration and focus from the spectator too, but deeply rewarding"
Learning the gestures and story behind this indian taditional drama dance art. Delighted by the excellent performance and meticulous make-ups. Highly recommended!
"This was literally across from our hotel and only inexpensive to attend.  The makeup session was ok to watch for 10 mins but literally was like 'watching paint dry' Thought there may have been more people getting made up but only the one on stage.  Skipped across the road for a cold beer and went back for the show.  Appreciate the talent and preservation of the cultural heritage, but it got a little monotonous for me.  50mins definitely long enough for my attention span."
Interesting and entertaining experience. There was an hour of face painting before the performance which allowed plenty of time for pictures. Book in advance for the best seats nearer the front. The information regarding the story enacted and the narration was also helpful to explain the dance. Well worth a visit.
"If you only do one thing in Kochi,  go to Kerala Kathakali Centre, and make sure it is the one behind the Basilica.  There are others and there is no comparison .  Dedicated,  beautifully costumed performers in a wonderful authentically decorated center.  Please be aware that some of the reviews are of a different center as I can tell by the photos and descriptions. This is fantastic !  Bring your camera !.."
"Enjoyed the show very much. Definitely worth seeing the performers transform themselves with make-up beforehand, and how the stage/floor gets set. As others have said, it gets very loud but I quite liked that!"
Make sure you get to the theater 45 minutes before the show to watch the make up ceremony and don’t forget to read the story as you watch it. Amazing experience of the Kerala culture
We saw a classical indian concert. Top notch performers and musicians. Not just touristy restaurant performes. They were the real deal. The setting and vibe was also great. Have been to some that are marginal and not comfortable. This was good all round.
Saw the demonstration of how elaborate make up is applied and subsequent performance of the group - in traditional costumes and story! Was extremely fascinating and interesting show. Truly worth going and seeing for yourself!
