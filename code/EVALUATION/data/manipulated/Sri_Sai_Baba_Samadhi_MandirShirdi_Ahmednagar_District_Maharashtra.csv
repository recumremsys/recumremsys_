"Sai Baba Samadhi Mandir complex is spread over huge area. Overall well managed temple. Due to heavy rush of devotee from all over India, it takes long hour to stand in queue for darshan. Need to improve some facility for those who are standing in queue. ViP pass facility is available here for those who wish to bypass long queue.       You feel divine and blessed at this place.   Lots of hotel and guest houses are  available for stay in shirdi .…"
Blissful prayers at Mandir. Kakad arti was crowded . Crowd is increasing yearly . Temples complex is very clean. Don’t be cheated by any touts. Obtain VIP pass from PRO office
"Must visit Temple.Good vibes will flow during the visit,  Very religious and soul purifying place. Devotees from far distance places come here and seek Blessings. There are separate lines for free Dharshan and online booking.Nowadays biometric process is prevalent. So take your Aadhaar card as age & address proof for the biometric entry pass and enter according to the time slot, after that it might take 2 hours maximum, during lean rush.The queue lines were very well planned where we find seats every few steps forward. Milk and biscuits also available.No mobiles or electronic devices allowed in the premises. A number of good hotels nearby. Well connected by roads. There is good option to stay in Temple Trust Sai Ashram as the Price is just 500 rs for AC room per day. Best Place to Silent your Mind --The moment you look towards the deity you feel like your wishes would be accomplished. Try to visit once in your lifetime."
Visited Sai Darshan today from Mumbai. It took around 4 hours from Mumbai to Temple. Roads are good and greenery all around. Darshan took almost 45 minutes despite paid pass. Not a very good arrangement to control the crowd. People were pushing each other to get enter first. Sai…
"The Sai Baba Mandir Samadhi is an amazing place with divine vibes. HOWEVER, there is a big disconnect between the way the affairs of the place are managed and everything Shri Sai Baba stood for. Sai Baba was known for his insistence on the equality of all before GOD. SABKA MALIK EK. Implying God is one for everybody. Everybody is equal in the eyes of God. However, this very thing is flouted openly at the Mandir. Devotees are categorised by the amount of Dakshina/ entry fee they pay. There is a normal darshan which may take a devotee hours for a possible fleeting darshan (view of Saibaba) if he does not buy a ticket. A Rs 200/= ticket gets one a special access. A Rs 400/= ticket gets the donor a special place for being present during the noon arati (mid-day prayer). Better still, a bigger donation amount gets a donor almost unlimited access to a special place in front of every other devotee from a vantage point.Sai Baba was against idol worship and difficult rituals. The priests have forgotten his very words and begun to worship him.The devotees are hounded and pushed around the temple by loud security guards shouting out their instructions.What should be a peaceful place is drowned by the cacophony of the howling out by guards and priests who wish the devotees to keep moving reducing the samadhi mandir to a fish market."
"Have visited temple in first week of September. By SAI baba's blessings I was able to get Darshan of baba. Have gone there by train and alighted at Belapur(shrirampur) BAP railway station. It took 1 hr from there but cabs are a bit difficult to get. Autos are there but make sure to do a lot of bargaining and better take auto outside the station. Please get a hotel nearby temple as it will be a lot easier for everything like visiting temple, getting cabs to diff places and also a lot of restaurants."
Had a great Darshan of Baba. It is a good place and must visit place. I booked darshan ticket from online and it is well managed.
"Very happy to be a part of kaakda Aarti. This place has a lot of positive energy which one can feel inside the temple. Temple is maintained very well. Prasad bhojan was simple but tasty. But cleanliness of utensils needs to be improved. Like most pilgrimage places in India, here too, shop keepers and street vendors try to loot you. Beware of them. Online darshan booking is easy. Do use this facility. Remember to Cary the booking confirmation slip and your ID proof. Go an hour before the time given in the slip through the gate mentioned. Shani gate is gate no. 1 don't get confused."
"Sai Baba Samadhi Mandir is the scared place where you have long queues if you are visiting on Thursday. If you are coming by flight take a cab from Shirdi airport, minimum charges for 4+1 passenger for sedan is Rs 600. They will drop you anywhere in Shirdi.  Go to Sai baba site…"
"Sai Baba Mandir is the main attraction of Shirdi and everyone comes here from around the country to get blessings. Following points should be noted while going to the mandir:1. There are 3 types of entries in the complex for Darshan :a) Free - Avoid this if you dont want to stand in line for 3-4 hrs !b) VIP pass - This costs 200 bucks per head. During a rush hour, it takes 20-30 min in the line to get VIP pass and another 20-30 min waiting in the line for Darshan. For VIP pass, you need an ID proof like driving licensec) Senior citizen pass - it takes around 10 min in the line to get senior citizen pass. The counter is situated near gate no. 3. You are eligible for this pass if you are above 60yrs of age. If you are above 70yrs, then a free pass for attendant is allowed. Carry your age proof2. VIP pass for Darshan can also be booked online which would save your 20 min in line3. Booking for Aarti is done months in advance. So, if you are interested in Aarti, then book it 2-3 months before your travel4.Entry for VIP pass people is at gate no. 1. If you have a senior citizen pass, you can enter Gate no. 3 which is comparatively closer.5. During rush hour, you would get only few seconds to see sai baba statue before being pushed out through the exit. So, try to plan your visit during early morning or evening"
"Most of us knows about Sai baba of shirdi. Sai bab samadhi temple is situated in shirdi almost 75 km from Nashik. It is co0nnected by road to Mumbai and train also stop here. It has airport but check connectivity. All facilities are available here. good star rated hotels, all international chain restaurants ( Domino's, Pizza hut) .Other local restaurants are also serving good food but only vegetarian. Good road will bring you to town.  Don't fall pry to agents. Everything is very smooth. There are different gates to enter. Check your entry point. Sai nath samadhi temple is very beautiful and very well maintained and located in the heart of town. You can buy VIP ticket also costing Rs400/- per person . Else you need to wait in queue which will keep you for almost 3-4 hours waiting. In case you take VIP pass it will bypass normal entry adn within 30 minutes or so you have baba darshan. Be careful when you buy offering for Baba, don't forget to bargain or they may cheat you. Lot of devotees visit this temple throughout the year. On every Thursday large number of devotees visit temple so better you avoid or you have to wait long in queues. Temple is very well maintained and discipline is followed by all. You feel divine and blessed at this place. visiting this place since 2003 and seen lot many construction , hotels, shops, restaurants coming up. You come out of the temple in the mid of market where you can buy prasad, souvenir etc. Paid Parking facility is available just opposite to the entry gate, its underground , you may ask shopkeepers they will guide you. Hotels suiting all pockets are available in plenty. Don't forget to buy Laddoo prasad for your family and friends. Its available just outside exit gate. You may have to wait in queue but worth waiting. Market is narrow and crowded be careful of your bags and pockets. Better if you reach early morning. Photography is not allowed inside the temple. Bags and purses also need to kept outside.  Very peaceful and blissful place. Must visit in case you are around this place.…"
very famous temple and very crowded. take a vip pass for 200 each and may be you can get dashan early. otherwise very famous temple
"One of the best places to visit. Very serene environment. Don't fall for touts, mandir trust has good facilities for darshan,  senior citizens can get free darshan pass once during day. Also anyone can go to PRO counter and get pass for Rs. 200."
The temple and surrounding areas are very well maintained and organised. The online registration for Darshan is very convenient. Serene ambience with lot of neem banyan and other trees. Drinking water facilities available. The Lendi garden in the temple premises is lovely. A…
"Sri Sai Baba mandir is the 2nd popular pilgrimage destination after Tirupati Balaji. Once you enter the main gabhara,all the pain you had standing in the long ques is out of mind.Divine Intervention. Avoid going on Sundays, Public holidays & Thursday if you want to avoid rush."
"Visited the Shirdi Sai Baba Samadhi temple after a very long time.Devotees have the option of taking in paid tickets with shorter queues or the free tickets which have more people and hence takes longer for one to proceed inside. The complex is hugeAnd one can also get books,cards and calendars with Shri Sai Baba photos. While it is crowded, the divinity of the place is unmistakable."
We came to get blessings of baba ji. Huge huge rush even on monday morning. Buy a vip pass for Rs200 each. Worth spending that money. Security is quite good. Thy try to keep things organized.
"this place is very sacred and you feels very very positive vibrations as soon as you reach thesamadhi mandir .  be calm and just pray baba , you will find tremendous peace and tranquility."
The energy and vibes of this temple is highly positive. You will feel very pleasant and calm. The temple is very organised. We had visited the 12 noon aarti session. Spent a good half an hour inside the temple during aarti. The templ offerings are yummy :)
Sai baba samadhi mandir really expect. Am going darshanam thusday evging baba pallaki seva thay do every thusdsy.
Om Sai Ram. It is a really good place. New VIP line gets you to do darshan in 15 mins. Do not get swayed by local people who will say the gate is towards that side and bla bla .... Ask the officials- police or guards or ones at counter
Do visit on Kojagiri Pournima night Sej Aarti in main mandir .... Mesmerising experience!!! The pooja lasted for 2 hours from 11pm to 1am. Book on line tickets .. Go by air as Shridi Airport is operational and spend more time with baba.  Note- Fresh Ladu prasad is made available…
"Shirdi is truely spritual place. You feel content after Sai Baba's darshan.   As per my experience best plan to for Pune/Mumbai people (who usually come here on weekends), to avoid rush and long que would be reach to shirdi by Friday afternoon/evening. Take Sai baba's darshan by…"
"This of course is a very holy place for Indians and foreigners . Predominantly Hindu it also attracts believers of all faith. Considering the number of visitors, the premises are very well maintained by the  private trust ,"
"Visited this temple recently. We made online booking (which is free) and could have darshan in 30-40 minutes.  The ashramm provides accommodation, but it was not upto our liking. I would advise visitors to seek other types of accommodation."
Went for Kakad Aarti Darshan.  Very good Darshan I had.  So peaceful and quiet.  Nicely maintained the place.
Got a golden opportunity in my life. Worshipped with my wife who is a devotee of Shirdi Sai Baba.🙏🙏🙏 Om Sai Ram 🙏🙏🙏
Felt refreshed and blessed after Sai baba's darshan. Its amazing to feel the divine energy in & around the temple
"Though baba is omni present but there is a special aura to this place, you actually feel Sai baba with you. Try This mesmarising experiance once and you will want comming here again and again."
Sairam. Blessed are the ones who get an opportunity to visit this holy place and be blessed by Baba. Sabka Malik Ek
Took a bus from Nashik to shirdi. Buses to shirdi starts from Mahamarg bus stand(Bombay nakka) in Nashik and ticket costs Rs 130 per person.Journey takes about 1.45 -2 hours. The buses stop at the the place from where we can go for darshan of Sai baba(Shirdi bus stand is about 1…
"Very spiritual, need to book in advance and clean. Did not eat food there. went for Night Aarthi, with booking one month in advance...."
"Been with parents to the place. Filled with surprises, the place was clean and lot of shops ( standard tourist place bargaining skills needed). People are nice and you will get a good food. Dont take chances for your regional food preference, Try the local food, its good and best to take in travel. Temple is quite small, including dwarka, not over expect but its corridors\ boundaries had expanded. Must bring back - take aways --> Ash from immortal flames in dwarka that is neither hot nor smokes, a bite of the neem leaves that is not bitter like you get at other places. WE had been in middle of rainy season so not much of hovering around.One cautionary note, dont opt for the Kakad arathi if you have elders or kids. Its not worth the money or blessing. 3 hrs of waiting in long queue and 45 mins in standing for dharsan. You need to try your luck not to get a pillar view or someone is in middle."
"Had been in mind to visit sai baba samadhi mandir for long and it actually turned true recently. It can be planned as a day trip from Mumbai like we did. You feel that peace and connect to divinity there. There are multiple places for darshan which can be covered in this overall place. The infra there is good to handle devotees. However some improvements possilbe still. The hall finally where whole crowd converges, this is where it become a commotion"
Been at the temple in November 2019.  Feeling of inner peace after the visit.  The only drawback is long queues and people has no manners in a temple as such.  They push and behaviour of people is a nightmare.  I attended the night dharsan and morning aarti.  Will definitely visit again.
