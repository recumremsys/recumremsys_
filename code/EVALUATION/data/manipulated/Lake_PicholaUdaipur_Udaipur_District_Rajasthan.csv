"Smooth quiet and therefore beautiful lake,it holds the breath of the city.the largest lake of the city.it is visible mostly from all the iconic places of Udaipur. Located in the heart of city.two islands Jag Mandir and Jag Niwas are located with this lake"
"One of the beautiful lake which you can visit for watching the Sunset while boating, makes more pretty with its surrounding. Don't forget to go for boating, a beautiful experience."
Lake pichola is very Nice and clean clear water. Evening view is.very nice. Best place for boating. Excellent
Pichola lake has very good place and superb in evening. Have got good views and best for photography.
"A beautiful lake, that looks prettier during the rains. Do cruise it to see the gorgeous hotels and palaces that fringe the lake. Stop over at Jagmandir  for a quick break"
"Went for a walk alongside the prominade in evening before sunset. The view is beautiful and especially do visit Ambrai Ghat which is on opposite side of Bagori ki haweli. It is a 5 mins walk from there via the foot over bridge. Also, there are great places to eat by lakeside and…"
"The lake looks equally beautiful from any ghats and during any time of the day. However according to be the views from western ghat will be the best as you can see city palace, lake palace, jagmandir palace all in a glance. Do not miss sunset over lake pichola."
Nice lake.. The cool breeze when you ride a boat here during rains is amazing..There are different jetties for different hotels.. Took the boat for Leela Palace from the corresponding jetty
"Visited thrice here. I always choose my stay nearby this lake. With all the transport connectivity, awesome restaurants and wonderful views of hills around this lake, there's no reason to stay anywhere else. You can enjoy calming sunset and sunrise at this lake. Must try boat ride of the lake as well."
Located in the heart of the Udaipur city. Lake Pichola is huge and very beautiful. There are a few platforms built at the shores for tourists to witness the beauty of the lake
This place is our worldly beautiful and must visit. Don’t miss this place. Prefer going on a non peak day when it will be less crowded else you won’t be able to take good pictures. Also do make sure do boat ride. That’s good. 
"Lake Pichola is an artificial lake that sits right in the middle of Udaipur city which was built in the year 1362 AD. It is named after the nearby village Picholi, Lake Pichola is one of the most famous tourist attractions in Udaipur. Flanked by islands, palaces, temples, mansions, ghats and restaurants, Lake Pichola offers something for everyone. The enchanting views of sunrise and sunset from the lake amazing. One of the most famous attractions in the lake surroundings is Lake Palace that sits right in the middle of the lake, constructed on the Jag island. Mohan Mandir, built by Jagat Singh between the period 1628-1652 and Jag Mandir are other islands that are worth a visit. City Palace is another famous tourist attraction in the lake surroundings.A trip to Lake Pichola is incomplete without a boat ride in the serene lake. This time it was my turn to go for boating. There are four islands in the lake, they are Jag Niwas Island, Jag Mandir Island, Mohan Mandir Island, and Arsi Vilas Island. It wasn't possible for us to go to them, a boat ride was perfect to have a look at those islands. Our boat ride started from one of the many ghats with an amazing view of City Palace.Boat ride in Lake Pichola is a must-do activity to enjoy the beauty and charm of the lake. It would be more interesting if you go for a boat ride in the evening."
It's awesome and famous lake in Udaipur with Taj palace/jagmandir in between . The boat ride is costly but worth. We went for evening boat ride and it was sensational. Make sure to take the boat ride from city palace to get down at jagmandir and enjoy the evening
Its great place for relaxation. Boating was main attractions of this place. You should go in evening.
Lake pichola right next to the beautiful palace. Took a boat ride sunset time. Reminded us of Venice. Beautiful place. Stopped by the hotel for a coffee. Very neat. Amazing time we had
"We went to Lake Pichola one afternoon, scenic lake, possibly one of the most beautiful lakes in India, visible from City Palace, a must visit if you are in Udaipur. We weren't fortunate enough to stay at the Taj situated in the middle of the lake so did probably the next best thing, we took a 30 minute boat ride, there were options for a boat with 30 passengers and another one with 10 passengers, second boat being more expensive but totally worth it. Gave us opportunity to take dozens of pictures and also enjoy the scenery.There is also an option to take a boat from City Palace to lake pichola, which takes passengers to Jag Mandir another island in the middle of the lake and there is a expensive restaurant there if one wishes to enjoy food, we didn't take that option.We took a 5-10 minute rikshaw ride from City Palace to Lake Pichola, there are photographers with traditional wares on the lake, we decided to get my daughters dressed up and took some pictures, good idea to get it done before the boat ride as the pictures were ready by the time we got back from the boat ride."
"Udaipur is all about water. Built around five man-made lakes, water is the focus of the city.  It would be a shame to visit the city without going out on the water.   It was a very calm day when I went out for a boat ride on Lake Pichola but I still put on the life vest offered.…"
Pichola is the most famous and beautiful lake in Udaipur. Do opt for boating here to get some amazing views of the palaces and hotels around.
"Its good to choose boating at the time of sun set. It seems that Lake Pichola is being maintained properly. Boating price is higher. They take you to 1 medium round of around 20 mins of boating. No guidance of the Palace or history of other monuments situated in the lake, while boating. There's more potential if the authority takes further interest."
We visited with FamilyThere are boats and Rajsthani Dressup photo walas service there It is top attraction of Udaipur. Compared to Fateh Sagar lake this one is small. Have boating which costs 300 per head boat of 6 ppl  / 150 per head for boat of 20 ppl They show you all palaces from lake Good time pass place
"took short boat ride across to palace, and see the garden was very nice. would have been nice if government kept up on the fountains and fence railings, as much of it is decayed as it all needs update painting also."
One of the most beautiful lake. One should do the boat ride when you are in Udaipur. It is visible mostly from all the iconic places of Udaipur. Located in the heart of City. Must do boating from lake palace so thay they will take you to jagmandir too. You can see Taj hotel situated in the middle of the lake.
It was extremely most enjoyably Boat ride i had in this place. Loved the place and the landscape. Love to visit again next year with family. 
"Getting through the boating ....v visited lake Pichola and it was a good experience, city palace , lake palace , jagmandir and had a lovely pictorial view of city palace !!"
"Beautiful man made lake in Udaipur. Offers boating ride. Boats are equipped with life jackets and have a roof too. Takes about an hour, along with visit to Jag mandir palace in the middle of the lake "
Wow! This is mesmerizing! This is the main attraction if udaipur and old city of udaipur was build around this.. the views from any ghat are great ..We had a boat ride from the city palace in the mornring time..it was very nice!! Do not miss this!!
"Situated near city palace, having jag mandir in its center. Boating is the main centre of attraction."
we took a boat near city palace to jagmandir and way back. Lake Pichola is surrounded by old heritage buildings and restaurants. Carry hats or stoles in summer or spring. Best time to visit 4-7 (sunset). Avoid having food from Jagmandir restaurant.
This is what Udaipur is all about. The lake is central to everything and is so beautiful. Make sure to get accommodation close or at least eat on on of the many rooftop cafe's around the lake. Sunrise and Sunset are well worth it. Such a beautiful and relaxing place
Beautiful cool day in udaipur. Traveller's have a choice of tickets one is the more expensive city palace one. This ticket you have to walk quite a distance inside city palace to purchase. I chose the government boats paid 200 rupees and shared the bigger boat covered and with life jackets. It was safe and also very nice to have company. We had 20 min ride that was taken slowly and we had enough time and good views of the palaces and hotels like taj and oberoi that have pristine exclusive views and entrances of their own on the lake. Take pictures with Rajasthan turbans and listen to the sweet sounds of the sarangi players. Lots of snacks and Desi good. An enjoyable day.
Most of the places around are facing Lake Pichola and it’s a gorgeous view altogether. Cruising along the lake would also be gorgeous and the sun set over the lake is a view you should catch at least once on your trip. Lake Pichola is one of the most beautiful tourist attractions in the city.
We were very disappointed because water level was very low but it was very very big lake. Boating price was also very high.
"Lake pichola is considered to be the best tourist point in Udaipur. However it failed to meet my expectations. The sunset is bang on average. Have seen way better sunsets in Delhi NCR. Also, there's not much to do at Lake pichola except the boat ride which is decent. The prices seem to be bit high considering the quality of the boat ride."
"We went for boating at the Govt. authorized point behind the City Palace. The access by car is till the gate of the boating complex. With help from the local staff, we were able to get my Super Senior Grandma to a Luxury Boat in her wheelchair. There's a ramp and a few stairs but these are all doable by wheelchair, if you can get help from 2-3 people. Off-peak timings are obviously better to do this. These boats go around the lake for 15 mins. and do not make a stop at the Jagmandir island. There may be other ride options available, but this one looked most suitable to us given our requirements."
"Best time to view is in the evening. The best view is from the city palace- Udaipur. Take a boat ride from City Palace -Udaipur. After a boat ride go to Taj lake palace hotel in the Pichola lake and can have dinner, if it is in your bucket list. Even if the whole trip with…"
