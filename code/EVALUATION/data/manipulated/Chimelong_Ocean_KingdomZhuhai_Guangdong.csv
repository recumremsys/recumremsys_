Great theme park experience. Very huge indeed to walk around. Amazing and very impressive aquarium. Enjoyed all the shows especially the Beluga show and the 5D Theater experience. The whole theme park was found to be very exciting. You need two days to enjoy the whole area.
"This is a beautiful theme park with a number of amazing features. The giant manta and video aquarium on the ceiling of the entrance pavillion are stunning. The flume ride glides past real bears. The giant whale shark flying into the air is only bested by the enormously humongous aquarium that has something like five real whale sharks swimming inside. Parrot Coaster is a great B&M wing rider. Some of the theming is fantastic. Not a ton of rides, but some decent ones, and there are lots of interesting animal exhibits. Get there while it's new, before they let it rot (as is the fate of a lot of other Chinese theme parks)."
"Very entertaining amusement theme park, rare marine animals, lots of thrilling rides and spectacular shows.  Go early to avoid the hot sun and not during school holidays time to avoid the queue."
First Class experience equal to Seaworld and Universal Studios.  The arctic displays and animals were a surprise!  Nice parade in the afternoon with entertainment.  The thrill rides were great.  Be certain to obtain the plastic covers for your clothes.  You will get extremely wet!  A great place to spend an entire day.  Good value for money.
Took two days for us to see the whole park and it was absolutely awesome!! Favourite ride was the Parrot Coaster for the adults and my daughter (6) loved the spinning pirate ship my son (3) lived the walrus boat ride. Alot of the rides are water related and u get pretty wet - rain coats available for 15 yuan.Fireworks extravaganza at new night was pretty good and there is a parade at 3pm each day.No expense has been spared on all facilities and has only gripe is some of the food prices.Animal shows and exhibits are all of top standard and all worth a look.Highlight for me was the whaleshark aquarium and the dolphin show.5D theatre a little pleasant surprise also and definetly worth the time.
"Nice park, clean, with nice games and attractions! Very nice place to bring family and children. Loved the roller coaster, the Parrot Ride is simply too scary and very very exciting! Not a lot of food inside, advice to make a very good breakfast and bring some fruits. You will be too busy running around looking at things to eat!The hotels around are amazingly big and massive with rich buffets and good food.Nice place to go if you are nearby, strongly advice."
"This newly built ocean kingdom is a visual treat and built like a 'Sea world meet Disneyland'.We got the flyer of the show timings at the entrance and planned our visit around that.We saw dolphin , sea lion and the beluga whale show which were all great. We saw the polar enclosure for polar bears and penguins and the beautiful whale shark aquarium( largest in the world). The rides were good , especially the nemo one. The parade is beautiful , please don't miss it! Also saw the musical fountains spectacular which was enthralling!! Loved my visit and would say matches up to any international park!"
"Excellent day trip from Macau . the rides , attractions were all great , esp the huge aquarium that features 4-5 whale sharks . The sight of these majestic sea creatures is worth the attraction fees alone . Do stay to the end, there's a 15 mins fireworks show , quite good and well chronograph ."
The first Amusement park that we visited in China. It has an amazing variety of waterlife in display. Biggest aquarium. There is a 5D movie screen as well. Have visited the place thrice and enjoyed it each time. Very well maintained. It has a few adventure rides aa well if you are upto it. There are good restaurants as well if you are a non-vegetarian. We normally take a car from Guangzhou and return by night. But there is a water park and some other attractions nearby along with a resort too. So you can easily spend two days here. Trains are available from Guangzhou to Zhuhai and from there you can take a bus to Ocean Kingdom
"Arrived by bus from Shenzen. Ocean Kingdom is like a bigger Ocean Park sans the rollercoasters and cable cars. If you like marine life - this is the place to go! They even have a separate area for brown bears and polar bears. The humongous whale shark tank is a site to behold. Kids will love it, plus there's a play/ fun area for smaller kids, Whole day affair.   And they are very strict with the height requirement."
"This is an excellent theme park. It's like an aquarium, zoo, and theme park in one! We started with the 5D experience (which is quite good, but might be a little scary for little kids). Then we went counter clockwise across the park. If you are into rides, i suggest you buy or bring a rain jacket from the beginning. You will be needing it many times in different rides. Their dolphin show is quite nice, way way better than the one in Ocean Park HK. Don't miss the great Whale Shark Aquarium, the biggest one in the world. They not only have 1, but 4-5 whale sharks swimming in the same huge aquarium. It's really amazing!! Not to miss are the bears, the walruses (they are SOOOO big and heavy), and if you'e not yet tired of the penguins, go see those as well.  Everything in this park is really nice and well laid out. The animals seemed to be well-fed and healthy. Overall, two thumbs up for this park! The fireworks at night are really great too! Very different from the usual fireworks as it combines fountains, acrobats, lights and fireworks in the show."
"$10 billion buys a pretty nice park.  Very clean and full of amazing animals and architecture. Admission is 350 if you are >1.5m and 285 if you are <1.5m. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because of the captive bears, who are clearly not happy or healthy.  Do not go and see them."
Very big theme parks with lots of marine animals. Went there on a Monday afternoon wasn't that crowed but many rides were not opened. You can also feed the brown bears and seals at 20RMB. I would recommend you all to go when the park is fully renovated.
"Visited Ocean Kingdom for one day, and found it to be pretty much just another theme park similar to Seaworld. Rides, aquariums, shows etc. Food overpriced, once over the initial wow factor then it makes you think weather really worth going. Best thing is the light and firework show in the evening when the park closes, definitely worth staying for and as you leave you walk under a massive screen depicting pictures of under sea life. I"
"Wow such an awesome entertained and adventurous place for all people. Had lots of fun.""FUNULTIMATE"" I MUST SAY. Even though our trip was very short but we went and play all the games,n saw all those birds, animals. Specially enjoyed playing those 3 roller costers. Wish to visit again. And lastly want to thank the security guard who helped us to get taxi. Thanks a lot to them."
"Don't get me wrong, the whale shark aquarium was amazing, but the overall park  was far below my expectations. Many recommended this to me and I saw the number one rank on TripAdvisor, but it's really not that good. First of all, the shows were clearly trying to copy Sea World. It's not a coincidence they also put diving, macaws, and dolphins together. The shows were incoherent, especially the dolphin show. They were pretty impressive, especially the beluga whale one, but incomparable to those of Sea World. The extreme air-conditioning of every animal exhibit indoors compared to the heat of outside was topped off with bursts of heavy rain when I went. It was impossible not to get a cold. They need milder air-conditioning or they can provide us with jackets we won't think to bring in 90 degree weather. The rides were good but made you pay 15 rmb for a raincoat to go on some of them. This is NOT a water park. Also, the rides are far and few. The 5D theater is worth a visit. However, there are better Changlong parks in Guangzhou where it all started. I was also greatly disappointed on the lack of emphasis placed on saving marine life. There was some on being friends with them but nothing on helping them or how chimelong helped them. It's nowhere as good as Sea World. Also, the whale shark basketball game was a major disappointment and not worth your time."
"This park is world class. Everything is clean and of high standard. Shows, rides and animals are all worth a visit. Can easily spend a whole day here! Great for families with children."
"No crowds. Great. Easy to get into shows. No queue. Saw Walrus Splash show and Beluga Dolphin show. Park was well designed. Pleasantly surprised. Stayed at Hengqin Bay hotel also was a great choice, more upmarket."
Great selection of rides and animals/fish. The main aquarium is impressive. Try to be there to see when they feed the big whale sharks.
"We went to the Ocean Kingdom by taxi. The park was amazing and we enjoyed. However, the nightmare was coming when we left. After the firework at 8:30, we walked with the thousands crowds for an hour before we reached the bus stop. When the bus came, hundreds of people rushed to stop the bus before it reached the bus stop. The mob squeezed into the bus, pushed each other, screamed.... one even climbed through the window. The bus was overloaded, the door was blocked but people did not get off..... We waited... but we were afraid that we were left in that remote area, therefore we took a deep breath and followed the mob to squeezed into the bus. Our bodies were pressed and we could not  breath. The bus took 1.5 hour to reach the city centre as there were so many cars on the road. We arrived the hotel after 12:00. Felt like a survior of a disaster. Goodness me! The joy was covered with the nightmare.Tips: Either join the tour or drive your car. Don't wish a luck for catching a taxi or a bus. Or you may come to Hong Kong Ocean Park instead. It's smaller but the transportation is good."
"I was really really impressed by the architecture of this hotel and everything and yes. It's an amazing hotel. I would have give it a 5 star rate, but I saw two things which are disappointing and I would like to point them out. First of all, there is this beautiful but very small dolphin pool near the hotel. There are 3 dolphins, sharing the pool with so many turtles in the same pool. I would like to point out, do they swap the dolphins? do they give them more space to swim than THAT small pool? moving on to the other question, so the aquarium educates school students about loving animals, taking care of our environment etc., but the hotel is serving shark fin soup? Uh what? Please. Seriously, the management should do something about this. THIS is very serious. You're telling little kids and even teenagers like me to take care of the environment but you're still letting your hotels serve shark fin? Please consider this. On a lighter note, I loved the hotel and I loved the park. It was picture perfect for me, sorry if I was directing the issue too harshly, I just couldn't bear to see the waiters serving literally 10 trays of shark fin soups walking past me. It's wrong. But overall, this is the ideal destination for you and your family 😁 very great, but there's room for improvements! 4 stars from me, 1 star lost because of the issues. But sending much love, I love this place, and would be back soon. I'd have to give credit also to the characters walking around in the hotel restaurant, they were amazing with people and kids. They said hi to everyone whom walked past and continued to greet people even some of them didn't bother to say it back. One character took it to the extend that he took a child to get some candies and drinks, and I couldn't help but smile to. What a way to make our night!! And Kiki played hide a seek with a girl while Kaka peeked through a window to wave hi to a teenager. Respect because they have so much passion and love for the visitors!!"
"It's a good park that combine about aquarium/animal show and playpark. And the park is clean, i impressed the staff is very quick to took the rubbish on the lane of aquarium. The animal look good seems well feed. See several thrilling attractions but unfortunately no have enough time to try it, I think need a full day to have all.I went on july, the weather so hot almost no wind. Don't forget to bring a hat, sunglasses, mini fan, and some change clothes (there's attraction could make wet and the hot weather)"
"Lot's of entertainment, animal shows- dolphins, sea lions, etc.Circus parade is fun too. Avoid 5D theater with small kids- under 6-7 years old-(can get scared easily) or elderly with heart problems. Food options a little limited, but it's OK for one day."
A simple theme park with not much attraction. Do not compare it with Disneyland. However it is stil ok for my kids to have fun. Tried the motorcycle speed racing which is fun. There is no queue when I visit this theme park probably due to outside holiday season. Enjoy the circus in the evening right beside the theme park which is fun and entertaining
It was fun to see the three rare whale sharks in the huge aquarium. Make sure you have comfortable shoes on and avoid the summer hot season.
"Compared to the other Chimelong theme park this is average. It does have the world's biggest aquarium but limited outside of that- some rides. Are good but the lingering vision of attic wolves running around a room smaller than my lounge room is disturbing, with the brown bears kept outside in the macau humidity extremely sad.There is slot of animals but generally they crammed into smaller areas was not good..  Okay but not must do- crowds when we visited on a Saturday were okay. Limited queueibg"
"Chimelong ocean kingdom is a big big park featuring an aquarium / polar bears / beluga / penguin / dolphins and many rides just to name a few. Situated in Zhuhai it is easily accessible from Macau or Hong Kong.Everything is huge here. The aquarium was excellent and had 4 whale sharks there on our visit. Other exhibits were also very good. We did not try the rides as there were too many people and queues were very long. At the entrance there is a huge ceiling tv (not sure what to call it) which is stunning.Food is rather expensive, we had 4 burgers that totaled about $30. Also forget about coming here on holidays or weekends as it is packed with people and queues for everything is very long."
Like1. Beluga Whale show2. Whale shark exhibit3. Soaring eagle roller coaster4. Parade5. Polar Express Water CoasterDislike1. No enough shade2. Retail was not interesting
"Ocean Kingdom is a unique place. The ""sea"" theme is strong with top level sea animal shows (Beluga whales, Dolphins, more), and numerous animal exhibits (Penguin one was poor and needed an overhaul, seemed older than others, and the Polar bear and Brown bear exhibits do not meet ethical treatment of animal standard: they were sad).  They have some delightful top rate rollercoasters and other attractions (Parrot Coaster is the biggie). Excellent staff with clearly strong management skills being deployed - it's clear they have learned a LOT about park operations and are working at a high level.  Lots of areas for kids to do added activities that had educational value.  The 5D theater was fun, with a high quality film...but the characters in the story are their own and have modest appeal. Not on the level of a Mickey or any Disney character.   The float parade was quite nice, but we left before the grand finale fireworks - due to rain. All said, it's a day well spent - lots to do, well maintained, well organized. Treat yourself and stay at the Hengqin Bay Palace hotel...and you'll have a great one-two day outing.  The resort pools will keep you occupied for a second day."
A big complex with rides and shows. It is said it should take about 2 days to go around the complex. I think one day is enough. Plenty of things for kids to do. U can hire a buggy for 100rmb for the day leaving 200rmb deposit. Travelling during the week is less crowded. Big disappointment were the restaurants just mainly canteen dishes with high prices. Nothing special. There is no western style dish like Shrimp with fries I was hoping for. After Zhuhai being a port I thought they would have more variety of different Sea food dishes.
Went on a Sunday and wasn't too crowded. Waited around 10 minutes for the roller coaster and log flume which were both really good. The aquarium is impressive. The shows I saw were a bit slow but worth catching. I thought CNY380 per adult was a bit too much though. Once you're in the food is bad and expensive (CNY 60-80 for a bit of fast food). If you can get a better deal on tickets it's worth a go.
"Lovely aquarium and animals on display. However this park was eerily empty even during holiday season - with most of their customers coming from tour groups. Unfortunately our visit was soured by the exceptionally rude staffs at the entrance. Having purchased our tickets at their Chimelong hotel we stayed at, the entrance staff had initially refused us entry as we had apparently breached their park rules - by purchasing the wrong tickets and demanded to know where we had bought it! They're not very inviting to foreign customers. Be very wary if you wish to go..."
The Chimelong Ocean Kingdom is one of the best presented and well maintained parks I have been to. This is a theme park offering the best aquarium and fantastic themed rides and zoo all at one location. I suggest you go early if you want to try and see it all. It is suitable for all ages. If you are game try the unbelievable roller coaster - just over 1km long in under 2 minutes. Try in during the day then again after dark WOW.Be assured it will take you all day to enjoy and appreciate this park and if time permits stay for the fireworks and show at 8.30 pm.As I said just fantastic.
"Went on a Thursday afternoon. 10 min wait tops for all the roller coasters.  Overall facility was big, clean, and entertaining."
"There has been so much hype about the place. Went there to check out. Firstly weather yesterday was super hot. Admission fee also expensive CNY 450 per adult for ocean kingdom and CNY 550 for theatre. This is excluding hotel accommodation which is easily CNY 2000 and above. A day + night stay there with family will easily cost close to CNY 10K including food and transport, if you are to cover both ocean kingdom, theatre and lions gate! Not many can afford and I don’t think it’s worth the money."
