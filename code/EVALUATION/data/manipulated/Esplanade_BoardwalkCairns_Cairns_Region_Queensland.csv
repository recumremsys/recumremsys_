"Great stroll along the boardwalk, many restaurants to dine at. viewing platforms to take photos. Good for morning walks and jogging."
"Beautiful boardwalk by the water with lovely views of the ocean, wildlife and rain forest. Have a drink at buddy's and watch the world go by"
This is a pleasant walk with shady trees and water views. Shared traffic so watch out for others on bicycles and the like. Plenty of places to eat and drink close at hand.
"Wandering down this beautifully created esplanade boardwalk in the morning was so relaxing. Birds, wildlife, ocean and people taking the critters for morning walks too."
"Great place to get outside and breath in the fresh sea air. It is a lovely walk along the esplanade right at the cities front door. Stop in at Muddies for fish and chips on your way back, you won’t be disappointed!"
"Live the Cairns esplanade . Always something to see, lots of people, great swimming in the lagoon, and heaps of choices along the front for food."
"Great place to stroll along. Lots of restaurants on one side. Walk along and stop at one of the mini outdoor gyms to a mini work out. Benches to sit and look out to sea and warch the world go by. There is a good area for children to play safely.  At the end nearer to the Marina, there is a fair sized pool area. It has a beach area and the pool has a depth area too. It can get a little busy.Early morning and early evening are the best times to go."
"Great trails, playgrounds and beautiful gardens. Groundskeeping at the best level.  Great for families but pleasant for all."
"Having a nicely done walkway along the ocean is great, with a grassy stretch next to it. I’ve lived in beach towns that could’ve been so much better if they had had something like this."
"Easy, flat walk.  Plenty of shade if needed.  Good to see families enjoying themselves with lots to do.  Loved tbe landscaping which was well maintained.  Close access to the  city  centre"
"Loved the Cairns esplanade boardwalk.  Beautifully kept and quite clean. Great to see families using the facilities such as BBQ and lagoon.  Many others walking, running and enjoying."
"This was a lovely spot to walk and wind down after being in the car. Was lovely to see so many people enjoying the walk, lots of playgrounds and no rubbish"
Taking a walk along the esplanade is beautiful here in Cairns. Lovely breeze off the water and a nice gentle walk. Perfect any time of the day
Great restaurants along the esplanade. Walking along the beach front is nice. Take a swim in the pool or grab a drink over the road. The esplanade has abit of everything. Great view of hills
So much to see and do here. Loads of places to eat and drink. Spotless barbecue areas all free. Loads of play areas for kids plus the pool for free. Buzzing at night as well as day.
"Walking along this boardwalk, day or night is spectaculars. You not only get to see the myriad of restaurants along the sea front but also get to walk along the seaside surrounded by park and a great walking path. It is well lit at night time and is a perfect place to stroll and absorb the beauty of this city."
"Loved the stunning pool at the entrance.  We were there during the Cairns Festival, great atmosphere and enjoyed the street artists and other special events"
"Lovely place to exercise or just people watch. Go on the weekend for the little market, so much to see and jump in the open pools if you want. Beautiful."
"A great place to walk, run, swim, eat, watch pelicans or relax. Great place for all ages. Loved Muddys place playground for the little ones. Tennis courts, scate park are close buy"
Lovely esplanade with plenty to see and do. Relaxed and well kept - our family enjoyed it every night in Cairns.
"Such a spectacular Boardwalk. Walking North from the Pier to the right past the mud flats we see the deep Chanel with a variety of small and large craft motoring by. Along the balustrade are descriptive plaques describing the different species of bird life inhabiting the area. To the left we have the spectacular lagoon with its water sculptures and variety of bathing areas. Further along we have beautiful tropical gardens, amazing sculptures then Muddies playground. This is an experience in itself. Past Muddies, we pass tennis courts and an amazing skate park.The Boardwalk is one of the finest I have experienced and is popular with visitors and tourists alike!"
"A walk along the boardwalk is not only good exercise for all ages it is also an excellent opportunity to take in the the atmosphere of the waterfront of Cairns, including the people. The mud flats may not seem interesting but a close look shows many animals and there is a resident population of pelicans. Walked along sections at different times of the day and night - all very enjoyable"
"I loved going for walks, sit and read a book.  This is a wonderful place for any age group to hang around.  Loved it."
"Went to the markets held here, only small market but interesting. The boardwalk is amazing and well planned, great infinity pool and picnic area for everyone, we also went on the ferris wheel,$10 pretty good value. Great day out"
Nice walk along the beach.  Lots of little stands/kiosks with jewelry hats etc.  Saw some pelicans.  Easy walk from hotel
"Walking the Esplanade Boardwalk was a wonderful experience.  It was romantic, it was for families, it was for friends.  It really could be everything to everyone.  And it was wonderful to see the number of people using it, and using it with respect (I didn't see litter, I saw people cleaning up after using the public grills in the adjacent park area), I saw families and groups of teens enjoying the swimming area.  I liked the public art and memorials."
Nice setting to enjoy an morning or afternoon walk.  Walk a little or a lot. Watch the pelicans and crabs as you pass by.
"Lovely walk, taking in scenery and wildlife (pelican s, mini crabs and small fish). Seen occasional helicopter landing and taking off."
Been a while since I had been there but great investment by city in a walkable area. nice restaurants and bars as well
"Took a night walk. Weather was perfect. Some activities was happening. People having fun, running and exercising. Lights were bright but enough to create a beautiful atmosphere."
"A really nice afternoon walk with great vistas. Take a walk along the esplanade around 5-630pm stopping off for a glass or two of wine from one of the many restaurants, bars and hotels on the way."
Nice little walk to enjoy the view. Recommended if you’re a first timer and even if you’re not......
Fantastic for walking and having a drink and bite to eat. Very enjoyable. Walked all day with plenty to see and do.
Strolled along the board walk mid to early morning. Very peaceful and quite. Lots of restaurants etc.
Landing in Cairns this is the first place you must see.  Don’t miss the displays of local history and geography or the pelicans on the beach.
