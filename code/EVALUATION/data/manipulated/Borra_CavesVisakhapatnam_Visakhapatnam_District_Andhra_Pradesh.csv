"Must visit place on Araku tour, Place which has great beauty within.Age old people be cautious as there are many steps to climb and get down. Do carry the camera with you to capture wonderful nature creation. Before entering the caves get your food ordered as you will very hungry after the visit.The charges for an adult is Rs 60, Child is 40 and 100 for Camera.Do carry a mobile with touch light only then you can capture the beauty of the caves."
"The caves are excellent and amazing. Well maintained and are extremely beautiful. U can get best pictures inside the caves. I would advise each of you to carry water bottles while entering caves. And discharge yourself and become free before entering caves because it would be extremely difficult once you enter the cave. You need to come back all the way just to urinate urself. In case if you are non-vegetarian, never forget to eat bamboo chicken there. It is the one of my favourite dish till date. The taste is amazing and will be cherished by you throughout your lifetime. Initially we ordered one kg of bamboo chicken. It was so delicious that we dint even think of next minute and ordered another kg. You can have it with roti or can have it like a starter. You will remember that chicken more than the cave. You feel that walking after long way is after all worthy. Try to order chicken before entering cave because it takes one hour of time to cook. So after returning you can enjoy the food."
It is one of the most popular sight seeing attraction with attractive colourful lightning and one can go deep inside the caves. It has water too so very small kids n elderly should be a bit careful or don't go far inside. Though I feel it's hyped...one visit can be made if one is around. Drive from #vizag to araku valley is quite picturesque though.
Named as andhra ooty where naturally formed shiva lingam and caves. A must see nature caves and near by waterfalls
The Borra cave is a huge cave which is located at a very nice spot. You can enter the cave on your own and there are also guided tours. The area around the cave is also nice and you can walk around. There are a lot of monkeys! Be careful with your bags.
"Experience the energy and depth underneath created naturally over years, you can see many sculptures and artwork through natural deposition of limestone & water seeping through it. Hire a guide, costing about Rs. 100/-You can pass crawling through a narrow passage at end of the caves reaching almost halfway back, only with your guide."
This is a very big caves which is almost 500 m deep inside. Made of Calcium deposit which makes it very nice.
"Very important point. Don't visit this place without a guide. Guide will explain you the different formation of the stalagmites happened from Limestone. He will show you the different shapes of the rock like, Shiv Parvati statue, Hanuman Foot print, Tiger and many ore things which formed naturally. Without guide you will understand anything.The guide charge is very nominal, only Rs. 150. So it's best recommended to visit this place with guide. Also different colorful lights are provided to see those structures and shapes formed naturally. Everyone will enjoy. Not suitable for old people. Because needs to climb down lots of stairs."
"The borra caves is one of the most popular destinations in arku valley. The cave is like an adventure for a beginner like me. Its never ending and full of surprises at each step.Its dark but lit with fancy lights inside.Be careful while you walk, its slippery.Photographs can be taken inside with instant print facilityWe however, asked the camera man to click us with our own camera an paid him an agreed amount..Things to do-1.Wear slip resistant shoes (since water is slippery inside the cave)2. Lot of walking involved, so pre plan the meals 3. Camera inside is chargeable4. Don't give up, its long but worth it5. mobile light will be  a great helpI have a full video based on my experience and preview of this, you can watch it on Youtube - Khushi NotOnlyMakeup"
1. Unique place.2. Very well maintained.3. More than 300 stairs to climb. So patients with kee problem and the elderly to take precaution.4. Well lit with beautiful colours.5. Stalactites and Stalagmites at its shining glory !!!!6. LACK OF GOOD RESTAURANTS AROUND. SO CARRY OWN FOOD. 01 RESTAURANT IA THERE BUT NOT WORTH AS FOOD IS LIMITED. MORE OF A CANTEEN.7. Must try the Bamboo chicken at the Parking area. Its expensive at Rs 500 for 1 Kg. But for 1 time its worth a try. Tastes really good.8. Bamboo cut beer glasses were a special novelty i saw here. Picked up 6 Large Bamboo beer mugs.9. Better to go in the non summer months. However even in summer months inside the cave is amazingly cool !!!!
Go in evening times. Resound and depth of cave is highlight.Different colors will attract everyone .
This is a natural wonder in araku valley. Well connected by road as well as rail. Try to reach here early morning as place become crowded later. It takes more than 2-3 hours to explore the cave. Though the cave is very much safe and secure but aged people may face some difficulty as there are many steps  inside the cave. However many old person and young ones were seen very excited and didn't reflect any tiredness
these are ancient caves and is easy to access from railway station. going to Borra caves by train also wonderful experience.
"Been to this place with family (6 adults 1infant). There was very long queue for tickets but we managed to get them within 5minutes with the help of an employee from 'Haritha APTDC hotel' which is right beside the enterance. December to January this place is Jam paked.Greenary and view around/before entering the caves is very pleasant.Inside the caves... It's all natural rock formation. Tourism department has made way to go through these rocks. There many steps inside, it could be difficult for elder citizens to walk around the entire place. Few places are highlighted by colorful focus lights for attracting visitors. Tollywood fans can correlate few movie scenes shooted there.APTDC hotel was very crowded. There were many stalls across the road between parking place to Borra caves, selling coconut water, sugar cane, bamboo chicken, herbs, toys, etc. So we chose to eat bongu lo chicken (bamboo chicken) in one of the stalls.All stalls have same and fixed price, 280â‚¹/500gm Taste wise it was like a regular chicken masala fry. They make it spicy upon request. Definitely not worth the cost for people from Andhrapradesh and Telangana. Non locals might find it different from regular."
Visited this cave in October 2018. It was a nice and eerie experience visitng the caves. The cave was dark and illuminated by colourful lights.  This cave is the main attraction of Araku. The tribal museum and botanical gardens are not worth of a visit and is just time waste.
It is a place we have to see. Youngsters can go till the end of the caves as i am 55+  I went half the way and sat down there to admire the caves. Feeling sad I was not able to go further down.
"I visited here along with my family. There is free road side parking almost 500 meters from ticket counter. There is small open place as well near road where you can easily park your vehicle as well. So parking is not a problem.There are many shops selling all knick knacks, tender coconuts, Araku coffee powder and Bamboo chicken within that 500 meters from parking to ticket counter. There is OTDC hotel near ticket counter where you get few breakfast items and veg limited meals for Rs.100The security allows only water inside caves. Food items are not allowed. Once you enter inside you will find washrooms on left side. From here the steps are present to descend into cave, if you want a guide then you need to approach someone sitting with torch with them (yes they are guides and you need to approach them). The guide will take Rs.150 for exploring entire cave in 1 hour.The steps are easy ones to descend. The cave is divided in two section, the guide will show you all sorts of shapes and sizes formed on rocks naturally. He will also show you different sort of stones and surfaces formed inside this cave. There is good and colourful lights inside which makes these caves looks more beautiful. There is ancient Shiva temple at one place where you need to climb some 30-40 steps to reach, very old peoples with knee pain and pregnant ladies should not do it. There is ample amount of place to sit inside the cave and relax. There are some professional photographers available inside the cave as well. Exploring entire cave will take hardly 1 to 1.30 hours. The climbing or walking inside is not at all hectic, everyone can do it. The cave is not at all slippery or watery, it has good floors and railing along the pathway. No need to carry/wear comfortable shoes or anything as been adviced by some people in TripadvisorAll in all a good natural cave formation which can be explored in relax way with the help of guide. Go with your family, friends and dear ones to see this amazing cave."
Borra caves is a must visit attraction on your way to Araku valley but plz avoid weekends and holidays as it is too crowded.. senior citizen with knee problem and with kids it is difficult to climb. They charge tckt for mobile phone camera also and no bags are allowed inside. Keep it in the locker or in your car
"It is stated to be 150 million years old , naturally formed caves .The government has laid out safe steps for people to climb down and up within the caves  , provided hand rails at all places for safety . Elderly people can think of carrying their walking stick for a comfortable walking inside the caves .It is wonderfully presented to the visiting public with attractive lighting arrangements and audio explanations given through speakers kept at number of places .It is a unique experience going through the caves which you will remember for long time . I was reminded of Batu caves in Malaysia while Visiting this cave There is a small suyambu Sivalingam in the cave which has religious significance. That was the highlight of my trip to Borra caves and made it an extremely worthy visit . Climb very carefully through the steps here as the steps very small and steep."
visited borra cave and enjoyed a lot. Please please hire guide to take you and show you properly. It's great to know the history and details of the cave.
"As the name suggest, it's the caves with hole at the top of hill. Starting from top, these natural caves extends up to bottom of the valley, where a river is flowing. The caves are now well developed by the government with properly constructed steps and colourful lightning. The history of the cave is based on mythological story.Worth to visit for unique experience.Be prepared for steep hiking to enjoy this place at the fullest."
"a very different experience , a must visit place in arakku valley tour. steps go down inside the cave and the senior people may find it difficult to climb back.  Recommended for others, dont miss the naturally formed limestone caves"
Visited as part of Araku Valley tour package. Very beautiful formations near Vizag but was unaware of how deep the descent is and the steps are somewhat moist due to the cave environment. There are signs not to carry snacks near the caves as the local monkeys will swoop in and take them- saw some tourists ignore the warning and saw the monkeys' action live!! Enjoyed going here a lot.
Good for one visit. To much crowd. Climbing stairs could be much of a task so if with kids try not to go very far inside the caves.
While travelling to Araku one should give atleast 2-3 hours in Borra Caves. Its approx 90kms from Vizag and 27 kms from Araku. One can travel by road or by Train to Borra Caves. The train station is approx few meters from the cave. Avoid visiting from 1-2PM when there is lunch break and visitors are not allowed to enter during this time. Sol plan accordingly ensuring no time wastage. APTDC restaurant is just beside the entry gate and one can have meals during this break.
"Borra caves is a spot on the road to Araku valley from Vizag. consist of large underground cave system where amazing formations. Groups of visitors have to pass through designated routes starting from the entrance to the exit , witnessing the stalactites and stalagmites illuminated by lighting. Those with knee problem may find it tough going."
"Recommend you take the time to go and visit the caves. Lots of monkeys around also. The area was very clean. One of the cleanest tourist sites ive been to visit here. Toilets were clean, no western toilet but was fine"
A great experience. A natural formation and worth a visit atleast once. Takes about 1-2 hours for entire visit inside.
"One of the best caves formed with stalagmites and stalactites , that you may probably find in the world. The expanse is daunting and it's a wonderful geological experience.However , we went in November which is Karthik masam . This month is supposedly the month of picnics in AP . It was overcrowded with school & college kids. The pandemonium created was not just because of the number of people but the heart wrenching cries & shouts that these visitors were emitting . They may be doing it in sheer joy of shouting but the effect that it created was quite horrific. The entire beauty of the caves were completely undermined by these cries , shouts which is sufficient to make a weak heart die. I somehow did not like the melodramatic lighting . It would have been nice if a more suitable colour hue were chosen rather than shades of pink , red , green etc . It made it look like puja pandal in a crowded Kolkata streets. Inspite of the artificial ness , the caves are beautiful . The stairs are also nice in most of the places . Without the religion flavour also , it can be a beautiful place to visit.The river Gosthani.flows out from these caves. Spend a good time in the surrounding as well. Do not miss the bamboo chicken if you are a non veg."
Visited the Borra Caves today with family.  Was delighted to visit the natural caves. The lighting has surely improved the beauty of the spot. Needs about an hour and half to have a good well paced tour. The caves are well ventilated (naturally) and one can spot various scriptures depending on ones imagination. A good attraction just about 90 Km from the city. Well maintained by the AP Tourism department.
"This one is a must visit place. For those who have visited other hill stations, Arakku has nothing much to offer. On the contrary, Borra caves has everything to offer. It is a massive cave and is around 100 million years old. I'd visited this place in 1992 and again now, in Oct 2018. Way back then, the cave was pitch dark barring the opening. The guide used to use 'mashaal' those days to show us the path. Things have changed drastically now. There is lot of lighting within the cave and nothing appears to be scary. This cave is very tall and wide and has many stalagtite and stalagmite formations. Too many bats within, but nothing to be scared of. take a guide. They usually charge around 100/-, but worth it. if you plan to take mobile phones inside, you need to pay another 25/- per mobile. Entry ticket is quite pricey these days. You do not have good hotels there. We are vegetarians and had absolutely no options. Fo non veg, they do cook something called bamboo chicken.you do get tender coconut water. Do take the train from Vizag to Borra caves. Train starts from Vizag at 6:50 am from platform number 6 or 7. You will come across many tunnels which kids will enjoy. In the return direction also there is a passenger train which comes from Kirandul to Vizag and is supposed to reach Borra caves at 4:48 pm but it reached at 6:45 pm and reached Vizag at 11:05, the train invariably gets delayed. That is one negative point. But, as i mentioned, train + caves is a feast overall. There are 3 sections to this cave and the 3rd section involves adventure where people would have to crawl through narrow crevices to come out near river Gosthani. This one would need the assistance of a guide and they take people on this trip only if there is a group of size 10 members and this takes 2 hours it seems"
"Borra Caves should be covered during daytime. Visiting Borra caves  after sunset is waste of time. We visited through APTDC package and they Borra caves at 6 pm. So we were unable to enjoy. But I stayed for 1 hour inside the cave, it is nothing as great as heard from various sources."
"Trip to Borra caves was main attraction of our vacation to Araku valley. Generally when someone talks about caves, you get a picture of small caves. Borra caves are really really huge and has many mini to big caves that you would even imagine. My family thoroughly (from my 3 years old daughter to us) enjoyed walking into the huge caves. We took a guide @ Rs. 100, he told us complete history of cave and beautiful formation crated by dripping water since millions of years. My recommendation is to take a local guide for the tour, otherwise you would not be able to appreciate the beauty of this natural structure.Cave is well maintained and lit with artificial colorful lights on Key formations of limestone structures. Exactly on top of cave Railway line passes through. There is 100 feet hill between railway line and the cave. It was interesting to see a naturally made cave pillars with millions of years of water drops. We have also seen a few Cave pillars under formation. Cave has shiny stones, which is due to limestone and marble. Guide showed us a human brain type looking structure formed due to water drops. Many areas of cave are closed for general visitor. There was a part of cave where it is full honey bees and therefore closed. A 50 feed Part of cave where you can come out of cave by crawling. In order to do this adventure, you need to be fit, thin and need a guide. Generally this place is closed for general visitors. Few more caves in here explored recently and found to be 50-100 feet long (Guide showed us one at the roof of the main cave). There were hanging ropes and stairs to climb up cave explorers.  Who should visit: It is advisable to visit with Kids above 6-7 years for educational purpose. My 9 yrs old son thoroughly enjoyed the views inside the cave. He found some small places to trek, instead of taking stairs (essentially good place if you have monkey type kids ;-)). Along with this guide made it interesting, he showed many Animal shaped formations (lion, crocodile, elephant) via natural stones and water drops. This kept the kids engaged through out the tour of cave. Elder people having issues with Knees etc may find it very exhausting. You need to 250 feet deep and then 500 feet walk inside the cave. Presence of monkeys is good attraction for kids. But you need to be careful if you or kids are carrying any eatables in their hands. Food: Before reaching caves, there is Bengali Bhojnalay. They offer good Bamboo Veg and Chicken biryani. You need to order while going and can have delicious biryani on the way back, when you are completely drained out of your batteries. This is small restaurant but tasty food. We are veg people enjoyed the food, I am sure Non-veg guys will relish it more (Adding picture of the same in my pics). I had a local driver from Araku, who informed me about this place. Looking at the restaurant we were skeptical about taste, so we ordered just 1 biryani, which we regretted later. There is an APTDC restaurant there but we didn't try it. Cleanliness: Overall approach road to cave is clean. Toilets are well maintained. You won't find garbage here and there. How to reach: We traveled via train to Araku and stayed there. We took at local cab and driver to Borra caves. Local driver also partially acted as a guide ;-)."
Hundreds of years of old Staligmite(linestone) caves first identified in British time BORRA caves are very famous in Andhra Pradesh. Authorised guides are available on payment who explains better.very good canteens are present for different food options.best for day trip.
"14km from Jungle Bells (APTDC), TYDA, this place is a must visit for any traveler to Vizag/Araku. Naturally formed cave consisting of Stalactites and Stalagmites, beautified by using multi-colour lights. It would take around 1hr to completely navigate through it although the natural ShivLing has a long queue, especially during peak season. ShivLing darshan is not recommended for old people or people with knee problem as the stairs are pretty steep and narrow. Overall, an awesome experience.Note: This place comes under probable Naxalite activities. You will find armed personnel patrolling the entry gate, dont get afraid by the guns. Before planning a visit, please check out with your tour operator if it is open."
