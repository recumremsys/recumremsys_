"It is not exactly a fort, it was built to protect Amber fort. It is famous as it houses the world's largest cannon on wheels, Jaivana. But not just this, it gives exceptional views of the Aravalli mountains and the city. There is a tunnel from Amber fort to this fort which is accessible, so it is easier to reach. Do visit if you have time and enjoy the views with less crowd.Also a song from Salman khan,s latest movie Dabbang 3 was shot here."
"This fort holds one of the biggest cannons of the world which was only used once. Considered a strategic fort which housed the battalion of the Amber, this one is rugged and battle hardened and the phenomenal view of Jaipur is visible from here."

"Located up higher from Amber Fort, this military fort has a tunnel connect to Amber fort. But we did go there on our car. Jaigarh Fort is quite big with wide area. One to see is the biggest cannon on wheel. But the other interesting is on the other side, the fort and palace‚Ä¶"
Jaigarh fort is the other way of Nahargarh Fort. Has a beautiful view and has a lot of plants everywhere. This is mainly known for a rooftop and it's view of the city.
This fort was built atop a hill to defend Amer fort and houses the largest canon named Jaivan. The huge walls surrounding it and Nahargarh form the defense system for the living quarters of Amer fort. It is really fascinating to study the architecture and the strong defense mechanism. Must visit along with Amer and Nahargarh forts to have comprehensive view. Carry sufficient water as one gets thirsty after walking.
This huge rambling fort is one of the most impressive in Rajasthan. might equals right and this fort was built to protect. the small holes to pour boiling water in the enemy are still notably there as are the slits for firing bows and arrows. any marauder who could break into this citadel would be tough and wily indeed. Jaigar is less busy than the other nearby but it is infinitely interesting. allow an hour or two to wander about and take in the atmosphere oh and dont forget to check the worlds biggest cannon that can hurl the 22 lb cannon balls an incredible 30-40 km!
This is still maintained by the royal family of Jaipur which was actually a army fort of then Jaipur kingdom. Located at the top of amer city.
the place looks used to be very good and connectivity from amer fort. now everything has been ruined and only jai canon is there. spend good 10 minutes as tick box item
"Visited Jaigarh fort and it was worth it. It is better than Nahargarh fort because of less crowd. One can buy the car pass and take your car right upto the fort canon. Luckily, it was cloudy and not hot which made my visit more memorable."

It's a fort on a hill top and 2as used to house the soldiers. The palace is about 2km away and was meant to keep the palace safe.

"Jaigarh Fort on the Aravalli Hills overlooking Jaipur was built by the royals. Besides its strategic importance and picturesque setting there are three major things that one needs to see and enjoy.(1) The water harvesting system built by the royals hundreds of years before stands to this day. The 3 reservoirs and canal system, its water purification technique, coolness of drinking water and the slope made for the water to flow is remarkable even to the standards of our modern times. The storage capacity of 2.3 crore litre of water could provide clean and good drinking water to a population of 10,000 for a complete 365 days. Just remarkable.(2) The fort houses the 'World's Biggest Cannon' weighing 250 tonnes and one required 4 elephants to turn it. Surviving hundreds of years, there is no corrosion. And the scientific technique of the pond at its back so that incase the cannon ball back fired, it would fall in the pond of water and the people igniting the rope laced with gunpowder could jump in the pond to save their eardrums bursting from the cannon fire sound.(3) The 'Multani Mitti' thin sarees available in the shop selling artifacts and leather items, clothes, souvenirs, footwear is a must to visit and purchase some Jaipur memories souvenir.Advisable : Hire a government approved guide and definitely carry a camera to capture the moments which you will relish. A Rs.70 ticket entitles you the entry."
