"Advise anyone to visit Teleferik nice views area, people are very friendly. There so many sovereign items to buy it. View on top of mountains were clear no winds to scare anyone."
"We took a dolmus from our hotel and it cost 2,50TL a person ( close to the big mall ) we climbed out right at the cable car. Tickets cost 35TL a person. The cable car takes a total of 25 minutes to reach the top, half way up you get out and walk through a small shopping complex you also go outside and can go on one of the snow mobile rides at 200 TL a person. Lovely hotels and photo opportunity walking in the trees. You then catch the second part of the ride up to the top, there are a total of 140 cars that arrive every 19 seconds, the cable car transports a total of 1500 people per hour. Each car holds 8 people. At the top you can walk through some more shops, have a coffee ( 10tl ) or salep. The Bof hotel is amazing ( African decor ) with a big fireplace inside and wifi. Going gown you take the same route and when you get out at the bottom you can purchase pictures thru have taken of you or have a quick Starbucks"
Bursa it is the nice place in winter to see the snow but sometimes u just loose the whole days if u go with a tour people bxuz they stopped u so many places to buy things and they will get the commission . By the time u reached there it is almost no time to have fun..
"Amazing place on top of Uludag mountain where you can enjoy the fresh air & beautiful stunning views. , Teleferik prices are reasonable , restaurants & restrooms available . Must visit . Enjoy . NK"
One should go up and see Uludag by this Bursa Teleferik. Was comfy and affordable. The view was great
Do you know? Bursa “Teleferik” cablecar is the longest in the world?From 150 meters to 1800 meters altitude and 9 km.
Come and enjoy the Teleferik during winter.. absolutely amazing. Ticket price is affordable and the place is good for family
If you are familiar with cable track you have to ride this one. About 8 km for me the longest I have ever entered. Amazing view and at the end a nice place with Sone hotels and restaurants. Don’t forget to bring a jacket it can be chilly in the mountain
A must when in Istanbul and easy access from the city via ferry from port takes 2 hours to get to Bursa. Leave really morning and in March snow was still 1meter deep.
"Best way to reach Uludağ Mountain (hotels, ski pistes etc). Nice scenery except watching how the overgrown Bursa occupies once fertile plains. Good for families but nıt for trill seekers. Be sure to check wind before heading to Teleferik station."
It was a nice experience to try Bursa Teleferik. The view was amazing. The service in the two stop stations are good and you can find all your needs. Recommended to try it when you visit Bursa.
I really want to use it. When come I saw big queue. Waited 45 minutes to buy a ticket. Fortunately I could. BUT maybe 500 people were waiting telefirik:)))AmazingNice lady who has blonde hair and blue eyes helped me and gave my money back. Employee are perfectAtmosphere is badIt's your decision for wait or not
"If you are staying in Bursa city centre look out for bus with 'teleferik' written on electronic screen and timetable available at most bus stops. On arrival pay a small fee of 35tl which is well worth it. The cable car itself is clean and spacious, can accommodate up to 8 people sitting. The ride up is slow with lovely city views.You stop at first station where you can get off or continue further up to ski centre. At first station is numerous restaurants and self buy meat and barbecue restaurant which I found super awesome. The second ride takes you upto hotels and ski centre where one can hire equipment and have some serious fun. Please note they do have closing times depending on weather and if you arrive late just before closing time it's very very congested. Wear appropriate clothing and shoes for snow as it's not easy to walk and one can get seriously injured.Enjoy"
"great experience fun for the whole family.  Was nice, modern, clean & very well organized.  We arrived at the top of the mountain after enjoying the breath taking view along the ride & had self-BBQ in the 1st restaurant up there.  Food was great & the Turkish tea was amazing.  It's worth the trip up there"
It is one of the places that you should not miss when visiting Bursa. The round trip cost LT38 for the adult but really worth the long trip excitement.There is three stages that you go through to be at an elevation around 1800m. Be ready for the cold weather with proper dressing. It is highlly recommended to have your lunch on one of the resturant when you reach the top to enjoy it with the nice wither. My whole family really enjoyed it and found it as the best spot in Bursa
"The view is amazing. The trip itself goes for about 25 minutes (round trip there and back). The cabins themselves are clean and sturdy. A nice experience.The price of tickets are a bit expensive for what it provides. Being out of snow season there is not much to do once you arrive at the peak. It has a bunch of deserted shops, piles of rubbish, construction, no real sitting or viewing area(s) and a lot of overpriced items (a handful of which are actually relevant to Uludag itself).You do get a nice view of Uludag in the distance (a bit further away that you would expect).It has parking on site (for a fee)."
Quite beautiful and one of the few touristy things to do in Bursa.Went up at 4pm down at 5pm.30 Lira (about $10) to go up the gondola and back down.  Had hot snacks when we arrived at the top as it naturally gets colder at the top of the mountain.
"dont miss the telefrik one of the best things to do in bursa , great view. enjoy the ride to the top"
"The road may be tiring if you go from Istanbul taking the ido from yenikapi ferry as early as possible to catch an early trip Where a taxi we preordered was waiting for us after a 2 hour trip.We went to many places which were regular like silk market or the bursa Bazzar ( same as Istanbul) then went to the teleferik regular ticket for 38 litra the whole round trip. Reaching a staggering 3400 m of fresh air and activities like ATV and hiking. The trip up was wonderful , trees surrounding the area .Best part was going back we stopped at the station went out and sat a restaurant in the woods where you can cook your own food and was delicious.Was an excellent get away from the Istanbul traffic."
"The cable car is quite long, with 1400m elevation change. Went only to the second station (from three available) as the last one is for skiing and I was not equipped for that. The ride was very stable, and the view is great, although anti-haze technology could be added to the window so we can see clearly from the cubicle."
View is amazing. The ride is smooth.  Gives you a very good perspective of the city and mountains. Prices are different for tourists and Turkish citizen.
Visited in the winter with family and had a great experience of the winter cold.Very clean and ready to help people around the shopping areas. The Syrian restaurant at the Base outside is a must visit.
"The cable car ride is the highlight.  It is a long ride and that was only up to the first station.  Bring warm clothes if you get cold easily.   We saw a restaurant there that looks like fun where you grill your own meal and the BBQ Grill Set is set beside the table.  I thought that looked fun and smelled good. Up in the mountain is really relaxing, take time to stroll and enjoy the fresh air and do not get distracted with the shopping.  PS.  Note they have a VIP ticket which you can cut the line and you do not have to share your cable car ride.  So for those who are strict on staying in line.  Do not jump on anyone here for not falling in line."
Do not miss this. The cost is 35tl for a return ticket and is well worth it. The views are amazing and there are restaurants at each of the stages. To go to the very top takes 45mins but there is currently a stop about 2/3rds of the way up. They were building another stop when we went up. You need to change cars at the 2/3 stop but it is all included in the ticket price. If you come to Bursa then this is a must!
Its a must go to attraction when in Bursa and make sure to go up all 3 stages.Once your up at the final stage youll know that it was worth every second in the cable car. Thw view is immaculate. I advise you to take the Fast Track ticket in order not to wait in line since its usually crowded & it costs 70TL total.As for the cafes & restaurant i tried the rest. in which there's a nargile and i do not advise eating there. The food was average & my nargile costed me more than my food it was a shock honestly.
Have been there to top mounting with teleferik in Sat. Arrival was at 9 so there were no ques. However in the evening around 5 pm the que was very very. Big and had to que twice for both teleferik stoppers. Avoid weekend or if no options than plan to leave as early S possible.
"Did a day trip from istanbul. Took a Budo ferry @830am from eminonu. Bought tickets a day earlier off Budo counter for 29Lira per pax. (One way) 2 hours ride. Once arrived, purchase bukart from the machine for 3.8lira and top up some amount to it. The yellow buses are right at the entrance so you cant miss it. Look out for 3/F for teleferik. 8lira for one way~ 45mins ride depending on traffic. (Fortunately at this timing there's no traffic) once at teleferik station purchase ticket from counter - 38Lira for a round trip. Unless you arrive early like we did (before 12pm) there will be a loooong queue to buy tix as well as to get on the cable cars. Worth waking up early to! You'll be blown away by the view! To return, you can take the same bus at the same point where you alighted ( please take note if you return after 3pm from here there will be traffic to get back to the pier- allow 1 and half hours for bus ride + waiting of bus arrival as they run on schedule."
Bought tickets for 95 lira for adults and 80 for children. Kids under 5 are free. Took the cable car up to the mountain ...magnificent views ....takes approximately 20 - 25 mins ...there are stops on the way ...pretty expensive to buy gifts at the stop off stations. When you get to the top or second station it's pretty cold take a warm jacket even though it was summer . City is bustling very clean and neat
It's suggested to spend a day in Bursa Telleferik. The cabins are clean and the view is excellent. You can use public transportation from city to there. You can see the whole Bursa from the top. Don't miss it.
"Very nice place, specially in winter. Make sure you are ready for cold weather. You must plan to visit"
The height of the mountain is 2200 meters. The view from top is stunning and beautiful. And when you reach the top you will freeez from the cold weather so you better wear sonething heavy. The time in the telefrik is around 20 minutes but its worth to spend the time. Loved it
"Perfect trip, wonderful view and lots of fun, it was my second time to visit bursa, the first time was during summer and this one was at Jan. and I've to admit. Winter is way better and much fun. snow wars, view is legendary and many activities to do during the trip. Don't forget to eat at ""Abo Shanab"" restaurant where you can grill the meat by yourself."
This is gonna be the most complete review about how you get to bursa teleferric i hope.  first you should go to yenikapi IDO terminal and take a ticket for 31 liras to bursa.  (i think there is same in eminonu terminal but I'm not sure)  the ticket is cheaper if you can buy online and you don't have to wait in line but it does not matter much because the line is not long for bursa. The ships are hourly but i recommend you go early because it's a long way and you need time to enjoy the very beautiful teleferric and catch the last ship for getting back to Istanbul. When you reached bursa buy a bursa cart and top it up with about 20tl for each person. You will get off the ship in bursa ferry terminal if you take IDO   ships or Mudanya terminal if you take BUDO ships. Anyway at both terminals you have to take buses with number GY1 (at bursa ferry terminal)  or M1 (at Mudanya)  to get to metro Emek station.  get off in Osman gazi station walk few minutes to bus station and get on bus number S2. It will take you to teleferric.  You can take the same way for return in the same way.  About two hours in ship and 1.5 hours to teleferric so it's kind of long way but if you like traveling on the blue sea and passing between olive trees  it will not make you tired. Teleferric ticket is 67 tl for adult. 130 tl especial ticket.( you don't have to wait in line and just your family in cabin) it takes 50 min to go and return if you don't want to stay up there for a while which i don't recommend. Hint: in the teleferric a Turkish woman told me there is bus from istanbul to bursa ans takes about 1.5 hours and 30 liras. But I'm not sure because of language barrier. Hint: exchange your money in istanbul you hardly can find a place in bursa. But shopping is much cheaper.
"If you are on an excursion from Istanbul to Bursa, then Bursa Teleferik is definitely scheduled on your trip. The green scenery while descending the teleferik was amazing. It's cold in May though, so be prepared with a jacket and do taste the buttered corn at the entrance of the teleferik as it's hot and yummy. Have fun!"
If you are in Bursa you must go up Uludag. Enjoy the view of Bursa from the cable car. Enjoy the cold weather on the mountain. Bring your jacket. Even if it's hot in Bursa but up on the mountain it will be cold. During winter people go for skiing.
