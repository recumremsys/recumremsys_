"Let me just say that this place is perfect. I visited it 3 or 4 times. Yes, because you should see how the statue looks in different day timings. I took a lot of amazing shots of the statue with my camera. You may do many things beside seeing the statue, of course you will pass by some other statues while going up there, but the most amazing thins is the green field around it. You can go there for a walk around the trees and stay for a while to enjoy a good weather. I stayed there to watch the sunset, seeing all the light reflections on the statue. I was lucky I went there on a cloudy day, so my photos looks just perfect. At night it looks wonderful too. Guess what?! This statue is tall enough and located in a very special place, that is why you can see it from everywhere in the city, while you are in the bus, driving your car, coming to the city by train, or taking a walk in a very far field. I was able to see it from a hill behind Volgograd University."
"If your in the area this is one you can not miss. This overlooks the city and stands out on the city skyline. Arrive in the early morning and enjoy the walk, lots of steps. Best if you know a bit of Russian. Upon completion this WAS the largest statue in the world, about twice the size of the Statue of Liberty.  Research online to get an overview."
"Requiring a bit of walking and steps up the hill where the sculpture is located.The ""Motherland Calls"" was under refurbishment when I visited earlier today. Yet, its still impressive, if not magnificent!Definitely a mistake in Stalingrad!"
"If you’ve come to Volgograd then of course you are coming here. She is an impressive sight to behold. However beneath this monument lies the final resting place of 35,000 people. Don’t walk on the grass in respect for the dead.Worth visiting/ 10"
"This gigantic statue is off to the north of centre and is easily reached by tramway. The visitor would ascend several hundred steps through tree lined pathways and ponds, with some sombre music and occasion sounds of gun fire, to eventually come to the eternal flame and ascend the circular ramp to the foot of the statue. There are visitors throughout the day but early morning would provide the best light. There are souvenir stalls around, Stalin museum to the right hand side of the statue and a cafe. Changing of the guards hourly at the eternal flame until the last one at around 18.50."
"This is the MUST GO, if you are staying in Volgograd. Take your time and walk to this sculpture from the main road. On your way is a hall of glory, where is nice to see the guard, when they are changing, I think that it is every hour, but I am not sure."
"The size, scale and history regarding this statute and the hill on which the statute resides is fascinating. We had an English speaking guide who told us about the strategic location of the hill during the battle of Stalingrad, the mass grave that the statute is on and we were able to witness the changing of the guard. Do watch your step - the ground is uneven, the stairs are not all the same and it is quite a long walk."
Situated in top of the hill dominating the city this is a sight to behold. Under restoration at the time of our visit but sympathetically clad in mesh scaffolding so view was not significantly obstructed
Feel the history. I didn't expect Volgograd was Staligrad. The second world war history is beyond words. The Russians still honor the soldiers in a beautiful way.
"Towering over the town and a must visit attraction, we were not disappointed by what we saw. While there are other monuments and the eternal flame to see around the monument, there are limited facilities for food and rest in the vicinity. One should come by train as that gives the best views and is also most comfortable"
This huge statue higher than the statue of liberty was built to commemorate the battle of Stalingrad. Be prepared to climb many steps to reach the statue
"Go there as soon as possible! The statue and the area is magnificent and mind blowing. You will never see something like this again. Just be aware that they are planning a huge reconstruction and the statue will soon be covered up. When, it uncertain, so update yourself on Instagram to check out the latest post so you wont go there and its all covered up."
Amazing statue that is a true reflection of the Russian battles against the Nazis during WW2. See the guard change and then see the very emotional eternal flame before reaching the statue itself.
"Although it is the statue itself that is world-famous, it is part of a huge and well-designed memorial. Spend a couple of hours there, wonder around, see the changing of the guards, and try to see if you can actually take in the enormity of what it all stands for."
The centrepiece of the WWII memorial to the fallen at Stalingrad. Quite simply awesome.  I note that this statue will form the backdrop to the new football stadium being built for the 2020 world cup.  Assuming Russia play at the stadium during the games then suspect that this statue will certainly increase patriotic endeavour whilst at the same time intimidating the opposition.
"We visited Volgograd specifically to see the Panorama Museum, and the memorial complex which includes The Motherland Calls. There are many amazing things to see in the world, but she is high on the list!  We had perfect weather the day that we went. I was moved by the entire complex, dedicated to the victory of the Battle of Stalingrad. It is best to start from the street, near the Volga river, and climb up through the memorial. The entire complex is a fitting tribute to the historic battle, and evokes many feelings on the way up to Mamayev Hill. The whole area is dominated by the 256 foot statue of The Motherland. She is beautiful, and riveting, and strong.  The day that we were there, ""climbers"" were visible among her skirts on the back side.  The guide informed us that these were specialists checking her for damage.  Next year, after the World Cup, she will be covered with scaffolding for repairs. See her while you can! She is worth it!"
I have been interested in the Battle of Stalingrad for quite a while and I had the opportunity visit with Sputnik Tours - Stalingrad Battlefield Tours. Visiting Motherland Calls was a part of our 3 day tour. I have been to many war memorials all around the world and this one is by far the most extensive and impressive.
The tram stops at the base of the park.  From there you walk through various statues and the flame on the way to where the Motherland Calls is.  The statue was much larger than I was expecting and was the highlight of my trip to Volgograd.  Most of the way there is via stairs but there is also a zig zag path near the top where you can take great photos.  The walk wasn't to bad since there were numerous stops on the way.  Try to plan your stop based on the light of the day.
"The statue and the memorial complex leading to it is probably the number 1 reason to visit Volgograd. The entire area is kept clean and well maintained with pride, and is a sobering experience until you get to the foot of the statue and realise just how big it is. Watch the changing of the guard whilst you are there, and if you can, observe the statue at night"
"Must visit if you are in Russia.  The city of Stalingrad now called volgograd has seen the bloodiest battle in the history of mankind . It's a colossal statue on the banks of the Volga river urging the sons of Russia to rise and fight! She is an angry woman. Use the metro tram to get down at mamayev kurgan station.  There are 200 steps commemorating 200 days of the battle.  There are lot of other statues like the grieving mother ,the soldiers statues depicting the horrors of war . There is an eternal flame monument . Pay your respects to those who have fallen. Don't forget to visit the small church next to the statue. Stand beneath the statue gaze on to the Volga and get transported back in time where the German bombers were bombing on the red army soldiers crossing the river by boat."
If you visit Volgograd you must visit the statue. You will not be dissapointed. Take your time and soak it all in. This is what russia is.
On the highest point of the city sits this tribute to the million or more who lost their lives in the battle. The statue and area around it are breathtaking and somber reminders of the past. Don’t miss it.
Having been many times. This is a must see place in Волгоград. Will provide many strong images of the war experience.
"The ""Motherland Calls"" statue, also known as the Mamayev Monument, commemorates the Battle of Stalingrad, one of the bloodiest battles of WW2. Leading up to the statue  there are 200 steps which symbolise the 200 days of battle. It's a good idea to wear comfortable walking shoes and to be reasonably physically fit if you want to climb to the top! If you prefer, you can get a shuttle bus which takes you around the back of the park and deposits you at the top so you can walk down. The view from the top is panoramic. If one knows the history, the  three-dimensional figures of soldiers which are carved into the rockface make for sombre viewing. We were lucky enough to witness the changing of the guard in the Hall of Remembrance. We learned much about the history from our tour guide and would recommend that the best way of looking at this monument is on an organised tour as they take you there by bus and give you the option of either walking up or walking down! Our tour was organised by the staff of our Vodohod river cruise."
