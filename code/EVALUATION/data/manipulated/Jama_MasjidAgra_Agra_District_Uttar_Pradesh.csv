Beautiful place to visit.   Steeped in history.  You will take your shoes off to get in.  Watch having to give tips as the minimum tends to be 100 rupees or be prepared for them to give it back to you!!!There are capes you can buy but honestly you don’t need them.
No restrictions on your religion to visit this place. Yet another beautiful structure left by history to us. Admire this beauty
"Must see while in Agra! Go with a tour guide or read about the history of this mosque prior, it will be more worth your visit. You have to pay to take your camera in. Go early or late when the sun isn't beating down on you. Recommended."
"Climb the steep steps to the oldest mosque in Delhi.  Remove your shoes and leave them with the attendant. Pay the 300 rupee fee supposedly for cameras, but cell phones count as well. Then take your time strolling in the compound and viewing the people pray, socialize and form community. Only Muslims are allowed deep inside, but all can walk along the outer temple. Pay the nice man who watched your shoes 50 rupee on the way out."
A nice place to visit if you are in Delhi. Covered clothing is mandatory and can be borrowed. 30 min is enough for a visit.
A wonderful serene place away from the hustle and bustle. Make sure you wear long sleeves as it is a holy place. Will take an hour to walk around.
Yucky.  Needs better upkeep.  It is an active mosque.  Need to leave shoes outside so walking with hotel bedroom slippers not a bad idea on this visit
"This ancient mosque is well worth a visit.  Be aware that shoes have to be removed (socks can be worn) and women will have to wear a long gown provided at the entrance.The mosque has one main undercover area and it contains some lovely architectural features.  Nice photo ops.  Two tall minarets tower above this section.The main area, though, is a very large open area with a water area in the middle.  When we visited long carpets were being laid out in preparation for a later prayer session.It wasn't quite what I was expecting of a mosque because of the large open area but well worth a visit."
"I didn't get to walk through the central area. Having read reviews that R300 is paid if you want to take photos, I decided to stand firm when asked (quite aggressively), even though I was carry my mobile in my backpack out of sight and did not plan to take photos. The doorman stood firm too, saying R300 is payable if you are simply carrying your mobile. Not wanting to cause trouble, and having seen the forecourt from just inside the entrance way, I decided to walk away. I have been conned earlier in the week elsewhere, so I was perhaps a little sensitive to being conned again. Decide your approach prior (to pay or not to pay) - the above hopefully provides info to do that."
Looks very beautiful but didn't have the courage to go inside the whole pathway was so crowded. Be careful about the number of People if you can handle go ahead
"Worth the stop to look around and get a few photos. Be sure to ""splurge"" on the slippers (Rs150/pair), as the ground is cold in the winter and is also covered in pigeon excrement. Save your socks/feet and get the slippers or bring your own! As with many tourist/religious sites in India, dress modestly. They do rent large robes for women who's legs/arms might be exposed."
"Be careful being conned. We had paid entry for climbing the minaret, then we still need to pay tips for the guy we did not asked Rupee100 each person"
Well worth the visit if in Agra. Watch out for those professing to be mandatory Muslim accompanying guides. Cover your head and enter the mosque at will.
"Beware of locals posing as entrance fee collectors. If you look very much like a foreigner, they will block your way and ask for 300 rupees."
"We tried to get in one gate, they give out free covers for your legs and arms, but charge 300 rupees for a mobile phone as it has a camera, which seems a little excessive so we decided to go in separately, and leave our cameras outside. This didn't please the guy on the gate & he said we weren't allowed in even when we tried to pay. We went to the other gate and paid instead. You leave your shoes outside, it's very very hot ground so take socks or you'll be hopping about. Very peaceful in the afternoon, but I believe it packs 25000 people or so at peak prayer times. Makes for some nice pictures, and some nice views."
"Nice place to visit, free entry but 300 rupees for camera charge or phone charge. Tried to charge one of our group members twice for the camera and having a phone."
This one is quite a large mosque. The place has a divine aura. Avoid going on a hot afternoon. The only problem is you cannot come to his place in your own car or vehicle.
visited this place on a weekend. this place and surrounding area was crowded. morning times will be less crowded. weekdays will be best to avoid crowds. but i loved the crowd and activities there. its best to walk around the places. there are so many street vendors. better avoid eating from street vendors.
"As it with other places, this is also again has been converted into business destination by local guides. Not minding the fee which they ask you for its visit which was 50 Rs, you can go inside and enjoy some facts about the place. However, beware of the thugs inside the Masjid. They will trick you into buying the Chadar for 500/750/1100. Just completely ignore them. Simple head inside the Masjid and pay your regards. Thats it. No need to carry anything."
"Shoes off of course. We left ours outside but noticed many carrying their shoes. Women must wear a covering following an incident by a female tourist in the heat of the summer. Fee for camera (300 rupees) and although only one of us had a camera both of us were asked to pay. 20 rupees for the gentleman watching our shoes and 20 rupees for the ""cover charge"". You are able to climb one of the towers for an additional 100 rupees. Look for the ticket booth along the outside walls at the back on the left. Steep climb worth it if you have a good day weather-wise."
Loved the architecture. A good scenic beauty with pleasant atmosphere. It was very beautiful and a must see for everyone visiting India.
"Being the first stop in our first holiday in India, visiting this place is best to wear normal slippers as entering the premises require one to removed ones foot wear. Remember that storage of your shoe or slippers require a small fees to the keeper. Architecture of the building I would says it’s amazing to the people, which dates back a few centuries ago when this mosque was builded. Tourist would also be mopped by locals selling the local handy crafts the moment you step down your car till you exit the place."
Loved going into the Masjid. Especially climbing the stairs up the minaret & seeing city below. It was a relaxed place & there were people who loved in Delhi & were there for the first time & were amazed once they were up the minaret. Highly recommend.
This is a nice mosque with lots of history attached. Very near to the Agra fort. Cover this place as well as a part of Agra fort tour. Beautifully decorated building and nice artistic work.
Was not expecting this place to be as good as it was! Beautiful architecture and very interesting. A nice place to relax and watch the world go by.
"Its a place of worship, and people from all religions and walks of life are free to go in. This was my first visit ever into a mosque. I liked the place.Its very serene and peaceful inside the Masjid. Even though its in the most crowded area of old Delhi i.e. the Chandni Chowk area, its very peaceful and quite inside. There is a small fee for going into the upper decks of the mosque. The ticket counter is clearly marked inside the mosque. Tips:  1) Shoes not allowed. Carry a plastic bag with you, outside the mosque, remove them and put it in your bag and carry along2) Camera charges Rs.300.  3) The surrounding areas unfortunately is very unkempt and noise. If you have a chauffeur driven car, try and get dropped as close as possible to the entrance of the mosque. 4) No real dress code, however respecting the traditions ladies must carry a scarf to cover head."
"Photos never show you the context of a building's setting. Surrounding the Jama Masjid is a neighborhood full of every imaginable shop which you can see on a rickshaw tour.This mosque is quietly elegant, like an old aunt whose beauty has faded. Its color and scale wonderful to see."
The mosque is generally underwhelming. not worth the walk there. When I was there I was not sure if you had to pay for entrance. Apparently it is for free there is just someone asking for entrance standing at the front. See photos attached photos for what he looks like. He is the guy wearing black.
"Stopped here on my tour of Agra.  It's ok, but like many sights in India, this hasn't been well cared for.  I suppose if you're spending a lot of time in Agra, you should go see it, but if you're there for a few hours you can just skip this and go to what you really came to see, Taj."
Nice experience amidst crowded market of delhi.One can experience delhi at its local level and also enjoy shopping in old traditional markets.Visit Masjid for spiritual awakening. Spend time with birds there.
"No pics taken because we were informed that we needed to pay upfront if we bring cameras or mobile phones in. Dont worry about the shoes as we had that taken cared off. Note: no shoes allowed inside the mosque. Good to visit, good to know how Islam has its influence in Delhi."
Situated near Agra Fort which is Sandstone made Old heritage Mosque!! Decent Dresses need to wear along with a slipper to visit Jama Masjid. A great architectural view with great & amazing carvings. Agra Fort view is very impressive from here
"Found this an interesting place. Nice views and architecture and although a ""cool"" day it was very hot inside. The hawkers just outside will not leave you alone but i just ignored them."
"One of the most beautiful monuments. Even with the crowded streets, it is serene. Have seen few mosques but this is the best of all."
"Its a magnificent view of Delhi from the minaret. Stand there and imagine that these Minars have witnessed layers of generations and folding history. I would suggest you to one climb up this minar and visit it. My first visit was with my mother to this minaret as she is from old delhi.Its around 250 stairs and little claustrophobic for some people as its narrow but that's the feel of it. There is ventilation through small holes in the minar. Tips: Be careful of the caretakers. Do not indulge in any kind of arguments with them. People around have created useless rules which doesn't exist on record to harass tourists for money. Wear decent (arms and legs covered) cloths in order to not invite unnecessary attention and arguments. Do carry a stole (for females). be aware of pickpocket and mobile thieves. Do not reveal that you have a camera , SLR needs a tickets to be used inside the premises, I have never paid for photography here though :pFeel free to ping me for any questions and tips for old delhi."
