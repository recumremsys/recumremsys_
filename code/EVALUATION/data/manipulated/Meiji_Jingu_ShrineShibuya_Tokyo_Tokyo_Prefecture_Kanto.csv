Can’t recommend this temple enough. You instantly forgot that you’re in the middle of a busy city. Great introduction to temple etiquette with easy to follow guides in the brochure. Recommend the inner garden for the extra 500 yen. Be sure to gain a charm to change your fortunes!
"We found the city of Tokyo to be an even moving hustle of people and business, especially after the fun and madness of Shibuya crossing.    Walking through the massive Tori Gate into Yoyogi park surrounding the shrine was a gentle slide into a green calm.   Tourists thinned out as we got closer to the temple and we passed small side gardens, now closed, that we wish we'd be around earlier to explore them.    A second enormous Tori gate announces your arrival to the Meiji Shrine and you are entered into the grounds of the shrine itself.   We saw a lot of shrines over this trip and you get a little ""shrined out"" however the majesty of Meiji remained with us and cemented itself as our favorite.   We performed the ritual washing of the hands (some wash their mouth out as well) as an act of respect before proceeding into the shrine proper.   One inside, it opens itself to you and shows the grandeur of it's size.   Stop on the edge and wait for a few minutes, take it all in, feel the timber that surrounds you and see the construction while the sweet smell of cedar wood and incense.    A spiritual moment?   Maybe...    but for me, I really enjoy traditional timber construction and craftsmanship, along with the tactile sensations you get from them.    What can I say, it's my bag!   From there, move into the main courtyard and up to the actual shrine and burial place of Empower Meiji, the 122nd Emperor of Japan and the man who modernized the nation. I feel the shrine really is a cultural must-see for Tokyo visitors.   There are information boards all around describing the emperor and his rule.   The shrine itself is a beautiful thing to behold and like us, you will want to buy one or the prayer boards (500 yen), write a prayer on it and place it on the hanger for the priests to present and offer the next day.   You can also purchase any number of small charms for whatever luck you want.   This is a fun think and it gives you some unique souvenirs.   They may be a little pricey but if funds go to the upkeep and maintenance, I’m cool with that.   Toilets abound through the park and pathways and there is a large cafe/restraint complex with souvenir shop.   Good shop for traditional quality items over tacky fun ones.Getting there is easy, either by walking up from Shibuya like we did or getting off at Harjuku, right on the park entrance.  Come early or late as it appears the park gets busy in the main part of the day.   If you are in Tokyo for some cultural satisfaction, this really is a must."
"Visit this majestic Srine surrounded by hundreds year old woods in the middle of Tokyo.  Listen to the trees, the wind and the crows, you would never think you are in a city with 15 million people."
"Don’t miss Meiji Jingu, the most famous shrine in Tokyo. Plan on walking quite a bit in good shoes on flat ground. Lots of cafes and restaurants nearby for lunch. Gift shop has fun souvenirs."
"Starts perfectly with a walk through the park to reach the shrine where you can see the absolutely enormous gates and trees. You could say the park is an attraction in of itself. The shrine is quite the spectacle to behold and exudes a wonderful atmosphere (just hope it isn't too crowded of course!). Like in most shrines, you are able to purchase charms for varying purposes that also serve as first-rate souvenirs."
Begin with  a beautifulWalk through a park and find your self cleansing before saying and clapping at he gorgeous shrine. A must in Tokyo.
Walking through the Torii gate at the entrance to the park removes you from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo.  There is quite a long walk to the shrine itself but it is through a forest of greenery.  It makes your visit much more enjoyable than Senso-ji which is too crowded to enjoy (in my opinion).  There is a lovely smaller garden called the Inner Garden that is also quite beautiful.  An admission is charged for that part of the garden but not the main shrine area.We ate a light lunch at the cafe by the entrance.  It was a great place with delicious food and fun people watching.Would definitely recommend this oasis in the middle of Tokyo.
"Nice quiet, serene. Air is fresh. What can you ask for!!! Especially right in the middle of Tokyo. Try to go on a weekdays and early. After 10am, bus load of tourists."
"Massive, compelling, and inspiring.  Surprising to find in the middle of the massive city of Tokyo, and among the best Tokyo finds if you are looking for scale, history. interest, and authetic Japan in one location.  Be preapred to walk a distance, bring comfy shoes.  Highly recommened."
"Going to the Meiji Jingu Shrine is a walk of faith for visitors as it takes an average person a good 10 minutes to navigate on a gravel lined path to the shrine itself.  Along the way, you'll be distracted by the lush foliage, and the sounds of nature permeating throughout.  The shrine itself is a monument of beauty, and we were fortunate to witness a wedding ceremony happening on the grounds.  Wonderful place to be in."
Such tranquility in the heart of Tokyo. Surrounded by forest and greenery. A very different side of a bustling city. A must to visit.
"A place to go if you are a fan of nature, history and shrine. It's beautiful. Enjoy the stroll with birds chirping and fresh air."
"A few steps away from the hustle and bustle of busy Tokyo, you enter a quiet and serene path.  As you stroll deeper into the man-made sanctuary you find yourself relaxing.  We had limited time and did not explore any structures, but enjoyed the walk and external views.  Ticked by the area where people can bring their vehicles for blessings.  We also enjoyed observing the sake barrel ""wall"". Each barrel wrapped and decorated differently.  Our escort explained that some of these were commercial or ad related, but still so beautiful (especially to those of us that don't read Japanese!)    Recommended for a calming visit and casual stroll"
"Go early if it’s hot as a reasonable walk to get there but worth it. Very beautiful and peaceful even when crowded, we saw a couple of wedding parties which was very special, such gorgeous outfits.  Well worth a visit"
"The Shrine itself is beautiful, but the surroundings truly make this a special place. Walking from the bustle of Tokyo into this peaceful oasis is stunning. Definitely one of the top places to visit in Tokyo."
This is a beautiful Shinto shrine located in a forest; surprisingly inside busy Tokyo.  It is in an impressive green space that is amazingly quiet and calming.  You will enjoy the sounds of birds and smell the pleasant forest greenery.  The history is very interesting and educational.  Touring the site involves a lot of walking and the guiding signage is well numbered to prevent getting lost.  Meiji Jingu Shrine was one of my favorite places to visit while exploring Tokyo.
"After seeing numerous shrines and temples in Kyoto, as lovely as the Meiji Shrine is, it is not as overwhelming as many other historical sites.  That being said, the walk from the Torii to the actual shrine is quite tranquil and very enjoyable.  Take a few moments to enjoy the 39 foot high main gate or Torii--it is made from 1,500 year old Hinoki Cypress trees.  We also enjoyed the barrels of both sake and burgundy that had been donated to the shrine--great for a picture.  From what I understand, the trees that are now part of the 170 acre complex were donated by people from all throughout Japan. Check out my photos for more details."
Went to this shrine. Very near to Harajuku stationIt was very serene If you have time you can visit
We chanced onto the Meiji Jingu Shrine when looking for a shady spot near Harajuku after a long sweaty walk from the Shibuya station. The shrine is a beautiful example of Japanese ability to be both ornate and simple at the same time. The massive structures of unfinished wood are impressive. The visit is free. The shrine is in the midst of a forest like park. Getting there was a pleasant walk in the shade after the hot busy streets of Shibuya and Harajuku.
A peaceful oasis right by the Harajuku subway stop.  Enjoy the beautiful gardens and peaceful surroundings as they make for a lovely walk to get to the Shrine itself.  Splendid and majestic.
Visit the great shrine for a peaceful and inspiring walk and then go to the road with yellow gingko trees lining the side. Another great place that’s just off the Harajuku station.
Wonderful park if you like being amongst nature and walking. Has a private (pay for) garden made for the Empress which had less tourists in it. The shrine was relatively busy for a tourist spot but not unmanageable. Brilliant example of shrines in Japan.
Meiji was a very important man in the shaping of Japan. When visiting a country it is important to learn about the defining moments in history for that place.Gardens are lovely. Walking through the colossal trees was a nice break from the surrounding busy city.
"After my 6th trip to Tokyo japan . I finally try a new sightseeing attraction for myself . I’m loving it - Meiji Jingu shrine . Liking the the natural scene over there on all of it . The historical park , building or even those wishes trees . Overall I loved the silence and felt so peaceful. I highly recommended this place to everyone to pay a visit . There’s many IG check in places to snap a nice photo ."
"Second time to visit since 2 years ago. If you’re planning to get temple stamps (Goshuincho), this should be on your top list. They usually close early, so my advice to visit in the morning. We also witnessed 2 weddings, and they say you’re blessed when you see the couple. Just a tip - exit at Takeshita-dori / Harajuku station (Yamanote Line). It’s the shortest walk and you can also check out Yoyogi Park after your Goshuincho. Make sure to take note areas that you can’t take pictures. Good thing my 7-year-old loves cultural trips like these, too."
"We took the train to Shibuya and then walked to the shrine entrance. Once you enter the hustle and bustle of the city just dies away. The lily garden and the pond area (500¥) are lovely. Don't forget to visit the shop close to the entrance, it seems to have nice quality merchandise. Harajuku also very close, you can enjoy multiple changes in atmosphere in one day."
After walking through the park (really a forest within the city) we reached the majestic wooden carved gates of the Meiji Jingu shrine. The two very old trees in the back of the square inner court catch your view. Even there are many visitors but also locals who came to pray there is only a little murmur. Don't forget to exit through the right doors if you entered through the main gate to see also the rest of the buildings.
"Beautiful Shinto temple to get away from the bustling city. Recommend to go before 9 am to avoid crowds. Also recommend to take a handkerchief and wear comfortable tennis shoes. Since it is a temple, people should try not to shout, fool around, run in the area and respect it. From the entrance try to walk on either side. It is easier to walk and also respectful to the God, who is believed to walk in the middle.Before the shrine, there is a place where you can cleanse your hands. First pour water on your left, then right hand, and finally let the water trickle down the handle for the next user. Then dry your hands with your handkerchief.Let your mind concentrate on the sounds, air, light, woods, nature that you see as you walk to the temple.When you pray, bow once, place the coin in the bin, clap twice, pray, and bow once."
A must visit if you are in Tokyo. You will have a long walk in the green forest before you enter the temple. Both worth the time. It is right next to the metro station and the famous Takeshita street. Combine them in one visit.
"Have visited this place a couple of times. A nice stroll into the shrine area from the madness of Harajuku. Huge area, tranquil."
"This shrine is interesting because it is located in the forest in the middle of the city. We didnt quite realize we would be walking through the woods to get to it. However, we did enter at the entrance near Yoyogi Park. I would actually recommend this as no one else was around and it was a nice leisurely quiet walk in the back way. Then we exited through the main entrance walking against the crowds coming in. It actually worked out nice. Bring bug spray as this time of year its humid and the mosquitos are out, even in the middle of the day! The temple itself is beautiful, especially the large wooden arches at each entrance. It was a nice change to see the natural wood and not the brightly painted orange arches that are so popular at every shrine in Japan. Like at most shrines in this city, you can buy a fortune or good luck charms. People were doing this and saying prayers at the main building of the temple. It was nice to sit on a bench in the shade for a bit and have a rest while taking in the peacefulness."
"Definitely worth the visit to this sprawling park in Shibuya. Give yourself a couple hours to walk around and see both the shrine and park. Also, make sure you stop by the sake and wine barrels!"
"This shrine is one of the most important ones in Tokyo. After a nice walk through the garden, you come to the entrance of the shrine. The shrine is open from 5 am to 6 pm. Getting there early is really important as it gets really crowded later in the day."
"Visited on 2 January and was amazed by the amount of people visiting the shrine for new years! Even though it was crowded, it was still extremely beautiful with a wonderful stroll underneath the trees. Would recommend visiting after sunset if there is a market - the lanterns were lit up and truly changed the atmosphere to something more mythical. Returned a few days later for a photo shoot in traditional kimono attire."
"After spending several days squeezing into subway trains, strolling along the neon lit alleys of Shinjuku and fighting through the hordes of Shibuya Crossing, visiting Meiji Temple was a welcome repast.  At my daughter’s urging to see something cultural, we decided to visit Meiji Temple.  From the Tokyo Station, Google offered several recommended transit routes.  I decided to take what appeared to be the most direct route to the temple.  After exiting the subway station in a residential neighborhood, we followed a path by a horse stable and what looked like an isolated dead-end street.  There was nothing that appeared to be a tourist site or a temple.  We had visited Asakusa Temple the day before and fought through thousands of tourists to visit one of the most commercialized religious sites in the world. There was nothing that appeared to resemble a similarly popular tourist site. We followed an elderly woman through a path into a park located at the end of the block and discovered one of the most serene places I’ve been.  Beyond a small guard shack there was what appeared to be an archway one would expect at a temple.  Believing that we were on the right path we proceeded through a beautiful tree lined pathway with open fields and few other travelers. Although we had not yet come across a temple, out of curiosity we continued on.  Finally, we came across some fellow visitors heading in the opposite direction who confirmed that we were on the right path to the temple. I felt that we were on a pilgrimage.We finally came across the Temple and now scores of visitors.  We realized that we had entered the Temple from the back though a less traveled route and now were amongst throngs of tourists.  The Temple is a traditional large courtyard with a shrine where devotees could make offerings.  This is a working religious center where there are several buildings dedicated to Shinto religious practitioners.  There isn’t much to see at the temple itself but wander through the park surrounding the temple and the trip is well worth the journey.  If you arrived at the Temple from the Harajuku/Shibuya entrance, do not get discouraged by the crowds, exit through the back of the Temple and explore the park away from the throngs of tourists, literally bus loads and bus loads of tourists.  However, if you want to spend a day away from the concrete, multi story shopping complexes and crowds of people,  the park is a lovely way to spend the day.There is a very modern visitors center with a café, rest rooms, and a full service restaurant.  We stopped at the café and had a snack.  The food served at the café was surprising very good and very inexpensive.  They offer a full range of Japanese food from soba to curry rice and pizza.  Get away from the crowds and explore the park grounds.  Serene and beautiful."
