"Ancient time temple with natural hot water bath at cold place, shows the power of nature. Was good experience there"
"Its next to Vashisht and Ram Temple, just walk past the temples. The pool like area to take a dip is for males only. Was told its a unique experience, so must try but I was in a rush and not ready. Have experienced it though when I was young."
"This is a old vasishth temple and water, Now a days renovation is going on. Need to walk to reach there as its on heights. good place"
This place is actually famous for its hot water springs though we did not have a bath considering the extreme cold temperatures and it being crowded. The temple in itself is an old small temple but great surroundings and hot water springs in its vicinity. Paid parking available.
the hot water nullah where u can bath & feel relax. remind you of Ramayana story of Guru Vashisht. nice place
Must visit place. Happening beautiful interior live music and yummy food. Outside sitting is also Available.
"This is a wonderful pious bath in a natural hot water pond. The water is warm throughout and also contains sulphur. Healing touch.Though it was rainy and cold weather during our stay in Manali, I and my son made the most of it by taking a dip in the hot water. The temples around are also beautiful."
"Hot springs are supposed to be good for your skin due to their medicinal properties as they are mineral enriched. Here in the Vasishta Temple complex, the hot spring water is diverted in to small public bath areas separate for men and women. The women one has a series of taps where you can bath and a small cemented pool where you can take a dip. But the place is not particularly hygienic and the spring water used does not seem very clean due to its storage condition. Also the area around the bath is very cramped, small and slippery if you are trying to walk around it.It is also very crowded and so early mornings or late evenings are the best times to come here if you intend to bath. Also bring in a change of clothes. It is at a distance of about 5Kms uphill from the Manali Mall and so it is best to use an auto or taxi to come here. Visit the temple complex next to the bath and enjoy a small meal or snack around the area once you are done with the bath."
Such a relaxation. Only grudge is there is not much cleanliness. Seeing meat shop just opposite the temple was a great shock for me.
"This place is Holy ,go early morning otherwise stuck in traffic. Don't forget to bath in Hot water kund."
"The main attraction of this place is the hot sulphur spring. You have to park the car at the parking and walk up. We walked up the winding roads to the springs. Didn't get down for bath.They have a tank in which the spring water is collected and let out through taps, for those who don't wish to go down. The view of mountains from there is beautiful."
Set in the city is this old and well maintained bath with hot spring.  I was here in August and the water was too hot for me!  I did put my feet under the running water and splashed my body.  Sitting bare breasted in the open sun felt wonderful and it didn't take long to dry.  The temple is interesting with a statue that is believed to be thousand years old or more.  Be aware the temple closes for some time in the afternoon.
Vashist bath on the manali foothills is one of the places to visit. Known for its pure water which direclty comes from the snow clad mountains you can have a dip and feel the freshness it has.
Guru vashistha place. Hot water Kund. Where you can take bath. Ladies and gents kund are different. Only three to four feet water. Safe for everyone. Water is very hot. Take care for taking bath
Very old temple situated at manali . Have a nice market for shopping .Better option other than mal road
"Taking bath in hot suphur water was an amazing experience. every visitor must take bath, but ensure to take clothes along with them for changing."
The place is next to the temple itself. It is a pool with hot water. An experience to go for. Take a towel & extra pair of clothes. Open to all age groups.

Nice place to take bath here. Spring is pleasantly hot in accordance to the cold weather. Remember to take a towel with you. The temple is just beside the spring.
"Visited this historical place with friends in last year. During our visit, Temple renovation work is going on. There is a natural â€˜Hot Water Kundâ€™ to bath. There is also another two-three small temple to visit. Parking is available there which is half km away from main temple."
"Went with my family, the male members spend around 1 hour and they felt so rejuvenated after the bath. Female area- I wouldn't recommend for those who can just go nude and wash and change before every other(female)"
"Situated right next to the Vashisht temple these baths are a blessing specially in the colder months. There are separate chambers for men and women. Since I have been the other natural hot water springs too, this one is much larger and well maintained compared to others. Good for people of all ages. Definitely visit here if you are in Manali."
"This place is beyond temple. Being a researcher this place attracted me more than any other place at Manali. Famous for its hot water spring, this place is known to cure skin disease which in not magic but science. Infact yes, dip in the hot water spring contain sulfur which can ease some skin problems. There are separate sections for men and women and you can dip yourself freely in respective section. The temple is made of carved woods which is also very fascinating."
"Vashisht Temple is famous for its sulfur hot springs and a lore related to this place. according to lore, you need to take a dip in sulfur pools to get rid of your sins and pray to Vashishta.- Explore Manali's real residential area around this temple.- Parking space is limited in front of the temple and its paid.- Separate pools for Men and Women inside the temple.- Pools are usually crowded, if you don't want to take a dip you can use a tap to feel hot water.- Bring your own costumes if you want to take a dip."
Wow.... Here you find Naturally hot water all the time at this chilled Place. Do not forget to take a separate set of clothes when you visit there. You will love to have a bath there. MOST IMPORTANT: Separate Place is there for bath for Males and Females. PEOPLE SAY: Some people say that your skin problem may vanish after having a few dips there in that HOT water. (I am not sure of this).But You should visit this place for sure. And don't be in a hurry.
Tried Tandoor tea near the temple. Something different to try abit expensive for rs. 50 but worth.  The temple is also good. Not to mention the hot spring in -5 Â° C. was thrilling
Its a very old hindu temple. Makes me feel like i am living back in pandav's era. There is also hot water pond.. which is magical in this cold hills
Ancient temple dedicated to Rishi Vashisht. It has natural hot bath facilities - separate facilities for male and female. Welcoming behavior by local people and temple priest.
"Compared to the men's hot spring bath, the women's bath is big let down ðŸ˜•. Don't get too excited ladies. However, if it is not crowded, do try and bath to enjoy the benefits of a sulfur bath. Bring a towel to dry off.It's a cool stop on the when walking up to see Jogni waterfalls."
Believed to be more than 4000 years old temple with beautiful architecture and wooden carvings. This temple is famous for it's hot sulphurous springs. Behind the temple there are bathhouses contain hot water from the springs which believed to have a great healing power for skin diseases. Water temperature between 40 to 50 Celsius. Through out the year it will remain the same. Separate bathhouse for women and no photos allowed. Worth a visit.
The temple complex and hot springs are an attraction here - some nice woodwork on the temples . Do not miss the ram temple located a few steps above.
This was a Memorable Hot water bath in the Lap of Nature My My two Friends enjoyed our day some days back when we were in Manali.  It was great and enjoyable bath. Thank you god for such a beauty of this kind.
"I visited this place while doing local sight seeing in Manali. This is an old 'Vashisht Muni' temple. Adjacent to the temple is a warm water pool. There separate sections for male and female. Be prepared, if you want to take a dip in this warm (slightly hot) water pool."
great experience at the hot water spring here in vashisht. easily. went there by own vehicle. parking is very difficult to find. so preferably take a walk.
"Vashisht is comparatively less crowded and this is a must visit place in manali. 3.5km form main manali is this beautiful vashisht temple with hot spring (very hot actually), but after a long walk or tiring journey, one should take bath and see the effect. Its very very relaxing. Separate section for ladies and gents. Must must visit. Try local german bakery nearby.Note: Hire local auto from new manali to vashisht hot spring (local-10 rs/pp). Outsiders (20-25 Rs./pp) depending on season."
