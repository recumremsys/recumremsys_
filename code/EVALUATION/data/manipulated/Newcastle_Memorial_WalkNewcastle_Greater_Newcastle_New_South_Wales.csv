"Discovered the memorial walk what a great surprise, beautiful walk and spectacular views a must if you go to Newcastle . It also commemorates the sacrifice of our WW1 soldiers."
Brilliant walk with amazing views all the way along. So interesting with loads to see. Walked from the Honeysuckle front all the way to Mereweather Surf House which was a great place to have lunch and rest up before the walk back.
Very nice walk with good information honoring heros who gave all. Stunning views of beaches and the town. Take time to stop and read the plaques and reflect on their sacrifice
Great views and an easy walk. Best to park up somewhere and make a return walk. Eg kings park to Merewether. Don’t be fooled by clouds- you’ll still get burned here!! Quite busy- frustrating that not everyone knows or follows the keep left rule - a sign or two would help either side of memorial walk.
"Stunningly beautiful memorial walk around the coastline. Lots of war history, a real tribute to the men and women. Wear sturdy shoes as is a decent but easy walk quite high up so views are magnificent.No dogs allowed.Free to access, sun block or a hat is a good idea. Nice swimming beach at the end."
"Fantastic short walk with amazing views! Wasn’t hard to walk round, no big steps or anything. Great view points in different places, best over looking the beach!"
"A beautiful short walk wit beautiful views of our beaches and coastal cliff's.  The council outdone themselves this time when they designed this walk. We are locals and enjoy this walk every time we do it. Come check it out for yourself, Newcastle has a lot to offer"
"Loved strolling this path, great views and we even saw some dolphins. Top afternoon out. It is an easy walk despite a few stairs but if you are even moderatley fit you'll be able to cope with this walk and you'll be glad you did it. Definitely recommend this activityy if visiting Newcastle."
"Linking cliff top spaces, this path reveals long coastline views. It can be windy but that’s one other reason to go."
Loved the views and the walk altogether. Definitely do this walk I enjoyed the memorial on the bridge too
This is an absolute must see whilst visiting Newcastle! Very informative and different memorial that stands out. The views are amazing along the walk. It was windy whilst we visited and being so high up it was extremely windy up on the bridge!! Hold onto your hats!!
"Great walk, great views, good excercise. Hugging the coast line and great information of the war history etc."
"The Anzac walk is a great addition to Newcastle. It is always kept clean and the view is spectacular. Depending on where you park, there is a responsible size hill and some steps you will need to walk up. But if you park in the top carpark it is very user friendly for everyone. Oh, and as it is a memorial, not dogs are allowed on the Anzac walk section."
Good walk with good views where you can take some really pretty selfies. Has lots of stairs going up if youre into that but also has some seated areas at the top. Nice place to chill or hang out with people. Can go at night too as has some nice lighting again for some good selfies
Easy access for those with limited mobility. Loved the views over Newcastle. Very popular even with the locals
"Ideal and refreshing walk along the Newcastle coast to Bar Beach. Fantastic ocean views and inland views of the city. The industrial area shows just how big it is with the four coal ship terminals and with ships in port. Also the ships on the ocean horizon waiting there turn to receive coal and wheat. Looking south west there is a great view from Blackbutt Researve across to Sugarloaf mountain and beyond. Sugarloaf is a great landmark. We all thoroughly enjoyed the walk although it could be a little cool on a windy day. Plenty to see for young and old.Walking shoes and jacket are best at this time of year. There are eating area, snack and restaurant at Bar Beach after the exhilarating walk. Plenty of wonderful views for use of camera or video."
"Stunning ocean views with a lovely walk and educational reading if interested.  Set high above the sea, walk along and watch dolphins at play or the whale migration.  The beach is in view and this is amazing! Don't miss it"
A magical memorial walk for the service people. Fabulous views of the east coast of Newcastle and beaches like Merewether & Nobbys. Not far from Dixon Park & Cooks Hill Surf Clubs. Go for a lovely walk then dine at the Beaches Hotel.
Was a lovely walk on a sunny autumn day. Not too long to wear off our 2 and 7 year olds and not too short as we spent an hour walking and capturing the scenic beauty
Most rewarding with great views of Newcastle & ocean.  Give yourself lots of time to read all of the information on the walk which commemorates our Aussie fallen WW1.
Walk by the ocean and view the names of those who fought for our Country. Stunning beaches and great cafes nearby in Darby Street. The Ocean baths at Newcastle and Merewether are the best in the world.
"Have done this walk numerous times, but especially enjoyed it during the whale migration. A great walk that combines History, nature, spectacular views and completed with a great Lunch at Mereweather Surf club."
"What a wonderful asset to the city this is . The views down the coast, up the coast ,east and west are truly spectacular. Stop along the way and reflect as well."
"Soooo gorgeous! Walk was just right, not too long not too short. One side is a view of the city, other side is a view of the ocean. Just the perfect mix. View was ethereal."
"A tribute to our fallen war heroes.Newcastle Memorial walk is a scenic, man made walk from the top of Memorial Drive over the beach side cliff down to Bar Beach and on to Merewether Beach. Don’t forget to look over the city side as well to view the industry side of the city which forms a vital part of the town’s livelihood. Beautiful any time of the day or night."
"The Anzac Bridge at Newcastle can be incorporated into a longer coastal walk, or the bridge walk itself is rewarding and not very long. The views are magnificent, particularly at sunset! It's a perfect spot for whale watching too. The steps are gently, so even if you have some mobility issues they may be achievable. The rise is gentle, each step is low, and there are rest platforms between short blocks of steps. Not too tiring. If you cant do steps at all you can still do it. Enter from the north end carpark (Newcastle Beach side) and just experience the bridge."
"Very moving tribute to those that gave their all. And what a view , look out for whales breaching. Take your binoculars"
Went for this walk at night. It offers a pretty scenic view of the skies since it is filled full of stars
"Built a few years ago. Starting from Strezlecki lookout.  Great views of the coast. Along Dixon Park,  Bar Beach and Merewether beaches."
Very exciting place. Great view of the ocean can been seen. Go alone or with a friend. Historically important to Australia.
Went on a very blustery Saturday morning.  Spectacular views and poignant tributes.  Highly recommend.... even with moody teenagers!
"Well - was not expecting this!  What a beautiful place.  Walked along the beach - amazing!  We were only there one day as part of a cruise, but could imagine spending a couple of good days here.  Highlight was when our cruise ship left, there was a gun salute, people in canoes alongside ship, and people waving from shore.  An wonderful end to a wonderful day."
Wwalking along above the clifftops gives amazing views in every direction.  As a special bonus we got to see multiple pods of whales just off the coast.  The historic information along the ANZAZ memorial walk is very interesting and to continue walking along the coast or back along the Terraces makes for a good outing.
This has car parking at the top end although limited. Bottom end has ample parking so recommend starting this end to do the full return trip. Lots of stairs which is ok for average fitness. The top half is relatively easy going being mostly flat and wheel chair friendly. It is sign posted NO DOGS but some choose to ignore this. It has interesting information panels along the way. Allow 30 to 45 mins for bottom return trip or 20 mins for top only. However take more time and a camera.
"It’s free, it’s a fantastic view. Take yourself or your out of town friends to see this amazing walkway."
