"Ideal place to take rest, for honeymoon, to enjoy the valley everything. Signature dish is Bamboo Chicken. Don't miss it. Quite, peaceful place to visit must. You should be there at least for two nights otherwise you can't enjoy Aarakku."
"Simple hill station with great attractions.Tribal museum, botanical garden,water fall(chapa rayi), coffee plantations and very famous Borra caves are worth visiting. Try bamboo chicken(tribal dish)"
"The Valley of Arakku is just min blowing, you can get a lash of greenery, hills, clouds, a long valley, beautiful roads, Waterfalls, Caves everything over here, just a excellent place. Try travelling by Kirandul passenger train from Vizag to get the magnificent views of the valley from Train passing through tunnels and while returning return by cab to get the road views above 3700 Feet from Sea Level. A really nice and great place to feast your eyes and to get a relaxed mind. Just for information till now Vodafone network does't work here however Airtel works perfectly, so if you are on vodafone network try carrying extra sim. A must place for visit all together.We visited in the month of September'2017"
"The valley is beautiful and ideal for a relaxing stay. While staying here don't miss bamboo chicken-a speciality of this place. Do visit Coffee museum, you won't regret."
Me and my friends. Enjoyed lot there there are many tourist places are there to see and three waterfalls and borra caves was excellent so you will also have fun there so you need to visit at least ones
"You can see clouds floating by in the morning. Still maintained almost virgin area with no commercial construtions.Peaceful and a good place to wind down. Have a waterfall, good valleys, fruit gardens,coffee plantation and more over a serene climate. Pollution free and must visit in the glass train from Vizag.Journey is too good."
One should visit such site seeing place. Both sides mountain and u enjoy the serpentine hourly passing through the valley. Stop at view points see the scenic beauty take snaps make memorable. Heart throbbing journey to reach the height. Should visit. Temperature varies.
It's a scenic place with a good weather most of the year. Me and my friends. Enjoyed lot there there are many tourist places are there to see and three waterfalls and borra caves was excellent
weather was amazing when we went to see Araku valley and reach ed Coffee plantation. Try local filter coffee sold for Rs. 10 per glass. its refreshing and must for cold weather. Buy some local stuff to help the tribal ladies
Visited by hired car. Train has no AC coach. So winter preferable. Good landscaped flower garden. An old sculpture garden.
Beautiful scenic beauty. a bit colder as compared to vizag city. a perfect picture of valley. must stay atleast for a day. surrounded with tribal people. staying at haritha mayuri resort of aptdc will be a good choice though the service of this resort is simply horrible but the view from here is wonderful.
"Returning from Bora caves we enjoyed the beauty of Araku Valley. Do not compare this valley with major hill station, but it has some own beauty. Good place to stay sometimes and some good views for photography."
"Whike the uphill to Arakku valley is scenic & lush green, there is nothing virtually up the hill to see.Triba musuem upkeep is ok but the real life like statues exhibiting the tribal way of living is worth an appreciation.The padma park is like any othet hill park. Notning unique.Government hotel Haritha food was good the day we had our lunch.Otherwise many small & roadsidr options for food. No major food chain with presence"
"Never would anyone imagine , Vizag the coastal beauty will house a beautiful mountain valley. Literally hidden, Aruku Valley is blissful and welcomes everyone with open alms. You have the Government run Haritha resorts (which is decent), there are other private hotels and guest houses. You can sit here and relax along the valley. Get a taste of the local music, dance and cuisine.  One is never tired of this place. The drive from Vizag to Aruku is roughly 3 hours, and is exciting as well. So go on, grab a 4 wheeler and wheel away ."
"Taken a road trip to Araku valley in June, 2017. Enjoyed the ghat road driving, the panorama offered from the various view points and the fresh mountain air. we spend a night in Araku valley. A beautiful place to rewind and relax. Though the roads are narrow,they are in excellent condition. But be careful on the drive as  we have seen many reckless drivers who has never been to a ghat section and takes the bends at breakneck speed. Try the bamboo chicken, its delicious."
A pleasant experience on the Hill meadows and nature. Can be planned for 2 days and 1 night kinda tour. Recommended stay at Mayuri - Haritha APTDC
"Nice views, quite beautiful. A ""must visit"" tourist spot. Drive in the valley is excellent. Local coffee is very good, a ""must have""."
Good for train or car drive only. Best if you can spend a day in the pleasant weather. Avoid during hot season. Fricking hot in October.
"Lot of greenery but climate is not cool as need to be in a hill station. Personally feel not worth the money spent for a overnight stay. Nothing worth seeing also. Suggest take the train to & fro,  visit borra caves & go back to vizag for stay"
Araku Valley is one of the main attractions if you are visiting Vizag. Keep one full day for the day trip to Araku Valley in an old fashioned way of Road Trip by Andhra Govt buses. Preferable time will be mild weather as the buses are non-AC. The trip take full day starting early morning around 7.30 till late evening. But the valley is a refreshing change from the usual city hustle and worth a trip!
"It is a great location with mountains and forests spread across 70km. The best way to enjoy this place is to go in train from vizag to araku, on this journey you can go through 40-50 tunnels dug through the mountains. You can see mountains , vast valleys and gorges.After train journey stay at a resort in Anantha Giri for a night to enjoy the peace and tranquility of the place. Do not expect tourist attractions here. I have also seen some camping sites .  You can then rent a car and go to tyda and stay for a night in the forest resort there. Which is pretty good by Indian standards. Location is just awesome . U should also take a hike behind the resort in tyda. I liked the views, and the flora and fauna on the trails.If you are adventurous , you should try a 9 km trek to the tribal villages. Remember it is 9km each way. So, start early if you want to complete it as a day trip. However , it would be more fun if you can backpack to the tribal village and stay there for the night. You got to understand this will be a primitive camping experience. On the way you can find a lot of edibles too.Caution: this is just my Idea for my next trip. There is no such organized trip. However, you can ask for a guide at the reception. I heard a lot about lambasinghi place. I guess it’s worth a try.Hope it helps. Please do share your experience of the backpacking trip."
Was heartening to see that the government has taken steps to attract tourists with coffee museum and tribal museum. Good effort. Apart from that nothing exciting. A valley..yes. but not with a great view unless you stay away from the town. We had booked a hotel to stay for 1night but decided to head back to vizag.
If couples are planning go some place for enjoyment. Araku vally is good to visit. Enjoyed alot in Araku valley visit. Best time time visit araku is Dec-Jan winter season only....
Don’t waste much time in the valley area ! Better spend more time in caves and waterfall ! Trekking plus scenic beauty is covered ! Valley is more good in case u are staying around week else not much to explore
Araku Valley is situated amidst the eastern ghats and is a popular travel destination. The journey is as beautiful as the valley itself. The place have a few view points and waterfalls. Nothing too great within Araku valley itself. Do try the Bamboo chicken if you are a non-vegetarian.
"It's a scenic place with a good weather most of the year except for the peak summer. Always had a good time.Be it driving around, walking,hiking or photography it's always a satisfying experience. The food is local and Chinese and there's a Araku valley coffee house which is impressive. Had amazing memories."
"Visited Vizag, then went to Araku Valley, a hill station of Andhra Pradesh, surrounded by thick forests with greener, is close to Orissa Border. The area is developed as Coffee Plantation area by tribal farmers."
"we have hired a two wheeler (activa) from vizag and drove to araku valley. nature lovers definitely enjoy the route , the greenery and the turnings. Had yummy bamboo chicken and spicy  biryani in araku and visited padma garden which is not worthy to spend time.then proceeded to chaparai waterfalls , on the way we could see lands filled with 'valise'flowers which is really fantastic to see. people enjoyed water slide in chaparai waterfall though the water flow is not much. one can plan in November  to see complete valise flowers filled valley  which will be more beautiful.there are many trekking camps also on the way."
"Recommend traveling by train, it is a weekend trip from Vizag or Bangalore. There are thick coffee plantations on both sides of a winding road. There is also a tribal museum."
"The place offers a good drive with mountain and valley views while Travelling to this place from  Vizag or Borra caves .It is about an hour drive from Borra caves or 3 hours drive from Vizag Though we only made a day trip from Vizag to see both Borra caves and Arakku Valley , one can think of staying overnight at Arakku for enjoying the weather .There is a tribal museum which is nicely put up , but its maintenance can be better considering a very good stream of visitors to this attraction every day . The entry ticket to this museum is Rs 40/- per adult .There is also a coffee museum operated by Private , which is good and an interesting place to see at a token entry ticket of just Rs10/- You can buy many varieties of premium coffee chocolates / dark chocolates / premium filter coffee . Enjoy a freshly brewed coffee sold at a reasonable price"
Take a toy train either way from vizag. Numerous tunnels and bends. Book from irctc before hand. Romantic. You can get down in borra cave stop and then take your car to borra cave.
"Situated in Andhra Pradesh it is one of the finest valley in India. one can see Coffee plantations on the way to Araku town. Surrounded with hills, beautiful waterfalls this valley attracts lakhs of tourists every year. Visit Borra caves, Coffee Museum, Padmapuram Botanical gardens to name a few."
"More than visiting places, one should try to enjoy the beauty of the valley by going on a morning walk. The place is a good choice during vacations. When it comes to places to visit,1. Coffee museum(Don't forget to taste coffees and buy chocolates)2. Padmapuram Gardens3. Anantapur Coffee plantation4. View PointsThere's a train starting from Vizag to Arakku at morning. Take that, that must be your onward journey(Executive class with big special windows is recommended). While returning, take road(Don't take train just because it come late every time, actual arrival is around 15:00 but comes only after 17:00 often).Train journey will be unforgettable, will be a long lasting sweet memory.Rockk Inn darlings ...!! No second thought, not a bad option though better choices are available.My visit was during a summer, stayed there for 2 nights, mornings and afternoons were shiveringly cold, and afternoon, one out of three days it was slightly sunny. Other afternoons, there were drizzle.i'm attaching a pic of the beautiful Executive class I mentioned earler."
"The train trip from Vizag to Araku valley was 5 hour long, but you can watch grand views. As you ride from Vizag to Araku , you get good views on the right side. Left side view is nothing special. Glass window is tainted or scarred, so you must find a clear spot to watch.Araku valley has a peaceful and soothing landscape with low mountains and fields. Coffee Museum was a nice surprise. You can drink and buy  quite tasty local coffee such as Peaberry and Araku Arabica."
"It's 2-3 hrs drive out of Vizag, winding roads & greenery takes you to this little know hill station. Catch some good valley & hill views, do a trip to Borra caves, put your feet up & enjoy the good weather."
