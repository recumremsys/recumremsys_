It was really fun to visit this place. I really enjoyed cricket session and shooting. Rest of the activities were also fun. It was so nice of Mr. Alok Kumar to assist us during cricket session.
"Good concept. Their Activities will keep you busy throughout. All their activities are for adults mostly. Very few of them for kids under 18. Good place to test someone's physical endurance.Just felt terribly sad about an activity. In the Dog Walking activity, you get to walk with a dog. There they have husky and other breeds of dogs that survive only in snowy areas. They keep them in an air conditioned cold room to cope up with that thing. How irony is that since their volunteers write, ""We love animals"". Atleast they should keep only those dog breeds that can withstand lonavala temperature without the need of air conditioners and similar synthetic situations. Let the huskies and similar breeds be freed."
Staff is outstanding. I hope they continue and bring enjoyment to everybody . Kavita from ATV rides was very attentive towards guest hatts off to team Della . Suggest a jumbo pack for everyone if u visit della.
"Loved the sports activities and the adventure, especially liked cricket and other shooting activities. It was fun. Shout out to Prasad."
"Nice experience with the activities, especially the dirt bikes and Kundan and Kavita. Booking was a pain. Entry staff is not hospitable."
All the activities where really good. Had gone on a Monday so less crowd and could do all the activities without waiting. Would recommend going on a weekday (except Friday). And if you want to have more fun take the jumbo pass. Water and food is very expensive inside.
It was amazing experience. More than 50+ activities and we could hardly manage 20. Full paisa wasool. Best experience was archery with helpful staff Alok kumar and Prasad. Cheers!! Keep rocking.
"Its a great place to experience all kind off adventure,  at really safe environment. A zone's activities  are pretty fun. Like knock out,  bull ride,  roller zorb,  rocket ejector and kids zone.

Had a wonderful time at Della Adventure Resort. Most of the activities are only available in this Resort and no where else in India. They are very particular about the safety and hygiene during the activities. The best activity was the Land Zorbin and the best place to chill in the resort is the sports bar. The virtual activities were guided very nicely by Arohi Jadhav and Nikhar and GRE Zaheer.Thanks a lot to the whole group of people who helped in enjoying all the rides. Special thanks to Mr. T J and team for guiding us about how to spend the day so that we can enjoy most of the rides in the resort.
