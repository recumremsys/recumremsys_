"It's a very small compound and the Buddha, while old, is not as large as some photos make it seem. Much larger Buddha in Hong Kong. Going into the statue is possible, but very tight."
"I have visited many statues of Buddha around the world, every one of them has something special about it.  Cast over 500 years ago, you can go inside the statue and see some of how it was done and get an idea of the devotion it took to create this attraction.  My beautiful bride and I went on a very, very hot summer day, but he feel of the grounds and the peaceful energy made it seem like a very pleasant day.  Even if Buddhism is not your cup of tea, this is worth a visit.  The walk from the train station took all of ten minutes.  Lots of shopping along the way."
This is a popular site so be prepared for a crowd. The Great Buddha is 750 years old and an iconic image. Read the history and posters about this before going or while there. It’s an additional ¥20 to go inside but it is worthwhile if you are interested in the construction.
"Went there from Tokyo by metro and the really old but wonderfully restored old Train. The Buddha is amazing, even when there are more temples in the city where you can spend much more time on."
"The second biggest Buddha in Japan is pretty impressive, with the temple surrounding it equally welcoming. Get there before 4:30pm so you can actually go inside the Buddha to see how it's pieced together. If you want to earn the sight, take the Daibutsu ""hiking"" trail - it's an easy 3km along a forest path, passing a handful of shrines. Start from Kita-Kamakura station."
"Stunner.   This impressive, magnificent Buddha is a national treasure.  Built in 1252 (took TEN years) it is imposing and beautiful.   I have been here twice.  Once there were NO people and one time JAM PACKED on the weekend.   So if you can visit on a week day maybe that is better.  :)"
"The great Buddha of Kamakura is one of the biggest Buddha in the world. The height including the pedestal is about 13.4 meters. Be aware there is nothing else to see then the buddha. Long time ago the Buddha was housed in a hall, but they get destroyed by strong winds. Normally you can visit also the inside of the Buddha, but we had very bad weather so we were not able to visit."
This well-kept temple is one of the top attractions in this perfect town.  Stunning in size and fun to see many local people visiting it.  We had a group of school children approach us wanting to try their English out. Take the time to go into the structure.  The street from trolley station to the temple has some excellent shops and restaurants.
Incredible site to see. The Great Buddha of Kamakura was cast 750 years ago.  Get here early to avoid the crowds.  The JR railway takes you to Kamakura station and you ride the local subway (200 ¥ ) three stops to Hase.  The Great Buddha is about  a 10-15 walk from the Hase station.
"Spent a day at Kamakura, came here to see the famous BIG BUDDHA.  Although is huge it is hallow inside.  The weather is perfect so i went trakking on the hillside just right behind the big buddha.  At the top of the hillside, there is a Cafe called ""Tree Garden"".The property was bought by the late founder of Hikori Corp where he made it a summer house and he had offered  to trekker who trespass his property a cup of green tea and I accidentally came across this place and enjoyed a cup of fruit tea and a simple lunch.Continue the trekking and you will get to visit a few more temples in the surrounding area before heading back to Tokyo."
We spent the day visiting a number of attractions. The big Buddha is an amazing feat . The area is easy to get to by bus from the station. Get a day pass at the information office at the station. An easy day trip from Tokyo with a one hour each way JR train from Tokyo station
Located at Kamakura u can see a big statue of Buddha . The atmosphere is very clean. And it is not so expensive. Lots of people praying and wishing makes u happy. Being a nepalese it really feels good to see that big statue of Lord Buddha .
Had been there. It is quite tall and while entering the statue we realize that it is neither easy to construct or restore these monuments.
You have to pay to see enter the area. In there you will find the big Buddha which is quite nice. Other than that there is nothing much to see. Is it worth to see? I think yes since its not expensive to enter. But don't expect to much
I was very lucky as I got to see the Daibutsu (Giant Buddha) statue during the covid Pandemic and the weather was perfect. Only a hand full of people. Easy to get to from both Hase tram station and from Kamakura station. I didn't get to climb the stairs inside the statue as access was closed temporarily but the view of this magnificent Buddha was very inspiring. Do not visit Kamakura and miss this.
"While it is certainly remarkable that they built such a big statue with a very ingenious technique, it is really just one statue and nothing more. Pass by if you will but don’t go too much out of your way for it."
Amazing amazing amazing view of an enormous Buddha. Loved the surroundings and walking through the forested path to the statue. Worth a visit and time spent taking photos and enjoying and the ambience. Surprisingly not busy for a summer August day!
"The trip out to Kamakura to see the Great Buddha is a must do!  We took a day trip from Tokyo (about an hour by train) to Kamakura, leaving early as to beat the crowd.  Once arriving at the train station we grabbed some breakfast (pastries and quiche) at Deli France, yummm!  We then walked to the park to see the Great Buddha, arriving around 8:30 a.m. Arriving early allowed us to get some great pictures and afforded us some peaceful time in the beautiful surroundings.  We then made our way back to town (a short walk) and visited the shops.  For lunch, we decided to go off the beaten path for a little food at a place called Hideyoshi, a Yakitori spot. It was delicious!  The day trip was a nice  get-a-way from the bustling city and allowed us to recharge our batteries.  :)"
Something like 900 years old.  2nd highest in Japan I think.  Made of copper I believe.  Lots of cool artsy statues.   Nice courtyard.
"Stunning views of the Great Buddha at Kamakura.  Caused us to stop and admire the statue, walked around it a couple of times to appreciate its size and art work.A great tribute to the religion of Buddha."
"Entry is at 300 yen. Not much inside but still interesting to visit the big Buddha statue, so I think the price is fair. Avoid the crowd by going early in the morning. Toilets available and also small shop for refreshments and souvenirs."
"This was a lovely day out, lots of temples and lovely train journey. The Buddha for me was the highlight. Recommended."
Don’t expect to much since this is a shrine but it’s a great site. Cost ¥300 to enter. Could do solo or like minded friends
"The town of Kamakura is a very authentic beach town only an hour and some change outside of the the hustle and bustle of Tokyo.There are a few great shrines and temples, but none more interesting and impressive that the Great Buddha. Made all the more unique by the fact that you can literally walk into his belly.A worthwhile visit to this town and this marvel."
"Majestic, peaceful and massive - this Buddha is worth a visit. Burn some incense, say a prayer and take in the calm. Stroll around the surrounding areas and absorb the harmony."
"In the middle of a quaint community, sits the Great Buddha, out under the skies, welcoming in serious and peaceful contemplation.  The garden is open till 5pm and has an entrance fee.   From Kamakura, take the Enoden (Enoshima Electric Railway) Line and get off at Hase.  Turn right and head onwards to the Kotoku-in.  Be prepared to walk with a multitude of tourists and pilgrims to this sacred and most beloved site."
"A must to visit to see the big Buddha, spectacular. About 40 mins from Tokyo. Crowded with many tourists."
"The Great Buddha stands nearly 12 metres high and is an impressive sight. Made of bronze, the verdigris patina adds to the grandeur of the statue. Make sure you go inside, where you can see how they re-welded the head in 1960. A must see if visiting Kamakura or Tokyo."
A must see. Allow yourself some time. It is a national treasure. Constructed of the Daibutsu  began in 1252. Lots of people taking photos and coaches everywhere. Outside there is a little market with lots to see and buy. Kamakura is a trendy suburb and lots of trendy shops to visit if you have the time.
Great shrine and the giant Buddha is definitely worth seeing. Don't plan to spend more than 20 min here; the shrine is small. ¥200 admission fee.
"I went to Tokyo in 2016 and planned to visit the Great Buddha of Kamakura (Daibutsu) in Kotokuin temple, unfortunately, there was some renovation going on and the temple was closed for months.I went back to Tokyo once again in 2017, this time the temple opened as normal and we could visit Daibutsu.It was a clear day, so it was very lovely there.Worth visiting!After that we walked to Hasedera temple. Along the way, there were lovely shops along the street. Recommended to have a look along the street too!"
I have not been to the big Buddha for the last 20 years.  Did a day trip from Tokyo. Started early and arrived before 9 am. Calming and majestic. I paid 20 yen j more to get inside the belly of the Buddha. Tour groups started pouring in around 9 am. Avoid weekends.
Definitely worth a visit. It’s so massive and the surrounding area is gorgeous! Spend that extra 20 yen and have a peek inside.
"The first place when I’m traveling (Yokohama-Tokyo area). Feeling get powerful when you praying in front  of the Great Buddha. Nice & lovely town Kamakura , Fresh food also."
"After reading about some guided tours from northern Kamakura down through the hiking trails to the Buddha, we decided to just try and do it on our own. We were very happy we did because the peace and quiet of doing it as a couple was wonderful. Finishing our hike with the Buddha felt slightly triumphant. We didn't go inside of the Buddha, but it felt like a nice way to finish the day. We went in July and probably got there about mid-day but it wasn't ridiculously crowded, although busy. Very beautiful and impressive up-close. Kamakura was a very fun day trip for us outside of visiting Tokyo--I highly recommend it."
