visited in monsoons...amazing view and very organised temple. took ropeway train and was amazed to travel one. One of the lifetime experience
"The temple is on up-hill,the place is very calm n beautiful and feeling satisfied while taking the darshan of mata's ( saptashrungi devi mata). Go in the early morning for the relax darshan.and also do visit saputara hill station is near to drive through temple base vani..its measure attraction of tourists."
"Been to this place while our second trip from hathgad, this temple is 22km from the nasik saputara main road, this temple is located on the hill, so to reach you need to climb the stairs some 350 to 400 steps uphill or you can take newly started rope way to reach the main temple Rs 80/- for return journey per person, recommended for all devotees especially  senior citizens, here they have good parking facility with a charge of 50/- per vehicle, the rope way has a waiting lounge with toilet facility very neat and clean and with lots of options for dining like snacks or meals at very reasonable prices, its a divine and peaceful place, many peoples from very far distance come here to take the blessings of the goddess. its a must visit place if you are near to the nasik."
A temple located on hill with amazing landscapes.  Place is peaceful and relaxing. Went on family trip to take Darshan of Saptashrungi devi. A must visit place near from Nashik.
"As we stayed at Club Mahindra, Hatgad, we decided to visit this temple which is atop a hill and around 25 kms from Wani.The cable car was not in operation and we climbed those steep steps to reach the top.Just 2 mandala before the temple at the top, the crowd started accumulating and became standstill as they were allowing people in groups after every 15 minutes or so.It was a scary situation as we were all standing packed on the steps and one single wrong movement would have ended up in a stampede killing people. Added to this was ladies with frenzy of Devi and a handicapped guy pushing the crowd  which really scared us.The ultimate entry and darshan of Devi cooled down our mind and feelings.Rtn J Ganesh"
"I visited the temple during last weekend. Its exactly 240 kms from mumbai. I strtd at 7 frm my house and rchd thr at 12. I took two breaks in between. Went upto nashik and then after a big flyover in nashik city, i took a u turn for some distance and then went inside city to reach thr via vani. The state highway was ok types and not so bad. Last 14 kms of journey was totally in hills with lot of hairpin bands and i suggest u not to take to drive if u arent an expert driver.I parked the car in one of the poooja material shop after many of them were jumping onto my car. The person charged me 200 rs for a pooja stuff of just 30-40 rs. I knew i was being overcharged but i still paid him otherwise they would have told me to remove my car from there. After reaching top, it felt a sense of relief. Mata was there sitting in hill and we took her blessing and then left for nashik..."
"I visited the temple on 26th January 2013 with my wife. It was my fifth visit to this beautiful Shrine. It has close to 1000 steps before you reach near the idol. The weather was very pleasant. This mandir is 1/2 shaktipeeth out of 3.5 peeths in maharashtra. There was huge rush as it was holiday and poornima. It took us 3.5 hrs to reach the top,but was excellent experience. All the people visiting Nashik should definitely visit this temple. Recommended!"
"Devi is situated on a hill top,one needs to climb 500 steps to enter the  Saptashrungi temple. the temple is well maintained and is of religious importance. All the people visiting Nashik should definitely visit this temple. Recommended!"
It is a wonderful place on top of the hills. Roads are excellent and so is the view from the hill top. A rope way is being constructed and could ease the journey to the top for the aged. Avoid it on Tuesdays and holidays when it becomes overcrowded. Food in and around the area is average. Good and cool weather all round.
"We took a public transport bus which goes up in the hill. The road while reaching the temple is nice and i felt awesome.There is a market. But this place is not very clean. Many of the shopkeepers persuade you to keep your chappals in their shop and take something from them. Yes if you want to u cn take, but there is a chappal stand at the foot of temple. We need to climb 500 steps. I did not count it. But i think its not 500 less than that becoz it was easy.Here some work is going on all building material here and there. This place needs proper management. i cud nt see any rescue material like fire extinguishers etc. The Devi was so nice. We had nice Darshan. Police are there in temple.We see a nice mountain while climbing steps which has the shape of Lord shiva PindThen we got to know there is a Annachatra here. Its a bit far away from mandir. They charge Rs.15/- for it but that is fine. Here also cleanliness was average. The food was nice.The authorities shud make better arrangement for public. I cud see work here. let see now."
Must visit this place who love nature. Situated on hill of mountains Goddess saptasrungi temple. You required to take around 400 steps to reach there. Very good place for worship of goddess but there is no washroom facility available nearby. Natural scenery is awesome.
Travelling from trimbak we reached vani at 10 am And started getting up .> about 350 steps >haif an hour to climb up for darshan of mataji > take prasad > perform pooja by brahmin> best place to visit > avoid saturday sunday tuesday friday otherwise place is very nice Lots of hotels for breakfast. But for stay not so good
Its holly place to visit. This place was very attractive. To reach some amount of physical activity require. surrounding was very beautiful.
"The most historic and religious place. It is one the important holy place of three and half Shakti peethas. Climbing stairs test your physical fitness. very good place. The arrangements of stay, food are very good. Attending mahapooja at 5 of clock in early morning is a great experience. Maata Saptrashrungi was family daity of the grate Saint Dyaneshwar and we being descendants, she is our family daity also."
"It is around 75 kms from Nasik has a temple of saptashrungi devi ( considered a shaktipeeth for the religious) on a cliff. Need to climb 500 steps to reach it. Also a funicular trolley  has been installed for the convenience of the people but yet to commence operation as in APRIL'2016, may be some time in future. A small village provides spectacular view of the satpuras and shayadri ranges. A lot of historical forts are located in surrounding area in radius of 50 km. Most accessible and close being hatgadh at a distance of 40 km. Worth visiting for a day out ."
"Cool Place. Nice drive from Mumbai via Nashik. The climb on the hill is nice and roads are well maintained. Parking is a problem. Search for govt parking  else you have pay 500 to buy some useless sarees. The Rope-way is great experience. Very well maintained and professional. Once you reach the top, The queue is not much.. 30 mins maybe. Beware of monkeys. You can stay on the top if you want to feel the mountain ranges. So if you are in Nashik visit SaptaShrungi and on the way visit Swami Samarth Mutt. Nice place."
"Wonderful place. At the hill top is one of the Shaktipeetha of India, Mata Saptashrungi. You can either climb the stairs or take a vehicle which costs Rs 90/- for return journey per person.There is a food court with lots of options. Earlier you reach here the better for you in terms of temperature. Visited the place in 4th week of July. So it was quite hot during the afternoon. Though you might hear there is a bus from Nasik in every 10 mins but that is not true. I missed one bus & the next one was after 1 & half hours. Being a solo traveller I didn't want to travel by a car alone. Fortunately met another family and together with some other people we came by a car. Attached is the photo of the number plate. Please do not travel by this car if you are travelling from Nasik by a car. Just to make sure we returned by the same car while returning to Nasik the driver & some locals misled us saying that we had to leave the shoes in the car as we would not be allowed anywhere near the temple premises with the shoes which was a complete lie. He parked the car at least 2 kilometres or more from the temple boundary. However after reaching the temple premises we found out that there are designated places for shoes to be kept. It was extremely hot and the road conditions are not at all walkable. As a result I burnt my feet and had other cut injuries. After returning when I asked the driver as to why he lied this gentleman along with other locals started fighting and the locals with sheer arrogance told me that ""it's our job to say all that"". Since I was travelling alone & by then injured my feet I was scared to say anything further. Friends everything else is fine in this place but please avoid this car for your safety & specially if you are travelling solo."
"Shaktipeetam is what we liked? We need to climb around 350 steps. Do not buy either flowers or Saree for the deity. The are recycled through pandits and sales women. Do not park car with flower sellers , if you do not buy , they will be rude and ask you to remove your car."
"i DID not know whether I would really climb this 500 and odd steps to see the Temple. I was really scared till about 200 steps and bravely went  upto the temple. Believe me IT WAS WORTH IT. I  enjoyed every moment at the temple. There is shade all through and you can just sit relax and then proceed. Once you reach the temple and see the Goddess, so beautiful and nice, you will forget your tiredness. It is so calm and cool inside, just relax for sometime after the darshan and then proceed to climb down. The construction work is going on and there is a deviation and but no problem.    The temple also has the facility for food and water. It costs about Rs' 14/ and there is sumptuous and tasty meal and do not miss to have lunch here.   Also many shops selling pooja articles, photos, prasadams and many more things. take your time and buy items if you want to. There is a long drive on the hills to reach the bottom of the temple.which is on seven hills. The drive itself is so pretty and enjoyable, one feels very relaxed and happy.    The Garbagruh has the statue of Goddess and pooja is performed through the day.Do take some water while you climbing the steps.   Arrangements are being made for the ropeway facility, Once ropeway starts functioning many more aged and old devotees will have easy access to see the goddess and take darshan of Maa Bhagavathi and offer pooja."
Great pilgrimage to mataji temple. There is tram that helps anyone who cannot climb via thd 510 steps to the temple. Allow 2 to 3 hours at least.
Beautiful temple away from the city of Nashik. You need to drive long to reach to this temple. Beautiful drive on good road. Easy to reach to this holy place. You need to climb many stairs . Be Careful of monkeys. The view from temple is awesome.
"A must visit.550 stairs to climb.Scenic all around.They are very soon starting a rope way sort of thing.Monkey around. Take precaution.Parking is available at local shops, from where you have to purchase some stuff."
Excellent place to visit this temple whenever you have minimum 4 to 5 hours to spare from your Nashik Visit . Took OLA ride outstation for family to travel to/ from between Nashik to Satpashrungi & back . Roads are not up to the mark .  Took 1 hour 45 minutes to travel from Nashik to Saptashrungi considering  bad road condition. Took Rope way / cable car for going to temple otherwise option were around 510 steps. Very good option for having lunch ( six / seven shops are selling food items ). Took more than 75 minutes in queue at top considering New Year day ( Next day of Diwali ). Person should carry water bottles.
"The goddess is very divine and the place is full of monkeys, but they do not harm anyone. Visited 3 times earlier. In rainy season it feels heavenly."
Also known as Vani Devi ... Mata is blessed with the powers to bless you with your muraad being fulfilled. Well located thru a scenic drive from Nasik towards Saputara...turn Right before 35 kms approx. Cloudy mountains & hillside with lots of greenery during monsoon and a good time naturally during winter. The stairs going up to behold the Darshan of Mata are well covered overhead for the devotees protection from direct sun ...with resting places in between. Coming down is a sweet feeling of fulfillment.
On the Saputara Nashik road 25 kms from Vani town. The drive is pleasing. Perched on a hilltop and mostly at a height higher than Saputara this is worth a visit. A typical temple setup with commercial activities at the foot of the temple.
"Need to take buses to reach till the base of the temple, private cars are not allowed. The bus service is good and frequent, although the buses are rickety. The climb to the temple would take almost 2 hours given the crowd/ queue. Advisable to carry water bottles along and refill it along the way. Plenty of eateries for simple food."
One of the must places to visit if you go to Nashik. Around 55 kms away . Takes close to two hours to reach.  Beautiful temple on the hilltop.  Temple food is available at nominal rates .  It is a bit spicy but very good taste.
"Combined a trip to this place with a trip to Trimbakeshwar. Drove to this place from Trimbakeshwar -it is about 93 kms, took us about 2.5 hours. Started at about 8:00 in the morning and reached at about 10:30 AM - traffic was rather high.Very good roads, except in short stretches of bad surface. Parking - plenty, provided by locals in sheds. They do not charge for parking if you buy puja material from them.The climb up to the temple is about 450 steps. Took us about 20 minutes or so the climb. not a very difficult climb. For the senior citizens / disabled, they have what is called doli - a chair fitted on a couple of bamboos and carried by 2- 4 guys. They charge Rs 500.For senior citizens, the entry to the temple is direct, one does not have to wait in the queue. We had visited the temple on a Sunday - as we had gone with senior citizens, we could enter the temple directly, without having to wait. Even if we had to wait, it would have probably taken 15 - 25 minutes maximum.Quite a few stall in the approach to the temple stairs - selling everything from food to puja material. Good experience."
Being a local i have been coming regularly here. Best time to visit is monsoon season when clouds takeover the whole area and temple view is above the clouds. There are quite a lot of stairs to be climbed for reaching to temple. Adventuros ppl can take their own climbing way to reach the stairs on top and climate is quite cool making the place perfeft.
"Commonly referred as Vani mata temple, this place is approximately 2 hours drive from Nashik. Located atop a hill feature, it provides a very beautiful view to the visitors"
"One of the best place to visit in nasikk!  Feel the nature and spiritual at one place. Best to visit in rainy season. Cloud around your car or bike during awesome road trip up to temple. Small waterfall in road.  If like to eat fish then Ozarkhed is the place 10 km away from vani, in Nasik ani road. It's actually dam."
"travelling by bus when you watch how your  vehicle going  with mountain you got enjoy.  the idle of Devi give us peace of heart,the story of this place also attract you.please if are go  in the winter must go at night.the starful sky and  the light ohf the bottom town. it's wonderful scene."
"We have visited Saptashrungi Temple in end may, it has best view of waterfall from mountains in monsoon. There are private car parking they charge 100-150 rs. Makes sure temple is very crowded on Tuesdays and Fridays, long standing que. but once you get darshan you feel blessed. Not advisable to stand in que with small kids as once you get in que you can not get out from it. You can make donations at temples's office and get receipt and prasad.You will find snacks shops try for palak bhaji kanda bhaji. There is also temple's own prasadi where they serve chapati rice dal shira at minimal price of 15 rs it is well maintained clean and hygiene.Overall wonderful experience."
Great place on the outskirts of Nashik. Excellent for an enjoyable day trip. Go for the scenic location and the exotic surroundings.
