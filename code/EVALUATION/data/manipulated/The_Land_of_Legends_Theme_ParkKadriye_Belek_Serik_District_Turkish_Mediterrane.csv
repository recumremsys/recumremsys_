"Had a fun night with friends. Show was really amazing and fun with rich content especially the show in the water and play of lights. This is a place where you don‚Äôt get bored even for a minute. It is so pleasant to have stroll around, watch the show which you‚Äôll feel compelled to make an Instagram live to show off to your list of friends. After the show, we had dinner at one of the restaurants and listened to live music from the neighbouring concert in the theme park. We had a really good time and endless selfies."
Staying at the kingdom hotel with 2 adults 2 children. Amazing from start to finish. So much to do for all ages. Hotel clean and food is amazing best holiday ever. Will be returning next year. Sad to be leaving tomorrow. Mehmet Surneli is my favourite all staff are welcoming and helpful.
"We were looking forward to staying at this 5* hotel expecting 5* service and facilities I will list pros and cons to make this Review easier.Pros - hotel is very grand/ clean- service is quite quick- facilities for kids are very good- staff friendly with kids- kids activities extensive- catered to mines and children allergies ( very big pro )- rooms are nice for children- outside hotel area there is a lovely shopping complex and cafes.Cons- I was expecting a hotel only pool only to find its part of the water park which everyone is accessing as nobody is even there to check who is using the pools. Leading to no beds being available.- in water park there are TWO towel areas. This means you are walking across 5-10 minutes to get towels which you have to lay out yourself ( something in a 5* resort you do not really do).- hotel buffet is awful it‚Äôs very basic. I was expecting more variety different cuisines such as Japanese.- lunch is a la carte not buffet only pizza burgers fried food. For those wanting a healthier choice you have to pay for grilled food. - The edging in the shower  is all black and full of mould in  ( will post a pic)- rooms have stains on walls and carpet- we changed room due to this. - the pools are absolutely freezing, to the point I have pain entering the water ( seriously no exaggeration). Kids refuse to swim.- Overall sadly would not return. I think if I paid less I would expect less. But we paid a little less than a holiday to Dubai. So was expecting high standards. If you are regulars to the Middle East do not expect this hotel to meet those standards- there is no comparison."
"Well worth a visit to this theme park.  It is very well laid out, lots of things to do for every age and good value for money.  Very clean and easy to find your way round.  Don't miss the sea life show, it's amazing.  You are given a wrist band on entry and you can load money onto it to use during the day for lockers, food etc any unused money is refunded at the end of your visit.Also, next to the Theme Park is a huge shopping mall that is free to enter and has lots of shops to suit every pocket and taste.  They also do daily shows along the main mall area and canal this is free from dance routines with fairy tale characters and music set to dancing fountains.  Well worth a visit."
Had a lovely day at Land of Legends theme park. Highly recommended to all of the family. We loved the dolphin show and seeing the sea lion. The park is beautifully presented . 10/10 for us üëçüèª Mehmet was lovely and asked how out day was and of there was anything else he could do. All the staff are really helpful and friendly .
Having fun at land of legends with family and friends. Lots to do for the kids and adults and great service
"Took a trip here with our family whilst staying at the Adalya Elite Lara. We had a good day, we split up so that the younger ones could go on rides and older kids could go on the roller coasters. The younger ones seemed to have more fun as there were more rides. The older ones did just 3 rides in one morning, the queues were too much for them and unlike Florida parks there is no reprieve from the heat of the day!We spent the afternoon at the pools and although enjoyable was really not much better than our own hotel.When choosing our holiday we were split between the hotel here and our own hotel and after visiting the park we were so happy we hadnt chosen to stay here. Seems like a park just plonked in the middle of nowhere. We were quite happy to return to our hown hotel. Although had a great day, we wouldnt return."
"I recently visited the Land of Legends with my husband and my 2 year old son. We had the most fantastic time and it is definitely a place to visit if you have children. It is a very child friendly place both for activities and decor. The staff were phenomenal-nothing was ever too much trouble. The night managers especially Mahir and Ali treated us like family, they took the time out to get to know us and really made us feel special. They constantly asked if we needed anything and we‚Äôre always happy to accommodate. We celebrated my husbands 40th and my sons 2nd birthday and the staff made both their days an exceptional celebration. Knowing that my son loved going up and down in a lift they even threw him a surprise party by decorating and cutting a cake in a lift! I can not highly recommend this place enough."
"Felt the need to review as quite a few negative comments about this place. All aqua parks the world over are the same. Height restrictions and lots of rules. My two kids are 9 and 7 and 134cm and 121cm tall. You need to be 120cm to qualify for most of the aqua park decent rides and 130cm to qualify for most of the coasters in the theme park. If you are staying in belek on an all inclusive where your hotel already has a few water slides and your kids are shorter than 120cm, then I‚Äôm not sure this is the place for you, especially after you‚Äôve been mugged off by the local taxi cartel.Land of legends is a great family day out, it‚Äôs clean, organised, new and large enough to cope with being busy. It‚Äôs like a Turkish version of a mini Disney world. Food is ok, changing facilities are ok. Clever lockers. Decent security checks on way in/out. Most of the staff spoke enough English to get by (a lot better than my Turkish!)Dolphin / animal show is worth watching and it feels like the animals are well looked after.The hyper coaster is worth the entrance fee alone. My 9year old absolutely loved it.The only reason why I haven‚Äôt given this 5 stars is because they insist on blaring out loud music and tannoy announcements all the time, I‚Äôm a bit deaf so found this very annoying.Enjoy."
It was the first time when we visited this place its really amazing place a lot of activities BUT not private safes for free. In the entrence security checked bags and not allowed water. Try only one attraction taken one hour because of queue crowded people. Thats ok next big problem they not allow use mobile phones and no safe to put it. During the slipping you should take of shoes in result you go by stones its really difficult especially in the sun.
"We visited this park 2 years ago and had a great time that felt like good value. Not this time.We paid ¬£190 for a family of 2 adults and 2 kids aged 12 & 13 which seemed like a lot, especially with the current exchange rate of just under 7 lira -¬£.Everything seemed more expensive this year, especially the food. You cannot take your own food in which leaves you no option but to pay the high prices that they charge. Both of my kids are celiacs with special dietary requirements yet they weren‚Äôt adequately catered for and we struggled to feed them. No real concept of cross contamination!!!There were much more restrictions in place this year, even in the wave pool where there was a life guard stopping people going out above shoulder height, even though the vast majority of the pool wasn‚Äôt being used?!?! All the life guards seem to spend most off their time blowing their whistles at anyone for anything, in the end it became white noise that no one responded to!The worst thing for me though is he queues. You queue to get your ring, you queue to get in the queue, you queue at the top of the ride.......also, certain nationalities don‚Äôt understand the concept of taking their turn, yet the park staff seem to just accept it?! There was a ride that required blue toboggan mats that was massively underused because you have to join one big queue for about 4 other rides where people are waiting at the top, yet they only let a few through at a time regardless of what ride you want to go on?! This meant that for 90% of the time nobody was on this ride yet there were people in the main queue waiting to go on it?!Overall it was a disappointing trip for us, overpriced, large unnecessary queues and too many restrictions.Oh, and tell the life guards to stop. Losing their whistles so much, it‚Äôs ceased to be effective!"
"We were staying approx 1 mile from this water park. Visited twice during our holiday. Second time we purchased Fast Track passes for our two children. Without these, you are looking at approx 45 mins to an hour. Ticket price approx ¬£60.00 ea, so works out an expensive day out on top of ¬£45/¬£50 entrance fee. Apart from this, it was not packed out. Everything is purchased through a wrist band which you put money on. Refund of balance at end of the day, not a problem. We found this to be a good day out, about 7 hours was enough for the four of us. ."
"We like the park This is first time for us but not the last time Just please we see only two place for towels, I think need more .. Also the lifeguard please some of them need more training to be polite with us .. Thank you üôèüèº"
Very fun. Kids really enjoyed. Lots of activities. Very friendly staff. Stayed in the hotel. Worth to visit.
"The park is immaculate and well laid out, plenty of eateries and charging points. 2 teens and 5 adults spent all day in large waterpark which closes at 6.30, very long queuing for some so does need re-organising. Then into fairground until 9pm, though this can be accessed at any time during the day, again well laid out. Carry on into area in front of hotel to beautiful area with amazing shops, eateries and entertainment, we were in the complex from 10am to 10.30pm, well worth the cost and highly recommended"
"We visited as a family of 5 & thought the price was a tad expensive for a Turkish theme park before we arrived HOWEVER, it was good value after our visit. On the day we visited (Thursday), the water slides were fairly busy (average 30-45 mins wait) but when we visited the roller coaster rides in the afternoon, they were extremely quiet, lucky if we queued more than 10 mins for majority of rides. Dolphin/Walrus show was good entertainment midday. Wave pool..........man, those life guards love the sound of their whistle, lol. Appreciate they're on guard & to protect everyone BUT that's all you heard whenever the waves were on. Nothing negative to report albeit food prices were a tad on the expensive side for simple fast food. Expect that though when there's no competition. Overall, a great park & would strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys water/thrill rides. I go to Florida regularly & this is on par with the theme parks from there."
"Best day of our holiday ! Brilliant loved it from start to finish. We took our 9yr old and 14yr old they both loved it we met friends there. If you are unsure about going like us because of queues or heat I can ensure you it is not a problem. You may wait a little while for a couple of the slides but it is summer! It‚Äôs worth the wait. We went the theme park at 3pm and ran on every single ride waited 5 mins at most! 9yr old went on everything at 130cm, two huge rollercoasters aswell you can buy video footage, expect rickshaw which is 135cm. Ground are lovely, very clean exceptional service, staff all lovely, polite. Wave pool fab nice bar behind it. Food in open restaurant was amazing and it‚Äôs table service. Defo worth going! Don‚Äôt be put off like we nearly was!"
"Went here as a party of 13 adults in early September.  It is a beautiful looking park, we got there literally as it opened and went on as many rides as we could before it got too busy.  The queuing system for rides is a bit confusing as my kids joined a queue for one ride and ended up on a totally different one :) By lunchtime the place was heaving and the queues were huge, so went over to the dry part of the park, less rides, but a fair selection.  One of the big ones wasn't working the day we were there so slightly disappointing.  The dolphin show was nothing special, so unless you have little kids that haven't seen one of these shows before, I wouldn't bother and would spend the time going on the rides while most of the park is at the show. The floors underfoot were really rough, even going up the stairs to the rides.  I do understand that they have to be made of a non-slip surface and not one that attracts the heat too much, but I saw so many people limping towards the end of the day!  If you have the type of beach shoes that you can wear on slides, then take them!The food areas were good, compared to other water parks we have been to and the food was of a really good quality and very reasonably priced. You have to put money on your wrist when you arrive to be able to pay for anything during the day, we thought this would be a real pain, but it was fine.  You can add money onto your wrist at any of the food outlets.  Also lockers just need a euro coin and they are placed beside your sunbeds, so really easy to get stuff in and out when you need it, rather than at a bank of lockers which other places have. The shopping and restaurant area is located just outside of the theme park, really beautiful, with amazing shops, but very very expensive, all high end designer shops.  We didn't stay for the show at 10pm as it works out a very long day, but would like to go back another time to just see this, as this part of land of legends is free entry. Would I go back? Probably, as its nice to get out of your hotel, but it doesn't compare to the Disney parks or to the Siam Park in Tenerife."
"We went for a day trip to the aqua park and then the theme park late afternoon. The slides in the aqua park are fantastic but we really recommend that you upgrade to fast track to ensure you get on all the rides. If not then expect over 1 hour in queues. To be fair to the park they always ensure that you are in the shade whilst queuing and health and safety is number 1 priority. It is an expensive day out but it is worth it. If you don‚Äôt participate in any of the rides or theme park then don‚Äôt go, it will only end up in an expensive spectator day and your time would be better spent in another part of the complex. The staff around the venue were always courteous and the life guards were superb and were vigilant at all times. The theme park had some of the best rides I have ever experienced. Superb. It is however a long day in the sun and please ensure you pace yourself for the day. Paying at the gate proved the best option rather than going through our Tui rep who tried to rip us off. Highly recommend this for a day out but make sure you have the energy and bottle to go on all the rides."
"We visited the land of legends (dry park) in  this December with 3 children 13,11 and 6yrs old respectively, free entry as Rixos premium Belek guests!  First day was raining but we had dinner in the amazing and stylish Nemo restaurant excellent value for money and  high level of customer service. Staff have rain ponchos and umbrella to use during our visit and we were now to do in building activities. The next visits were dry with temp 18-21 degrees on various days. Park was lovely as no crowd no queues and the kids were able to  have multiple  go on rides. We did 80% on day 1 took about 4hrs. You get to buy videos(uploaded to your Samsung phone and pictures).  There is a small session for penguins as well.The dolphin show is actually in 3 parts: dolphins, walrus and beluga whales 3 shows covering 1hr!  Dolphin shows have been our staple in Spain but this show is on another level very classy and the animals are happy. The dry park still has a good number of rides and the typhoon coaster which ends in water so nice.There is food and drink around the park you buy this as no food allowed inside except water. Make sure you do the sky walker! Night show was out of the world  Christmas market, Santa ,elves,reindeers ,king and queen fireworks smoke effect bubbles in streets and glitter it was very Christmassy. And all day Christmas songs bellowed around the park from speakers, so we danced our way round actually. We will definitely be back again . This made our Christmas."
"I've visited this amazing place yesterday with my family. It's a huge theme park, Rixos Land of Legends. There are water attractions, land attractions and shopping street. If you come Antalya, you shoould go there and take your children too.Only minus is that it's too hot. All other is only advantage. Go there and enjoy"
"Went to Land of Legends as part of the Rixos Sungate and had a great day. My only comments are:- check whether you need a fast past and don‚Äôt believe all the ‚Äú1 review‚Äù comments from a few days ago that say you do (marketing bots?). When we went it was quiet and fast passes were not needed. In our experience, when there was a bigger queue, especially on some of the water rides, they let about 10 fast passers through, not everyone in that queue, then 30 non fast passes which was annoying for anyone who had paid extra. - do not get a fast pass for anyone just under the minimum height! The sales people are obviously on commission and will sell as many as they can including for children just under the height restrictions. They are checked at every ride and are refused. Getting a refund was difficult but we got there in the end.- the ride operators are very strict about minimum height and maximum/minimum weight. All of the water slides have weighing scales next to them and you have to get on them in front of a staff member. Great H&S but slightly rough on the ego!- eat at the restaurant as you cross into the water park (I can‚Äôt remember it‚Äôs name). The table service was really good and the food delicious. Completely unexpected but we were all impressed.- some of the walkways to the water rides are very sharp on the feet and made walking painful. Perhaps it was the end of the season but LoL need to do something urgently.Unlike a previous reviewer, we thought the park was pretty reasonably priced. But then we had Turkish Lira so perhaps this made a difference."
"Given some rides were closed due to COVID, ¬£180 for the day for 4. If you're Turkish though you get in for half price!Shopping avenue is beautiful and the hotel looks amazing."
"We recently visited Land of Legends with my Mom (70 y.o) and 2 young kids (7 and 5 y.o.). Since we had little kids with us, we focused mostly on kids related activities. As expected park is very crowded, when we arrived by 10 am (opening of the park) there were crowds of tourists (mainly Russians) coming with tour companies, but staff at the entrance dealt with crowds very effectively and soon we reached first kids play area (next to the spray area) with 5 slides for kids taller than 100 cm and small water play area for kids with kiddie slides and knee depth swimming pool. Our 5 y.o was scared to go down the 5 taller slides as when she reached the bottom she momentarily went under the water even though the water level was up to her neck), so she refused to go down again despite kind urging and support from lifeguards (they were very patient with her, giving hugs and offering to catch her in the water). As of note, parents can't go on these slides but can waddle in the kiddie pool. Next stop was at the Aqua tower (just a few steps away from kids area to the left). This is an amazing place for kids (5-9-year-old) and parents. Both kids could go on all the slides and I could join them too. We spent at least an hour there and enjoyed it very much.  Some slides have a wait 5-10 min, some have no wait time at all. Unfortunately Secret Lagoon was closed during our visit and we couldn't explore it. We spent about 2.5 hrs at the water side of the park and then went to have lunch at Nemo restaurant. It is quite a unique and quiet place, as you are seated next to the huge aquarium with tropical fish and sharks. An unforgettable experience, albeit at a premium price (roasted salmon with vegetables 125 tl; kids chicken noodle soup 35 tl). We enjoyed it, the food was delicious and the whole experience worth it. Next stop was the dry area of the park, where kids had so much fun riding carousel, uptown loop, sweet swings and others. We spent 7 hrs at the park and it was just enough for little kids. They had a great experience and so did we. Park is very clean and well maintained, guards are courteous, helpful and diligently working to make sure kids are following the rules and everyone is safe. Recommend for families with small kids, really a great and memorable experience!"
"We visited here on two separate occasions one day the theme park and then going in the shops. The other day in the water park. I have two children with Autism, ADHD, Sensory, learning difficulties, and challenging behaviours ++. We visited in Covid , and I understand that everyone needs to wear a mask. We were happy to wear masks, but the staff in the shops were very rude to you if the children did not wear masks. Even when I explained that they had learning difficulties ( it‚Äôs plain to see) and they cannot wear them due to having a meltdown ! They insisted on them standing outside the shop on their own. I did not understand this when in the airport this was not imposed ???? My son has a fear of water in his face, so I took him to the baby area. He wears a swim jacket as he feels he may drown in two inches of water. The life Guard insisted he took it off, even again after I explained his needs. No again, no allowance for special needs. What harm was he doing ? I asked the lifeguard if I could take him to the top of a small slide. As he was nervous, and wanted me to come. No again. We have been to Disney many times before, and when entering the hotel this was the feel I think they were portraying. Think again Land of legends, because you are not inclusive of all."
"Great slides and rollercoasters. Entertainment is guaranteed. Cheerful and friendly staff, especially at the white and blue rollercoasters. Be sure to take a fast track. Cleanliness is ok. Food is bad, we couldn't find a tasty meal."
"If you go to this theme park DO NOT WEAR FLIP FLOPS!!! Wear shoes that are unlikely to fall off on the rides. They make you take off your shoes if they aren‚Äôt secure and a lot of the rides have metal loading platforms. I went to this park and thoroughly enjoyed my day, however me and my family wore flip flops to this park and by the end of it due to the metal loading platforms our feet were covered in cuts burns and blisters. We had to spend the last day of our holiday in Turkey in the room as it was so painful to walk. As good as the rides were they definitely weren‚Äôt worth being unable to walk because of our saw feet. I do not recommend you visit this theme park and if you do, WEAR SECURE SHOES!"
"I have travelled to almost each corner of the world and been to Dubai's Wild Wadi Waterpark and USA's Volcano Bay by Universal and to be honest this is miles better compared to both of them and Atlantis waterpark - why? Because the resort is not only huge but incorporates a waterpark and theme park with rollercoaster rides so gives you the best of both across one site. The admission is approx ¬£50 and well worth it in my opinion coming here approx. 5 weeks ago. I am still left amazed at the beauty, standard and quality of the rides and experience - looks and feels brand new with a shopping centre and hotel on the complex too. It is located close to the airport, arrive early morning to get more time and I felt it was the biggest mistake to not have paid extra for fast track - just pay extra it is justifiable as the queues for the popular ride are huge especially in high season periods like July and August. The staff communicate well in all languages, good service and plenty of amenities across the complex and features the wristband which can be topped up with credit to spend on gifts and food very handy for an ice cream pit stop - to be fair the food is not overpriced as you would expect. As I didn't properly research and contemplate getting the fast track - I was able to go on several rides but still wanted to go on a lot more which was a shame; so take my advice and pay extra for the fast-track admission pass. And locker of course this is essential and works very efficiently via the wristband. Everything is very well maintained, even the toilets thank goodness. But I could recommend clearer sign posts and more signs to direct to different parts of the park as we spent a lot of time walking backwards and forth. But the guest relations direct you on your whereabouts. Also I'd like to say it's an amazing spot to take pictures and the entrance is truly magnificent. Distribute more time towards the waterpark rides, they are one of a kind!The money is well spent and a great day in Antalya, an absolute must you do not want to miss out otherwise what's the point of coming here!"
Average. Do not visit with very high hopes. Food is not great. Limited outdoor activities for this season. Not very friendly staff at the fish restaurant in side the park.
The attractions are really good and interesting. But there were too many people waiting in lines. Spent more time waiting under the hot Sun. They have to fix that somehow.
Loved it. It has sooo much variety for all ages. We stayed there. It closes at 6 pm. So better to spend the day there then after 6 pm move to the dry park which is also very entertaining. For families who are staying in the hotel. All of this is free. üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
"5 star hotel with soda extra in minibar.Such a shame for a Rixos family.I came here from Rixos premium belek but guess what, i did a terrible mistake by coming here. Forget about covid19 precautions and forget about social distance. Its a bazaar place in theme park.Stay away from this place.I will also write to Accor Hotels Loyalty club about the extra charge for the soft drinks at room."
"I have just spent a week here in turkey at the land of legends rixos hotel and theme park, myself, my son ages 9 and my parents, we all had an amazing holiday here at the land of legends, i found the added benefits of the rixos facilities most favorable, the beach is amazing and the food in the rixos is delicious and we were absolutely spoilt for choice with options to choose, all delicious...... and the service is incredible. they even offer night time entertainment at the rixos, and the added bonus to the land of legends show, then being able to enjoy the theme park with my son along with the beach hotel at the rixos just made it the perfect all in all holiday with the best of everything to choose. my advise is to stay at the rixos which also provide themed land of legends rooms, all inclusive is all inclusive the cocktails are to die for, in the theme park there is a selected amount of all inclusive available where as in the rixos Hotel everything is all in, I loved listening to the piano, the live band, the music is great, service is excellent, we will definitely be visiting again next year and already can not wait to come back, also the people are all friendly and everyone including all the children play together very well, my son had no problems making loads of very good friends and had a great time, he enjoyed everything about this holiday. thank you so much. also thanks to the roller skater waitors around the pool, also the dancers in the theme park, also the dolphin show is excellent. Myself and my son swam with the dolphins which was an excellent experience, my son really enjoyed this, to swim with the dolphins is extra for both myself and son was around ¬£200, definitely worth it, also my son loved the roller coaster rides, the slides, the slides are a little longer to que although they do seem to get quite towards the late afternoon, you can also keep track of the waiting times, the wave pool is amazing we had a great time in there, they definitely make this a fun time and everyone joins in the fun together. In the theme park you are unable to use cash or card to purchase added items which are extra charge as apose to your inclusive items, to purchase and pay for extra charged items you need to put money on your wrist band which you can do this in the hotel reception, or in the theme park at the main entrance and also near the wave pool...... all the staff are helpful, polite and friendly although in the theme park some do struggle to speak english and have difficulty's advising and understanding to which in some cases you kind of find out as you go. So be sure to follow the travel guide, and also the theme park map and information. The night time show at the land of legends which starts about 10pm each evening is absolutely beautiful, although each night it is the same so I recommend maybe planning your week around all the different choices to make the most of the availabilitys!!! My son loved being able to play in the land of legends arcades which is also included in your all inclusive package, the land of legends Hotel is amazing and all set out to suit your children, my son lost his phone at least twice and my mum also lost her phone and each time was handed in and returned to them both, the hotel is safely camered up so you feel comfortable knowing whilst the kids play there safe inside the hotel whilst making friends in the arcades, all in all this as to have been one of my favourite holidays thanks to all who made it extra special, üëç"
"Visited here for ‚Äúfree‚Äù as part of a holiday staying at the Rixos Sungate. I have to evaluate this the way I experienced it, so that others reading may understand what they will go through.If you are at the Rixos Sungate ‚Äì they will pick you up at 9.30am in one of seven buses ‚Äì its mayhem trying to get onto one of these buses and they cram you in like sardines, the air con doesn‚Äôt work very well and you end up in traffic due to the time they leave.We arrived (exited the bus) at 11:30am ‚Äì we were given our wristbands and told that the buses back left at 4:45pm‚Ä¶.we got through the gate, exchanged money onto the wrist band (we aware that the exchange rate is utter trash ‚Äì I lost about ¬£12 by converting Euro into Turkish Lira and put onto the wristband and then when we left they paid out in Turkish Lira not Euro) ‚Äì it‚Äôs better to put Turkish Lira on the wristband, hired a locker (that you can return to as many times as you want during the day) for around ¬£6 by the time we had finished that we got one ‚Äúgo‚Äù in the wave pool and then it was lunchtime‚Ä¶.unfortunately we went to probably the worst fast food place in the park ‚Äì over by the ‚Äúfountains‚Äù ‚Äì you want to go to the restaurant in the middle of the lazy river ‚Äì the food looked much better there. Having finished that we went to the kids play area ‚Äì this was so busy that we had to keep an eye on the littlest one at all times, lots of pushing and shoving by other bigger kids but otherwise it‚Äôs a nice area as its covered by a big tarp to keep the area in the shade for the little ones.After an hour of this I decided to go on one of the rides on my own as the kids are too small ‚Äì the one where they shut you in a capsule and the floor drops out underneath you as I have never done one of these before and wanted to experience something for the first time‚Ä¶..40 minutes queing later I am 6th from the front of the queue‚Ä¶‚Ä¶they shut the ride stating technical difficulties‚Ä¶.‚Äùwhat do I do?‚Äù I ask ‚Äì lifeguard shrugs and says ‚Äúgo on the one at the top‚Äù ‚Äì this was a simple straight down slide ‚Äì 3 seconds tops‚Ä¶..i finished that, checked the time and it was nearly 3pm‚Ä¶.i thought I can‚Äôt queue up for another one as the queues looked to have grown‚Ä¶.so went back ‚Äì had 1 more go in the wave pool with everyone and a bit of a splash‚Ä¶.then it was 4pm, time to go get dried off, ready, change the money back and we were back on the bus at 4.30pm for the 1.5 hour drive back ‚Äì total waste of a day.In summary I went on 1 ride, spent 3.5 hours in a bus and spent ¬£75 on not a lot of food/drink/locker on a free trip. The queues are beyond ridiculous ‚Äì even the fast track ticket only gets you to the front of one queue at the bottom of the steps, you will still have to queue at the top by the actual slide entrance ‚Äì this was 20 minutes itself. You won‚Äôt get a bed to put your stuff on unless you are early or are lucky either.This place is very well kept and looked after and has a very upmarket feeling and I think if you could stay say 1 hour after the others have left or be there for opening this would be worth it as you would get some time on some slides but as it is I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place to anyone especially if you were staying at the Rixos Sungate and travelling in.I didn‚Äôt even have time to get to the roller coaster part of the park ‚Äì some other families said they managed to get on the roller coasters and the park was empty as everyone was at the water park.If you go ‚Äì make sure you get there as early as possible(go in a taxi), get yourself a sunbed to dump your stuff on, don't take ANYTHING valuable so you can just leave it on the sunbed, change your Turkish Lira onto the wristband as soon as you get in, buy fast-track and just go go go ‚Äì that way you will get on the rides and enjoy the park ‚Äì there is a lot to enjoy, but it‚Äôs just not the chilled out experience it should be."
"Went here for a birthday treat for my son, day pass as couldn't afford to stay in the hotel.  We all really enjoyed the day, went on lots of water rides, by time we got through to the theme park area, there was a lot not operating but didn't deter from enjoying ourselves, went to the dolphine/whale/walrus show, kids loved it and pleased they are looked after, both my 2 will be saving up to come back to swim with them 1 day.  Came back in the evening to watch the boat show, really good atmosphere and we hope to come back very soon"
