"Do the Milford Track, they said. It's the ""finest walk in the world"", they said.  Hardly ever in my life have I been more disappointed. I was partly disappointed in myself because I believed the hype about the track, but mostly because the Milford Track is just not worth the effort, the money nor the time.  Be aware: The Milford Track is located in one of the wettest places in the world. This alone should make you suspicious. The marketing people at DOC back in the day probably thought let's try and sell the wettest place in New Zealand by calling the Track the ""finest in the world"". Well, it should be called ""wettest in the world"". The problem is: You have to book so early in advance you never know what the weather will be like. Most likely it will pour down.  This means not only will you definitely get wet, you will get soaked, even if you have good gear. Because good rain gear will protect you from the rain, but you'll sweat because that gear won't let air out, so you'll get soaked from the inside (even if it's cold outside). And you can't dry your clothes or shoes, because the huts are not equiped for that. So be prepared to walk in wet shoes for three or four days. The DOC folks in Te Anau called the wetness ""part of the fun"". Yeah, good fun indeed for an hour, but certainly not for three days.  Another thing: You basically walk in a forest the entire time. All you see is bush and more bush with one or two clearings per day. It's nice bush, but after hours and hours in it it would be nice to see mountains or something else. And on the MacKinnon pass it probably rains so even there, where you're meant to have a beautiful view, you'll most likely see a wall of grey 50m in front of you. So if you're into views: Definitely don't do it. You'll be disappointed, no question.  Ah yes, have I mentioned the sandflies? As soon as you want to have a break, they attack you. So don't even think about having a peaceful lunch time break. You'll just want to eat your sandwich as quickly as possible and then carry on - screaming children for an entire night are more peaceful and enjoyable than that.  So no, never in my life would I recommend this walk. DOC does an awesome job at PR for a terrible track. I'm sure every time someone books it they laugh and say: ""Look, we've sold the wettest and most overrated walk in the world to another idiot!"" Don't buy it! There are dozens of walks alone in NZ that are nicer than the Milford, try them!…"
"The Milford track is sometimes called ""The finest walk in the world"", and our family would have a hard time disagreeing. Make sure to book about a year in advance, because it is always sold out. The hike was beautiful, and everywhere you turn you see something amazing. It is a four day walk, independent or guided, our family did independent, which is much cheaper, and you get more of the real hiking experience. You take a boat to the starting point, and the first day is short for independent,  a little more than three miles. You stay in huts each night, and carry your own food, which you can cook on the gas stoves at the huts. Day two is about 10 miles, over flat ground. It was at the hut on day two that we saw the first Kea, which is a bird, similar in looks to a parrot. They will eat anything, so we had to hang our boots and not leave clothes to dry without supervision. Day three was around 10 miles over the pass and back down. This is the hardest day. The last day was 11 miles, but was completely flat. You then take a boat through the sound, and take a bus back. Each hiking group has about 40 people, and another great thing is that you meet a lot of interesting new people. We definitely recommend doing this hike."
"I walked Milford Track in March 2010 with Ultimate Hikes. All was perfect: sunny weather, amazing scenery. I like to go  hiking in the Alps, where I live, and I think Milford Track is not hard but not so easy.We were a group of 50 people, most from Australia and New Zealand. The guides were fantastic and very helpful. Lodges and food were beyond expectation. First day I met 50 people, last day I left 50 friends.Now I hope to come back and do Routeburn Track next year.Thank you Greta, Toshi, Lizzy, Raenee. Thank you to my new 50 friends."
"Advertised around the globe as 'The Finest Walk in the World'... it does live up to it's reputation.Love Love Love everything about this track... just a stunning piece of the world.11 of us walked it independently and firstly enjoyed the boat trip across Lake Te Anau to the start of the Track where of course we all stopped for the proverbial photo's at the sign.The sun was shining so we soaked it up on our 2 hour meander along manicured walkways, across a massive swing bridge and alongside the river into our first stop for the night.....Clinton Hut.The second day was also sunny but a little cooler, so as we made our way through to Mintaro Hut for our second night we needed to rug up a little. We ensured we took any little side trips to enjoy every moment, and the scenery was again magnificent.It rained heavily on the 2nd night and when we awoke to leave early the next morning for our BIG climb up over the MacKinnon Pass we saw the BIG ""Do Not Leave the Hut"" sign on  the door. There were 130 km gale force winds up top and the waters were raging across the streams and rivers. We were held back by the ranger until 10 am as the winds had eased and then left in the rain. Just 200mts from the hut we struck calf deep water and as there was no way around we just had to step through it soaking our boots and socks through... an interesting experience but all part of trekking in NZ.The cloud cleared as we reached the top and the vista's were to die for... absolutely magnificent.Our third night was spent at Dumpling Hut  The cooler weather continued for our 4th day walking out but the stunning waterfalls and magnificent scenery made up for the cold and damp. The Rangers give talks each night in the huts and are very informative and interesting giving information, weather reports and answering any questions.The sandflies are the biggest 'bug bear' and you certainly need a repellent that is strong. They are pesky little bugs!!!You definitely need to carry wet weather gear and warm clothes as you never know what to expect as you can get 4 seasons in 1 day out on the track.All up a little bit challenging for some but a most fabulous 4 day hike through the rugged beauty of NZ."
"We did the independent walking on the Milford Track November 2016. I'm not the fittest of people but I was able to do this walk without many problems. On day one, the walk is really short, only about an hour, to the first hut. It's a good introduction to the track. Make sure you bring a book or something to read as there isn't  much to do once you arrive at the hut. Also, if you are coming from Queenstown, chances are you are taking early transportation and will arrive at the hut around 1:00 p.m. Day two is also pretty flat, until you get to the end. We didn't have any rain that day so our walk was rather easy. We could see the markers in the track for days when it floods. Have lunch at the Prairie shelter, not the Bus Stop as the BS is basically a dirt floored shelter with no place to sit. Day three is when things got interesting for us. It was raining, windy, and cold on top of the McKinnon Pass. There is a shelter up there with a gas stove and two burners. I would highly recommend bringing an instant soup or something warm for lunch along with a thermos. Most of us were very wet inside the hut. We did stop in at the hut provided for independent walkers, by the guided walkers, towards the end and had a nice cup of complimentary hot tea. That was really a nice touch. The decent on this day can be kind of rough. We didn't have any hiking poles but with we did.The last day is also a fairly flat walk to Sandfly Point. My GPS came in at a little over 13 miles, although officially it's only supposed to be around 11. We left the last hut at 7:45 a.m. and arrived at Sandfly Point at 1:15. We did take a few small breaks during our walk, but nothing  major. The huts are not heated however there is a wood burning stove in the communal dining room. If it has been a particularly wet day, you'll see a lot of garments hanging around the stove in an attempt to get them dry. You can buy decent rain gear, however be prepared to get wet. If you really want to stay dry, bring a cheap plastic poncho. We are slow walkers so the walking times the DOC posted were never accurate for us. We always took at least an hour or two longer than the posted times. Bring Deet or some other kind of bug repellent as the sandflies are prevalent most places on the track.I brought the following with me, and used everything:Down throwSleeping SheetsSmall PillowTwo pairs hiking pantsTwo shirtsBase Layer top and bottomThree pairs of socks- two for hiking and one to wear at the hutsSweat pants and shirt for lounging around the hut and sleepingUndergarments - clean every dayShoes for the hutsHiking Shoes with good ankle supportRain PantsRain JacketDown Jacket - light fillWool BeanieBaseball capLeave in shampooSoap - some of the bathrooms were out of anti bacterial gel so this came in handySmall washclothHand towelCooking potTitanium cupBowl and plastic silverwareFor food, we brought a number of dehydrated fruits and vegetables from home. We also had some nuts for snacking on while tramping. Water can be drunk straight from the streams so you don't need to carry a lot of extra with you. If you are not in particularly good shape, the best thing you can do in order to prepare for the track is to walk, preferably with some weight on your back. Also, make sure your hiking shoes are well worn in before attempting this.Have fun. It's really a great adventure and such a beautiful place to visit."
"Hiked the independent walker version of the Milford Track. Logistics booked through DOC excellent. Huts are basic but comfortable and even have flushing toilets. The hike is stunning from start to finish. One day of rain which completely transforms the forest and creates roaring waterfalls. This hike definitely needs a day of rain. If you are fit, a must have on the bucket list!"
"The idea of hiking, or tramping as the Kiwis call it, for three nights through the 'wilderness' may frighten off many who visit the South Island Fiordland, but don't be put off, it's great fun and not really wilderness as there are other walkers and DOC (Department of Conservation) personnel around although care is needed in bad weather and you need the right equipment. Fortunately we had four days of sunshine which is apparently a rarity on this walk, but the scenery was stunning and the escape from mobile phones and Internet were total - no signal, no Wi-Fi! You can take the independent route staying in DOC huts which will require booking in advance and you taking stores for your journey, alternatively you can go for the slightly more civilised option of a guided walk, run by Ultimate Hikes who work closely with DOC but have their own well equipped lodges. Either way you have to walk the 33.5 miles. We opted for guided (which is more expensive) basically because it was easier to organise -simply less hassle. The Milford Track was just part of our month in NZ and it meant we could limit the amount of equipment we took with us  from home as Ultimate Hikes provide the essentials, rucksack, walking poles, sleeping sheets, rainwear, transport, food and sort out permits, which otherwise will need to be booked in advance and picked up at the DOC office in Queenstown or Te Anau before you start. Guided means you get transported from Queenstown to Te Anau Downs, rather than making your own way there for the spectacular boat trip to the start of the Track. From disembarking the walk is pretty easy going for days 1&2, a good well marked path, allowing you to take in a changing landscape, view the wildlife and generally get into your stride. On day three you start around the 14 miles post into the walk the climb up the McKinnon Pass. The climb is around 2 miles of path, reasonably strenuous as you climb c700m but most reasonably fit people should manage it. The views from the top are stunning if it's clear (no guarantees and often the weather is poor), once you have made it the remainder of day 3 and all of the fourth day is either downhill or fairly flat right to Sandfly Point where the Anita Bay will take you back to Milford Sound, it runs at 2, 3 & 4 pm daily. Give it a go, it's worth it, it's not difficult or particularly challenging just beautiful countryside, however just take your insect repellant as Sandfly Point gives you a big clue what the biggest pest is on the walk"
"Walked the 4-day Milford Track January 2014.  As is apparently normal for the Milford Track, we had two days of brilliant sunshine and 2 days of relentless rain.  Walking the first day was very easy after a gorgeous cruise across Lake Te Anau and up to the first hut (Clinton Hut).  Second day was long and arduous because the mercury hit 34 degrees.  Third day was the brilliant McKinnon Pass in a wild storm and the last day was very rainy and very long.  But the scenery throughout was spectacular.  A magical ""hobbit"" forest.  The final day was straightforward but long and there were a lot of streams to cross because the water levels were so high.  Overall the track was fairly easy - very easy for young people.  I did it when I was 67 so I'm rather slow.Definitely one of the highlights of my total world travel!  Highly recommended but you have to book almost a year in advance especially if there's a few people doing it together."
"Won't go into the walk itself, as plenty of others have covered this.Booked the guided walk through Ultimate Hikes, we thought - this is typically something you only do once, so do it well - very glad and happy we did. It certainly makes the hiking more fun when there is a cold beer and hot meal waiting for you each afternoon.Ensuite rooms are cosy, clean and beds are large and comfortable. Showers always had hot water for us, with good pressure.Food served each day was of surprisingly good quality, considering the remote locations and there was always plenty of it - you won't be losing any weight on this walk!Lights go out at 10 each night, but that's ok as we were ready for sleep.1 of our party was not very fit, this was not a problem, it just means you move a little slower and take a little longer, no issue as you have all day. In fact it gives you more chance to take in the amazing scenery!Most of the walk is on well laid paths that require little effort. One caution - there are a couple of sections, crossing bolder-strewn rockfalls and a steep section downward from the saddle where  it could be quite difficult, bordering on very hard, if you are not reasonably confident with balance and agility. Take 2 walking poles, you won't need them most of the time, but very handy when you do.Summary - I don't think anyone, of any background, could do this walk and not feel awed by the unspoilt scenery and sense of peacefulness.If you like us, have talked about it for years, get off your butt and do it, it will be one of your life's best decisions!"
"I was travelling on my own and did the Milford Track in February - non guided/independent. I stayed in Queenstown the night before and took the early morning bus to Te Anau. There is a connecting bus onwards to Te Anau Downs to get the boat but I decided to have some time in Te Anau and was glad I did. I had time to collect my tickets from the park office. Additionally I visited the Tracknet office which is just near to the National Park Office - they offer a service where they take a box and deliver it to the Milford Lodge for a cost of $15. I thought this was great and in my box I added some fresh clothes, a bit of food and chocolate, some toiletries etc. This saved me carrying extra stuff with me. I bought lunch in Te Anau and then got the lunchtime bus to the ferry. The best bit of advice I was given at the park office was to have a backpack liner and I bought one from the park office for 8 dollars - best value bit of kit I owned for the track. I was glad to have made the decision to get the later boat as it is only a 3 mile walk on day 1. This was the only day I was dry and saw the sun. Food I took - I am not very keen on the add water to dried food things you get so I took a bag of pasta and some sauce and had that every evening. I toasted bagels in the morning on my small frying pan with cream cheese. I had bagels for lunch as well which was a bit boring in the end! Packet of ginger nut biscuits for snacks as well as 6 tracker bars and some tea bags.Sandflys - they loved me - I had bought two different sprays in Queenstown and they were both fairly ineffective. Has to be deet really. As soon as you stop they find you. I was glad to have antihistamine available as my wrist ended up quite swollen.Clothing etc - Head torch was essential. Pots, cutlery and sleeping bag essential. I didnt have a plate and ate out of my pot. I had waterproof jacket and trousers, light weight walking long trousers zipping off to shorts, 4 pairs of socks, long sleeve light weight top, light zip up fleece, change of clothes for evening and an essential pair of flipflops. I took good, well broken in boots and was glad of this. Walking poles were essential for me. I didn't have gaiters but wished I had.  So after day one I walked the remaining 3 days in continual, non-stop torrential rain. I have never been as wet in my life. The track became a steam to splash through, rivers burst out over tracks with wading knee high and sometimes up to waist high. Thunder and lightening storms etc. My feet were never dry, in fact I was soaked through every day. The waterfalls were stunning as was the forest area but I didn't get any great views at all, not once did I wear sunglasses or put on any sun protection cream and my sun hat remained in my bag the whole time. I of course knew it was a very wet area of the world but just wasn't expecting to walk the whole way in constant heavy rain. Still it was a good experience and there were nice people doing it at the same time as me. I did think at one point think that the best type of clothing would be a wet suit, some fishermans wading trousers and perhaps a small boat would have come in handy. Overall I am pleased that I did this walk but hope if you are reading this and planning to do it that you get less rain than I did."
"Had an amazing time on the Milford Track guided walk by Ultimate Hikes. This is the fourth time I’ve walked with this company and they have not let me down. Big thanks to the guides Hannah, Margarita, Megan and Toshi, for keeping everyone safe and happy and to the lodge staff for the excellent meals and accommodation. We had a great bunch on people on the walk and its safe to say that we all had great time together. We had an absolute beautiful’s days weather on the last days boat trip around Milford Sound. Anyone planning to do the Milford Track should be aware that the third day going up and down the Mackinnon Pass is the toughest and the weather can change very quickly. But apart from that the scenery is breathtaking and the waterfalls everywhere are a amazing. Would high recommend this to anyone."
"The Milford Track - wow! I set myself a hard task there but very rewarding. It's a great way to lose weight! Stunning scenery, beautiful waterfalls, tame and unusual birds, gloworms by night and an idyllic end to the track. Just make sure you are fit before you go and especially make sure you're used to carrying a heavy pack - depending of course on how much you carry. Take painkillers and padding - or squeeze some rolled up socks under your rucksack shoulder straps. I went as an ""independent tramper"" having made my reservations on-line with the NZ DOC office.I got in last minute on a cancellation. These seem to come up quite frequently so keep checking!Day 1 was easy - a doddle.  Starts with a nice stable boat ride from Te Anau Downs. You only walk for 90 minutes and then settle in to Clinton hut, fight for space at the gas ring, cook your dinner, wash up and then socialise before bed. Don't carry too much food and remember you must carry out all materials you carry in including your rubbish.Some trampers took wine and steaks much to the envy of those of us on dehydrated mince and instant potato! I'd do the same next time though - nothing like a bit of luxury after a hard day's walking.  In the evening you can join in the nature walk and talk then bump into fellow trampers in the darkness of the forest as you seek out gloworms in a grotto close by the river. Take a head torch and spare batteries! I can't remember the name of the ranger that presented to us but without exception all rangers at the huts are close to nature and lovely people.Snoring - oh the snoring - it reverberates around the dorms - sleep with ear plugs or better still stick your iPOD on with some pleasant sound to drown out the rumble! The noise was so bad one of our guests moved her bed into the kitchen block. Dorms and toilet facilities are all mixed by the way! All to a very decent standard though. No hot water - this is the wilderness after all.Day 2 - walk to Mintaro Hut. This stretch is predominantly through forest though it eventually opens out into some impressive scenery, a hidden lake in which you can swim (if you're a seal) and the crystal clear Clinton River which has an inviting bluish, turquoise tinge if you can brave the temperature. The odd Weka will pop out to greet you on the trail, Robins will peck your feet and Fantails will flutter around you but only to catch the sandflies that are now biting you because you were daft enough to stand still and watch the birds! Take repellent! You have been warned. By the end of this day I was in extreme pain from my pack. I slept like a log whilst contemplating whether I should ask for a chopper to airlift me out the next day - after all how was I going to climb up to 1154 metres given how difficult lugging this pack around had been.  Day 3 - the best day of all for me. Starts with a climb up the McKinnon pass - to amazing views. Look at my pics. There was an inversion as we emerged from the clouds. Here you will envy the Guided Walkers who will be there sipping hot tea that was carried for them. Take your own flask and make yourself a brew before you leave Mintaro hut. The summit is one place you will appreciate a cuppa more than any other place on the trail - unless you end up walking flooded trails down below of course. Warning: Be prepared to wade up to your waist or even chest in water - I didn't have to but many walkers have had to as river levels rise dramatically and quickly when the rain comes down. Think about carrying sufficient changes of clothes! This stretch is so pretty - you will pass stunning waterfalls on your way to Dumpling Hut. Keas also ""operate in the area"". At Dumpling Hut is a beautiful swimming hole - leap in and when you come out, sandflies will be waiting to dry you off. If like me, you wont want to complete the trail without having bathed in the river - especially after three days of sweating - it'll be welcome refreshment. Day 4 - to Sandfly Point. This last stretch is reputed to take 6 hours - provided you march that is. I did it in 6 hours flat but only because I left the hut at 5:45am in darkness and maintained  a constant pace. Along this stretch are more falls. You'll simply be amazed.They are the kind of falls you'd imagine fairies to be bathing in when you're not watching - not that I imagine fairies you understand. I did see two Possums along the trail which I caught in the light of my head torch. I got to Sandfly point early and being all alone I was in my element, laying there on the wharf enjoying the sunshine. It was 90 minutes or so before anyone caught me up although I did pass some day trampers coming in the other direction. I'd recommend the day walk if you can't do the four days. It covers some of the best parts of the track.I was paranoid about missing the boat as I had to get to Milford, get the bus and then pick up my car and drive 460 miles back to Christchurch to catch my flight the next morning. As it was I got the 2pm boat and made it to Christchurch by 2am in the morning! My advice is to leave yourself time to explore Milford Sound. I had to leave it all behind which made my heart sink - the scenery is incredible. I will return! Finally one point of note. A significant percentage of this walk is through forest. At times I began to think I don't want to look at another tree but other trampers felt that this was one of the attractions. I like scenery and am used to walking in the Italian Dolomites and English Lake Districts which are much more open and varied in my experience.  There is no doubt you'll love this walk but compare pics with the Routeburn (have I spelt that right?) Track which others recommended to me."
"I can see why it's one of the ""Great Walks"" of New Zealand. Nothing prepared us for the amazing views on this track. Be sure to bring a camera."
Organised for car relocation from Te Anau Downs to Milford when we walked the Milford track. Very friendly and efficient. Would highly recommend
Did this independently. Worth doing if u are reasonably fit. The best day is the third days. The views are stunning. The Sutherland falls are amazing side walk.
"The Milford track was awesome.  Went in as an independent tramper, making reservations online with DOC.  The track is maintained to a high standard and there is very little chance of getting lost.  You will see some beautiful scenery, amazing waterfalls and cheeky and tame bird life. I personally found the walk a lot easier than I had anticipated, and the first two days of hiking are pretty straight forward.  The third day of the hike would probably be the best, the view from the top of the McKinnon Pass is breathtaking and we were lucky to have decent weather while we were up there.The huts are fairly comfortable, however snoring in the bunk rooms can be pretty loud so maybe bring a pair of ear plugs or take your iPod and also ensure that you have some decent insect repellent as in some spots the sandflies are evil . The area gets a lot of rain and changeable weather so be sure that you are prepared, have decent water proof clothing and that you double bag or pack all your gear into dry bags. Also when we walked the track there was that much rain, that we were unsure if we would have to stay an extra night on the track, so it would be a wise idea to take an extra days food, in case such a situation arises.Loved this experience and would definitely recommend."
"Just returned from Milford Track as an independent tramper. It was absolutely fantastic.Having done some longer treks than this I was expecting it to be ""a walk in the park"". I was pleased to find that it was more challenging than I expected. Not hard but accurately graded as a moderate level walk.The scenery is really something else and incredibly varied. Having a booking system which limits the number of individuals starting each day to 40 is a really good idea as we found that we rarely came across anyone during the day. As for the accomodation on route, I found the huts to be very comfortable with good facilities for cooking etc.One tip I would give is to try and keep your pack as light as possible. I had no problems with sore feet, shoulders or back which can be an issue. I managed to get mine to just under 10 kilo which included all personal items such as sleeping bag, cooking utensils and food for 4 days, first aid kit, insect repellant (very important) clothes for all weather conditions and toiletries. I also took a hip flask of Kahlua which came in very handy thankyou very much. Don't skimp on little luxuries such as chocolate as you need to have some nice yummies to look forward to.Our party took our time during the day and often were the last to arrive at the huts as we stopped and swam, chatted and generally soaked up this incredible part of our world.Would recommend the independent tramp to anyone of reasonable fitness who wants to see nature at it's best...."
"Definitely the best track we have ever done. Gorgeous, impressive nature. 33.5 miles in four days from Glade Wharf across Mackinnon Pass to Sandfly Point. Be aware that this is quite a tough activity - you take all your belongings on your back, even all garbage you produce during the track.Simple accommodation in three huts - Clinton, Mintaro and Dupling hut where there are cookers, water, toilets and simple beds, with about 20 people in one room. If you prefer an easy version of the same route, with more comfort, and if you are ready to pay for that, take a guided walk with Ultimate Hikes and you will walk the same route without heavy packs and with sleeping in comfort huts with good beds, where they will even prepare meals for you. Anyway, if you like nature, Milford Track is a great activity for you!"
"We completed the Milford track self-guided in early March 2014 and it was an incredible walk. The scale of the place is massive! If you're fit and have walking experience you can save money by doing the self guided walk. setting you own pace is the best part. we found that there are plenty of hours in the day to get to each night's hut so don't be pressured to leave early. some people on the walk would leave at 7am and rush to that night's hut. I recommend taking you time and stopping to ""smell the roses"". There's something interesting around every corner. also the groups that left early on the day over Mackinnon Pass found there was too much fog on the saddle for them to see anything, they were quite disappointed, whereas we arrived at the pass 2 hours later and had the clearest most magnificent views!. So i cannot stress enough, take your time and enjoy! its much more peaceful at the back of the pack:)"
"We just returned from hiking the Milford Track through Ultimate Hikes.  Our friends hiked the same days as us, doing the unguided walks and staying in the DOC huts. Based on our separate experiences, I can unequivocally say the extra money spent on Ultimate Hikes was well worth it for us.The Milford Track is one of the most fantastic hikes we have ever done.  The flora and fauna are incomparable and amazing.  Old trees covered with mosses are everywhere as the trail winds through a rain forest.  You see incredible waterfalls and mountain views as you climb out of the tree line, cross Mackinnon Pass and walk back down into the valley. A truly stunning landscape over 33.5 miles in 4 days. Whether you stay in the huts or the Ultimate Hikes lodges, you walk the same trail. The difference comes in how you experience the Milford Track.With Ultimate Hikes, we stayed in lodges with private rooms, showers, washing and drying facilities (very important when hiking in a rainforest) and large common dining facilities and even bars. We ate great food, they had vegetarian meals for us for dinner and lunch. We had knowledgeable, personable guides. Kelly, Thomas, Kieran and Kyohei were fantastic and funny! We received a slideshow briefing every night about where we would be walking, trail conditions, weather, the lunch stop (where we received hot drinks) and bathroom and water locations. We carried relatively light day packs containing extra layers, rain gear, our lunch and clothes and shoes to wear at night. Also included in the price was an overnight at Mitre Peak Lodge on the last day of the hike and a boat tour of spectacular Milford Sound the next morning. We had an incredible experience that we loved.Our four friends who did the DOC huts had a vastly different experience. They carried much larger packs with bedding and food for four days. They had to arrange their own bus and boat transportation to the trail head.  Because of a communication problem, they missed their bus and they had to scramble to get another boat, much later.  There was torrential rain that afternoon and they were caught in it as they made their way to the first hut.  Two were caught in a flood and had to be rescued by helicopter.  Their boots, gear and clothing were totally soaked and the drying room in the huts was inadequate.  When some of our group met them on the trail a day or two later, our two friends said “you must be with the guided group”. When asked why, they said “because you look happy”. I have seen a few reviews here saying the huts “are 10% of the cost of the guided hikes” and while the guided hikes are definitely more expensive, that’s not quite the whole story.  With Ultimate Hikes you get bus transportation from Queenstown to Te Anau, a boat to the trail head, all your meals for the duration (excellent meals), a boat out and a bus ride back to Queenstown.  On the unguided hikes you have to arrange and pay for all of this on your own, as well as purchasing and carrying in your food. At the end of the fourth day you go back to Queenstown in the afternoon arriving late evening.With Ultimate Hikes, included in the price is a fourth night at Mitre Peak Lodge, dinner, a boat tour of Milford Sound the next morning, lunch and a bus back to Queenstown, arriving at 4PM.For us, Ultimate Hikes was well worth the extra money.  We had a much better experience than our friends did-it was more about enjoying the Milford Track rather than surviving the Milford Track. You will spend so much money to travel to New Zealand anyway, I don’t know why you would cut corners on the Milford Track experience."
"I had wanted to hike the Milford Track for over 20 years and finally did so.  Everything you have heard about the zillions of waterfalls after a heavy rain is absolutely true - so unbelievably gorgeous!  HOWEVER that view requires the clouds clearing after that heavy rain.  Of the 80 + people on the trail, only 5 of us were ""slow"" enough to be around on the peak (McKinnon Pass) when the clouds cleared.  Only 5 of us saw the fairytale landscape.  The other 75 grumbled and missed it because they were already far down the mountain when the clouds cleared (but they made it to Sutherland Falls and we did not - no problem as we had seen soooo many waterfalls that my partner finally admonished me to stop photographing every one - LOL!)  BE WARNED - the final day of the Milford Track is Hellish!  Yes you do go through more gorgeous forest, but you are Rushing To Meet The Boat On Time.... and it is By Far the longest part of the whole track (11 miles / 18 km).  So instead of taking your time and enjoying the last day, you are walking as fast as possible to meet the boat - this is Bad Planning on the part of the DOC.  That fourth, longest day was Not Fun...Not Fun At All!!  We almost went into the DOC aftewards with one simple message: Reverse The Hiking Direction!  If the first day was 11 miles / 18 km, you would arrive at the hut exhausted certainly, but then you could wake up and relax the next morning instead of needing to be frantic and hurried.  The second day would then be the Main Day of McKinnon Pass with an easy hike up and a faster descent.  The third day would again be a nice slow walking day to enjoy the beautiful forest and all the flora and fauna, and in this Reversed Direction, the last day would only be a two hour walk and so you could ENJOY your final day with a nice slow stroll to the boat wharf.  As it stands, we loved day one, we loved day two, Day Three (McKinnon Pass) was astounding but only for 5 out of 80 of us, and day four was Living Hell (note - ALL as in 100% of our blisters and soreness came from having to rush on day four on the longest walk of the trip; We were Fine before that day in every way).  People we spoke with afterwards agreed that the first 3 days are awesome and the last (4th) day is bordering on living hell (while surrounded by gorgeous nature that you barely have time to enjoy, which goes 100% against my entire hiking philosophy about Taking Your Time to Enjoy Nature).  You have been warned.  Also your rain gear will all fail - everyone's did from every brand you can name - in this amount of constant rain (160 cm in one day!).  Only the people wearing good old cheap plastic Rain Ponchos reported being dry - LOL!  So definitely invest in a Bag Liner (garbage bags at least).  Typical rain gear is NOT designed for this degree of wetness.  And bring a LOT of bug stuff for the sand flies.  p.s. we were independent hikers, not guided."
"We just returned from a 5 day guided hike on the Milford Track.  The track itself is 33.5 miles long and it covers both flat and mountainous areas.  Almost all of the walk is done over 3 days - walking for 7-9 hours each day.  The first day you spend making your way to the first lodge with a 2 mile nature walk.  The last day you take cruise around Milford Sound and then travel back to Queenstown.Whilst the walk was at times gruelling, it was absolutely beautiful regardless of the weather.   The path itself changes continously.  You walk through moss covered temperate rainforests, between mountains, next to rivers, up mountain paths, over streams, through mud and here and there you climb over areas struck by landslides.  There are a lot of rocks!  Expect to have very sore feet!The guided tour is excellent.  Food and accomodation is provided each night (and you can buy alcohol at each lodge). The quality of both was excellent except for the last night at Mitre Peak which was comparatively poor.  There is hot water at each lodge.A special mention must be given to the guides who accompanied us.  They really added a special dimension to the trip.  Amazing folk.The tour can have up to 50 hikers.  We had around 18 people on our hike - they were a fabulous bunch of fellow travellers and we really loved spending the evenings chattting.I would recommend you take the minimum amount of clothes with you for the walk.  You don't need much as there are washing and drying facilities at each lodge.  I took one pair of light summer shorts which was fine even though the temperature was 12 degrees celscius.  I also took one t-shirt and two thermal tops (I only used one), plus a fleece and rain jacket. I also had light pants and shoes for the lodge each night.  Either sandals or you can buy a type of slipper shoe at the Milford Track shop in Queenstown.   It is a good idea to borrow a walking stick for the trip down the mountain (McKinnon Pass).  I borrowed that on Day 3 when we stopped for lunch at the top of the mountain.My boots were great except on the downhill track when my foot moved to the front and I had badly bruised toes which was really painful.  My boots were a little too big.  I would recommend buying some foot fleece (at the shop in Queenstown) or wearing another pair of socks on day 3 when you climb down the mountain if your foot moves in your shoe.  Even better if you have boots that are the perfect size!Fellow hikers varied in age from 18 to 80.  The hike is rigorous.  The 80 year old lady on our trip was a very fit person.    There were no negatives to the trip.  It was a great way to relax as because you are so focused on hiking and admiring the amazingly beautiful landscape (plus thinking about sore feet!) you don't spend a moment thinking about your normal life.The memories from the trip are something I will always treasure.  Summary of tips- Make sure you get the best fitting boots possible, it's the downhill that can get you if the boots aren't great- Buy footfleece at the shop before the walk.  - Take slipper shoes  or sandals for the lodge- You can wear shorts - if it gets cold you can throw on thermal pants- Don't take much as you can wash and dry your clothes every night.  I half filled a 35 litre pack- A walking stick was useful on the downhill path - you can borrow one- Take a water bottle!- Be prepared to get wet and enjoy it!"
"The Milford Track is a must. If you don't have much hiking experience, it is perfect. We did it independently which made it even more of an adventure. You will make great friends and get to know everyone in the huts. Plan for rain and bring wet-weather gear (Goretex) and thermals. It was cold even in summer, there was still snow on top of the mountains at MacKinnon Pass (spectacular to see!) We were blessed with sunny and rainy days. The second day poured down and all the streams flooded and we barely made it across! Be careful of hyperthermia, try and stay dry underneath. We had the best time of our lives, it was such an adventure. The photos we have to look back on are just amazing. Make sure you train regularly beforehand and practice carrying a pack. Mine was 15kg and I am only 5'3. I did a lot of weights and walking/running prior to. The best practice is hiking ofcourse. We stayed in Te Anau at the Red Tussock before and after the track, and they stored the luggage we didn't want to take with us. You can buy all your food in Te Anau and gas for your cookers etc. Make sure you take chocolate and lollies, you will need them! You might want knee supports for the decent from MacKinnon Pass, my knees were killing me!"
"We walked the Milford (and the Routeburn) as a guided walks in what Ultimate Hikes calls ""The Classic"". This combination was not cheap, but is was worth every cent 200% over. The lodges are spacious and clean, the food excellent, the staff and guides super-pro and friendly as only Kiwi's can be. We had the ideal weather, torrentials rains on the last Milford day.  [-----------] and cristal clear balmy weather on the Routeburn. An experience never to forget.Both tracks are well walkable for reasonably fit people. One has to be able to sustain a couple, like 4 at least, hours on walking boots. Sticks help immensely. So does some walking experience. It is all in the head! The scenery is so stunning that you forget your sore feet though. Plus the welcoming in the Guided Walks lodges, the warm showers, the extensive wine-list and the company of other happy people do wonders. I have attached some panoramic photo's as I can add a thousand more enthoused words, but one (or more)picture say(s) it all!"
Wow! Milford track was stunning! Loved every part of it! The first day -5km - was a bit too easy and I feel like you could definitely do longer on this day!! There was bad weather when we did it and an avalanche closed mackinnon pass to we had a free helicopter ride up to the top of the pass which was totally awesome! Walking in the fresh snow on the top of the mountain was insane! The walk down to sandfly hut via the emergency trail was a bit rough on the knees though! Make sure you take mosquito repellent on the Milford track because the mozzies are like small birds!!!
"We walked the track in the third week of March. Many people had told us what an amazing experience it was so our expectations were very high. Perhaps that was why the trip fell a bit flat for us - or maybe it was the weather. We got no rain at all during the trip. While this did enable us to enjoy great views, we felt a bit like we had missed out on the full experience.  Only the permanent waterfalls were running, and we didn't even get our feet wet. The Clinton river was beautiful and we enjoyed seeing a lot of it as we walked up the Clinton valley. I had a swim at Prairie Lake - it was lovely.The walk over MacKinnon pass was a great day, with spectacular scenery. The Anderson cascades on the way down were my favourite part of the whole trip.  Walking out through the Arthur valley was actually a bit underwhelming, other than the two waterfalls, which were lovely.  It is mostly just very easy track through bush. I think it would be much more of an adventure in the rain. Sometimes it rains so much the track is underwater in places and people have to wade through up to their waist in water! If I did it again I would do it in spring or early summer when it would be wetter and there would still be some snow on the tops, because I think it would be more interesting.  There are many great tramping tracks in New Zealand. This one just didn't stand out as exceptional for me, but I guess for people who haven't done much hiking/tramping in New Zealand it would be a great introduction."
"Did the four day 33.5 mile Milford Track walk with Ultimate Hikes. The hike was a little pricey at close to NZD 2000 but did include two nights accommodation at Queenstown, three nights accommodation on the track and one night at Mitre Peak Lodge. Also included was a Milford Sound boat trip with Real Journeys. From the start of the hike right through to returning from Milford Sound on the bus all food and drink (non-alcoholic) is included. The lodges during the walk are great they all have comfortable bunk beds (or a bit more expensive if you want a private room) . Great hot showers and flushing toilets. There are laundry facilities at each lodge with huge drying rooms. So u can finish the day's hiking have a hot shower, then wash your hiking clothes, put them in the drying room and be dry in a few hours, ready to wear clean the next day if you want to. There is lots of food maybe too much, with cooked breakfasts every day, sandwiches and snacks for lunch with a three course meal of quality food every night ie lamb racks, steaks, venison casserole etc. In a way probably too much food, there is no need to take any food. At night you can run a tab for alcoholic drinks. Of course you can get four seasons in one day out on the track and the sandflys can be tough. Every night the guides run a 'foot love' session where you can get bites, blisters etc attended to (a great service). The guides do a great job and are always on hand with advice, medical gear, hot drinks or snacks. On our walk Liv, Tom and Makono-san were great especially Makono-san who is a great girl with 5 years of track experience and fluent in Japanese and English. A fantastic trip and well done to Ultimate Hikes."
"This is rated as the most popular Great Walk in NZ. It's easy to see why. Gorgeous and breathtaking landscapes. Limited amount of people allowed on it per day. Exotic wildlife you can only find in alpine New Zealand... Here's what you need to know. 1. If you are going during busy season, book as soon as booking opens. You can register to be notified by NZ Gov when registration opens. 2. I'm not kidding. I signed into their booking system the moment it opened and within 12 minutes the dates within four days of mine were all sold out. Thankfully I had them held in my shopping cart!3. There are two ways to do this. Through the DOC which is what we did, or through the guided walks. Through DOC you have to pack and carry all your own stuff. With the guided walks, they provide bedding and food and carry most of your stuff for you. But it costs a LOT more. 4. Only 40 people are allowed to start the trail through DOC and 40 with the guided walks. So it can be more crowded than you'd expect, but it's still not bad. 5. SANDFLIES. We laughed at the 80% Deet bug cream at the store. Until we got to Milford. Holy mother. Keep moving and they won't get you. Keep your hut doors closed. I took to sandfly murder with a dirty sock against the hut window. It wasn't pretty. But I was desperate. 6. Kea. These guys are awesome. Parrots that only live in alpine NZ. The little jerks will try to mess with you and steal your food. DO NOT FEED THEM. This track is fun because it's extra remote. To get there you have to drive to the DOC center in Te Anau, take the bus to a boat, and the boat to the trail head. Then walk your 33 miles. The DOC website lets you book all those tickets at once.  walking! :)"
"I hiked the Milford Track last week with my mum and I can honestly say it was the most amazing experience of my life. We took the guided option with Ultimate Hikes, and we both had an absolute blast. We were incredibly lucky with brilliant weather 4 of the 5 days and not too many of those pesky sandflies. Ultimate Hikes are a very well-oiled machine - they know what they're doing and they do it extremely well. Communication was excellent right from the moment we booked, all the way til we hopped off the bus at the end. For anyone booking with them, I would advise to listen to everything they have to say and read every bit of information they send - as I mentioned they know what they're talking about and they tell you this information for a reason. We found their packing list brilliant (first time multi-day hike) and we really got a sense of what the track would be like. Still, it was tough - I'm a pretty fit 30-year-old and although I did not struggle, it was definitely no walk in the park. The track can be well-formed in places and you're able to look around and take in the beauty of the place but there are a lot of sections where you have to really pay attention to where your feet are going. Good boots are an absolute must and be sure to break them in. Do prepare for four seasons in one day - we went expecting cold but ended up in shorts and tshirts. It also pays to make sure you have excellent quality clothing - quick dry material (merino), functional items (zip off pants, thermal layers that can be worn as a single layer - and kiwis love their thermals so don't be afraid to get the out-there patterns!!) as this greatly increases your comfort and reduces the weight you have to carry. The lodges are amazing, considering their remoteness. You don't want for ANYTHING. The food is delicious, the staff brilliant, the rooms clean and super comfortable, and what's better than a hot shower at the end of a long day...! (There's actually a bath at the final lodge..... yes, a bath) And the guides. What can I say! There are 4 of them on your walk, plus a fifth who joins you for your descent down Mackinnon Pass. Ours were excellent - Eddie, Hannah, Daile, Kyohei and Ellis - thank you guys for your banter, expert knowledge and friendly smiles. You helped make this hike what it was - a truly amazing experience. You can see your guides, and the rest of your group, as much or as little as you like - even though there's 50 of you (plus the unguided walkers), we found we were by ourselves sometimes for hours at a time. Which to experience the true beauty, isolation and serenity of this place, I think you really need to do. There's not much I can really say about the actual walk itself and the scenery you see - no amount of words can really do it justice. You'll just have to get out there and do the track for yourself!! PS there's a helicopter transfer option from Milford Sound back to Queenstown instead of taking the coach - it's expensive but if you can fit it in your budget, make sure you do it - it is worth every cent!!PPS there is an optional walk at the end of day 3 - after the epic crossing of Mackinnon Pass - to Sutherland Falls. Sure, you see plenty of falls on the main track, but this one is exceptional. Make sure you do it because it's SO worth it."
I spent Christmas walking the Milford Track. It was a challenging walk but definitely one of last years highlights. The scenery is breathtaking. A steep climb days one and two and a very steep descent on day three with alpine waterfalls following you down the mountains. Finish the day with a detour to Sutherland Falls - it's magnificent!
"We did the track as ""independant Walkers"" and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The track is very well maintained but kept very natural.  The DOC Huts are of a good standard with water and flushing toilets (no showers).  The DOC staff are very knowlegable and helpful. However never under estimate the power of nature  - you need to be well equipped for this walk - you could literally be walking in the rain for 4 days (we even got snow) so its vital you have good boots, wet weather gear and warm clothes.  You need to be resoanably fit and without injuries.  Make sure you have insect repellant and be prepared to be crossing rivers oftne up to waist deep.  Be prepared to get wet - they dont call it the wettest place on earth for nothing but it is well worth it."
"Having done the Milford Track previously guided, it was quite a difference experience with kids and unguided.  We went with about 3 other familys.  The kids loved it and had a blast....they had energy to burn and it was an amazing experience.  The scenery, wildlife,huts etc are all absolutely fantastic.  Found it hard going to carry all food etc for 5 people.  When you arrive at the hut you are pretty tired but you have to start cooking before the lights go out and get your kids sorted.  Was good lesson for them in having to carry their own gear and manage themselves.  At the end of the trek we went out on the Doubtful sound overnight which was spectacular.  You can sleep overnight and have dinner etc go kayaking, explore.....such a lovely thing to finish off a very memorable trip.  Kids ranged from 8 - 14 years."
"My girlfriend and I did the unguided hike of the Milford Track on Nov 18-21.  Wow.  It was definitely worth the 15 hour flight.  Before we left, we intentionally didn’t look at too many pictures ahead of time and we’re glad we hadn’t.  The scenery got better each day – culminating with the amazing Mackinnon Pass views on day 3.  We had 4 straight days of sunny weather – some would say lucky - though we were wishing for at least 1 or 2 days of rain to see all of the waterfalls roaring and get the true ""Milford Experience"".  We still used our rain jacket and pants on the Mackinnon pass because of cold/wind. Here’s the lowdown:Getting there – we booked with Tracknet shuttle and they picked us up from Queenstown Airport.  They were great – on-time, and even let us store a bag in their facility while we were on the track.  They also provided transport back from the Milford Sound dock (the scenery on the bus ride back on the Milford Road is amazing…like Yosemite Valley…but even better).The Hike – Day 1 – It’s a short and flat 3.1 miles thru the woods once you step off the boat to the Neale Burn Hut.  The first thing we noticed about the trail were the beautiful bird songs – the songs stay with you all 4 days.  Once you arrive at the hut, there are 2 equally sized bunk-bed rooms here (hold 20 each), a cooking/eating facility, and 4 toilets/3 wash sinks.  As you arrive, try to grab a bunk that isn’t near the door (and bring ear plugs!).  Be prepared for your first encounter with sandflies…as soon as you stop there they will find you.  Have your bug spray (high % deet seemed to work, the picardin stuff we bought at the DOC center didn’t).  The sandflies seem to go away at night and didn’t bother us while sleeping.  Scenery is nice…but it’s going to get better.  If it’s clear, the morning sunlight shining off the peaks is cool.  You’ll be lucky if you get Ranger Ross – he is close to 70 – and has a great attitude/sense of humor.  Go on the nature walk with him.  Enjoy the pepper (you’ll know what I mean later…).  Everyone seemed to fall asleep by 10.Day 2 – It’s a 10.2 mile hike over mostly flat ground until the last mile.  While the last mile was a unanimous unwelcome climb, you’ll find the location of the Mintaro Hut worth the climb.  More on the hut later.  The hike itself travels thru beautiful, lush mossy/ferned forests…until it breaks into a clearing that wows you…  You’ll see stunning cliff walls on both sides of the valley with numerous waterfalls, and glaciers/snow at the higher elevations.  Take the side trip to Hidden Lake for a nice snack break.  Keep walking and eventually you get to the avalanche chutes.  Signs there tell you to keep moving thru the areas and we did…because we could hear a few avalanches falling to our left.  We did get to see a few, they were smaller, but still impressive.  They never got close to us but I wouldn’t linger.  The sandflies don’t bother you on the trail unless you sit still too long…even then they really weren’t too bad on the trails – only near the huts.  Now back to the hut… after having done the unguided hike I would never recommend to my hiking friends the guided hike for one main reason – the Mintaro Hut.  It’s location is amazing – you can sit on its front porch and face a sheer mountain wall with glaciers at the top and watch nature put a little show on as a few avalanches fall every hour…what a show.  The mountain seems close enough to touch. I’m not sure how long this goes on thru the year, but during our stay in late November it was amazing.  You could even hear them at night.  Here there is 1 bunkhouse with about 20 bunks on the top floor, and 10 each in 2 lower rooms.  The kitchen is also on the lower floors (communal cooking/eating was cool – you get to meet all sorts of people from everywhere – and just like grade school you can trade food).  Each hut has a wood burning stove to heat it – wood is available and each night folks fired up the stove in each hut.  That said, we were never even close to cold in the sleeping huts which don’t have any heat sources.  As for the bathrooms – same story here: 3 clean toilets, 4 clean sinks w mirrors (no soap) – never seemed too busy, but we tried to beat the rush each morning to wash up.  If you’re into freezing cold water, you will like washing up in the sinks.  Oh yeah, and don’t even think of whispering/talking when ranger Kate is giving her presentation…or you will getting a swift talking to!  Day 3 – This is the day…8.7 miles to Dumpling Hut.  Eat a hearty breakfast because this morning you climb for a few hours.  If I had to guess, it’s about a 1,500-1,700 foot climb that takes about 2 hours.  We started around 7:30AM – and arrived at the pass around 9:45AM. It can be misty/foggy in the morning as you approach the pass – as it was this morning – but have patience (and extra layers handy – it’s cold and windy! – and mind your packs – the Kea birds tore into a few unattended packs) …wait until the mist clears and….WOW…the pictures just don’t do it justice.  Not even close.  Snow covered peaks…a 360 degree view of 2 valleys, mountains, glaciers, rivers, small lakes, a snowy cirque…you’re even up close to the higher sections of the wall that was putting on the avalanche show the evening before.  If you are praying for clear weather – this is the moment you want it.  The Mackinnon Pass refuge is a great place to get inside and wait for the weather to clear or to have a hot snack (there is a stove there, water – and the famous “loo with a view” – a portojohn with a window facing down the Clinton Valley).  If you like downhill you’ll enjoy the next few hours. We took the emergency route due to avalanche danger and it drops quickly – watch your step as it is a rough trail (bring hiking sticks – they are a must for this section).  You continue past a river section with cool waterfalls and hike mostly thru woods until you reach Dumpling Hut.  Unfortunately the 1.5 hour roundtrip side-trip to Sutherland Falls was closed due to rockfall – it’s accessed at Quintin Lodge (where you can get water/bathroom break – there are bathrooms spaced throughout the trail system). You can still get limited peek-a-boo views of the falls thru the trees as you hike towards Dumpling.  Dumpling Hut seems to be the newest hut and offers 4 rooms with about 10 bunks in each.  Bathrooms = 3, sinks = 4.  There’s a swimming hole/rock beach nearby – worth a visit when it’s hot – but no one lingered too long – the water was freezing and the sandflies hungry.  Day 4 – 11.2 miles to the boat.  This is a mostly flat section that seems to pass quickly.  You cross a swing bridge (look for eels below) and soon see beautiful Mackay Falls and Bell Rock.  Keep huffing and eventually you get to Giant Gate shelter – we had a snack there. You pass Lake Ada and you know you’re getting close to the end.  Now…here’s the trick.  If you go too fast, you get to Sandfly Point too early and, well, donate blood.  If you go too slow you miss the boat (and it does leave on-time).  We went too quickly and had to loiter at the 33 mile marker (every mile has a marker) for about 20 minutes – this is the last mile marker before the boat landing and is about 20-30 minutes from the dock.  There was a group of us there waiting there at 33 and the sandflies weren’t present.  We then hit the Point, took the obligatory picture by the old sign-post and hopped the boat.  The 20 minute boat ride to the Milford Road dock is short, but beautiful.  Stay on the back deck to get the views, though you might get a little wet.  The Tracknet bus will be there in the lot waiting for you – enjoy the scenic bus ride – and enjoy some buffet dinners in Queenstown (Ok – and 1 stop into McDonalds) for the next 4 days like we did…Total Cost: Permits/Boat = approx. $250/person, Tracknet Shuttle = $150/personEnjoy."
"Did the track on our own. Enjoted every minute. Weather was magnificant, and climbed McKinnon Pass twice due to early arrival to the hut on Day 2 and accepting the recommendation of the track officials that ""if the weather is nice, climb the pass because we can not guarantee good weather the day after"". Everywhere you go you enjoy nature at its best: streams and rivers, plants and trees, valleys and mountains. Booked 6 months in advance!"
"The Milford Track is a spectacular hike which I would strongly recommend - but it isn't a walk in the park and warrants a few more words of caution than I came across when doing my research. We did the self-guided hike, so here is the lowdown for those considering it:Book early:- Really early. We booked six months in advance and got the last two spots for our dates.Accommodation:- For us, self-guided was definitely the way to go, you are in control of your pace, your side trips and feel like you're stepping into the shoes of a ""real"" tramper.- Fairly basic conditions: bunk rooms, no showers, limited hours of lighting. Which is perfect for suburban dwellers like myself as it gives you some downtime from gadgets and luxuries and you earn that feeling of achievement (prove to yourself that, yes, you can survive without your skinny latte for a couple of days). Saying that, the huts have gas for cooking, fireplaces and proper toilets so there are some luxuries!- It's all communal and you will be staying with the same 40 people everyday. But the fact that they're organised and interested enough to book the self-guided means you will at least have something in common. We met some wonderful people and had a fantastic time.What to take:- You need to take everything with you except water and gas. Pots or pans, bottles, utensils, bedding are not provided. Dehydrated meals will become your new best friend. Tap water is safe as is the water from streams. Bring a camera, of course. Headlamps or a torch are essential as there is no electricity apart from lights in the dining room for two hours at night and in the morning, no lighting at all in the bunk rooms. Insect repellant. - Bin bags. What you take in, you must take out again. There are no bins, so you need to carry your rubbish with you the whole 4 days- WATERPROOF stuff. Lots of it. And i don't mean prepare for drizzle. Prepare for non-stop, heavy rain for the entire 6-8 hours of every day you walk. And prepare for feet getting completely submerged in ""puddles"". Then if it's dry, you'll be in for a pleasant surprise!- A change of clothes. Because you will get soaked through even with fancy waterproofs, and they won't dry overnight.- Ear plus if you're a light sleeper. There will be at least one snorer.- Ibuprofen if you get knee painThe walk:- Stunning. Each day is different, from walking amongst the trees to mountain sides to waterfalls and valleys.- If the weather is dry, this walk is very easy for someone reasonably fit, and a medium walk for someone with average/moderate fitness. However, chances are the weather won't be dry - which means you need to take it slow, concentrate more and get wet and cold in the process, so it gets harder for everyone.- BE CAREFUL ON DAY 2 if it has been raining. The recent tragedy experienced on this walk shows how deadly this track can turn in bad weather. There is a small basic shelter called Bus Stop where you should wait if the river looks too hard to cross. The water level can rise and fall dramatically within a short time period so if in doubt, it is better to wait. Yes, you'll be a bit cold and miserable, but it's worth it to be safe.- If you have a dodgy knee, bring poles for support on Day 3 when there is a long stint of downhill. Not very steep but just goes on for hours.Why do it?- I've personally never experienced landscape like this anywhere else. It is just beautiful.- Its a great way to immerse yourself in the nature of New Zealand- You don't need to contend with altitude sickness, snakes, crowds, litter like some other hikes in the worldEveryone will have a different opinion and experience but I hope this helps others when planning their trip."
