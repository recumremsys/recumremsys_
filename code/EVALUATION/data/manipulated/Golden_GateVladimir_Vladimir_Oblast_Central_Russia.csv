"The Golden Gate is an interesting landmark from the outside and houses some very interesting historical artifacts. There is a lot of information to be found inside and is definitely a must for a tourist in Vladimir. Beware of the stairs, there are quite a lot. Probably too much for an elderly person but very manageable for the majority of adults and younger people."
"The Golden Gate and the museum are very much worth visiting. The museum focuses on the Mongol invasion in the 13th century. See more here. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate,_Vladimir. I loved seeing the Gate and the city of Vladimir."
The beautiful gates is located in the middle of Vladimir.  You won't miss the historical site when you pass the city center.  Recommend you to have a photo stop there even if you have no interest on the displays in the museum.
The impressive gateway is on the main street in the middle if Vladimir. Check it out as you walk or drive past to other sites.Some reviews mention q display upside but we didn't stop to go in.
"Didn't really go out of our way to get here as if you are walking down the main road you will come across the golden gates. It helps to know a little if the history to make your time worthwhile,  otherwise you will just be admiring an interesting game arch and building. So stay on the main road and  you can't miss this site."
