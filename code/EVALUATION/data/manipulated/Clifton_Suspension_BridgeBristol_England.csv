Fabulous drive under and over. Quiet stunning views around. It's quiet amazing when you first see of from below in this valley. Ignore the road and cars and it's quiet a picture. I'm sure with autumn approaching the colours of the trees changing it will look spectacular
"It is good to get views from a both below, on the level and above. Takes a little moving around to do this"
"Walked up to bridge from the centre of town, it was very busy at the bridge and there were some great views. The information centre holds lots of knowledge and is worth a visit, it is free"
Visited in a beautiful sunny day which showed the bridge at its magnificent self. We walked over and back. Well worth a visit.  Clifton village is also worth a visit.
Great views of a brilliant city. Been here 30 and hope to see another 30. Visitors centre on the leigh woods side definitely worth a visit very interesting
Walked over and enjoyed the views. Can drive other using contactless card for just one pound. People can cycle across for free. Toilets on site. Coffee stall outside and a visitor centre available too.
Very nice place to see and walk around. Took some nice panoramic photos and visited the museum afterwards. Can spent 1-2 hours there in a family day.
"Walked up one side, back down the other, the views are boss. Worth going up to The Observatory too to see this incredible feat of engineering from up there - an excellent way to spend a few hours on a sunny Saturday afternoon."
Once of my favourite parts of the city - being able to walk around the down and city the bridge is a delight. Looks great and has a great history. Highly recommend
"Loved walking across the bridge, great views across the city and out over the gorge. The visitor centre is well worth a visit, free entry just give a donation, friendly welcome, informative displays. Maybe a little coffee shop? But all in all a great place to visit."
We visited on a glorious day so stunning views after a walk up the fairly steep roads to get to the bridge. Don't forget the visitors centre.
Fantastic view and piece of history.  Had been to SS Great Britian and was nice to know this was part of Brunels work.
Busy place well worth a look. The sheer drops and movement of the bridge all add to the day.. Recommend the white lion nearby for food.. excellent bbq shredded beef on chips yum !
Really refreshing. Great view and perfect for photos. Watching a sunset here I’m sure would be amazing.
Has great views across the city and down the gorge. The visitor centre on the side is also very interesting
"Walked from the CAMC site at Baltic Wharf. Pleasant path along the river, steep path to the top of the ravine BUT difficult to find from the NT Leigh Woods! Need to turn left, follow the road to the end & there you are. Very nice coffee truck just before the bridge, much needed."
"I visited on a rainy day so it was a shame but the view was still incredible, we drove across it which cost £1, but we also walked across. Recommend a visit if you pass through."
Always a splendid bridge to walk across with amazing views along the Avon Gorge and across Bristol.  Walked across this bridge today and stopped at a lovely cafe on the Leigh Woods side for a cappuccino before making my way back across and admiring the views towards the downs and over Clifton as a whole.  The only downside at the moment may be restricted opportunities to take photographs due to social distancing measures.  I think the best place to take photos of this bridge would be from the Observatory overlooking the bridge on the Clifton side.
"What a great view, gutted we wasn’t there when the hot air balloons went past but we will be back to see this spectacular views. Was definitely worth walking up the hill to see these incredible views."
Went for a drive along the bridge and the view was astounding. This is well worth the drive past when visiting Bristol.
"A beautifully constructed bridge, with lovely views of the Avon gorge.  Don’t forget to visit the Bridge Museum situated on the west side of the bridge."
"Located up the rock, so if on foot you need to do a good fitness excercize. If on car, there are parking lots, but very busy, could luckily find one. View deserves that! Check The Lookout Lentern for it, or Observatory on top. walk along the bridge, one line system for pedestrians. For cars toll is 1 pound. Google maps can say the bridge is closed, not at all."
"Drove over the bridge cost a £1. very interesting view however no opportunity to stop. Had to travel to a remote location to get parked and walk back in the rain :-( (in our case). The weather then made getting to the tourist hut undesirable and we opted not to, instead climbed the short distance to the observatory above it.  The view from here of the bridge and soundings were excellent and free. The weather prevailed however and we moved on without sampling the offerings of the observatory caff."
"A great post covid attraction, very quiet when we walked over it.  Parked close by and had no other people walking over at the same time.  Walked up the hill on the Clifton side and had some stunning views.  Lucky also we had very little wind.Shame the visitors centre was closed as this really is a masterpiece"
The bridge is pf course magnificent. Make sure to go to the visitor centre on the far side. Its very detailed but super informative of the construction and intricacies of this amazing feat of engineering.
I love bridges. The short walk of about 25 minutes or so along the banks of the river that lead you to the curve that reveals the bridge slowly was lovely. The bridge was spectacular. Enjoy.
Excellent architecture and great history. Has the most amazing views of the Avon Gorge from the bridge.
Go when the sun is setting. Totally amazing. The views are amazing. Stop and ensure you take it all in.
This is one of the landmarks of Bristol and it's a very nice from the city center (about 25 minutes) along the river! Walk up past the observatory and get a great view of the whole bridge without using a wide angle lens!
"Was nice to see this spectacular and famous suspension bridge! if you drive through it, the cost is one pound"
Saw this bridge on a rainy day and it was still great. The information center has really good information and the staff are really nice
Great views from this bridge though over very muddy waters. Good bit of Bristol history and a top ten spot to go to. Looks great at night when lit up and nice to walk across. There's a visitor's centre there open during the daytime. A fantastic walking / cycling trail that runs under it for the more adventerous and you can take great photos of the bridge from the ground up.
Yes well worth a look at. Walked over and went to a viewing platform away from the bridge but actually higher than. Have a look if you have a mo.
Iconic Bristol Bridge. A must see if you are just in Bristol for the day. Walk up to the right from the East side and there is a viewing area above the bridge.
Drove over today by accident. Great bit of British history. Great views over the river and city. Worth the £1 toll to drive over!
