"Loved USJ... Amazing rides ... great food options ... super cleanToilets ... Lots of characters freely availableTo meet andTakePhotos . Wear the most comfortableShoesLots of walking ... The park is magical , the attention to detail is beyond perfection .. the rides are different fromThe other universals visited they seem longer and are more enjoyable .Only negative criticism is thatThe introductions to some rides like backdraft and the Minions is tooooo long before the rides start .. it seems like a delaying tactic to make it seem like u started the ride but its still another 10minutes  to the start of the ride and this is  AFTER you get intoThe ride ... i am not Not talking about the queues before you start the ride . But that said i LOVED the park loved the rides and willReturn ...loves the caramelPopcorn .Fast passes can be purchased with different options depending on which rides appeal to you ... worth it  although very expensive . Most rides have the option of single riders which move very fast and beat the queues."
"There are a lot of attraction and cafe. And there are really many people! But it was so awesome! The best time in the Japan! I think, you should go there. I recommend you it! Go for it!"
"Beats Singapore’s Studios by Miles. Top service, top rides! Just a great park! Recommended for all families with kids"
Gosh the Japanese really know how to make people feel welcome! Everybody were smiling. Rides were cool. Food is expensive but really legit yummy! Loved everything!
I've visit disneyland and disney sea last with my family..and have a great time there..while universal from my personnal point of view is giving a different taste. Enter this park just loke you've been taken to the hollywood side since so many ride which related with the hollywood movies however the explanation is in japanese..Really have a great time here...
"You would need 2 days to experience everything. Son particularly enjoyed the sesame street stuff and spiderman. The harry porter world was surreal. Highly recommend that one would reserve a time ticket to enter. Went in the morning without much fuss. However, come evening, was refused entry as we did not get the time ticket. The wand was not fully utilized. Till next time, expecto patronum..."
"Wasn't even on the 'maybe' list of things to do in Japan but so glad we went! Despite teaming with visitors the hospitality second to none! Haven't been to any similar but thought the attention to detail was second to none and as an adult there were a couple fantastic rides. We forked out for the express pass so not 100% sure whether standing in hour long cues would have rated such a positive review so def look at those if you can. If you are willing, the singles' cues are a great option for cutting time in the line if you are willing to go separately...HEAPS of movie trinkets to buy and loved my minion burger lol"
"Got buy1free1 tickets from klook. My tips:1. Go on wed/thu. Check Japan school and national holidays, and sometimes sundays can be less crowded. For Crowd predictor, Google search plala gcap usj.2. Google usjinfo realtime (use chrome translate to english) to check waiting times, graph is especially useful!3. Run for the Harry Potter timed ticket first. If you're lucky like me timed tickets are not required for that day, then run straight for the most popular rides.4. Flying dinosaur is easily the best ride of the whole park. Hollywood dream forwards and backdrop are superb too.5. Hp forbidden journey has super long queues in the morning and noon, more than 2 hour queue, crowd dies down near evening and queue becomes 10 minutes long. Always check the graphs for queue times!6. Always use single rider lane whenever possible. Saves you massive amount of time and money.And that's how I was able to ride almost every attraction (Hollywood dream twice and forbidden journey thrice) with a normal usj ticket!"
Was a fabulous day. Loved the Harry Potter ride- warm butter beer is delicious. The night light show was spectacular. The service was so friendly and helpful. So appreciated how great they do.
"Great time but extremely crowded. Bought the fast track 4 for an extra £100pp (ouch !) as hate queues. But beware - worked well on H Potter - 20m instead of 1h20m. Big attraction was Flying Dinsaur, BUT... the fast track only was valid from 19.10pm, probably to keep us there all day ... turned away at 18.00 and 19.08 (!!) 15m to ride instead of 1h40m - fair improvement. The other two fast tracks were hardly worth it. Jaws was only 18m wait (single rider) and pretty much free for all entry into the massive Terminator theatre .... You pays your money you takes your choice ..."
The park is fantastic! Went on October 1st and they were ready with their halloween horror nights!  The Japanese staff in the venue is just fantastic!!!
"Visited Universal Studios Japan for 2 days and had a great time! It was my second time visiting the park and would love to go back if I ever get back out to Japan. They still have the classic Jaws ride and Waterworld show which has since been removed from the US parks!We enjoyed all three Cool Japan attractions while we visited; Neon genesis VS  Godzilla, Sailor moon and Attack on Titan. There was also various one piece merchandise scattered around the park! We visited in July and it was hot, the park has several cooling stations spray mist too cool people down as well as a water fight parade which we joined in, but warning you get soaked! We also sat in the splash zone during Waterworld and we got cooled off for sure!The night time parade was one of the best I have ever seen also! When the park opens head straight to The Flying Dinosaur, the coaster is incredible but  warning it is very forceful and intense, which is perfect for me! the queue for the ride builds up fast so it's best to go to it right away. DO NOT go straigh for Harry Potter world over the two days we visited I noticed that the queue for Harry Potter jumps right up as soon as the park opens but tends to get shorter around the afternoon. I guess most people head straight there and then do the rest of the park."
"Enjoyed a full days worth at the park. Rides were great fun even though they were narrated in Japanese. Waiting time for popular rides without fastpass was 90 to 100 minutes. Couldn't do it all but that was expected given the popularity and the sheer number of people present. Artwork, costumes and creativity was amazing with different themes spread across the amusement park. Staff on site were really friendly and cheerful all day long. My wife and I enjoyed our time there."
"Excellent theme park, much enjoyed my time here. Being a theme park, F&B items are going to be a bit more expensive, but it is not outrageous. I spent 3800 JPY on lunch for 2. The rest are all on you, water dispensers are available throughout the park and resting areas are plentiful.Some tips:Be there early: We were at the park at 0735 which was 1 hour ahead of the park opening and there were already long queues with hundreds upon hundreds of people waiting. The gates opened earlier than expected at 0810 instead of 0830 however.Get an express pass: You will need it to avoid the crazy long queues. Queues can be extremely long at popular rides. I was a single rider on The Flying Dinosaur, entered the queue showing 35 minute wait and eventually waited slightly more than an hour. I finished the ride, looked at the queue board. Normal: 120 minutes. Single: 110 minutes. You can figure this yourself.Consider planning a rushed start where you're moving fast and running and hitting all the big attractions/rides before the crowd comes. Then tuning down into relaxed mode once you've cleared those rides. Refer to above express pass comment. This also works in favour if you already have an express pass because you will need to make choices on what rides do you want to use your express pass on. For example, we did the Harry potter ride using express pass. We had an option of using the express pass for Jaws which was the next area, but we queued for it instead as the queue was ""only"" 30 minutes and saved the pass for Terminator.Some ride review:The Harry Potter ride was excellent, but one tip, lean forward and rest on the shoulder rest. I thought I wanna sit back and relax but my view was partially blocked until I leaned forward and my ride became better. It is nevertheless an excellent ride. You will need to stow your baggage in the provided lockers.Terminator 2: 3DThis is definitely worth your time. 30 minutes of a sit-back-and-enjoy show.Spiderman 4kUpon reaching the end of the queue and seeing the ride, I asked myself: ""Is this recycled from Transformers?"" I didn't find this ride enjoyable not because the 3D glasses were constantly being knocked off my face from the movement and I had to hold on to it all the way, but it was really just bland for me. Transformers was much better  and I really think this Spiderman is recycled from Transformers but I could be wrong.I didn't do the Minion ride as our express pass was for a very late timing and my partner was very tired. So we left early. It's a great place to visit nevertheless albeit the expensive express pass."
"I've been to USJ three time with my family already.  We just love this place!  It's so much fun.  Our favourites are Harry Potter, Jaws, Waterworld, Jurassic World, Terminator, Spiderman, and more.  Only downside of course are the long lines.  Getting fast pass is very expensive especially for a family of four.  So we put up with the waiting and can't always get in all the rides that we want to in a single day.  That's why we have been here 3 different times!"
i found this park to be one of the best universal parks that i have been too. If it is a hot day please take sun screen and plenty of Water as it was a hot day on the day i went and i got burnt. Please pace your day out and perhaps do the ride ride that you really want to do earlier in the day with less crowds as i went on a Saturday . As the day went on the park got busier . Find a cool place around 2.00 pm to sit and claim you space for the afternoon parade and just watch the world go past people were dressed up in costumes which made it fun to watch and the parade was interactive with the crowds and unlike a park that has a mouse were the staff forced people to sit down the staff here wanted the people to stand and get involved .  I was mad at myself for not seeing the evening parade as from what i have seen it is awesome but i had only one day here and i was tired and sunburned by 6.00pm when i left but maybe get there early do a while bunch of rides in the morning find a cool place to rest for a while and then do some more and rest so that you get to see the night parade.I want to come back here
Took our 18 & 19 year old to see Harry Potter which they love. The queues were crazy an average wait of 1.5 to 2 hr wait to get into any ride so worth buying a express pass.
"We went to Universal on the last day of our Japan holiday and what a way to finish!! We had pre-booked our entrance tickets but also our fast-pass tickets noting that the fast pass tickets cost more than the park tickets themselves - but for me were totally worth it. Be reminded that if you choose to buy your fast pass tickets on the day, you will pay top wack as the prices fluctuate the closer you get to the date you want to go.....make sense?? Please carefully choose your fast pass ticket bundle - from memory, you can do bundles with 3, 4 or 7 rides. Unknowingly we selected all the top rides which was a bonus as the queue time for some of these rides (like the Flying Dinosaur) ended up being 120 mins!! Like Disney, the park itself was rammed - more so when we went as there was a Halloween special, with lots of people walking round in fancy dress. The rides are awesome. I have 3 boys (aged 13, 10 and 8) where our favorite rides were The Flying Dinosaur, Hollywood - The Ride, Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey as well as the motion based 3D rides such as Spider-Man and Despicable Me. There are height restrictions on some of the roller coasters (I think min 132 cm) but my 8 year old was tall enough. We had lunch - quality was pretty good although grossly overpriced however loads of restaurants and outlets to choose from. We got to the park early and stayed for over 12 hours - yes we were knackered by the end of the day but was totally worth it! The park is well connected to the JR network with its own station which takes you back into the centre of Osaka so we had no trouble getting back to our hotel afterwards. For me, Universal was better than Disney in Tokyo, a fantastic place to have lots of fun with the kids!!"
"BEST NIGHT EVER: Was a bit hesitant about USJ after Disneyland and the INSANE crowds....I’d read through some forums you can rock up and purchase a twilight ticket for use in the park after 3pm. We did this! Slightly cheaper, We skipped the insane heat, we skipped the crowds. Longest wait times for Minion Mayhem-and that was only 30 minutes. Jaws was a 20 minute wait, The Amazing Spider-Man was 20 minutes and the Jurassic Park ride, my partner walked straight in.If there is just one person riding, we’d definitely recommend the single rider queue. Come 7.30/8 you can pretty much walk straight on in. I’m surprised we got so many “popular” rides in, we had a sick time, and the Hogwarts Light show shouldn’t be missed!"
Weather is great here! Just in time for the Halloween night and almost everyone is “dressed to kill” or frighten you! An absolutely fantastic experience especially when we visit at this time. Getting here is quite a breeze just a total of 7 stops from Nippombashi station!
"The rides are awesome and mind blowing. It is not possible to cover all the rides in a day. Hence, try to extend for 2 days or buy express pass. So that you can explore all the rides and places. There is some height restriction for kids in few rides.If you are fine with exploring only important/famous activities, one day is enough with normal pass. Don't miss Harry potter and few other rides. Location is near Universal station which is covered in JR pass."
"We’re frequent visitors to the Hollywood and Orlando Universal Studios locations, and I would rank Osaka below Orlando and well above Hollywood. As is the case with everywhere in Japan, the Osaka universal studios is extremely clean. The rides are solid to great, with the highlights being Flying Dinosaur and the Hollywood Dream ride. As a huge theme park fan, I can say unequivocally that the Flying Dinosaur is one of my favorite rides of all time. The Hollywood Dream ride isn’t a majorly thrilling rollercoaster, though it’s definitely fun and a really smooth ride. Keep in mind, the lines for most rides are absolutely freaking ridiculous. There was a temporary VR Neon Genesis ride while we were there (it was mediocre, though I guess if you’re a fan of the cartoon then it would be cool), and the wait was almost four hours long. As such, I HIGHLY suggest getting an Express pass. Be aware that it’s different than the pass at Universal Studios Hollywood, as you’re only able to choose between several bundles of rides whose lines you can cut. That said, it’s absolutely worth it and pretty much required if you want to ride more than a few rides. (10/2018)"
"Very weird coming here as it is SO similar to the one in Hollywood, minus the studio tour of course! But the whole feel of the place, and many of the rides and attractions, are exactly the same. We went because a niece is performing in one of the live shows, but in fact had a good day all round! The shows are brilliant and the rides we went on were also excellent. But Hogwarts as an area was the best part of the day! It just looks and feels as you would imagine it would do. There are quite a few food options on the park; we had pizza for lunch, which was surprisingly good, and later on popped into the diner for drinks. Neither was ridiculously expensive given that you are in a theme park so are a captive clientele. Getting to USJ is pretty straightforward on the Osaka subway and local train line, with just a couple of minutes' walk, clearly signposted, when you leave the station."
"(English couple from London) My partner and I are mid-twenties and from London. Having done Disneysea already we were in two minds to go here on a hot afternoon. We bought the Twilight pass at 3pm for 6,000Yen and managed to ride EVERY SINGLE RIDE in 6 hours!! It is ten times more magical than Disney here and you do not need Express Passes so no need to overspend. This was the perfect ending to our holiday. It doesn’t make a difference that everything was in Japanese, the rollercoasters were incredible. We rode in single passengers where possible. There was no queues in Harry Potter at all and we got straight on those rides at 20:30. Bring some snacks and you won’t have to spend a penny here! If you’re in any doubt, we hope this review convinces you to go for a fun afternoon."
"Worthy a visit for all, solo, friends, couples, groups, family, a one day visit is enough for travelers, if I live around there I'll be visiting every while for excitement and adrenaline games. Most of the games are speedy trains with different types and scenes. Some of the games are unworthy the time spent on waiting. Waiting line are for too long during rush hours, less at late hours."
"Being in this place makes me young & relax. My favorite characters are around for the ""meet & greet"".The feel of Christmas is still present, with Christmas songs still playing & Christmas trees are still around."
"Very happy amazing place happiest place on earth but expensive. Went during Halloween. A lot of effort put in by amusement theme park workers.  Queues are long, but not unbearable. We used quick pass anyway which was very handy and definitely worth it."
"I usually stay away from Theme Parks so I did not expect to have as great a time as I did. Plan ahead. Figure out what you want to do and the order and how to tackle two hour lines. Do not miss the Harry Potter attraction!! Check out what special events are happening around the time of your visit. When we went they had a Summer Parade where everyone sprays everyone else with water and gets soaked, which was a really fun way to cool off! And don't forget to take a photo in front of the Universal Studios globe by the entrance!"
"The interenet gives you access to knowledge like never before and my kid is proof of this!    She saw one brochure at a travel show and from there it was Disney this, Unversal that.    We'd agreed to go to one of the major theme parks and although we would later stay between the two Disney parks in Tokyo, we had a preference for Universal Studios.   This visit may have been for our daughter, but we still had to deal with it and Universal appealed to both of us more.You'll find Universal Studios towards the Harbour,  a few stops down from Osaka station on the Yumesaki line.    The stop you want is actualy called Universal City and is not right on the park, but a short walk through numerous resturaunts, bars and hotels.   As we arrived, station staff were advising that visitors purchase return tickets immediately to avoid long queues.   Do this!   You won't regret it. The park entrance is an open plaza with ticket booth, entry and lockers to the left and the Universal globe and fountain to the right for selfies.   Another great tip here is that there are luggage lockers and toilets before the entry and there are also lockers once inside the park.    Use the ones inside the park as once you leave the park, there is no re-entry.   Seems a bit unfair but it's their park, thier rules.    Entry for two adults and one child cost us around AUD$300.   That includes standard rides in the regular queue.  In hindsight, we shoud have chosen the Priority line tickets, as queues were as long as 90 minutes for some attractions.    We also noted that some of those times were overstated, or the number of riders had reduced and the wait-time hadn't been changed.   We had entered the park around 2pm on a wet day and it was still really busy.   The park itself is broken up into serveral themed areas and you should make yourself aware of these with the park map or before you go.   Some of these may just not be of interest, such as the Americana area was not interesting to us.    The minions area was smashed with visitors and looong wait times and we nded up wandering to the Jurasic park area and onto the boat ride.   Queue time stated 45 mins but it took us about 28 mins and we got to the front of the boat.  Way cool!   BTW, buy the overpriced 400yen plastic poncho from the vending machine.   Those things served us for the whole day and were essential at the front of the boat!    This is a fun ride.   We did get stuck on one part for about 15 mins and a dinosaur peed in my ear, my daughter's favourite part of the ride, and it was really fun.   Just wish I knew where the camera was as the Japanese father next to us popped a dab at the right time and made a very cool photo souvenir!    As the lttle one was mostly too little for the really fun rides, we took her to snoopy land and the other kids areas.   Just beware that some of these shut down their kids rides at 4pm, leaving you with one grumpy kid.   But don't worry, there's plenty of other rides for them that are still going.   Even the waterworld attraction shut early.   For us, the best part was Harry Potter world.   By 4pm, queues are shrinking and so are the crowds so 20 mins or less is the average wait times we found.    Do the ride in Hogwarts, no I'm not going to spoil it, but just don't do the Butter Beer beforehand.   It tastes alright but that stuf comes back to haunt you!    I have to say that HP world make the visit for us.   It's well planned and executed and presents realistic worl at twilight.As we wandered towards the gate, I told the family I was going to do one decent scary coaster ride, with or without them.    That was the Flying Dinosaur ride.    I got on the car with three quite young Japanese guys I didn't know, we screamed and laughed our guts out, and got off to high-fives and the new found bortherhood of the Flying Dinosaur.   Brilliant!!It's hard to write about leaving as everything now had a dull taste to it.    Good thing we had already bouth our return tickets!   Now for a 39 min ride home to Kyoto...Basically, go a little later, buy your return train tickets when you arrive, buy the priority tickets, use the lockers indise the park and have fun.    When we tought about it, this was better entertainement value that a day at the Sydney Easter Show."
Lots and lots of people. Book early and get to park early for best possible spot to view show. Getting to a restroom will be a challenge due to the heavy crowd.
"We bought our tickets online from Klook for Code A week and the tickets are emailed to us and we just printed the tickets directly. Do not resize the tix. QR code is scanned at entry. We arrived at 8.30am and park opened at 9.30am. We ran to Harry Potter for our 1st ride. I think it is better to do Flying Dinosaur as 1st ride and then go to Harry Potter for picture taking. You may ride Harry Potter after 7pm with no wait at all. On average, Flying Dino has a 100min wait. Maybe it is due to the fact that it was closed for 1-2 hrs in the late morning. All other rides were a wait of 15min to 30min. Minion is 45min but i think it was due to the silly introduction which I almost drifted off to wonderland. We didnt watch any show since it was in Japanese. In between we had more than 2hrs of rest for lunch and dinner and after 2nd ride of Harry Potter after 7pm, we had more than 2 hrs of free time for shopping! We did sit all rides. A family of 7 bought the 7 express passes and told us it was truly a waste of money as the wait wasn't long. However you may check if other weeks require express passes."
"Wonderful time, lots of fun and plenty to do for young children.  It got very crowded when we were there and we got separated but nevertheless, we still had lots of fun !  (there were 7 of us).  We didn't have enough time to take all the rides.  At least 50% of the rides, need to queue for 45mins or more.  We checked, it was not even the school holidays in japan.  So...  Suggest it is better to get a 2 days passToilets are spacious and very thoughtfully designed for parents with young children."
Went there on Monday. Booked tickets from the Klook app and got the special entry. Managed to go in 15 mins early than the others. my first ride was the Harry Potter ride! took a lot of pictures with less crowds in it. love the butter beer (Non alcoholic drink) will definitely go here again in the future!
"We made a bee line straight to the Harry Potter world. The beer butter is must try but it’s really sweet. Recommended to share a cup amongst a couple of people just for the experience.All rides in Harry Potter world are worth going for, we queue for less than 30min even without the express tickets."
Do come early. Many people running at the start to get on the rides with shorter queues. You snooze you lose
