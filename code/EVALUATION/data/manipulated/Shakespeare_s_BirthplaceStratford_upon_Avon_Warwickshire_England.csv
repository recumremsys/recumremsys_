The 5 pass made for a good value. Interesting details provided by staff located though out house. add words to make it.
Excellent. Makes Shakespeare’s boyhood experience come to life. Must see the graffiti in the windows of his home and much more.
Husband and I visited for his birthday 09/10/2020. All covid precautions in place. Staff very friendly and informative. Learnt a lot about our language as well as about Shakespeare himself. Seeing his cot was a delight. Was well worth a visit
"Visited on 04/08  with the family, including 13 + 9 yr olds. Very interesting and definitely worth the 5 centre family ticket. This is a must for the Shakespeare experience and clearly very popular. The house is part of a full walk through with educational centre to start before entering the gardens and actual house. The house and staff are excellent and you do get the ambience of the time and how hard life must have been. From the house you reenter the gardens and we took advantage of two very articulate and interesting actors who recreate some of the Bards works. Excellent!"
"Touch the doors he touched.  See where he had his meals.  Look at the room he learned his early skills as a glove maker - apprentice to his father.  There's something of a magical quality about being in the actual house where Will Shakespeare lived.For the sixth time.But I learned a great deal from the guides during this visit.  The wide wooden floorboards had gaps between them to allow heat from the fires below to warm the bedrooms.  The chamber pots were positioned on the left of the bed so those below needed to be vigilant.  Beware 'getting out of bed on the wrong side'. And the foot long staves that lined the wooden frame each side of of the bed and helped keep the blankets from falling off either side, could be pulled out in the blink of an eye, and used to bludgeon intruders — to stave off danger.The modern extension on the side of the timber framed house, has a wonderful video presentation and a great of historical facts about Elizabethan theatre and life at the time. You simply cannot go to Stratford and not visit this house.  It would be like going to the Louvre and not seeing the Mona Lisa.  Like going to Rome and not seeing the Sistine Chapel.  Going to New York and not seeing the Declaration of Independence.  The human race does produce exceptionally brilliant specimens now and again — the least the rest of us can do is pay homage."
Interesting display and video 15 minutes showing various old and new performances along with lots of info re his works and life.  Lovely peaceful and tranquil garden and interesting old house with some people inside who knew their info.  Disappointed with the courtyard actors who seemed to be happy to sit around and chat for over 39 minutes without performing.  Eventually gave up and went out through the shop.  Good value ticket for 4 Shakespeare sites available.
"Started our trip to Stratford here and bought a family ticket for £59 to enable us to visit all 5 Shakespeare locations. The birthplace was quite busy and I would have liked to spend more time reading the history boards, but felt a little rushed through by the lines and lines of other visitors also making their way through the house.  Beautiful garden also with a couple of actors acting a few scenes from different plays in the garden. Very cool!"
Enjoyed a morning trip to Shakespeares birthplace using the full story ticket we had purchased. Very interesting and definitely worth a visit with the added bonus of the acting out of scenes from his plays out in the courtyard area.
We went with friends and kids. Found the place to be really interesting and easy going. Good give shop although one of the shop assistant was very unhelpful to not just us but quite a few people. Was disappointing she was there as spoiled the very nice experience up to meeting her.
Staff helpful and friendly as always.  Covid restrictions explained well. Was disappointed we couldn’t walk through the gardens and am not sure why we couldn’t as people were socially distancing well.
"Before entering you can enjoy displays of the immense  chronological  work and impact of his penNumerous Phases and words used today are quoting Shakespeare The “3” cottages are well wornAmazing knowledge when engaging the docents on history. Enjoy the now removed Visitor’s Windows on display with many other famous people have visited that house, and scratched their names into the windows in the house - forever leaving their mark on history. Some of these people include Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Charles Dickens, and Walter Scott. Outside short skit performances are “audience participation”The garden is manicured but small. Walk down the street to very large outdoor garden if that is your likingThe book store is a must with delicate to amusing soveniers"
"Visited Stratford recently with my teenage daughter. We visited all of the Shakespeare houses. Anne Hathaway’s cottage & Arden’s farm were the most enjoyable. The member of staff at new place who gave an introductory talk was very informative & easy to listen too. Worth catching the talk otherwise you may not fully understand the history of the place. All in all a very enjoyable day. We booked the combined tickets online, just be aware that the cottage & farm are out of town. They were a short drive from the centre, but too far to walk unless you have plenty of time."
"WE went here for the day, very intresting, we went to 4 of the houses, not the farm. The staff were great ver informative, ground lovely. easy to get to. disbaled parkling at the back of the shakespeare birth place.The history and presance about this place/ town was magical.Thank you for a great day we will be back.WE used our tesco clubcard vouchers for a annual ticket for all houses etc. well worth it!"
"Visited Shakespeare's birthplace and it was interesting. There is an actor in the garden who will enthusiastically recite some verses from requested Shakespeare's play. Anne Hathaway's Cottage is beautiful and most interesting. Lovely to learn how people live during the era from guides located in some rooms. For eg, I found that people slept sitting up that was why the beds were smaller."
The introduction film is interesting. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable. Such great history on display. Loved the Shakespeare actors in the garden.
Visited this site as part of our bus tour. Really enjoyed the tour and how the site is laid out. Fun watching some of the actors outside performing some Shakespeare dialogue.Very informative and interesting to see the house and learn about the family history. Well worth a stop and visit.
"We started with a mini museum, followed by a 15 minute cinema, entertained by competent guides and actors performing Skaespears work and lovely gardens. Highly reccomend but get there early. Within 90 minutes the venue was quite busy. Thank you to the Actresses on the day, they involved me and it was great fun, Thank you.  Enjoy!"
"Booked this within an offer of the five Shakespear venues, what value and with the bus that drops and picks up at each venue it was great managed this with Anne Hathaways house and Mary Ardens house as well as the other places on the list.  Fabulous a must do thing on any trip to Stratford"
Visited Shakespeare’s Birthplace yesterday with my wife and our newborn. It was a fantastic experience - as most of you would have studied shakespeare this is a great experience to understand our national bard. The only negative is that you cannot take a pram/pushchair around the house. Very understandable as it is very narrow and historic. But just a warning to be prepared to carry your little one around the house.Thank you to all the actors and historians who were working at there yesterday. Everyone we met was fantastic!
Have read his books during college & seen few plays also . It was wonderful seeing his home which was maintained immaculate with information . We enjoyed walking around the town.
"Given the choice of paying lots for one house or paying a little bit more and an open opportunity of seeing other houses, we spent that little bit extra and managed 2 houses in the time we had. The intro video was engaging, the gardens were among the best kept I have ever seen, and the actors acting in the cold outside a nice touch. Shakespeare's birthplace was interesting especially if there was a guide with their bit of the story to tell. We loved the gardens most. I couldn't say if we've had value for money as we will try to get back to visit the other places but I'm sure it is. If you have time and an inclination to drink in the displays then you will have an incredibly immersive experience. Same if you have kids as their are activities for them to do that help engage and entertain."
Was a bit sceptical as I’m not an avid Shakespeare follower however was pleasantly surprised by the two locations we visited...birthplace and family home but not Ann Hathaways house. The guides in all locations were very knowledgeable particularly at the family home which had been altered/ rebuilt over the period in question. The garden was fabulous there. Would recommend a visit.
Not even 1 star but lowest you can select. Do not purchase this ticket’ all the houses are closed except Shakespeare’s birthplace. I am yet to hear about a refund. The tickets are being mid-sold because you cannot use them.
"Lovely house, exhibitions were interesting and the staff were very knowledgable. Was lovely to see live performances of some of Shakespeare's plays taking part in the gardens."
"Visiting Shakespeare's birthplace was very interesting. The home complete with a pie on the table seemed authentic and realistic for the time. To visit the church where he is buries, the theatre where he performed and The Other theatre  were other highlights of the visit. We also glimpsed Anne Hathaways cottage. Well worth the visit to Stratford on Avon."
pushed round quickly .so to get you to the gift shop. rip off price and overated . go to Warwick instesd much better place to visit.
Wasn’t sure what to expect especially as none of us are too familiar with Shakespeare and his life and works. It really didn’t matter as there was so much interesting information and the staff had so much knowledge and enthusiasm to share. Would recommend this to anyone. Might not be very interesting for younger children who have no awareness of the life and works of this amazing man
"Really enjoyed touring the birthplace of Shakespeare. The grounds were very so scenic and you could peruse at your own pleasure.Inside has lots of information available from the local experts, who were also dressed up in Tudor clothing. Loved the mixture of history regarding the period and the history of the writer. The actors were very friendly and very informative. Actor outside in the gardens reciting Shakespeare's works was also a real delight I stayed a while longer just to hear him do more. Was very impressed."
Me and Becky visited and it is the birthplace to Britain’s most well known bard and that is it. Think Stratford is quite rightly milking this fact
"Visited today and pleasantly surprised to find it wasn’t busy! We spent a good couple of hours absorbed in everything Shakespeare here! Loved it! Started off in the Shakespeare Centre which was a good introduction before we walked through a lovely, colourful garden (for this time of year!) to the Birthplace itself. All of the guides were friendly and happy to answer our questions. We really enjoyed talking to Joe in the glove shop as we learnt some new things about Shakespeare’s life. A very interesting visit...Thank you!"
Was nice to see the history resolving around the poet. Was a nice half an hour touring round and viewing the history boards. Would recommend if you was interested in history and Shakespeare.
You can’t go to Stratford without visiting the birthplace of the great man. Now a shopping promenade set around the history building. Lots of tourists and tourist traps. Can be expensive due to the massive number of foreign visitors. Recommend non the less!
"Enjoyed the 5 venues very much, we only had a day to fit them all in but just managed it. It was very informative."
Enjoyed a bus trip through Cotswolds and Stratford. Good to have a commentator to learn of history. Great to go into his parents home where he was born and see house he died in. This town is all about him and his history. A nice day out or visit overnight not so rushed.
"Having visited the four 'houses' open this time of year, I have been enthralled by enthusiastic tour guides detailing the life of the house and its occupants, despite adverse weather. Then entertained at Shakespeare's birth place by 3 players delivering sonnets and speeches, portraying characters from audience chosen plays despite, the cold enough to stiffen the sinews of any tourist."
