I have worked in museums and visited museum around the world and this is the best one I’ve ever seen. Fabulous exhibit made me cry. So thorough. Make sure you have the whole day to look around. The cafe is good too. We shopped at the gift shop too which was excellent.
"Went to this Museum and spent a whole day here, I must say it was amazing.  So much information and wonderful displays. If you have a chance to go I would make sure you take the time."
"This museum is packed with so much information! I am particularly interested in WWII history so of course I loved it but I think it would be worth visiting even if you aren't. I recommend planning out your visit since there is so much to see. Definitely don't miss the building with all the airplanes. The museum is open with reduced capacity, social distancing guidelines, and extra cleaning. Take this into consideration when planning your visit and buy tickets online before you go if possible."
"We spent 2 days touring the WWII Museum and probably could have spent another day too!  Very well done and laid out.  Staff were fantastic, facility was spotless and very aware of COVID prevention,  There was a special exhibit on glass collected from Europe's churches and made into are that was fantastic.  They had a European, Pacific and another special wing that were superb.  We did not do the 4D movie - kinda wishing now we had.  Did get a $2 off coupon and then the 2nd day back was $7.  A must see when in New Orleans!"
"This is a wonderful museum everyone should visit.  Spent two days there, and could have spent more.  So much to admire about our Fathers and Grandfathers.  The sacrifices they and their families made to assure us of freedom is hard to comprehend."
We love any type of history museum but this was really an exceptional one. The layout is very good. Had no ideal there would be so much reading and video presentations. Our mistake was to only plan for one day here. It would definitely take two full days to see and heare everything that is here.
"Being a Veteran, this was very important for me to see.  They took great care and time putting this magnificent museum together.  Bring to life the actual people and places that encompassed WWII and life on the home front.  I loved being able to see more than just the Uncle Sam and Rosie the Riveter posters, and the stories behind the items shown in the museum.  Well worth the visit!"
"This was an amazing museum, one of the best I've been to. I'm not a huge museum buff, or a history buff, but this was a very elaborate and personal experience that I think every American should see. Packed with artifacts, and personal stories, it's impossible not to feel moved by this place. I can only go to museums for about 3-4 hours at a time before I reach my intake limit, but that only covered about 1/3 of the campus. I would totally go back again to learn more."
"This was our second trip to the museum, the last being about three years ago.  My how it's grown!This is the most comprehensive installation of WW II stories and memorabilia one could imagine.  The addition of the Boeing gallery, with suspended vintage versions of the great WW II aircraft, is not to be missed!One realizes the sacrifices of the entire country and of specific men and women as they fought against great evil.  It honors folks like our parents and our uncle (who gave his life in Germany 2 weeks before wars end).  Every one who contributed to this effort - on battlefield, in hospitals, on ships and planes - is a hero, and the WW II museum honors them magnificently!Don't miss it, and bring your entire family!  Note: It is great for kids, but they should be at least age 12 to have a sense of the history.  Some exhibits are explicit, with film and photography of harsh events."
I have three boys ages 11-14.  They love history.  We do museums.  Have been to the WWI museum in Kansas City twice because they love it so much and that is the only thing we have done twice as a family who loves road trips.  All five of us agreed this was the best museum we have ever been to.  We spent 6 hours including lunch.  Lunch was pretty good for felt it was a bit pricey.  I think we probably missed some exhibits.  I wished I had had a map with all the nooks and crannies to make sure we got as much as we could.  The staff is outstanding.  It’s really interactive.  I highly recommend to watch the movie.  We got tickets online for 9:15 then movie at 10:00 and that worked out well.  Parking is across the street and very reasonable for the area.  We paid $14 for 3-7 hours of parking.  That’s all I’m going to say so not to spoil it.  Do this.
Visited the museum there is so much that all could not be seen in one visit.  I love how they have the dog tags and that you can follow an individual as he/she travels throughout the war and talks about their experiences.  The volunteers were especially helpful in helping us determine what we wanted to see and do.  They gave us great directions after asking us what we were interested in due to the limited time we had there.  Highly recommend visiting and great learning experience for anyone.
We only had 2.5 hours and it was not enough. This museum is truly a must do in New Orleans and we all need to realize the sacrifices and heroism of so many people world wide during WWII. We cannot forgot what so many men and women fought for and  the freedom so many gave their lives for. Don't miss the Airplane room at the end- just breathtaking
"The WWII museum (also called the D Day museum) is one of the most interesting, organized museums I have ever experienced. Don't miss this important site!"
WOW.... We spent 4 hours here.  Everything is awesome.  Great for kids and even I learned something more.  I talked with WW2 Veterans for over 1/2 hour.  Loved them.  Sooooo much to see. Words can't express the overwhelming experience.  Intense and humble.  Don't miss this one.
"I could have spent 6 hours touring the campus, there is so much to take in here. It is amazingly put together with audio and visuals that really immerse you an quite the experience. Give yourself LOTS of time to tour this, you won't regret it!"
"To see this museum fully, you need to take two days.  We went as a birthday outing and the time just flew by.  Sad to say, we forget about this spectacular venue all the time.  Blame it on being a local.  It is now five buildings!  Upon realizing what we still needed to see, we became members.  Our next outing is already on the calendar.  See the movie.  Next trip, we are going on the submarine experience."
Great museum. Separates the two campaign in Europe and the pacific. Was great for my kids to see. When we left I asked my son what what was the generation called that fought the war. The greatest generation and now you know why. They truly sacrificed for us. I hope it wasn’t in vain.
"This is an excellent museum, it’s very large and very well kept. Be ready to spend some time because this is not a quick in & out to get the most of your visit. The movie “Beyond All Boundries” is an absolute must see!! The airplane exhibit was great too."
Go see this.  We were there for 1 day and you really needed 2.  So informative.  This museum will have you going through all kinds of emotions.
Great musem.  Gets better everytime we go.  The interactive parts were closed for Corona but it was good never the less.
"A very educational and moving experience at the WWII Museum. A vast amount of Powerful   information about WWII.  A great history lesson for those who are young and know very little about the sacrifice and hardships endured by ""the greatest generation"" Worth every penny !!! Make sure you see the Tom Hanks presentation."
"I am retired military and am obsessed with the WWII era of history. Have read an obscene amount of books on this era so coming here was an amazing way to see a lot of WWII artifacts first hand. The collection of items in this museum is second to none. The personnel who work there are over the top helpful and polite. Definitely schedule your whole day for the museum, there’s sooooo much to see! Highly recommend!!"
Excellent museum. Very modern and makes a real afford to capture some of the atmosphere the various theatres of war had. Captures some of the many human stories of heroism and sorrow.
"My 15 year old history buff loved this museum .  We spent 4 1/2 hours and only got through about a 1/3 of the exhibits.  We did watch the movie, which took up about an hour.  Great gift shops throughout the museum.  Buy tickets online to avoid long lines during peak times."
"An absolutely amazing experience.  You keep going and going through all the exhibits, and the sheer magnitude of what humanity went though during that horrible period of time is simply overwhelming.   We spent most of a day there and I could have easily spent two days to stop and really look at everything.The ""Beyond All Boundaries"" experience narrated by Tom Hanks is a must-see.  Don't skip it because of the add-on price.   It's worth it.  There is construction going on and I'll be back to see the new things that are coming."
Went for a convention and presentation.  The entire experience was fantastic!  The food was great.  The staff were friendly.  The presentation went well and the stage/lighting/sound were excellent.  I would recommend for any event.
Went here during Covid. The place was almost empty and we got to spend a lot of time looking at stuff. I watch the WW2 programs on tv but this has much more and many war items to see. Thank you for presenting this in a way that brings it to life. My spouse didn’t even know that we were fighting on 2 fronts so it made it more special for her to learn new things.
"This museum is beyond words, really. First, it is huge with more artifacts than probably all other museums combined. We have visited Churchill's War Rooms and thought it was amazing, but this museum surpassed it. From personal stories intertwined to just so many facts and interesting displays, they hit everything when they made this place. My teenager appreciated how the floor got rough when we were learning about being in the trenches and was smooth carpet when we read about less intense portions. Just amazing. Go and spend your day here!"
This is a venue NOT to be missed. The curators have designed a well thought out way to visit the components of WW 2. Allow a full day and be sure to include Tom Hanks unbelievable moving and emotional movie with your ticket. Every American of every age should be required by law to visit this museum as its message is ageless.
Beautifully constructed museum and well thought out layout. Do keep in mind that this is not a museum you could do under an hour. There is massive amounts of information and it could take hours to get through the whole museum. There is a massive presence of older folks so be mindful of noise levels.
"Best WW2 museum in the country, kids got a lot out of it too. Do the submarine “final mission” and go through as many exhibits as you can - it’s so comprehensive."
"There is so much that they could have done with these exhibits.  Things could be interactive.  Following the dog tag or soldiers could be more poignant.  The 4D movie missed the mark.  It reminded me of newsreels at the movies when I was young.  I love they have volunteer veterans and hearing their stories as I spoke with them was much more interesting.  Once you see one building, you don't need to see others.  They already need to revamp exhibits!"
"Excellent experience, learned a lot.  Allow plenty of time.  We were there over 3 hours and still only got through 2 exhibits."
"It's ok, but I was disappointed in truth - the scale of the museum buildings promised something more substantial. Having visited WW!! museums in eg Normandy , this pales by comparison. Exhibits are limited, storyboards  ae confused and of mixed quality. And really quite expensive."
"Visited the museum on a Sunday afternoon. It was VERY crowded, but people were respectable. Much to see (lots of original old footage) and read. You could easily spend 2 days taking in everything. Limited food available within the building. Disappointed there were not more airplanes/tanks/original equipment on display."
