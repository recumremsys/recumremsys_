Climb uneven stone steps to the coloured shrine. Then keep climbing up up up to the tomb at the very top. A peaceful resting place and worth over 200 big steps. Nice bronze & stone lanterns & pillars along the way.
Way to many steps for me but my travel companions made it to the top.  Be sure to wear comfortable shoes.
"Not the most impressive Shrine in Japan, but certainly it has the prominence. Layed out in a series of levels, irregular stone steps - makes visiting for some a bit difficult. Crowded at the site and especially in the ropeway leading down to the Shrine itself - I personally think they jam too many into the tram. Worth a visit, but not on the top bucket list."
We took the stairs up as the cable car was not working. The climb is amazing. Takes about 20 minutes. The shrine is beautiful and peaceful. A great place to visit. The English audio guide is very useful if you want to know more.
"Many, many steps to climb but really worthwhile to see. Very nice architecture. Use the wood and bamboo walking sticks found near the ticket booth. Go early to avoid the crowd"
"This shrine is hard to get to but well worth it.  We took the gondola from the plateau.  There are several gates and you must walk up many steps with tall risers, so take advantage of the free bamboo walking sticks by the first gate.  The sticks made a big difference as we climbed higher and higher to the top.  The views from the top to the bay would be spectacular on a clear day, but we arrived in the middle of a rain storm.  Still the place has a grandeur and mystery that is haunting.  We took many photographs of the structures including the roofs and intricate detailing.  Several beautiful cherry trees in bloom on the site in early April.  See this site for a peaceful break from modern Japan."
"Visited in the pouring rain and still very nice shots. The temples have many very beatiful details and bronze work and painted wood. Traditional temple architecture and bronze and stone lantern posts. Visiting the temple requires many steep steps on stone stairs, you must have no physical handicaps. I think the shrine would be most beautiful at early sunset and after new snow, but even in the rain it was exceptional. I prefered it over the major shrines in Tokyo."
"Nestled in a rather remote peaceful hillside location there is no road access to Kunozan Toshogu Shrine. There are two ways to reach the shrine ascending 1159 stone steps from the bottom of the Kunozan Mt, or by descending on the  Nihondaira ropeway.  This is one of Japan's 100 most scenic spots where on a clear day you will have glorious views  of  Mt.Fuji, and the Suruga Bay below.  Over 400 years old it is a fine examples of ornate Shinto architecture and brilliant colours shrines temples that we saw in Japan.  The detailed decorations, rooflines,  bronze and stone lantern posts, and pillars are all impressive.  It was designated as a National Cultural Treasure in 2010. There are uneven, steep stone steps, often wet, in order to reach the Shrine complex."
"Visited the Shinto shrine with a tour group. It is the burial place of the first shōgun of the Tokugawa shogunate, Tokugawa Ieyasu and features many beautiful structures and art. The buildings are colorful and have elaborate wood carvings. They are protected as important cultural properties. The downside is that the place may not be so elderly friendly as there are many stone steps (200+ steps) leading to the buildings. Otherwise, it’s worth the visit!"
"Built in 1617, the main shrine showcases lacquers and gold foils.  Similarly the other buildings are likewise painted every 50 years to preserve them.  Many steps take you past about 13 buildings in all and the final set leads to the grave of Ieyasu Tokugawa.  Fabulous vistas of SUruga Bay can be scene from this location"
"Go to there by ropeway 600 yen/way, 1100 yen/roundtrip. There is an historical shrine there but there is an admission fee so I didn't get into and unfortunately I went there in cloudy day so no much scenery to seeFurthermore, you can go down by foot around 11xx steps and can get the bus back to Shizuoka station there and around the bus stop there are a lot of strawberry shop and strawberry farm. Some farms you can go and for strawberry picking"
"This is the most famous shrine in Shizuoka which attracts many visitors not only from Japan but from all over the world.    Unlike Toshogu in NIKKO, this one has calm and tranquilized atmosphere. Established in 1613, just two years after the first Shogun IEYASU passed away, the buildings were very strong and in elegant mood.  On April 17, which is the day when he died, all the TOKUGAWA families get together from all over Japan and have an annual ceremony in honor of him.      On top of KUNO mountain, his mausoleum stands solemnly viewing west, just like looking at his birth place (OKAZAKI).     There is a museum in front of the entrance of the shrine, where swords or armors he actually used and a golden clock presented by the Spanish King are exhibited. For those who are interested in Japanese history, it is the best place!"
"This is the real original burial place of Tokugawa Ieyasu the great shogun who determined Japan’s history for 350+ years, the Edo period. Everything we consider typically Japanese today originates from this era. The place itself is a jewel. Ieyasu’s grandchild considered this place to small and constructed Nikko, now overrun by tourist. Nikko is an inflated Kunozan without the atmosphere you can find here. Climbing the walkways inside the shrine complex one feels that this was the place were a big ruler got his peace to think over his realm.The place is undergoing major renovation now, but this is done in a clever manner so only small parts are inaccessible at a given time. Don’t miss it if you have a half day in the region."
"the original burial place of the first shōgun of the Tokugawa shogunate, and is thus the oldest of the Tōshō-gū shrines in the country. The main festival of the shrine is held annually on April 17Since up there at the cable cart station is hard to find taxi back to the port,  I hired a taxi for 3 hours and was enough drove us from and back to port. The shrine is nice,  though many steps to be climbed. Go early to avoid queue. Must be very clear day to see mountain Fuji. C U Around"
"I'm a history buff of the Sengoku period and so naturally I was excited to visit Ieyasu's shrine, but I definitely had grander expectations. The shrine itself is lovely and you can enjoy the architecture of the walls and buildings - though it should be stressed you're barred from entering any of them within the actual compound. Quickly you realize this trip is more a 30 minute detour that doesn't justify a trip in of itself, yet can adequately complement a larger more expansive trip. Some advice to travelers: you may also have checked and read about the nihondaira rope way and may plan to drop that into you trip to this shrine. Don't waste the money. The ropeway is a 5 minute descent to the shrine over a view of nothing but trees. It's like getting a closeup of broccoli. Also, suggest skipping the Tokugawa museum there - unless you're really keen to see Ieyasu's scissors and his bookshelf."
