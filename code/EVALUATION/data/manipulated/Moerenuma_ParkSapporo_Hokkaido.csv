"Visited with familyPros:1) This park can be reached via train and bus. Ensure to read and understand the directions carefully because it can be confusing.2) Best to visit with a full stomach and bring some drinks and snacks. My family and I visited right before lunch, luckily there was a small cafe inside the park which was quite a walk from the main entrance.3) There is a bike rental a few meters from the entrance. Suggest to rent one. The park is huge and easier to cycle than walk.4) There were many attractions to visit but my favorite is the pyramid-shaped museum and cycling around the park.5) Allot 1 whole day or at least half day to visit. It closes around 5pm so best to start early.6) It is definitely child-friendly.7) Best toilet to use is at the pyramid-shaped museum.8) Wear something comfortable since this is an outdoor place.The only con I can think of is the insects that appeared around 5pm on the way to the bus station. It was similar to the insects we experienced at the Shiroi Koibito Park.A must-visit."
"This is a very nice park to spend a leisurely morning/afternoon, and maybe outdoor picnic.  Recommend to drive as it's not accessible by train or subway."
Rent a bicycle near entrance of park. 200 yen for 2 hours. It is better to see the park vs walking. Climb the 222 steps up Mt Moere to catch the breeze at the top & a panoramic view of the park. Interesting feature on the architect of the park Izamu Noguchi.
Impressive park. Nothing else like it. Go there. The sculpture is incredible. Take lunch with as cafe is limited if you don't want a sit down meal.
If you have kids you must go here! hire a sled or skis from the glass house and spend hours running up and down the hill!
"Moerenuma Park is an incredible mixed use public park that is suitable for all ages and interests.  Mixing sculpture, architecture, public art, and diverse sensory experiences, it is a place that demands repeat visits in various seasons to enjoy the changing scenery.  From the artificial beach to the children's playgrounds, to Play Mountain and the Glass Pyramid, each region is unique yet seemingly integrated as a whole under Noguchi's artistic vision.  The location is a bit off the main Sapporo downtown requiring subway and then a 30 minute bus ride, but well worth the visit."
"Free to enter.  We rented bikes at very reasonable rate (200 yen for 2 hours) at the entrance and helped to move around, which saved our energy for walking up to various higher grounds for most charming views around.  We enjoyed the 15 minutes fountain show.  Check the schedule at the bike store."
It's very easy to navigate this park.  The theme of this park evolve around pyramids. There is glass pyramid here and other pyramid hills.  You can go in the glass pyramid but it's close on the first Monday of every month for maintenance.  Bicycle rental can be found at the first parking lot right as you enter the park and it cost 200 yen for 2 hours per bicycle. 300yen for special bicycle that has a toddler seat in the back.  Takes around 30 minutes to make a full loop around the park at a brisk pace.  The loop trail is shaded in some area and on certain part of the park you'll be riding along a river that has a lot of ducks near a bridge.  Great park if you want to enjoy some family fun.  I went on a weekday afternoon and only a few people there.
"Renting a bike was only 200 yen per person and I think made the scroll through the park much easier and enjoyable. The bikes had a self lock in each one, so it was very easy to leave the bike whenever we wanted to walk around. Great park!"
"A fantastic place to relax and enjoy the time. The park is pretty big. can enjoy the surrounding view around the areas and good for outdoor party and activities. The place is bet far from Sapporo downtown and public transportation is also not frequently available. However, worth visiting it. If you are lazy to walk, you can hire a bicycle and it is 200 yen per 2 hours time. The renting place is near to the park entrance. Best would be spring and summer I guess. Was there in the spring and saw many people enjoy the time and relaxing...."
"Getting to the park from downtown took almost an hour. Read couple of reviews on TA describing the various modes of transport to/from the park. What I came to realise is that Bus 6 plies only on weekends and weekdays from 19 July to 17 Aug...so it wasn't an option for us. We took the conventional route describe in the park's brochure...on the Tono Line, drop off at “Kanjo dori higashi” station. Head for the exit that says ""Bus Terminal"". Upon exit up the stairs, turn right and about 30-40m from there on the right is the bus terminal. Take Chuo Bus 69/79 to the Park's East entrance. Entrance on the bus on from the back down and grab a ticket. Exit from the front and pay there. If in doubt, check with the bus driver, they are really professional and helpful. We rented our bicycles at the entrance-this is a great option to cover the entire place. They have all types of bikes of people of all ages. They also come with locks so that you can make a stop, climb the hills, enjoy the various attractions without worry that your bike will be rode away. We spent about 2-3 hours at the park...a little short and longer would have been better. However, with bicycles, we managed to make our way throughout the park from a clockwise route. Tennis Centre to the breath-taking views from Mt. Moere; Tetra Mound; Play Mountain; Beach; Playground, Fountain and the Glass Pyramid. When in Sapporo next, we will certainly make our way back to this magnificent park."
"Getting to this park is easy, u can either choose to take subway  Toho Line “Kanjo dori higashi” Chuo Bus [higashi 69] to “Ainosato kyoikudai eki” or Chuo Bus [higashi 79] to “Nakanuma Shogakko dori” get off at “Moerenuma koen higashiguchi (east entrance)”, follow the exit 2 sign to go to Bus terminal then turn left and u can see the bus waiting area. For return bus nearby the park waiting area, there are only 3 bus routes which Chuo Bus (Higashi 6 to Bus Centre Mae), Higashi 68 to Sapporo Factory and it stop by Kanjo dori Higashi subway station or Higashi 28 to Asabu. This place is really awesome if you love to enjoy nature."
"Was very excited to explore the park as it has such amazing reviews and is so well-designed. Because it was winter, was not expecting the bicycle renting experience, but was at least hoping to see a beautiful winter landscape. However, we went on a MONDAY, which is when the park is closed, including the bicycle rental service and glass pyramid centre, which was already a big disappointment in itself. The bigger disappointment is that the park is not maintained in winter so the entire landscape was covered in at least 40cm of snow. Travelling 100m into the park already felt like a chore that wasn't worth the effort. DO NOT go in winter and if you do, plan very very well. Best to ask locals or service staff for suggestions if possible. The park was not designed for winter, which is a poor testament to the designer."
"We enjoyed this park immensely!  It is so huge you will need at least 3-4 hours to walk it!  This park was designed byIsamu Noguchi.  We have  enjoyed his artwork in Kansas City & Washignton, DC. but this park surpasses everything  we have seen before......His designs at this park are HUGE !  We were blown away by the massive artwork !Beautiful & beyond words!  A must see if you are in Sapporo, Japan.  Suggest you rent a bike at the park....Park is on the outskirts of Sapporo City."
Visited the park after reading reviews on the site & I wasn't disappointed. Took bus 68 (for some reason tourist map doesn't mention this) from subway for about 35 minutes & it was a fairly easy journey. I hired a bike for 200 yen for 2 hours. Great value. Beach was shut on Thursdays but that didn't detract from my visit. All areas were good but the fountain & glass pyramid were great. Highly recommend!
"Wonderful, unique park dedicated to a talented artist. Went with my wife, sister, and mother who all enjoyed the experience for the landscape design and overall visit. We’ve been to the Noguchi studio museum in Long Island City, NY and love his aesthetic and work. This is even more and different given the dimension of space. But even for those unfamiliar with him, the park can be enjoyed for the natural surroundings, views from high places (hilltops and the top of the glass pyramid), and the Sea Fountain. For the Sea Fountain, don’t expect a Bellagio water show. It’s an hour display where the water changes but in intended ways that require you to “see”. His work wants you to appreciate nature and examine the beauty often unseen or taken for granted. We spent a couple of hours there and could easily have spent more time. Walking is required to cover to grounds but it’s more about enjoying and taking in what you see. Highly recommended for anyone wanting to spend a pleasant worthwhile afternoon. No fees or charges."
"A lovely modern  park designed by a famous half British, half Japanese designer. Has huge outdoor spaces with soft lawn that kids seem to love to roll on, plus a wading pool for kids to jump around in, while the parents sprawl out on the surrounding grass watching over them. There is so much space, kids can play football and run around happily without having to disturb other people. It's completely man made, but beautifully done, with plenty of green all around. It's about a 30 min drive from the JR station in a taxi which adds up to about JPY3600 per way.  They have a souvenir shop, a tiny museum including some info about the designer and a restaurant that one needs to book a table at, at least one day in advance (both lunch and dinner are served there). Otherwise there is also a small fast food place selling soft cream cones and other snack items (need to buy a ticket from a vending machine and then bring the ticket to the counter to retrieve your items). The wonderful thing is that you can rent bicycles there, including ones with baskets in front (between the handle bars) for infants or other bikes with toddler seats.  It costs JPY300 for 2 hours.Many families brought little tents with them (can be bought in toys r us) or blankets and had picnics on the lawn, while keeping cool.It's a lovely place to get away from the city for the day."
"To go there, just follow the instructions on their website . The bus stop returning to the subway is across the street from where you get off. Do check the timetable before you enter the park, as you may spend hours in there. You can rent a bike, though we walk. If you hate the sun, don't come here. There is almost no shelter except when you are in the main building, the pyramid. If you don't like to walk, don't come here. In particular, climbing the 2 hills are lot of fun. You can buy simple food from the small cafeteria. But why don't you bring along some food and picnic on their seas of grass? We lunched at their French restaurant. 3 choices of set menu, the cheapest around US$90 each. Excellent french food, a 1/2 star Michelen standard. No reservation needed as we were there on a weekday. Otherwise, do reserve a table. It's worth the money."
"Such a chill place, with beautiful scenic views. Had lots of fun cycling around!! The tranquility I’ve experienced is one that I can never forget."
"Took some effort to climb the hill, the scene on the hill is definitely worth for a climb. A good place for the nature lover, family, and for those who love to walk in nature. Enjoy the fountain breeze in this city park."
"I thought the design/architecture sounded interesting enough to warrant the roughly one hour of subway and bus travel to warrant going, but we ended up staying longer and had a great time. This is the opposite of an electronic arcade; you make your own fun. The hills, glass pyramid and fountains are a feast for the eyes and as KanoSouthCarolina says, the people watching is fun. You can stretch your legs on a rental bike $2 for 2 hours (free park admission) and it's fun to make a circuit or two on the 4 km perimeter bike path. Don't miss the sea fountain... I don't want to post a spoiler but I've never seen a fountain do what it does. It starts at 15 after the hour during summer months and lasts 40 minutes. Stay past the big initial geyser. Food choices were really limited; bring snacks. The whole park is sculpture and very cool.The Tohu subway line from Sapporo station has English signs and it's just 3 stops out. The bus pulls up right outside and -again - it has a sign in English as well as an English announcement. You won't get lost."
"One of the nicest park I've been to! Don't expect flowers like furano though, everything is mostly a wide expanse of green. You can rent a bike and cycle there, but they are quite strict on closing time (last rental before 4? I think). Have a picnic there, climb to the top of the hill etc. I think it's definitely worth a go. Everything there is so aesthetically pleasing to the eye."
"A very unique park. Modern, broad and fantastic. Relieving and eye-opening, literally. Will definitely visit again."
"Take your own food if you go; we arrived at 1.15 and the only restaurant was full. The only other food place was the coffee shop which had sold everything except some paper bags of cold soggy fries. So nothing to eat and no lunch. The park is a re claimed waste disposal site. It's bleak, windy and unattractive. If you're a tourist in Sapporo, a much better option is the Mount Moiwa Ropeway."
"I went during spring/summer. It was raining, however, I enjoyed the whole thing there. Being person who a little artsy, this is a worth place to visit. Perhaps, it could be less crowded all time, this is a little unusual as compared to the Open Museum at Hakone. The landscape is basically structured to deliver different screenshot in all 4 seasons. You snow most of the time and greens in Sapporo. But this one, entirely about the mood that you going to perceive depends on the current weather. I felt like I am in a different zone. I couldn't rremember how i get there, my review may not be helpful, but perhaps I give you a little idea that this place is worth a visit, if you are someone, who appreciate the effort that put in a work as a designer/ artist."
"Went during the snow . We had to travel a long distance from the hotel, When we enetered there was no clear directions in the Zoo. No helpers and no one inside showing the directions etc."
"This designed park is a bit of a way out of the city centre but it is well worth the visit.I went in July 2017 in the early evening and witnessed the sunset on the large mounds.There are a few landscaped hills, skate areas, sports courts, a baseball ground, tree planting areas, sculptures, a fountain and a glass pavilion. Walking or cycling is a nice way to spend the evening, and the views from the top of the hills are amazing with the city and mountains in the backdrop. The illuminated water fountain show was good - I would recommend the 15min one not the 45 min one (which is too long and there is not enough variation).A must see attraction while in Sapporo!"
I went to the park in a Saturday and even it was in weekend it wasn't very crowded. If you rent a bike it will be easier to travel inside of the park. The price of one hour rent is 100 yen. You can also take your tent and have a little camp for the day. There is also a little lake in this park that you can take off your shoes and get inside but it is very shallow that the level of water doesn't pass your knee. Don't forget to climb to the mountain and see the beautiful view of Sapporo city. And also there is a very big fountain which makes a show every hour. You should also see the glass pyramid. It was a very interesting building. Finally if you love to play tennis you can rent some tennis rackets and balls and spend your time by playing tennis.
Went there on Monday and so would like to remind you all that rental of snow sport equipment is close on that day. Luckily someone left their plastic sled therefore my kids able to slide down the snow sliding track. We went there by bus from a subway station. Cannot remember the station name just Google for Moerenuma Park how to get there from Sapporo. Entrance is free and you need to walk like 10-15 minutes from the bus stop to get to the playground
Having visited this park many years ago (even before it officially opened) I was delighted to return. A great place to bike/run/walk. Rolling hills that you can take at your own pace.
"Spent some time just shooting pictures and wandering around with family. Always reminds me of how spacious and free Hokkaido is compared to other parts of the country. A beautiful fountain show on summer evenings, and some neat art galleries too. Plenty of parking and it works well for a picnic too."
"Looking at pictures beforehand, it looks like just a nice park, maybe worth an hour on a lazy afternoon. But in person it's just beautiful. The scale is hard to grasp through pictures alone, and I wish we'd spent a little more time there. It definitely makes sense that they rent bicycles. The park is very family-friendly, with lots of artsy playgrounds scattered around the park. There are lots of open grounds where people play sports and eat lunch. The cherry blossoms were great, too, and not nearly as busy as other parks.Make sure you wear some comfy shoes!"
"It was a heavy snow storm when we were there. Our visit is to take picture , unfortunately it was very heavy snow rain , we waited for 2 hours inside the pyramide building , it was warm and very nice building .After waiting and took some picture around the building we decided to get back to station by taxi. Thanks for the staff who helped us to make a call for taxi , otherwise we had to walk under snow storm to get out the park at least 30 minutes and no idea how long had to wait for taxi or bus passed by .This is a remote area , we had to pass some warehouse or maybe industrial area . Anyway we are glad with the experience eventhough could not take a lot pic . Need to return if we are in Sapporo next time"
"This is a sculpture park designed by the  American born artist of world renown; Isamu Noguchi. there are kids play areas, and fountain shows long and short (30 min and 15 min), there are also 30 tennis courts and a sports field.  Built upon a landfill dump in a swamp, this is now a beautiful location for a few hours relaxation, and art appreciation. I highly recommend it. man made hills are fun for skiing/sliding in the winter."
"The Moerenuma Park is located  north east of Sapporo not so convenient to reach. From the Sapporo station you can take the bus number 59 to the last station. From there it si a 10minutes walk.The Park offers a great combination of sculptures, which are actually more buildings than sculptures, and possibilities for picknick and playground for children. Founded and designed by Isamu Noguchi on the ground of a former waste treatment plant in 1988, there are about 10 major structures, which are perfectly designed in harmony with the landscape: mountains, rivers, fountains and the landmark glass pyramid. There are many lawns and water places which are ideal to sit on or play in on hot summer days for the whole family.From the play mountain and the amphitheatre you will have a very nice view of the distant Sapporo skyline. To go around you might rent a bike for 300Y per person which is a very convenient way of seeing all exhibits.Despite the fact that it takes some time to reach this place, I recommend this as a very nice and inspiring trip."
