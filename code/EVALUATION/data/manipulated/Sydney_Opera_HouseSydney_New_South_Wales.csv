"The iconic Sydney Opera House is amazing in it’s unique design, and graceful setting! A must see inside and out.  I saw the opera Carmen to experience the fabulous acoustics! Think the inside is as majestic as the outside of the building.  Good eats and drinks at the Opera bar below!  As a side note, thanks to the manger Roberto for helping me out with a phone emergency I had!  So kind and accommodating!  And do see the Opera House iby day and night!"
Amazing icon and this is the best location for Sydney harbour views. The bar at the opera is great with happy hour. Food is average and pricey. Avoid Fridays as locals head down there for friday drinks.
Our tour of the opera house focused on the architecture and history of this iconic building. It was so fun and informative! Loved it!
"‘Ello chaps!Few buildings in the world are as famous as the Sydney Opera House. Located on the southern point of the Sydney Harbour, it is impossible to miss. Taking a stroll through the large royal gardens or come from the dock side, there is much to see around the Opera House itself. Many people like to climb the steps and take a quick peek inside. NOTE: You can only really get to the heart of the inside of the opera house by taking a ticketed tour or seeing a ticketed show. Beyond that it’s still possible to go inside and get a taste of what the interior architecture is like. There’s also a fancy restaurant on site giving you stunning views of the downtown city and of the harbour. The building was formally opened October 20, 1973 by her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip. There are multiple performance venues inside, which combined provide space for more than 1,500 performances annually, attended by 1.2 million people per year. It is a build that truly impresses in person and in photos. Overall I give Sydney Opera House five stars out of five."
"Even though we live in Sydney we wanted to share our view on one of the world’s most iconic sites - The Sydney Opera House. Set against the backdrop of one of the world’s most iconic harbours, the Opera House is a must visit for anybody coming to Sydney. The Opera House car park located underground is surprisingly well priced for it’s location and has easy  access to the Opera House. After pictures and a walk around the Opera House one can walk through the botanical gardens (next to it), see NSW government house and make their way around to Woolloomooloo whatf where some of the cities best restaurants are located on the harbour."
The Sydney Opera house is at the Harbour. Book a Tour to learn about the history & architecture. Many theatres & shows - a visit is highly recommended
I wanted to take in the magnificence of The Sydney Opera House’s architecture.It is iconic. I climbed the stairs & I walked around & marvelled at the beauty of this building against the surrounding deep blue waters of Sydney Harbour. Bring your family. Bring your friends. This visit shall stay with you always. Bring a hat on a hot Summer’s day. Bring your bottled water. So many great places to eat. You may even bring your own lunch & enjoy on the stairs. Spectacular views.
This was a wonderful tour as we had access to many parts of the opera house you would not normally see. Given a history of the building  etc  in an unhurried fashion. Lots of steps to climb so you need a reasonable level of fitness
Seeing the stunning Sydney Opera House from the outside is impressive but it is not enough. The walking tour is well worth the cost. Our guide was knowledgeable of all details of the amazing building. The tour is done with audio headphones  so  you don’t miss anything. A true highlight of any visit to this beautiful city.
Nice one hour tour throughout the opera house giving you an overview and history of the building. Visited both concert and opera halls. Worth visiting.
"Ideal location, unique design, well worth visiting when in Sydney. Relaxing walk from Circular Quay with plenty of cafes and bars to drop into on way there or back."
Loved visiting sydney opera house. Beautifully designed building and good bar/ restaurant overlooking the harbour. Would love to visit again some day.
"The most iconic building in Sydney is a feast for the eyes with an interesting history.  It juts out into the harbor and at times it appears larger than I expected and then surprisingly smaller than I expected, depending upon the angle.  The late modern expessionist design is one you don't see every day.  It covers 4.4 acres of land and is 600' long and 394' wide with over one million shell-like tiles.  Architect Jorn Utzon designed the masterpiece that was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1973.  There are tours as well as various performances throughout the year.  Book ahead if possible since it has over 8 million visitors each year."
"We spent a good amount of time walking inside and mostly outside the opera house.  Having seen this iconic structure so many times in photos, it still took my breath away in person.  At every turn, the spectacular architecture presented itself for photo opportunities. We didn't do the tour as the times did not fit our schedule. There are also restaurants/bars along the harborside to relax and take in the  beautiful skyline."
"The Sydney Opera House and Harbor Bridge alone are fantastic to visit, but there's so much more to Sydney. However don't miss the tour of the Opera House to get a real view of this fantastic structure. And if you're daring and have plenty of money to spare, try the Harbor Bridge climb to the top for an incredible view of the area. The very walkable downtown area is lovely. Other terrific places to visit include The Queen Victoria Building which is a lovely mall inside this historic building. For more shopping there are other places too like the Westfield Mall. The Darling Harbor area is another not to miss. Several tourist attractions are located around the scenic harbor. Hyde park offers some tranquil spaces right in the city. Besides different churches, don't miss St. Mary's Cathedral, it's worth a visit. Sydney offers a lovely mix of classic buildings and totally modern ones. They recently installed electric modern trams throughout the downtown. Did I mention how friendly the residents are?"
"Go before sunset to experience the full majesty of the building and surrounds- for the active walk through the botanical gardens, or from the quay! see a show but if you are a tourist remember to be quiet during performances!"
"The Opera House exceeded all my expectations. I highly recommend taking a tour and seeing a show. It is so spectacular inside and the shows, regardless of what you go to is top notch. Be sure to get a view from the harbour on a ferry and from the bridge!"
Truly iconic in the Sydney harbour. Seen the opera house countless times but i'm still amazed by it everytime. There's always a crowd around here. The pub nearby has great vibes so do check that out.
"Having seen the Opera House many times from the outside, it was great to get behind the scenes.Our guide was very knowledgeable and much was learnt. The only disappointment was that the Concert Hall was being refurbished."
Do I need to explain why this is a must!?An excellent venue. Walk around it and take pictures from all angles. OR...cross the bridge and check it out from North Sydney. AWESOME view!
Nice way to see the inside and hear about the Sydney Opera house construction.  Was expecting a little more to the tour but glad we did it since we did not have time to see an actual performance.
"We were unable to enter the Opera House, but walked around it caught ferries to see all sides of it, and looked at it from the window of our hotel in Circular Quay. Originally the cost of building the Opera House infuriated the people of NSW, but now everyone recognises the genius of the Danish architect. Mind you, I've read that the main theatre inside is not really suited for performances of opera! The stage is too small and the wings and fly space above the stage lack space. As a consequence,Opera  Australia has to make sets fit the Sydney venue but they are too small for Melbourne's State Theatre. That's what trying to cut costs does!"
"An outstanding and world-renown piece of architecture. Viewed it from our ship s it entered the harbor and on land. Impressive +, everything we expected and more. Possibly it was a government job 'cause it came in at triple the original cost, but then Sydney has it and no one else does. So there."
Only walked around and took in the architecture and view of this place. Has a great view of the harbour. Good photographic setting. Lots of steps to the entrance. Not everyone in our group wanted to go inside for the tour. But was pricey. very hard looking as not much foliage to soften the exterior walking area. Didn't realise how large it was until walking around the whole building!
So much to do and see in Sydney. Walking cross the bridge is it gay great way to see the opera house and Sydney itself plus you could either bungee jump off the bridge or walk to the top on a tour. Plenty of places to eat around the harbor and a few blocks in.
Visited the opera House for a tour. Interesting and highly recommended. It’s huge and I can see how they run everything.
"When you stand anywhere outside, the Sydney Opera House is indeed spectacular.  We took the tour - a little slow, a little bland, but still worthwhile.  Seeing the actual performance halls is nice.  Getting up close to the amazing structure is wonderful.  No fireworks, a little pricey, but we believe it was time and money well spent"
"We had the best tour ever of the Sydney Opera House. Our guide was so enthusiastic and told us many interesting facts about the Opera House. We were able to go into 3 theatres.  He told us about the history of the Opera House's conception, architecture problems, changes with time, construction, and stories about the architect and his family.  We loved the Opera House. Afterward, we tried to get tickets while we were in Sydney, but the show we wanted to see was sold out .   Do this while in Sydney!"
We booked ticket for the opera on our arrival day in Sydney. What a disappointment to see that it was in a second hall. we had a nice time and it is very impressive to see it live. Arrive early for a drink at the lobby bar surrounding the bay.
Great views of Sydney and waterfront.  Water taxis go back and forth.  Heard that the Opera House may close for renevations.  We didn't take a tour because there were activities all day.
"Had a wonderful tour of the Sydney Opera House yesterday, it’s worth considering a very early tour as they tend to be smaller, and less crowded.    The tour was very informative, and we were able to see all of the smaller venues within the opera house.  Don’t be afraid to ask difficult challenging questions; your guide will know the answers and will enjoy being challenged.  Well worth a visit for a few hours."
"Experienced Carmen. Blown away by the human factor of the opera house. Perfection. Not saying more, spend your money on the best seats you can."
Don't miss this at all! It is not only beautiful to look at from afar but internally the architecture is just stupendous! Take a tour ! It is worth!
"Took the hour long tour to get a better insight to the history of its construction, and to view areas that otherwise may be difficult to see from a concert attendance, or casual visit. The tour was informative and provably worth the reasonably expensive ticket pricing. However, it would have been nice to get behind the curtains into the real backstage areas ( as other opera houses overseas do)The walk around the forecourt is a must do and doesn't cost anything"
I never knew that I would learn so much about this amazing piece of architecture until I took the wonderful one hour tour of the Sydney opera House. The history is fascinating the story of the architecture in all the pieces of material also very interesting. Being able to sit in the concert hall before it closes for the next two years was a great opportunity. I certainly now have a new appreciation of this unique amazing structure.
