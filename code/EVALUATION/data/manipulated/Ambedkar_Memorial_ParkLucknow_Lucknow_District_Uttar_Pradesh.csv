"must see it, if you are in lukhnow, greate Art of workmanship. go in Evening or early morning only.."
Spend the day at Ambedkar park as it was cloudy and windy. The support of the weather and beauty of the architecture made the place amazing
Useless place. Wastage of time and money. Made only of marble. No greenery inside. In summers u will be fried inside and in winters u will be shivering. No concept nothing. Just a monument of dr. b. R. Ambedkar ji. The place holds no historical value. U will repent after going there. So dont waste ur tym in going there.
New concept park. Well organized and maintained one. Only problem is the political inclination. Rest is OK.  One must see particularly in the evening if you are in Lucknow.
"Good Place, Nicely maintained. But during summer it should be looked. Need to have alternative on the same. An awareness programme has to be spread in terms of afforestation and utilisation of plastic products."
visited there in the month of mar 16 and was disappointed to see that the park is just show of strength of some particular political party or group. Though the work is outstanding and exceptional and it must have taken lot of financial resources from the exchequer.
It is one of the best place for spending time. Looking wise good. Suno na sangmarmar song is shooted here.  many other movies also shooted here
I visited here with my family . Loved this place will like to visit here again. Don't visit during summers as monuments here are made of marble or stones . Enjoyed a lot here .
"When we visited this on a Sunday evening, there were only about 20 visitors including us. Did not appear to be very popular with the locals. The arrangements and the ambience is good, still it gives a sort of bitter taste about the abuse of Power and waste of Public funds in India. There are many life size elephant statues lined up inside."
"Visited during the evening, and was impressed by the large structures and lighting around the memorial.  Everything is grandiose.  The main statue in the interior is modeled on the Lincoln Memorial."
"wish the architects of this great place had thought of planting some traditional trees to enhance the beauty of marble.red sandstone and concrete.the statues ,the myriad elephants ,the tombs,gates all have their own charm but look stony without a green cover.these were built by Mayavati,erstwhile CM. THE HUGE SPACES ARE GOOD AND IN THE EVENING THE GENTLE BREEZE FROM THE GOMTI RIVER ON A GOOD WEATHER DAY ADDS TO THE CHARM."
"Remembering Dr Ambedkar is a must for all those who believe in human equality and I visited this memorial after sunset, while going to the airport.  I wish if I could have had more time to spend here."
"It one of the best place to visit in Lucknow. It is quite large park or memorial you can say. It would be good to visit in evening as it is full of marble so going in afternoon doesn't make any sense. We visited this park quite long ago, and best part ........it was raining. It was an awesome experience. Remember famous SUNO NA SANGE MARMAR song from movie Youngistan...that was shot here itself."
"This park has everything magnificent. Starting from gates and waiting area to the main attractions : parks,statues and elephants.This place has a central piller encrypted on which is the history of this place and significance of the place.This is no doubt a good picnic place as it has many big size parks."
Does not go with the general ambience and style of the city. This city is fast losing its charismatic beauty. The overhead metro will be the death knell.
Superb layout with ample of parking space. The place is full with morning and evening walkers. Evening a good place for Youngsters.
Looks like granite and concrete maidan. There should be more trees and the pathway should have been lawn
A big marble construct and not a park at all. Lots of fountains that clearly don't work. Do not go out of your way to visit. Very disappointing.
"Heard that lots of natural land, trees were cut down to bring up this Park made up of concrete, stones and statues. It is so massive that you wont be able to see anything further with your naked eyes. Lots of red-stone have been used in this park.. you will find towering statues of Elephants almost everywhere and 2 big statues of political leaders of the state. Lacks green lawn and trees. Needs proper care and maintenance. Often frequented by love-birds to get some personal space."
"Good place but needs regular maintenance. Ok for few hrs to roam around, sit or relax.  Crowded on weekends."
Having driven past this site to see another. I just had to come back and see it. Truly a work of art in what has been built here. Every part of the park is something completely different but works in harmony with all the other's. Not to be left out of the sites to visit in Lucknow.
I went for a walk with my friend and saw that there is so many amazing building which can't define. enjoying alot my friend also talking about this
Big structures and big domes occupied in large area of land. Located in center of the city. Fully made up of Marbles including floors. Not advisable to go in between 11 am to 6pm because of sunlight absorbed and emission by marbles. Must see. Hardly take 1-2 hours time.
this place is just next to Vivanta by taj gomti nagar lucknow ..its a great place to visit ... you enjoy some great welcome by the stone structure of lots of elephants on either side. followed by two dome like structures in which you get to know about some great leaders who rule the country by their majesty thorough which today you are able to live the Independent life ... each and everything is made of imported marble so dare not to visit it in summers as it really get too hot out there .
"This place is a great hanging out place for picnics in Lucknow... Located prominently, this is a big place and requires an entire day to have a complete experience of the place... Build recently, this place projects a glimpse of modern architecture..."
All you can see is the plain land with marbles and elephant statues around. Seems like you are walking and walking but you could barely something different. High points goes to the cleanliness and maintenance of the park.
"We were told a bit about this park before arrival, but nothing can prepare you for the immense size of the place! Walking between the rows of gigantic elephants was an experience in itself.The few trees in the park were trimmed uniquely, but more greenery and water would make the place very lovely."
"Created by Mayawati when she was the CM , this definitely is not to be missed for its grand scale & opulence . It's built over a very very large area & one needs at least two hours to go around if one wants to see it properly. A photographer's delight , one must carry a good camera or mobile to capture the moments."
Be prepared to be struck by the sheer size and expanse of this magnificent modern structure. A must visit if you happen to be in Lucknow.
"Huge stone structure with countless stone elephants. Looks good but why not have a public park instead with trees and green grass?also, it doesn't open till 11 AM...how will someone visit a stone structure in broad daylight in Lucknow where its extreme summer for 10 months in a year?"
Huge Park of about hundred acres... With lot of walkways and seating areas.... Located on the Gomti riverfront .... Because of time constraint I had to visit in the day time ... After 6 p.m to 9 P.M is the best time ... With all the lights on....
Visited this place few days back with family. It's one of the most beautiful place in entire Uttar Pradesh. A must visit.
"This park is one of several parks which have sprung up in Lucknow over the years. Dedicated to the memory of the architect of the Indian Constitution, Dr B R Ambedkar, it is a nicely landscaped walk, full of symbolism of a political party which governs the state every so often. I love the stone decor, the stone elephants and the unusual, quirky design. It;s a must see for both visitors and residents of Lucknow. Some may argue that it's a waste of taxpayers' money and they're certainly entitled to their opinion. But it must have provided employment for some in the building stage. And there's something peaceful and nice about the atmosphere here. Well worth a look around, one can spend a nice, tranquil afternoon here - or maybe early evening during the hot season, when the weather is cooler."
"I wish there was some greenery at this 'park'. A vast expanse of granite, floors, statues, pillars, everything. DON'T GO IN SUMMER MONTHS. Definitely not in the afternoon. Evenings maybe. Since it is all stone, it's hot in the summers and cold in the winters. Having said that, it does make a pretty picture when the weather is right."
"Lucknow has a rich cultural heritage with many historic monuments, gardens and famous parks. Everywhere one can see greenery with shady trees and spacious parks. nearly there are one hundred parks such as Gautam Buddha park, Dr.Ram Manohar Lohia Park, Janeshwar Mishra Park, Swarna Jayanti Smriti Vihar Park, Chandrasekhar Azad Park etc.  The Nawabs of Awadh beautified this city with many gardens, palaces and mosques. During my short stay there I had an opportunity of visiting the Ambedkar Memorial Park, a public park and memorial in Gomti Nagar. Ms. Mayavati, the former Chief Minister and leader of B.S.P. established this park with many monuments and pillars to represent the democratic ideals of social reformers and noble persons who worked for the upliftment of Dalit people. The foundation stone for this memorial park was laid in 1995. It was called Dr.Bhimrao Udyan. Construction and development work continued up to 2002 and the park was re-named as Dr.Bhimrao Ambedkar Memorial. In 2007 it was further renovated and developed. On April 14, 2008 the park was opened to the public. Finally in 2012 the park was re-named as Bhimrao Ambedkar Memorial. Red sandstone from Rajasthan was used for this megalithic construction. Nearly seven billion rupees were spent to build this lofty monument which has become the pride and glorious symbol of this city. Unlike other parks, here one does not find much greenery and gigantic trees. So we don’t find any shelter if it suddenly rains. It would be better if the authorities have set up some shelters for visitors to protect themselves from intense heat of summer and rainy showers. You will see a very spacious land of 107 acres with a broad stretch of road flanked by sixty-two stone elephants on either side at the main entrance. This spot is called “Pratibimb Sthal”. Priority is given to statues of elephants as the elephant is the election symbol of Mayavati’s Bahujan Samaj Party and also of  Ambedkar’s Republican Party. Nearly three thousand elephant figures are seen in this grand construction.  In the center of the park there is a massive musical fountain. It stands as a symbol of Dalit empowerment and dignity. On the left side of the park one can see a huge building called Ambedkar Sthupa located on a mound. Inside the Sthupa one can see a big bronze statue of Ambedkar seated in a chair. At the base of the statue a message in Hindi is engraved which means “My struggle of life is my only message.” Many statues are seen depicting the life of Ambedkar. In Ambedkar Samajik Parivartan Sangrahalay spread over 2.5 acres, one can see a monument with two domes. Under one building one can see the statues of eminent social reformers like Jyothi Rao Phule, Shri Narayana Guru, Dr.Ambedkar, Kanshi Ramji and Rajarshi Chatrapati Shahuji Maharaj . In the second building the marble statues of Gautam Buddha, Sant Kabir Das, Sant Ravi Das, Guru Ghasi Das and Sri Birsa Munda are seen. This monument is an objective representation of equality, humanity and social justice. In Drashya Sthal one can see an eighty- foot tall pyramid structure with water flowing from its top. From here one can have a panoramic view of the whole park with its monuments and pillars spread around. In Dr.Ambedkar Samajik Parivartan Gallery spread over four acres one can see many bronze murals. It would better serve the purpose of spreading the ideals and message of Ambedkar and other leaders if a gift shop is set up there where one can buy books, photos and souvenirs that contain the teachings and messages of these noble personalities. This park is open from 11.00 a.m. to 9.00 p.m. on all days except on Monday. This park was under the supervision of the Lucknow Development Authority."
