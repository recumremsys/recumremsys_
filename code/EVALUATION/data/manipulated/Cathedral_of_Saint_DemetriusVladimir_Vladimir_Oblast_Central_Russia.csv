Building is beautiful on the outside. Went inside (150 roebel entry price) but that was a mistake. Not much to see there. Would not recommend going inside.
"Don't bother paying to see the inside, there's not much there. The carved exterior is what you want to see. Each small scene one tells a story in pictorial form."
"Why to see: UNESCO World Heritage monument of the 12th century, probably the most typical and indicative white-stone building of the premongolian period in Russia.  What to see: the facades)) a truly unique composition of King David, Alexander the Great, Prince Vsevolod, Hercules, saints, lions, griffins etc... all in all up to 1500 mastepieces of white-stone carving (though estimates may vary) giving a vivid picture of russian medieval (political? spiritual? cultural?) outlook.     the interior: not as decorative as the facades but still pretty interesting. there is a tiny museum exibition inside with several showcases (archeological artifacts) and information boards that briefly tell the history of the cathedral and its carvings (1 or 2 are in english and quite helpful). Add a piece of 12th century fresqo paintings (considered the work of greek artists) under the choir gallery and an impressive burial of the first Vladimir governer Roman Vorontsov in the south-west corner of the church (left of entrance).     Don't forget to: - give your explanation on the ""crescent"" part of the cross on top of the church- investigate the origins of red brick that surrounds the cathedral on 3 sides- ask yourself about a pelican in the burial monument inside  - close both heavy doors at the entrance as there is a sign in russian that asks to do so))) Mind that the cathedral is used as a museum (no religious services) and the entrance is chargeable. Though it's just 80 rubles for adults. Kids under 16 or even 18 enter for free and students have a discount. Working hours are 11-18 in summer (may-october) and 10-17 in winter (november-april), on monday it closes an hour earlier. Days off are all tuesdays and last wednesdays of every month. Taking photos is allowed and is free of charge. Personal tip: get close to the northern wall (it is almost always in the shade) and just look up at the carvings trying to imagine what used to happen here centuries ago..."
Has description in English and great place to step by on your way to other sightseeing. Amazing stone work dating to 11xx
"Find Vladimir Sobolev easily, is in the central part of the city in a beautiful park, which is located on a hill, and there is a good view of the river. This is a unique, very old and rare for Russian cathedral! Demetrius Cathedral in Vladimir - court temple, built by Vsevolod the Big Nest in the prince's court, and was consecrated in honor of the martyr Demetrius. It was built in 1191-1197 years. Outside gorgeous moldings, inside the church no icons and paintings, it is very unusual for the Orthodox Church. Church services are not held inside - it's a museum, photography is prohibited. If you want to see the bright side of the Russian soul - this is for you!"
"Gorgeous... everything here on this trip was gorgeous. Take pictures and if you want to buy souvenirs, buy it here vs Moscow... it's much cheaper!"
