"It's a must try if you are visiting ooty.. unique experience.. people know most of the things.. so here I am mentioning only the info to keep in mind while you are choosing this.. ENJOYABLE ONLY IF YOU ARE HAVING WINDOW SEAT :) and it will definitely not help you in any means if you are sitting elsewhere.. window seat is a must... and avoid sitting in the first compartment near engine because of the smoke issues throughout the journey.. Trip from coonoor to mettupalayam or vice versa would be better if you are not ready to accommodate 5 hours journey till ooty. Have some snacks handy especially if you have kids.. Mostly try to avoid the journey if travelling with infants.. they get afraid because of sound & tunnels n it would be pretty difficult to handle them there n there wont be network in case of emergency... good if you are travelling alone or as couple preferably to enjoy the long lasting beauty of travelling amidst mountains, valleys n rivers.. little polluted in recent times.. but cant complaint.."
"Very well maintained, good order in serving the guests. Had n Amaizing ride it was a fulfilling experience, a must visit place."
"It's a train you should board and would say the vacation remains incomplete if missed. Runs from ooty to Conoor 1 hr ride and passes through scenic hills, sideby roads and some tunnels as well. Would suggest to board 9.15 am train in morning to reach Conoor to enjoy freshness in morning with amazing valley view"
"A small but nature packed short trip which will not only excite you but give you pleasure of another level. Its a very short travel but very interesting one. Passing through tunnels and scenic beauty all around. Eucalyptus forest, tea gardens, step farming fields, playgrounds, stadium are just aweeome."
"Having tried the Shimla version we looked forwards to this experience.The obvious differentiating factor is the steepness of the track (1:12) which requires a cog-engine and third rail. However,, the fact is that the route is also much less windy which means far fewer turns and viewpoints. Furthermore, the train travels slower on the steep stretches and consequently we found ourselves getting bored after the first hour.We were glad we experienced the journey once but we'd not take this route again."
"It is definitely a 'must' trip to take when you plan to visit this Hill Station Ooty, the experience is awesome and the feeling is nostalgic since you will be going on an old but very reliable and proven steam engine machine (only if you take the Metupalyam - Conoor section). Booking tickets will be a struggle but there are around 40 unreserved seats whixh you can get hold if all reservations are not available /full. To get hold of unreserved ticket(s) max of 4 per head, you should try to reach the counter by 6/6:30 morning on the travel date.  Ticket counter opens at 8am in the morning. Rainy seasons will be a challenged as the age old train will not be able to withstand heavy ones (windows and couple of drops from roof) but hey! that also is an experience which you won't get easily now in this generation...while going down,  right side has more downward sceneries but left side do have some beautiful views of waterfalls falling from literally from the sky down all the way across the train.. and down... Don't worry about rest rooms as you can go to any one of the stations which it will stop on its way.. So enjoy the ride..."
"This is a totally different experience, one must travel on toy train when you visit Ooty. The train, route and tunnel everything thing is full of photo opportunity. The toy train will be loved by kids a lot. The travel is from Ooty to coonoor passing through scenic mountain, Forest and tunnel. The travel time is 1 hour and every min you will enjoy the trip. It is better to have reservations before hand to avoid Last minute rush and traveling in general compartment. First class is bit costly but it is most comfortable than others compartment. Don't forget to carry good camera or good phone to take as many pictures as possible. On Ooty station we can see the museum and souvenir shop to take away some memories with you."
"I had wanted to travel on this railway for years but the actual experience was so disappointing, quite the worst steam train experience I've had anywhere in the world. It could be so good but is badly managed.Reserved seats are five on a bench which can seat only four. The windows are filthy so only those in corner seats can see through the opening windows. Come on management, these are things which can be improved.....which ought to be improved. Paying customers from all over the world deserve better."
"Really enjoyed the journey, purchased 1st class tickets, but only seemed to be authenticated on the day of travel.We were the only passengers in our compartment so were very comfortable. Were given a complimentary bottle of water and some local goodies in a bag. The train travels very slowly so can see the beautiful scenery. Wouldn’t have wanted to miss this trip."
"A must-do in Ooty. You can read other reviews for the charm factor. I’m no expert but here’s the facts:  Ooty - Conoor is the fast trip (1 hour), which gives you all the views without using up the whole day. There are three trains a day on this route. 9.15am, 12.30pm, and the last at 5.30pm. I don’t have times for the return trains from Conoor. Cost only 35 rupees single. Unless you’ve reserved weeks and months before, and if you’re reading this, it’s probably too late for that, you can only buy tickets on the day. I tried to buy the day before - not possible. Ticket office told me to get there early, i.e 7am to queue to buy a ticket when ticket office opens at 8am, for the 9.15 train, he said queues can get long.  You can’t buy a return, so assume you would have to queue again if you want to do the same trip return. I arrived at station at 5.15pm, no queues and took the last train. Loads of seats - bear in mind the sun is setting, and the last 20 minutes or so (in winter) is more or less dark. Sunlight probably best on the morning train for photos. Take seats on the carriage side away from platform in Ooty (for best photos). Got a bus back from Conoor to Ooty - no waiting, 20 rupees... whole round trip 2 hours.  A great excursion for 55 rupees. Train has around 7 - 8 carriages, 64 seats per carriage - 2 of these carriages are for people who’ve bought reserved tickets in advance."
"Visited as part of a tour group. 2nd class tickets gave us a carriage that would fit 8 people but 10 were squashed in......good job we were all slender people !!I was lucky, I had the open window seat, so did get a view of the passing scenery......the windows were dirty, so impossible to take any photos through.Our train was diesel but we did see a steam train puffing along on the track !! As a quaint experience it was fine for the hour and a half we were on it. Be sure to use the toilet before you get on the train....."
"If you didn't travel in this you will loss something . Springs , Forests, Bridges ....wonderful experience. If you are to ooty keep sitting left side. Book 03 months before through IRCTC . Its hard to get seats at nearing days ."
"Amazing views and awesome experience. Watching nature at its best. Do not miss this if you are in ooty. Book tickets in advance through IRCTC website or else you will have to stand in a big queue on the day of your journey & there is very less chances that you will get a ticket specially during peak season. During the train journey, the tunnels, bridges, tea garden, clouds, Nilgiri forest and the view are just mind blowing."
Its a must ride for all visitors I would suggest. Its a 50 minute ride with awesome view. try to grab a window seat and click natures beauty. Book your tickets in advance to avoid last minute rush.
"The question is not whether it is worthwhile taking a trip on the NMR, but whether you'll be able to secure a reservation. We eventually obtained excellent seats, but when we first went online two months prior to departure, we were unable to book a seat.In one sense, the railway is ridiculous; it takes nearly five hours to reach Ooty, just 26 miles (43 kilometres)  from Mettupalayam, while the same trip can be completed via the twisty road in just an hour and a half. If you don't understand the magic of the train, there is probably little I can say to convince you.The next ridiculous thing about it is the timetable; while tourists come from far and wide, and like us, scramble for a ticket, there is only one train a day each way, and it leaves at Mettupalayam at seven in the morning, or as soon thereafter as can be contrived. This means that unless you are a local, you'll need to find somewhere to stay; we put up at the Black Thunder Resort, which was fine, but in no way close enough to walk to the station; you'll probably need a car, and if you have one, then send your driver ahead with the luggage/baggage; the advantage of this is you'll not need to try to attempt to stow your bags on the train, where space is at a premium.The line loses money, and that is probably why there are so few trains — if more were added then it would lose even more, yet as it is (part of) a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it cannot be closed, and recently, new locomotives have been purchased. Given its special status and the large staff available, it is a pity the windows are not cleaned enough for people who have travelled thousands of miles to get there to at least see out. In practice, the Windows were soon opened, and we could see the landscape clearly.For a while, the train trundles along on the flat in a more-or-less straight line, and just as you are beginning to think ""Well isn't this boring?"", after a halt to take on water, the locomotive engages with the rack, and the train begins to climb steeply; at every thrust of the piston, you feel a little push in the back.From now one, the track is seldom straight and never flat. There are frightening views down into deep valleys, with many bridges and viaducts, and several tunnels in which, by some convention, all the children scream.The locomotive is at the back for safety reasons, to prevent unhooked carriages from hurtling downhill, out of control. The train is ""controlled"" by one or more guards sitting on a veranda at the front, who show red or green flags to the engine driver/engineer.The train stops at stations redolent of empire, like Hilgrove, Wellington and Lovedale, to take on water; each time, everyone piles out to photograph the loco, each other, the landscape &c. You will be warned there are no toilets on board the train. While this is true, there are ""facilities"" (of sorts) at each stop.Coonoor is the end of the rack and pinion section; the steam engine is replaced by a soulless diesel, and things are never quite the same again, until the train pulls into Ooty/Udhagamandalam, where passengers are already queuing up for the journey back down the mountain.I have also travelled on the Kalka-Shimla line, which is twice as long, but not nearly so satisfying."
Excellent journey between the nature. Had taken the first class ticket and that ensured hardly any trouble for the seats but overall it looked good. Coaches are perfectly clean and well maintained for their age. Entire journey  being extremely close to historical rock cuts and natural colourful flowers was an experience. The tall trees and the deep valleys are mesmerizing.
"It's a nice can have experience. Takes one hour from ooty to cornoor. The queue is very well maintained by the police. So if you reach a little early, get your ticket and sit in the queue you can be assured to have a nice and enjoyable one hour.Please note that the seats are quite small to accommodate two bulky people. Seats towards are right side have a better view."
Enjoyed the journey on this train. Started from coonor to ooty. Classic train quite comfortable ride with good scenic views.
"Enjoyed the experience of riding from Mettupalayam back to Ooty, but wasted a lot of time in the day queueing BEFORE the ticket office opened one hour before the journey to ensure a place, having missed all the tickets earlier in the day for the opposite direction. Please note for enthusiasts, this is not the steam section of the journey. Being able to buy advanced tickets would have given us more time to enjoy the surrounding area."
"If u have already experienced a mountain railway, this is no exception. Once u chug out of Coonoor, there are some superior views but marred by houses and garbage... We need to look at securing the Nilgiris heritage trail...Too long to reach Ooty if ur in a hurry. Lovedale is a quaint station. Weather will add to the experience. Road travel offers better view of the valleys on a clear day. Take the ride once if u have never been on a toy train."
"Travelled from Ooty to Connor.  Sit on the Lt side of the train seats so that you can see the valley view, which is awesome, we usually won’t travel in that height and in forest, don’t expect to see the animals, don’t worry if won’t get 1 st class or 2 class tickets, which are not needed for 1 hour journey, try to get the tickets 2 hours before departure."
"Unique place for new married couples. Visited with family and enjoy the Trip, One of the best place in my life"
An incredible experience. The 46 km mountain train journey was full of excitement. We reserved our seats four months ahead reached metupalyam at 4 am afterfresh up reached railway station. The train consits of four bogies with two reserved coaches. The train departed at 7 10 amThere is no toilet in the train. We were afraid about this. But the train stops at intermediate stations  for five to ten minutes.so any one csn use the toilets at stations neat and hygienic. This train uses the rack and pinion technology to climb the mountain. Traversing several tunnels and bridgesWe reached ooty by 12.05 PM. With cherished minds.
Was an amazing but long train ride..you get to see the greenery throughout the 3-hour ride. I would recommend a shorter train ride from Mettupalayam to Coonoor. I visited OOTY way back in August 2006.
"Nilgiri mountain railwayUnmissable!Put aside the absurd schedule, the ludicrous early morning start, the typically Indian queuing system for unreserved tickets, the appalling cramped uncomfortable seats and the clapped-out rolling stock left over from the Raj! This is the only way for a tourist to reach Ooty. Going by car is boring, by bus terrifying!Revel in the the 5am arrival at the station to meet the local who’s queuing for you, have a disagreement with other Europeans who accuse you of queue jumping, be encouraged by the Indians who seem to find having a man holding your place is normal, eat your railway breakfast of iddlies, vada and sambar in a foil box with a plastic spoon too fragile even to stir tea. Finish with a chai in an Indian Railways branded paper cup!The steam-hauled journey is breathtaking and conducted at a sedate pace (down to walking speed at times) with plenty of stops to take on water and allow everyone to alight for a wander round and plenty of pictures. The second part of the journey from Conoor to Ooty has the steam loco replaced by a diesel which spanks along rather faster. (Since the scenery on this stretch is less impressive and the knees are feeling decidedly stiff, it’s all to the good).Unfortunately our schedule meant we couldn’t take the train back down. Next time I’d make sure we did, and I think we’d go First Class!"
When you are in Ooty never miss an opportunity to ride on this heritage train. We rode from Coonoor to Ooty stretch. Next to the station is stem locomotive repair shed. You are allowed to walk over and admire the steam locomotives there which are still used to push some of the train services from Coonoor to Ooty. Enjoy the views all around. We had booked first class and were lucky to get seats in the first compartment in front of the train. You can see the guard signalling the Engine driver who is pushing the train from behind all the coaches. The engine actally pushes the entire train uphill and each coach has a guard who is in charge of emergency brakes and signals the loco driver using red and green flags.One of the very few railway services in the world where a stem locomotive is still in use.
"Last min plan to try out mountain railways. Managed a second class ticket at the last min. People with back pain, spinal issues should definitely avoid. My daughter loved the ride. Plenty of stops enroute for photo opportunity."
Please plan and book in advance for the travel from IRCTC. Getting tickets will be tougher. So plan in advance. The drive will take 4.5 hrs to Ooty. The train will take you to places where you have not visited so far in the forest. Must try.
"Written about, filmed & made into documentaries. One of the world’s  must do train journeys. Astonishing feat of engineering with amazing tunnels hewn through rocks; bridges without sides across chasms and old narrow carriages. Very romantic. The journey end to end is 3.5 hours but you can do the Ooty to Coonoor but in 1 hour although this is by diesel rather than steam train. Alternatively Coonoor to the end of the line at Mettupalayam. Need to book seats by the windows to get views and photos. Best side is on right of train when descending and left if going up. Seats to book are in FS1 carriage numbers 1 & 9 for forward facing and 5 & 13 for rear facing. On the Coonoor to Mettupalayam section you may get some soot from the engine on your clothes."
Enjoyed lot with this chaiya chaiya  train. One can remember your childhood even in the old age while travelling in this vintage train.
This is the best attraction in Ooty especially if you have young children. We went in a long weekend hence was very crowded. I tried to book tickets on IRCTC but it kept me in waiting till the end. I went to the station stood in line for an hour and got the first class tickets. The ride is good with beautiful views . Try to book ticket in advance .
This trip is mentioned in world heritage tours. The rail was constructed by British. The coaches are small but comfortable.  Book early your tickets.  I am sure it will be a mesmerising journey.
Tried to book the toy train tickets in advance via irctc but nothing got confirmed after charting was done(Actually  booked First Class tickets and then tatkal Second class both ended up in waiting list). Thought of trying our luck in  Mettupalayam station and on the day of journey multiple reserved FC ticket seats were empty. People didn’t show up so TC allotted us FC seats by paying the ticket price. Amazing valley views and it took almost 5 hours from Mettupalayam to Ooty. Overall happy to get the tickets and completed the trip as we really want to have toy train experience.Attached few pics
"So we took the toy train up the mountain for a morning of leisure. It was a lovely outing and lots if picture opportunities. A wonder around town and lunch was all very jolly. But there were a lot of people everywhere, plenty of noise and more of the same at the top. Think a first class ride would have added to the experience."
"Fastest, comfortable and cheapest option to visit Conoor. Enjoy the scenic view of valley as the train moves along its course. Advise to young parents Travelling with children : click pics but don't neglect your child."
