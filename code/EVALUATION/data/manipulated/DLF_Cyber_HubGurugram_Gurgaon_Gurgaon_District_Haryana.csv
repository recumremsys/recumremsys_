Can eat from so many Indian and international restaurants with lots of shops and good bars and clubs! Felt very safe as a tourist there for all my social meetings
Loved this vibrant place. It was commercial offices along with wide range of restaurants and activities.It a modern development of Business park in Delhi.
"Loved this very well lit vibrant place. It has shops, restaurants, pubs, lounges, coffee shops, cafes, lounges, food carts, parking, toilets, a food court, bistros and a good amount of crowd on most days.You cannot smoke here except for designated smoking areas, be careful or you will be fined. Best way to reach here from Delhi is to take the metro."
"Nice ambience, lot of food options, restaurants and bars. Have options for people of any age, from kids to elders. solo, couple, family, business."
"It's one of the happening place which is beautifully designed and maintained. You'll find most of all brands Restaurants, Bars also surrounded by corporate offices.For parking you have to wait for long. Take not on weekends as you come out from Cyber Hub you will find massive checking by police. They check for Drink and Drive.This place is very close to Delhi Jaipur Highway."
The place is awesome. Many options for drink and dine. Great crowd. Safe. Parking mat be a problem on weekends. Mostly corporate people frequent this place because it is surrounded by a lot of office buildings. Slightly expensive but still it’s reasonable for the type of choices that you get and location.
"Wow, what a great set up, shops and restaurants underneath to suit all tastes and needs. Crowded, but that is to be expected. Some of the buildings need a bit of maintenance. Lifts are always busy - so we used the wide stairs for 4 floors."
Visited cyber hub area a few times and found it very interesting with a mix of restaurants and bars it had a great vib going on and very cosmopolitan. Recommend a visit
Nice place to Have dinner away from all the cars and honking. Litter free and a good selection of restaurants.
"DLF Cyber Hub is a perfectly sorted premium place to hang out with friends and family. This one stop centre have lot to offer, from Restaurants to Bars, Live entertainment to virtual gaming hubs and variety of stores and outlets. A lot of media, lifestyle and entertainment events are organised here. Range of good restaurants and restro bars to suit everyone's taste is located here. Oh! Calcutta, Imperfecto, Cyber hub Social, Hard Rock Cafe and Olly are few to mention. This place offers a good uncluttered and easy to access parking space. I had an unparralled experience hanging out here with friends.Important Infos:1. Paid parking woud cost INR 50 for 3 hours and INR 100 for every hour after that.2. This Place is located on National Highway 8, which connects Delhi to Gurugram (earlier Gurgaon)."
Is strategically built and has good food options but usually everything is overpriced and every 4th person is drunk and is misbehaving with someome. Would not recommend to go at night as commuting is difficult and the crowd is bad to go with the family. At day time is very pleasant and one can enjoy the structure and the food quietly.
Well lit promenades. A happening place. Be careful about choosing a place where you eat. Mostly very highly priced and food of just satisfactory quality.  Branded chains are good.
"The Ambience of place is similar to any part of Europe or America. Surrounded in business hub, a wonderful place to dine out and partying."
Visited in the evening & that too during a weekend. The atmosphere was lively with a live band. Surrounded by good restaurants with wine & dine.
Its a place to impress your clients and guests. Took them for an afternoon lunch here.Only downside is high cost of place.
went pra pra prank and the food was amazing. It added to our experience and made our outing a very satisfying and enjoyable one
"You want to party with friends? Want to show your parents the glitz and glamour of this beautiful city from a spectacular vantage point overlooking the DLF Tower? Or do you want to take you kids for wonderful walk down the ice cream gully? Or would you just idle away time with a special someone in the amphitheatre listening to your favourite band play for you under the open night sky?DLF Cyber Hub has EVERYTHING for people of all ages, tastes and cultures...Loved this place throughout 2018-19, my one year stint in the NCR."
Check your taste buds . Something for everyone to enjoy and satisfy your food experience. Burma Burma for veggies.
"Considering the level of pollution now a days in Delhi NCR, not sure if the people would be interested in an open place with some truly worth going restaurants, but in good weather, this is one of the coolest places to be in Gurgaon. Very well architected and great restaurants, it does give you a European feel."
"Had a great time with friends. some really fancy places to dine and drink. Great ambiance,best place to spend an entertaining eve in Gurugram"
A place made to cater to the offices in the first stage is now a full-fledged space of some of the best restaurants in the town. Say of Pra Pra to dhaba to HRC.This place is a mandatory place for a visit if around.
Cyber Hub is undoubtably the most happening place in our very own millennium city . The vibe is always so positive and energetic. The choice of food and beverage is quit varied and suits every palate. Visited Cyber hub last week for dinner with family and friends and enjoyed thoroughly. Only suggestion is that they should improve on their décor and set ups . For sure they can learn few tricks from Select city walk .
"looks so much of fancy place places of gurugram from th eoutside. The place looks great from the inside though, photogenic. The place has many a stores for shopping and window shopping,grabbing a bite,etc. the place is clean and hygenic. the staff is great and the service is good. the place can be recommended for a visit."
Food at Burma Burma was awesome. A vegetarian place but the khouswe was out of this world. Overall ambience of Cyber hub is great. Loved every moment
Its an attempt at imitating the western atmosphere and they seem to have done a better job of it then in the west. But that is it. If you have not booked in advance be prepared to wait it out and then be prepared to empty your wallets. A meal for two with some good malt or lager can easily offset you by 12K+. In return you dont get anything as far as memories is concerned. Avoid driving there as parking can be a nightmare and another ripoff. Its a great place to go to if you are on the companies account and entertaining some folks to rip them off through your company subsequently.....lol....Jokes apart Gurgaon or Gurugram has awesome outstanding places to go to in half the price and value for money. Where food is lip-smacking drinks out of the world and they dont rip your pocket apart.
