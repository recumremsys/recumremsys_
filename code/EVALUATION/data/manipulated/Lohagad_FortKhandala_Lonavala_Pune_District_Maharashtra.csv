Visited this fort during Monsoon on a Saturday morning. This place is very close to Lonavala so it gets very crowded during weekends. Best is to reach there by 9:00am. Car parking is available at the base and many local restaurants as well. Takes about 35 to 40 minutes hike to reach at the top. The hike is easy and you will enjoy flowing waters on the trail and steps. It gets very windy at the top so a oid carrying umbrellas. The major attraction on the top is reverse waterfall - waterfall flowing down from top blows back due to high winds - truly a unique experience. Must visit place during Monsoon.
"The name ""Lohagad"" (iron fort) has its weight. We visited the fort during monsoon - independence day long weekend. There was a long queue of cars - so had to park and walk about a mile to get to the bottom of the fort. From there on it was further a climb through the stairs for couple of hundred meters.The fort is an imposing monument - rising above a lofty deccan step hill. As one keeps climbing up, from different location can get vantage point views of the adjoining areas, hills, lakes and the valleys - the views are quite breathtaking.The fort has multiple levels with multiple viewpoints and a final terrace at the top. Keep 2-3 hours to explore all. Try reaching there by noon.Cautionary notes - unless you are outright romantic, avoid visiting in the monsoon. The place is poorly maintained and there is no safety measures. Under rain the place becomes even more untidy with water-logging inside the forts - be aware of loose stones and stairs. I am sure during dry season / winter, it will be a place worth visiting."
"Pune is well known by forts around. Lohagad is one of those fort which is very near to pune and easily reachable. Regarding the trekking is moderate risk that most of the stairs are in damaged condition, in monsoon season you have to take extra care.   Once we reached on top of the fort , scenic view is nice, Please take care of your belonging that there are few monkey they may snatch your bags."
Lohagad is one those hill forts which is located near the famous weekend destination Lonavala. Just a few miles away from the main lonavala city. Lohagad fort is worth visiting. The fort has been well maintained and worth a trek. Surrounded by greenery from all side the fort stands tall. The best time to visit this is during monsoon. Normal trek can take you to the top of the fort where you can spend time chilling around. It takes hardly 20 25mins to reach the top if you are at a normal pace. Nearest railway station is malavli and you can find some local transport to reach the base of the fort. Good place to trek and spend quality time.
Brilliant view from top. Best time to come here is in monsoon .and thus how we came here Mumbai to lonaval and then malavli station and trek start you cn hire an auto to which take 50 each but while returning they increase their fares.So try to leave early on same cave n fort are not possible unless u have private vehicle .. Enjoy guys

The trek to the top of the fort is itself 5 KMs from the base and have tar road, on which you can hire tempo as well if you want. You can spot various refreshment stuff sellers on the road and taking a trek with its road is a wonderful experience. On can also use the hill for professional trekking but it’s always risky.On the way, take a little diversion approx. midway of the trek, you’ll Bhaja Caves, WHICH IS 1800 YEARS OLD. Buddhist Cave, as they say, built in 2 Century BC holds ancient carvings and numerous stupas. It is a structure built from cut outs of 22 rocks (wiki) and is amazing attraction to see.

Mind the views and the climates is literally majestic."
This Scorpion shape fort is a good decent trek in the months of monsoon and later in the winters. It gets really crowded over the weekend during monsoons. Lot of gangs n groups trek n go to the top of the fort. Not many eating options. Recommend to carry food in the car and eat before and after the trek. Trek comprises of lots of stairs and top view is amazing. Not much visible during monsoons as u are surrounded by clouds else worth an attempt during either of the seasons. Carry water for the trek be it any season.
The Fort is good. Clean. Take food with you cause its too inside in village and do not have good shops or eatable items available near by. Be careful of monkeys. They attack on food. Good view from top.
Very close from pune and 30 mins bike ride. Visit during monsoons - the place is flush with greenery. Take some snacks and drinks and travel to the top with freinds. Its a good experience.....
This fort has great view once reached to the top. We have steps to climb so no much difficulty. Had awesome time and lime juice sold in the fort by a local guy was awesome.
"This is one of the fort of maratha King chatrapati shivaji maharaj .you need to reach till the base of the fort either by your car,bus or by walk .you should try to   visit for as early in morning as possible .good time to visit is during rainy season as so many waterfalls welcome you . Nearby villages make the arrangements of guest who want to stay .very nice view from the top of the fort .must carry camera for good pictures with nature .carry water bottle if needed . Enjoy the waterfalls in nearby area ."
I am from Punjab and visit lohgard fort on later dec. not find much in Lonavala as per expected. but if you visit lonavala then this is of must visit destination. you have to trek through steps. its hard for old one but good trek for young one. after reaching top of fort you will get nice view. The connected road to this fort is in very bad condition. Have many monkeys around fort so you cant take food along with you. There Have small food corners arround but we had a food near Pawana lake that cost of food as per 5-star hotel but food quality is too low.
"Other than Sinhagad, I think this is another fort near Pune where you can see a lots of fortification and you have good constructed steps to climb up. I don’t have enough vocabulary to express my feelings of the Pawna Lake view from the top of the hill. I can only share the picture I have taken. Better you try on your own :)But the MOST IMPORTANT thing that I should tell you is the MONKEY TROUBLE you will find there. However here are some suggestion from me which could make you feel that that’s nothing.1.	DON’T carry any food or plastic carry bags with you. If you want to carry food then kept then confined in your rucksack until you reach the top.2.	DON’T ever make mistake of leaving your belongings apart. I made this mistake and had to became fearless to get it back which is not recommended as a bite from them may need you take immediate medications. I put my bag down for photo pose and a healthy grabbed it. See photo where you can see I am busy posing for the picture, while the creature was thinking to grab the bag and my 6 year old son is looking at him but not intelligent enough to warn me :)3.	DON’T look at them or make any sound to them. 4.	DON’T try to scare them with small sticks or false act of throwing stones. They are very intelligent species so if you really want to scare them then do it with a real fat stick or a big stone and a strong heart off course :)And the last but not the least, DON’T through plastics around and keep the place clean and try not to feed or hurt the monkeys."
"The best time to visit is Rainy season. We went to Lonavala in August 2016, we reached Lohagad Fort around 12 pm which was fully covered with fog. We enjoyed through out the climbing. Carry Water bottles as we should reach the top and beware of monkeys. Great place for nature lovers"
"Approx 18-20 kms from lonavala market, this fort is situated close to pavna lake. Its better to keep lohagad fort, pavna lake and bhaja caves for the day sightseeing. Need to trek to reach the top. Easy cum moderate trek but previous experience of trekking is not needed. An amateur trekker can also complete this. Very beautiful view from top. A worth visit place."
"Visited on last weekend as we have weekly off on Saturday. Started from Shivajinagar,Pune local train to Malvali station. The local train timetable is available. Prefer morning time as it gets full so quickly. Got down to Malvali and started walking. Bhaje village is on 2 km distance, we met many waterfalls in the way. You can visit to Bhaje caves if you want. We proceeded towards Lohgad. We reached there in around 2 hrs. Many stalls were there for wada pav, chai and kanda bhaji.We found too much crowd and traffic jam of people while climbing the steps. So please prefer weekdays for visit. Please carry raincoat instead of umbrella as it is of no use because of high wind.Enjoy..."
"An abandoned fort on top of a mountain, an hour plus drive from Pune. Best time to visit is monsoon/post monsoon or summers for sunsrise/sunset views. A typical hill top fort in Maharashtra with different darwazas and spectacular views. Carry food and water. Its a 30 minutes trek to the top from the base."
We walked from Malavali local station all the way to lohagarh fort. There are several small waterfalls on the way. Trekking is easy. You can take a local guide. They charge 100rs per person. You can take a cab to base village.
"We did Lohagad in Nov-16, took the road from the Pawana side, in rainy season this road is an absolute pleasure to drive and was hoping to have a similar experience as were were travelling very close to end of rains, however the roads were not as scenic as anticipated. Never the less, you have agriculture plantations on both sides to it was a good experience.WE did spend some good time at water canal and that was indeed refreshing, with gushing water.Then comes the actual fort. Earlier when i visited this place in monsoon, the road had withered, but in Nov the initial road was newly made and had no trouble with our vehicle. Those who are newbies should be careful with the drive here.The climb was not sever as we had taken the route to the top, regardless, it surely can be a task if you are not used to climbing.We had a couple of senior citizens with us and who also managed the walk of the stair (incase that helps for your planning)Once on top, where is not much of sightseeing actually. Finding a decent place to each can be a challenge due to shortage of trees on the fort and the the usual suspect monkeys.Had a fantastic lunch picnic and then we covered the fort tour. Vinchu Kada is a must visit spot and it really great sight.Monsoon its definitely a must visit place"
"Visited this place last weekend. It is 90 min drive from Pune. It took us 30 mins to reach the top of the Fort as it was raining. The stairs are slippery so be cautious. Its better to wear shoes as some stairs were submerged in water.As we visited the place on rainy day, it was completely covered in mist and it was raining continuously. Its best to avoid bringing camera in rainy season. We stayed at top for nearly 2 hours enjoying the rain and gusty wind.The trek way down was tricky as the path was bustling with people trying to climb up. It took us almost 90 mins and lot of jostling to get down. This place is extremely crowded during weekend in rainy seasons. Our ordeal didn't ended there. We had to face traffic jam upto 5 kms because of people parking their vehicle in road. It is a no go area on weekend for sure.One must enjoy maize, tea, pakoda in rains enroute to Fort which makes the trek worth remembering. Also you can find lot of makeshift waterfalls during monsoon."
"We visited Lohgad fort on a Sunday. This place is 75 KM's from Navi Mumbai. Vehicle can go upto the fort and parking is available. Initial laps for vehicle looks dangerous and most people park their vehicles on the way. But after some laps, the way is easier and I would suggest everyone to take vehicle upto the fort. Once you start climbing the stairs, the view of the valley is beautiful. It takes about 30 minutes to climb up. Once you are at the top, you find a Shiva temple and a small pond. View is nice and wind blows fast.Very good for morning to evening trip from Mumbai. Best time to visit during monsoon. Don't forget to carry umbrella for each person. Also wear floater as water wud be flowing down the stairs and with shoes it will be difficult to climb."
It’s a nice fort near to pune. One can take a train and visit this fort by getting out at malavali train station. Don’t miss reverst waterfall in monsoon!
"Clean Easy fort. Steps available to climb. Monkeys on the way. hence keep eatables away. Takes 45 mins with kids. We had 2 5-10 yr olds and a toddler. small tank, temples and hillocks on top."
"Any one visiting Lonavala should must visit this fort. This fort requires at least 20 min steps to be ascended to reach the top of it.What a commendable job by the authorities to provide such a comfortable steps for ascending which I have rarely encountered in any other such forts. People of any age groups can easily able to go up. But needed to be more careful enough during rains the steps become slippery due to the presence of moss.Fort is amazingly built and indeed adds value to the history of India.After reaching the top of it there's a great mesmerizing view of the pavana Lake and western ghats. Just before the final steps reaching its top of Fort approximately 20-30 there's come a point where the corner one of the openings blows air like anything. What an amazingly fresh and cool breeze. Being tired one can have quick test at that point and experience this natural breeze and appreciate the beauty of this forts design. There's a marking of ""AC"" over that opening which indeed it's more than that.Beautiful fort and a beautiful experience of the day!!"
"This fort is probably one of the cleanest and well maintained forts in this area. The local gram panchayat [village council] has signs all over about waste reduction and cleanliness. What makes this fort unique is the clean and easy access to the top and the well maintained steps and walls that adds to the beauty.Once you reach the top, there are clear signs indicating what stood there once among the ruins. Keep walking all the way to the end of the fort and you will see another part of the fort that no one seems to visit. If you are ready for a small adventure then climb down to that area which is of course cordoned off with strong railings and walk all the way to the end where you will see a flag fluttering in the wind. Once you reach this flag the scenery is breath taking and the wind will make you want to hold on to something."
"Lohagad Fort can better be avoided. Instead visit Pavana Lake, Bhaja and Karla Caves which are on the same route and better accessibility. Lohagad Fort is all climbing stairs to just see the valley view from top, nothing else. It has more stairs than the two above mentioned caves have. You can get the valley view and a much better view from Bhaja Caves. While climbing stairs to Bhaja Caves one gets beautiful hill view. Lohagad stairs in the starting are better but as you go higher and higher, stairs are broken, missing, uneven and risky to climb specially in the rainy season. Moreover there are no railings on the stairs to hold. Surrounding rocks are slippery to hold so one cannot have grip while climbing up or down. Must avoid this place during rains because of two reasons. Firstly due to rains no valley view can be seen as it is covered in all dense fog so wastes the purpose of climbing stairs all the way up. Secondly during rains the stairs get more slippery due to running water. Lonavala is all natural beauty. One can see hill view from many points. At the base of stairs there are few restaurants which serve hot maggi, omlette, tea, etc."
"It's located of Mumbai-Pune Highway, close to Pawna Lake.There is small parking at the entrance, and a place to eat (Shivkrupa Hotel) is right opposite.The Fort is open to visitors from 7am to 5:30pm daily. There is no entrance fee.The climb to the top is quite easy - there are steps all the way. Steps are good till about half way or more, almost to the First Gate. Then its little broken and may be little difficult for old people of very small kids. But it is still very much ok. (Still families come here with young and old!)Once you're up, you get to see tombs, water tanks, a temples and (possibly) a mosque.We didn't have much time since we ran up by 5:25. Kids enjoyed, adults enjoyed. Climb was satisfying, view was spectacular from every point... we sure are coming back for more!(Carry your water, maybe snacks - if planning to stay long - but make sure there are no noisy wrappers since monkeys are around. They won't come to you unless they believe you have something they want.)"
Good Trekking spot during monsoon. It's a Medium difficult trek for new trekkers if planning to. Put your eatery stuff inside your bag and beware from monkeys there.
"Visited the fort with a couple of friends. One has to climb more than 500 stairs to reach the fort. Yes the view is worth the efforts. It is not only the fort but also the view of the Pawana lake, which is breathtaking.The visit gives a nostalgic feeling of the Maratha empire during the great Shivaji and his successors."
Great place to visit with friends and family when in Lonavala. Make sure you come in the monsoons which makes the area all the more beautiful!
"Visited this place in the month of Julh. The monsoon was at its peak and it added to the USP of this fort. The problem with this place is same as  with most places easily approachable from Mumbai/Pune which is too much rush. The steps are steep and at some places are quite dangerous to climb on. Wearing a pair of trekking shoes is advisable. You can go on the top of the fort and click some really good pictures with great views in the back drop. But one thing that I would like to bring into everyone's notice is the tar road that reaches to the base of the fort. Well the condition of the road was nice given the heavy monsoon witnessed but they are very steep. At some places there are turns which might scare you. So of you are planning to drive your vehicle to the base of the fort, make sure you are skilled driver and have enough fuel because a lot of it going to burn.I would also suggest a check up of your vehicle before you head to the fort. It is fun as long as you can control your vehicle and manage the steep turns. There will also be rookie drivers who might spoil the fun with their irresponsible driving. Have a safe trip!!Cheers!!!"
"When you reach to top of this fort there will be nice view. There are some steps to climb until that. This fort is well maintained. Sometimes monkeys come as groups. Don’t try to give them foods because they may attack you. Before climb steps keep some water bottles with you because in middle you may need water. I could get foods before enter to this fort. There were Wada paw, noodles.I needed 45 minutes to climb top of this fort.I went in weekend so there were people. But not so crowded.Actually this place is good construction and this is one the must see location in Lonavala. Nice place for photography"
We went there in rainy season. There was a heavy rain fall that made our day so adventures. One can go to the base of fort by car but I suggest to trek there from railway station which is around 6 km far. The trek will serve the beauty of nature. Rain will make your trek adventures. Go to the top of fort. The view from top of farms around fort and the nature was awesome.
Nice place for a short trek amidst the hills and nature. Be prepared for heavy winds and showers if visiting during monsoon (which is ideally the best time to visit). It's a n amazing experience at the top especially observing the clouds passing by.
"Visited just yesterday  along with a friend.  Reached the fort base by car. Last few km Drive from lonavala was bad due to the road condition. Road near fort is bit dangerous, hence be careful while driving.Carry 2/3 bottle of water and some snacks as there is nothing on the way to the top of the fort from basement.Take pictures while climbing since you are fresh and not that tired.  Once you reach the top , you feel exhausted and you don't feel like taking snaps while decending.You don't get to see much of the fort as there is not much remains left.The view from top is mesmerizing one side you can see lonavala city, other side pawana lake and table top (platue).There are few options for eating at the base of the fort.Over all it was a nice trek."
