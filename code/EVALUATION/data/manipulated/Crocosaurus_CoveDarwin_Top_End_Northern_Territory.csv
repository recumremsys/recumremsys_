Had a wonderful experience visiting Crocosaurus Cove. I also did the cage of death experience with the crocodiles and it was amazing! Highly favourable towards the staff and very professional. I would highly recommend visiting this while in Darwin. It is conveniently located right in the heart of the CBD.
"Had a fantastic experience at Crocosaurus Cove. The highlight was the Cage of Death - a truly exhilarating experience. The team at Croc Cove were professional, friendly and enthusiastic. A great day out."
"An amazing experience in “The Cage of Death”. Diving with the Crocs a surreal experience. A great set up central in the CBD, the service from all staff was excellent and the Handlers very professional. The Crocs were amazing to see close up."
I did the cage of death with crocs Will & Kate and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. One of the most exciting things I have done in a while & would do it again for sure. It also has one of the best reptile collections I've seen. Located in the middle of the main street so very easy to get there.
"Had an amazing experience doing the cage of death croc dive. The staff were very welcoming and knowledgable, they made me feel at ease regarding the croc’s happiness! Axel was an amazing croc to swim with, although it is mildly terrifying I couldn’t recommend it more !!"
"Enjoyed my experience, was happy to be put with Axel after requesting a big croc.  He put on a show and I loved how close he came, we virtually touched noses through the slits in the cage. Overall though it ended up being very expensive with the photo package! I believe the baby croc photos should be free to simply be placed on the usb after already purchasing the full photo package from the cage of death. Also especially considering the venue doesn't have its own designated parking either and the street requires pay. Also the cage could do with scratch repair or replacing, again considering how much money theyd make on these alone that happen throughout the whole day everyday. Glad I ticked this off my bucket list though"
Crocosaurus Cove is a great family friendly place. The cage of death experience (adults) was fantastic! Was lucky to see Axle - a 900kg croc up close. It was fascinating.
We did the cage of death swimming with Crocodiles. A fun activitie on holidays . Bought the photo package with USB for souvenir. They were very professional and I felt safe all the time .
Did the cage of death experience which was definitely an experience not to miss when visiting Darwin. It is slightly overpriced and photos should be included. Overall the cove itself and the experience were really good and I would highly recommend to others.
As a whole Crocosaurus Cove was a wonderful experience. The highlight for me was doing the cage of death and being able to get that close to now one but TWO crocodiles! Thank you to all the friendly staff for such an awesome experience!
"Went swimming with these awesome creatures. Loved loved loved it. Rest of the Park was great.. staff very friendly and knowledgeable. Right in Darwin. Close to taxi, Coles and cafes."
"first time visiting Darwin, so seeing those massive crocs up close was great. Watched from the sidelines the people who went in the water with the Croc.......I was happy with that. The children and grandparents enjoyed it too, so good for a family outing."
Visited Croc Cove with another couple. Excellent experience heaps to see & the Croc’s are huge. Make sure you experience the Croc feeding. Also if you are keen on the history of Darwin they have a documentary running in the “theatre”. It’s definitely worth taking a break & watching this.
One of the highlights of our trip! Was a great morning out getting close to some big crocs and even holding a baby one. Staff were so friendly and knowledgeable. A must for families or thrill seekers wanting to get into that croc cage.
Crocosaurus Cove is a must when visiting Darwin! Loved the Cage of Death. I was lucky enough to get up close to Axel the croc.
"I visited Crocosaurus Cove and took the VIP tour under the guidance of Jess. Jess provide a real insight into the life and times of crocodiles, other amphibians and reptiles. There were five people in the group, and Jess ensured that each one had the opportunity to get a real hands on experience with these amazing creatures. She provided a very professional and friendly experience and I thoroughly enjoyed my day at Crocosaurus Cove. Thank you Jess! Jess and the other friendly staff made my visit fantastic and one of the highlights of my visit to the NT"
"Was a great chance to view Crocs in an enclosed safe area. I did get into the, Swimming with Croc experience, although the total price, including a photo package, was hard to qualify, but in saying that, one only lives once & Im glad I did it. The rest of 4hrs was spent meandering through all the complex, which also included having  lunch at the Cafe. Plus did some Great souvenir shopping just to buy a special memento or 2."
first stop when i got to darwin and loved every minute i was there. learnt alot about crocs and even got to touch a baby croc.
"Went as i had not been here before. Very good, very educational. We ended up spending over 2 hrs here. Worth the price and good value."
Fantastic place. Been there 3 times now and each time was just as good as the last. Great for kids..
Was a good experience with William and Kate and then the viewing of the other Crocosaurus marine life was great. A great reptile mixture. The meal and coffee very refreshing. Thank you.
"I understood prior to the Cage of Death experience that I was paying $175 for essentially 15 minutes. But I’ve always wanted to do this experience, so I splurged on the cost. The staff were very friendly and took me through the safety briefing and answered any of my questions. The biggest issue was that the mask they gave me kept fogging up. They bragged that they were giving me a new mask, but they clearly did not treat them to prevent fogging up. I’m a scuba diver and there are many simple ways to treat new masks to take care of this issue. Plus they should have anti-fog spray to use just before you go in the water. I kept having to take off the mask and clear them. It was super annoying and a waste of my precious time in the tube!What really frustrated me was that I was paying $175 for this experience and I couldn’t see! I told the staff when I got in the tube that the mask fogged up and they essentially ignored me. Then when they called out to see how I was doing during the experience, I told them again that the mask kept fogging up. They just yelled back, “Ok!” And that was it. When I finished and expressed my disappointment, I got a halfhearted, “Sorry.”Aside from the foggy mask issue, the rest of the experience wasn’t that great either. The pictures show a croc swimming underwater in what appears to be a large enclosure. Complete marketing gimmick! The enclosure was actually quite small and the croc just swam in slow circles around for the first 10 minutes. I have an underwater camera, and I never got a picture of the croc in its entirety because it kept half its head above water. And that’s normal for a croc (which I’ve now learned), but don’t make your advertising look like this croc is going to be doing anything super exciting while you watch it! It even completely stopped moving for about three minutes and just sat there in the water. The last five minutes of the experience they have you sit on the bottom of the tube and they feed a small piece of chicken to the croc, which livens up the croc and it opens its jaws for you. That’s it. For $175. It’s completely ridiculous! And then they’ll gouge you again on the photography, but I elected to skip this because I had my own camera.Overall, I was super excited for this experience and then was quite disappointed with what I actually got. Save your money and go do croc experiences out in the wild instead."
We chose to go for the cage of death. Not cheap but worth it. It would have been an amazing experience if the goggles provided wouldn't have been such a nightmare. They kept breaking throughout the entire dive. Missing out on lots of the action specially when you have only 15 minutes under water. Recommendation: Bring your own goggles.
was not overwhelmed with the visit.  had all the essentials and it could have been because it was very hot
"Fun morning out, lots to look at and learned plenty. Nice to hear the stories of how the Crocs came to be at the enclosure. Enjoying kwatching a brave young woman 'swim with the Croc'."
The cage of death experience was awesome from start to finish.  We were put in with Leo who put on an amazing show with the help of the awesome trainers.  Ended up getting the USB with all the photos takes as well as 360 degree videos.  Have reviewed the photos and watched the videos a few times to relive the experience.
Croc cove was amazing. The staff are very knowledgeable and friendly and answered all questions (even the ridiculous ones). Seeing crocs for the first time was mind blowing and getting to hold a baby croc was special. The reptiles and fish were great to learn about. Awesome day with plenty of shade and air con
"Right in the heart of Darwin, this is a must see. Watched people in the cage of death. Crocs weren't that active in the morning so if you plan to do this, afternoon might be best. A bit hit and miss depending on the crocs' moods. Fish and croc feeding was informative, but hard to see if there is a large crowd. A really nice reptile display and bubble windows for a closer view of crocs in their pens and pools. Held a baby croc, but photos are expensive if you want more than one."
"Average, overpriced for what you get to see, spent less than an hour here. Felt sorry for the people doing the crocodile experience... so expensive and the staff had to lure the crocodiles to even move an inch."
"Such an exhilarating experience, with a lot of laughs and as many oooooooo's. Seeing these amazing creatures up close is unforgettable"
"We had a ball here, very informative, kids had a ball (14 & 3 years) the highlight for the kids was being able to get so up close and personal with the baby croc (and hold it) Very informative! Thank you!"
"We studied about the show time prior to visiting the place. Remember of any discount voucher such as groupon deal or hotel fliers with 10 percent discount. But even if you ended up paying full price it is worth to visit. The entrance isn't appealing so we waited til last day where there was no more places to visit. But we spent few hundreds of dollars in the place without any hesitation and stayed full day enjoying every minute in the place although it was absolutely sticky humid day. Most animal in the place were actively moving unlike to other zoo where you hardly can see any movement. There are shows after shows and it isn't just boring one way but interacting and experiencing reptiles such as feeding lizards some insects, touching and hugging baby crocodile, feeding a sneak (by staff) right in front if your eyes, see humungous crocodile top to bottom, lots of baby crocodiles and feeding them and much more. If you follow its timetable, you can easily stay half day or even more without realizing the time. Best of all were staff. From the ticketing til souvenirs every interacted staff were extremely kind and knowledgeable and this made my day even better. Thank you and well done."
"Went there first time after being in Darwin for about 3 years. Very unique and different experience to other croc places. Never got so close to those giants so close and observe what they are like from under water. Staff there are friendly and very helpful. They took every chance to enhance the experience and they did take some nice photos. Overall the cage is a must go if going to the place. If not interested in the cage, then jumping croc in Adelaide river night be a better choice."
"After doing skydiving and bungee jumping I wanted to try another exacting experience so I have decided for the Croc Cove. The workers there are great, very friendly and they love and take care of the animals including the crocodiles. Being able to get so close to a crocodile doesn't happen very often and this sort of interaction makes you respect those big predators even more.I loved my experience, thank you Croc Cove team!"
Really disappointed with our trip to croc cove. The print pictures and over all photo package was poor quality. We were promised over 150 photos we did not get. And print photos were really poor quality aswell seemingly faded and with flash visible. Only bought for the sake of the photos would not recommend. Also the highly stated croc jumping etc. Was not the case at all.. the crocodile we had axel  we later found was half blind and did not move very much. Whole experience can only be described and disappointing and not exhillirating as we thought it would be.
