"This was a fascinating experience.  They take you to a tunnel and tell many stories associated with this structure. I have never been to a place like this. The tunnel is well kept and has very fresh, clean air. Being a unique and quite complex structure, the tunnel plaid several roles throughout time, about which guides will tell you with great professionalizm."
"Enjoyed both aspects of the tour - the history of the coal industry and the experience of what it must have been like for people avoiding the bombs. Was not as damp or cold as I thought it might be, but had sensible clothing and footwear on."
"Loved this tour! Amazing to discover what's hidden beneath the city. We had the tour from Phil and John, who were very knowledgeable and answered all of our questions. Had a great laugh."
The tour is reasonably priced and took about 2 hours. The first half was the story of the tunnel as an air raid shelter in WW2. The second half tells you about the building of the tunnel and it's use by the coal mine. Both have interesting stories as well as a walk along the Ouseburn giving some local history too. A must for anyone interested in local history. Be aware that in places the floor is wet so wear a decent pair of boots
"The guide, Phil, was a very good story teller, bringing to life the people who had been part of the tunnel from construction to usage during WW2. It is well kept and not at all claustrophobic despite the roof being just above our helmets. Shame it couldn't be the full tour during Covid but very interesting nonetheless."
"A very different tourist experience, covering two parts of Newcastle history. We only did the hour tour but would like to go back for the two hour visit. Our guides, Phil and Andy, did a great job of bringing the history to life and keeping us all enthralled. Look back to going back and exploring the local pubs and art galleries."
"Had a great morning yesterday exploring and learning about the history of these amazing tunnels with Pete and Joanne who were fantastic guides. If you have an hour or two spare and want to explore Newcastle's underground secrets, I'd highly recommend this tour."
"If you are looking for something a little different then this is for you. A fascinating insight in to a unique and relativley untold part of Newcastle's rich history and heritage. Our welcoming guide Phil was full of anecdotes, facts and vignettes that brought the tour to life. Great sounds effects too. Thoroughly enjoyable and highly recommended. Get yourself down to Ouse Street..."
"This is an amazing piece of Newcastle's industrial and social history. Our guides Jan and Barry split the walk into two with Jan talking about WW2 on the way into the tunnel and Barry talking about the building of the tunnel in the 19th century on the way out. I am a visitor to the city and found the visit interesting as part of Britain's past, but I think a local person would find learn something about their city's history. Allow time to look at the books and photos in the centre beforehand or afterwards."
"Went on the tour by myself, soon felt part of a group with the guides making it feel an inclusive experience. The tour was really interesting & informative and that was from our guides who were Donald & Phil very knowledgable & entertaining. The 2 hours whizzed by & I got a good feeling of what it was like for both the victorians making it, those who worked there & the people who had to use it during WW2. Highly recommend and the surrounding area is worth checking out."
"Fantastic tour this afternoon provided by Peter, who has extensive knowledge of the tunnel, its surrounding, and history, not only the history of the tunnel, its geography etc. but of Newcastle as a city. It was brilliant to be able to discuss our interests with someone so passionate and knowledgeable. We're very much looking forward to returning in due course to undertake the two-hour tour. Thank you again! Tara, Laura & Ella."
This tour of part of a Victorian 2.4 mile tunnel built to take coal from pit to river under what was then the town of Newcastle is a fascinating place to explore with the knowledgeable and entertaining city guides. Using waste stone from the nearby building projects of Richard Grainger and bricks made from the clay removed from the tunnel it used gravity to take the coal wagons down to the river for only 18 years. It was then used as an air raid shelter in WWII and there are some fascinating tales to be told.
"A mixture of  experiences, entertainment  and history in a most unusual  setting.Our tour was led by Pete and Donald who successfully took us back through the years with a mixture of stories both humorous and sad in a hidden world beneath the streets of Newcastle.  Be aware though this is not for anyone who is afraid of the dark or who suffers from claustrophobia."
You must see this if your visiting  Newcastle. Book online perfect guide  took me  to a magical place and time hidden beneath the city
Despite being a resident in Newcastle I did not know about the tunnels until 2 years ago. The tour was fascinating (especially knowing the area) and the guides were engaging. Enjoyed learning about the history of these tunnels.
"Had a very educational and fun couple of hours in the depths of the tunnel. Phil and Dee our guides were very friendly and knowledgeable.There is no lighting so you get your own hard hat and torch, so if you are in any way claustrophobic this tour is not for you.The tour starts at their office near The Cluny and you get a short walking tour of Ouseburn thrown in.Another plus is you get discount on unearby eateries, so all in all well worth a visit."
"Living locally it's a place we always see and hear about but never visited. It was so interesting listening to the history of the use during the war and how big the tunnel actually was. Finding out how and why it was built originally was something i'd never known before, would have been great to be able to actually walk the full rout but never mind!"
"Good insight into the past - World War Two and it's history when created. Pete and Barry were good, friendly and helpful. They promised to check up on an associated historical point we raised about bombing on East Coast in WW2. The holes on the blast walls are an interesting recent feature! The sandstone in the lower part of the walls, below the brickwork, had evidence of being carved and the guides informed us of the history of the source of that stonework.  How do you avoid being killed by a run-away train carriage! Listen and learn!!Our only problem was my height - with helmet it meant I was crouching the whole time but Barry spotted it and suggested I sat on a bench during information session later in the tour. Two hours well spent"
"30 members of our W.I. enjoyed a most witty , informative tour of the tunnel lying under the city of Newcastle. We were all given torches and the option to donn hard hats if we were tall and were escorted into the depths of the earth in two groups by our tour guides, Bill and Phil.They were both very knowledgeable and told some very interesting facts about the history of the tunnel, life in Victorian days, and the period during the Second World War when the tunnel was used as an airaid shelter. many thanks to them both, a most fascinating morning"
"A wonderful end to a great school reunion weekend. This one hour tour was so interesting and informative with our guides Phil and Ian really bringing it all to life. They were interesting, humourous and obviously passionate about the history of the tunnel. That passion really rubbed off. Thank you so much. Will definitely recommend to friends and come back myself."
"Ouseburn is an interesting part of old Newcastle & the tunnel & it’s story is well worth a visit. Diane & Dee (Thelma & Louise) ??Ask them ! Were really entertaining and never boring. They both know their subject and make you smile. But be warned, strong footwear & warm clothing is essential. Even with a constant 12 degrees it gets cool after an hour or so in the tunnel.During our tour, we had others from Wales, Liverpool, Northampton & Essex.Being from the North East some of the anecdotes were surprising, revealing & interesting. Booking essential but well worth it. Well done girls & the Ouseburn trust."
"Born in Newcastle and never knew this existed.Pete and Phil do a great job of taking you back through time to the WW2 era, and the tunnel being used as an air raid shelter. Then further back to the Victorian times and the construction and operation of the tunnel as a coal transportation system. Well worth a visit."
"Do this tour and you will stand in the shoes of the men who literally dug this tunnel by hand, workers who faced deadly risks on a daily basis on the tunnel's  wagonway and civilians who sheltered from bombs dropped on Newcastle during WWII. The tour guides, Donald and Pete were nothing short of excellent."
An excellent experience with great commentary by two super guides! Thank you Dave and Malcom. Atmospheric and educational and well worth visiting.
"Brilliant tour, guides very knowledgable and answered all questions asked. Interesting place and lots of information given. Ordered a guide book also which is very informative."
Thanks to Pete and John for a very interesting hour tour of the tunnel. Visited on 29 Dec and only the hour tour was available during our stay. It came up as the top attraction in Newcastle as is well worth the trip. Pete gave us all the info about it as a mining tunnel and also an air raid shelter with an interesting story and sound effects at the end. Well priced and time went very quickly. Glad we made the trip. Conveniences are in the reception and entrances to tunnel a few minutes walk up the road so beware if you are doing the two hour tour.
"Fantastic friendly staff and what a fantastic place absolutely breathtaking to visit. The Tunnel has to be seen to be believed. A true wondrous experience for subterranean tourists and people interested in underground tunnels that go under the ground horizontally. try the souvenier shop is packed with Tunnel related novelties for people who like that sort of stuff. Very reasonably priced too. Apparently misconception is that people think its named after Victoria Beckham but its actually named after Victoria Wood. Built in AD67 by a Roman Architect Pisshedius, the story goes it was originally meant to be another Wall but he got the plans upside down. I'm a bit of a solitary person (excuse for having nae pals) and I visited alone but its a great venue for a date I reckon, I have my eye on a tidy receptionist in the Vermont but she is more interested in smoking and getting steaming but I'm trying to persuade her there is more in life than fags and bevvy. There is Tunnels to be viewed and walked through."
"Took a tour today with Phil and Ian - really informative, interesting and enjoyable. The 1 hour tour was the only one we could book for bank holiday but it managed to pack tons in - would definitely recommend a visit. No special kit needed (torch and hard hat provided!) Hope to come back again and do the longer tour next time"
"Just completed a 2 hour tour of the Victoria Tunnel in Newcastle. Absolutely excellent guide Pete with trainee Barry. Managed to handle a wide range of ages, very engaging and humorous as well as informative. Highly recommend  this"
Fascinating place with lots of interesting history.  Make sure you wrap up as it's quite chilly. Great for kids.
"Thanks to Esther and Dave for a brilliant two hours. Bringing this bit of history of the Toon, made me realise what's under my feet? I would recommend this to local Geordies, travellers from afar and those wanting to do something totally different. Once again BRILLIANT!!"
Having some free time in the city we looked on trip advisor and came across this hidden gem. Very interesting with engaging and knowledgable guides. We did the one hour trip and feel that was a good length of time to get the feel for the place.
Great little attraction in Newcastle. Due to restrictions you are limited to a family group and the guide. In a way it's better as it's exclusive. Only myself and my good lady wife. Jeff was our guide for the day. Great stories and information. Funnily it makes you appreciate the buildings and locations above ground so much more. Great for kids of all ages. Safe in all respects. Check your location for the start and allow time to find it.
"Wanted to do something a bit different whilst visiting Newcastle. Great experience, fantastic tour guides Andrew and Kate they were very knowledgeable. Reasonably priced. I would recommend a visit."
Found out about this historical trip while looking on Trip Adviser on what to do in Newcastle. The guides who took our group of 14 were very informative and gave us all plenty opportunities to ask questions.The trip took 2 hours and most of the time was spent in the tunnel. Make sure you wear flat shoes and suitable clothing. Hard hats and torches are supplied. All for a very reasonable £8 per person.  Make sure you book ahead as this attraction is so popular.
