"A very big gallery museum, they have great collections! Count about 3 hours to spend inside. The young kids won't get bored because they have many things to see. It's children friendly place."
I’ve been to Moscow many times but never visited this gallery before . I absolutely enjoyed it! Growing up in Russia I remember seeing all these famous paintings in text books. I was so happy finally being able to see them live! Great masterpiece of Russian art. It’s worth booking tickets on line as you will skip the queue especially on the weekend. Kids are free but still require a ticket
"We visited as part of a guided tour of Moscow. Wish we had come here earlier as we had seen so much art in the city, we had just about had our fill of art. Don't get me wrong the collection is stunning as well as the building it is housed in. Well worth a look."
Overall it was well worth visiting here. I made 2 attempts to go. The first had a 300m line out the front as it was around 11am and the second about 6pm. Going later at night was great because there was no line and it was a bit quieter. The collection here was great however too many portraits for my liking. Cost was ₽500 and a spent a few hours walking around
A multi floor museum with categorized paintings and art! You got to climb stairs and move around ! Need 2 hours for a good viewing of the art and paintings!
You need whole day if you want to be able to see the whole gallery. It is packed with interesting pieces. The area where gallery is located is packed with interesting streets and churches. Do some research about the area.
Loved this museum/gallery.  A 'must' for art lovers traveling to Moscow.  Could spend 2 days rather than 5 hours.
"I just visited this museum and had very mixed experience.There is long line in front of the building no matter what time you get there. Do not bother to buy tickets online as you still have to stay the main and only line. I spend in the line about 45 minutes and at the time I was close to the entrance door and looked behind there were probably over 300 hundred people in the line. I was very curious why it took so long and guess what -- there was only one security guy who was checked you walking though the security frame and your bags. Unbelievable!!! The main Russian art museum has only one security and every person in the line that consist of few hundred people has to go through this guy!!!Then you walk inside and try to figure our how and where to buy tickets.Then you have to check in your jacket/coat any outwear. Be ready sometime to stay in another line and give your clothes to very unwelcoming staff.The collection is very good and worth your time to see however it is very difficult to enjoy the experience. There were crowds of kids from school different age starting from younger than 10 yo. Their teachers usually occupy so much space blocking the view of the paintings and they talked to the students in very high pitched voice and often even screaming. There was so many people on the phone (not just students)- I was in many world museums and never saw anything like this. I do not want to sound bad but Russian people are rude- they continuously pushing you, kicking you with their elbows, stepping on your feet. They will never say ""Im sorry"". Also, they never silence their phones and talk loudly right in front or behind of you. All of this takes away from the experience that could be excellent but at the end of the day was just average."
If you like art and especially Russian art this is the place. The touching history of the family along with the very very rich collection of art will not dissapoint you for choosing this gallery. Take your time to observe the  paintings. They represent a lost era of Russia. And do not miss the magnificent Icons collection! Wow and really not something you see everyday..
"If you have enough time, extend your visit to a few days since the gallery consists of 60 halls each suggesting a wide and really good selection of Russian art. Auido guide is strongly recommended. Enjoy Schedrin’s city views, Venetsianov’s rural life and Repin’s realism. A real must see."
So many russian paintings so many beautiful paintings and some statues ! take an audio so you can follow to put in the numbers with a good explanation via Audio! take you time and also admire the building and interior itself.A must see if you are interested in russian art.
"This is a museum of Russian artists and it is fantastic. Living in the ""West"" we hear little about and know little about Russian artists except for the great of the great. To see these artists and recognize the different schools of painting is amazing. There were many great artists of Russia that rival those we know of. It is a quick. Metro ride from Red Square and the neighborhood is quite pleasant as well. Arrive early as it is very busy and the line to enter is always long. We arrived when it first opened and had to wait 20 minutes to get in and when we left over three hours later the line was just as long. We know why and after you go, you will as well."
"Buy your tickets online and go during the week, Russians love their cultural heritage sights and flock there on weekends. I was there on a Sunday afternoon and we stood in the line for 1 hour to get tickets. I visited the a Vasily Polenov exibition a great late 19th and early 20th century Russian artist. The Tretyakov is an amazing facility."
"Loved the things we saw, but disappointed that it was so crowded we could virtually not move.  Many tourist were extremely rude.  We were told this is common"
"Must visit place! Take your time and see all the paintings, take the audio guide! Emotional and spiritual uplift guaranteed!"
This is a very large museum! We found a large part not to our tastes but the part we did enjoy was great. The art covers so many periods that you will find something to see. One room in particular really fascinated us. See the photos.
"A must to go place in Moscow, if you want to be exposed in Russian arts. Don't forget to stop by St. Nicolas - ""Our Lady of Vladimir"" by Andrey Bogolyubsky, 12C the great icon painter."
"We visited the gallery in early January 2018 and spent about five hours to explore the main exhibition and I think it really is the best collection of Russian art in the world. We rented the ""audio guide"" device and it was very helpful. Keep in mind that it will take some time to stand in line to get into the gallery, so better come in the morning to the gallery opening."
"Went there to get to know more about Russian artists (from Icons until 19th century, I believe)  and was not disappointed. Easy access from metro, nice neighbourhood, beautiful estate. Gladly discovered some great russian painters and sculptors. Did not use audio guide, but you can do well without it. Museum Map easy to follow."
We did this with a guide which turned it from average to interesting. The paintings mean so much more when you understand who was up who and who was paying. The power plays were fascinating. Oddly one of the “princesses” kept getting taken off her husbands and married by someone higher up the ladder. Though she started as a peasant. Reminds me of Evita Not a must see but does cover history
This is a beautiful gallery with beautiful art. Enjoyable visit. We took the audio guide in English. Recommended!
"A must visit museum in Moscow. If you have only one day to dedicate to museums, I think it would be the best choice to meet the greatest variety of Russian art. The museum is huge, but is very easy to orientate. All halls are numbered and present art from a particular period, starting form 18 century, and progressing to 20th. Take a map, and follow the numbers. The museum can take all day if you want to see in detail all its collection. Since I am not an admirer of portraits of royalties, interesting art for me starts from second half of 19 century. So I ran fast through the first 15 halls, and slowed down at hall 16, where art began to develop towards impressionism. Don't miss sea scenery by Ayvazovski, countryside and forests by Repin, Shishkin etc. From this point, each hall leads to more modern, captivating art. Make sure you have enough time to get to hall 32 with Vrubel. His work is mesmerizing and emotional, I could not take my eyes of his Demon for long minutes..."
This has to be one of those “must see” venues while visiting Moscow. Allow several hours to view everything. Wear comfortable shoes! Take a camera. Be prepared to be impressed.
"If you are in Moscow, and hungry for art, Tretykovka is the place to visit, you won't leave unsatisfied.  Be careful, if you are with small children, they are not stroller friendly, you would have to carry it yourself or ask for help from visitors."
"Fabulous museum, it displays the Russian history in paintings. Recommend a minimum half day visit, with a break having lunch or snacks at its restaurant."
Excellent museum. Lots to see. Part of Moscow Pass . Allow lots of time to spend here. I would definitely recommend this museum.
No where in this world but saw the masterpieces Russia. Trinity God is the Orthodox God..e.g. sculptor. shown in Yarosclav
Brilliant Gallery to visit! One actually needs a full day. That is if you have an interest in art. Go and see it!
Beautiful historical place. There are so many famous russian artists. Paintings are incredibly good and interesting too. Be ready to spend couple hours of walking around . They also provide English speaking guides
Russia needs to catch a wake up. I have visited 37 countries and Moscow tops my list of most unwelcoming to foreigners. I bother to work hard and save my weak South African Rand to pay for my way there and walk for miles and miles to admire the beauty such an unfriendly nation has produced...only to be met with impatient staff and service providers that do not realise that as foreigners we are an asset to their economy. At the Tretyakov Edvard Munch exhibition l was treated with such racism and felt like a criminal as an impatient ticket office ASSUMED i was in the wrong building and sent me to another queue to make sure l knew where l was. BEING FOREIGN DOES NOT MEAN WE ARE STUPID...WE DO OUR RESEARCH BEFORE WE VISIT!!! And security guards need to treat visitors with respect. I felt like l was entering a prison. Unfortunately...beautiful or not....a country's popularity DOES MOST CERTAINLY lie in its people and although l do respect each culture's manner and processes....THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR BEING RUDE TO ANYONE IN THIS WORLD...ESPECIALLY IF THEY BRINGING THEIR HARD EARNED MONEY TO MAKE YOUR COUNTRY RICHER. Make an effort Russians if you want a better life for yourselves you must sow friendliness back into the universe. AND START TO EMPLOY ENGLISH SPEAKING STAFF AT TOURIST SPOTS....THE REST OF THE WORLD DOES!!!!
Wonderful collection of Russian art. Starting with icons and progressing through time. A lesson in history and culture.
Stunning collection of Russian paintings (& some sculpture). We arrived in the evening which was good in terms of there not being too many people but bad in terms of feeling a bit rushed as the collection is quite amazing and would benefit from repeated visits. don't miss it.
A must!!! Take a guide to visit!!! Also the park is a great place to stroll around!!! I think you should include it in your travel plans
Hiya. Tretyakov gallery is one of my favourite picture galleries in Moscow city. I love new excursions. The gallery of January 2012 was worth seeing. Recommend to all visitors of City!
"If you have a passion for a culture you must visit ""tretyackovka"". Put it in your list of places you want to see in Moscow, sure you won't regret"
