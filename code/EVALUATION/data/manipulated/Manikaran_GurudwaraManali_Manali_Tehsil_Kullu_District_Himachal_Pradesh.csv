"An experience in itself to visit the Manikaran Gurudwara is really amazing ! Enjoy the vibe there, explore the area around. Also, Manikaran hot spring water is said to heal a lot of skin diseases too. Feel free to have a bath in that."
Visited Manikaran Gurudwara with my family and it was a divine experience. The gurudwara is situated on the shore of Parvati river. It has hot springs. Lot of people visit this place.
"Visited this Gurudwara during our trip to Manali. Was a very soothing and peaceful atmosphere, we had langer for the first time here."
"What an experience...a must visit for all...gurudwara & temple co-existing besides sulphur spring. After paying obeisance, we had langar sitting beside sulphur spring fumes. Drive from the National Highway to Manikaran was wonderful. Be careful while driving in rainfall."
PLEASE MUST VISIT THIS PLACE TO SEE THE MIRACLE OF GOD. Really amazing place I ever visited. Hot water and cold water sangam is a miracle of god. There is one gurudwara. you will get good food there. 
"Had darshan of the gurdwara, then visited the place within the Gurdwara where there is a hot water spring. Also the drive from Kullu to Manikaran was very scenic and the road is decent. Takes approx. 1 hour to reach Mannikaran from Kullu, worth a visit for religious purposes or even otherwise to enjoy the scenic view."
"From Manali , it will take almost all of the day to visit Manikaran Gurudwara. I think one should visit it mainly if religiously inclined . The place is busy , vibrant and have good vibes. An old shiv Mandir is also in the same campus. Feels good to be there , if u r spiritually inclined.I didn’t found the hot spring as much of a spot , to travel half a day for. It is in the form of a pool , like tank . Situated in the basement sort of space. It is not well lit and is crowded. Can’t make out if it’s boiling hot just by standing near it. People taking bath in it made me wary of putting my hands in it. Not sure if the water in the pool is flowing , looks like it is stagnant. Besides it is not comfortable for women to take a dip there.  If u r going there just to see the hot water spring , do not go. But if u are a nature lover and u love driving in the wild u will enjoy the travel from Manali . Religious aspect or to enjoy the nature , only these two reasons r valid to invest a day , for this place."
Special Attraction - Road towards Manikaran. Mindblowing Route.  Place : Gurudwara   Food : You can have the umptiest of your hunger but reaching here will take that all off from your mind. Lunger Holy Food available.  Shoes can be kept there and no charges.  Sulphur Springs are…
"Located far off from kullu, this is a must visit gurudwara near kasol valley... The view of the beas river is just breath taking and will give eternal peace and tranquility to the soul... highly recommended..."
Feeling to depend time in manikaran gurudwara is awesome that I can’t explain to u . In manikaran gurudwara u experience the feeling of hotspring and ther is a hot cave also which relax your body and brain
I went to Gurudwara Manikaran Sahib in January 2019. We saw light snowfall there. Gurudwara provides free Langar (food) to the shrines visiting the Gurudwara Sahib. They also provides accomodation facilities free of cost. Although if u wish to have hotel like facilities I would suggest to stay at some nearby hotels or resort which are very cheap after mid january till march end. Bath in natural Hot springs was something like lifetime experience although the water is really hot and u cannot bear it for more time. Manikaran is 40 km from Bhuntar but visit to this place is must specially if u have your own vehicle. Road is really narrow but in fairly good condition. Only precaution is not to drive fast..be patient till you reach your destination. Never forget to bring heavy woolens and never try to overtake vehicles on the way to manikaran. Enjoy....
"Very peaceful, very spiritual, natural beauty and amazing Gurudwara. Have langar and enjoy the peacefulness of this place."
"Though I have been to Manali many times, this was my first trip to Manikaran & the visit to Gurudwara Manikaran Sahib was a cherry on the cake. Its perfect set amidst the towering mountains & the gushing Parvati river makes it even more beautiful. Ofcourse a very pleasing & peaceful experience"
"We visited this place many times, with family and friends. located on parvati river in parvati valley, dont forget to do darshan of  Ram mandir and Gurudwara both. Have Prasad there  please.  I suggest all visit to explore  nature at its best around Manikaran Sahib."
"This holy place is 35 km from Manali, worth visiting it if you want to experience Magical hot water spring ! Though we didnt dip into the hot water spring but still it gave us a spiritual feeling ! Gurudwara is on a beautiful location . We couldnt stop taking pictures as the climate was cool and it was drizzling ! Lungar offered at Gurudwara is taken as a prashad .. Hats off to the true service givers who non stop served the devotees at the lungar .. Blessed that we could visit this place.."
Do buy cans to bring Amrit Jal back home. Langar is served 24*7. Rumalas and prasad from outside is not allowed.
Manikaran Gurudwara is one of the famous places in India. It is a historical place. Felt very good to visit here.
"Manikaran is a religious place of Sikh and having very Old Gurudwara and Sulphur bath. Travelling time from Manali to Manikaran approx. 2-3 hrs one way on mountain roads. Gurudwara is situated at very scenic location . there is bridge which is the only way to enter the Gurudwara , river flowing with high current . Visitor Can take bath on Hot bath than pay darshan in Gurudwara. After Darshan we ate Lunch at Lunger Kitchen. behind the Gurudwara is Raghunath temple ."
What an amazing place. Mesmerised to see the boiling hot water at the banks on ice cold parvati river.This is a science but still a miracle. There is a huge amount of sulphur there but it was a miracle Guru Nanak Dev Ji to ask his follower to remove a particular stone to get the hit water to cook food.A must visit place which in Manali.
"Nice place to visit for Fun and worship. Nice drive. Has ample space for parking. Gurudwara, Shiv Mandir visit is attraction. Enjoy some hot spring bath in gurudwara and Pray in Shiv Mandir and cook some rice in boiling water of natural spring."
Go here if you are already in kasol. The gurudwara tends to get very crowded and is a bit dirty here and there.
Situated in the foothills at manali the manikaran gurudwara is one the places to visit. Known for its hot spring water bath and peaceful experience get immersed in the blessings of the place.
Experiencing hot water spring and the stream adjoining is a natural wonder. Visiting this place is a must.
From Manali to the Manikaran Temple  was very beautiful and scenic. The interesting part is the hot spring.  Is boiling hot . The temple place the food on the boiling spring water to keep it warm and cook.
It was serene sight. Loved the view and the sacredness of the place. Loved the sound of flowing river.
very very good place and hot  water bath in winter. nice place to visit and lungar at gurdwara  . recommend to visit.
"Perfection in one word ! Give me another chance and i wud visit again! What an aura this place has! Surrounded by lush greenery and mountains , this gurudwara stands strong! They have a space to accommodate 4000 people and a non stop langar ! Perfectly managed! Such a peace of mind attained after visiting this holy place!"
"Our stop to Gurudwara was unplanned, Until we made our way, we appreciate stopping by. Seeing the statue of Lord Shiva was amazing and the story behind it all. Definitely worth a visit!"
Going further upstream from Kasol is the town of Manikaran which has the famous Gurudwara. Within the compounds are the hot water spings which are carefully directed to separate pools for men and women. The crazy parvati river flows besides the gurudwara and it is exhilarating to experience the hot waters of the pool besides the ice cold water of the river...
it is best to visit this place in the month of august . Gurdwara shaib is so beautiful and the shiv temple is just amazing . Make sure to take a bath in the hot water it way to relaxing .......
"It's a lovely place, great vibes to be here. However there is just no guidance around here. So you kinda feel lost or juts follow the crowd, which may not be the best thing to do. So, we wanted to take a dip in the hot water spring. Now here there are several places to take a dip, for men and women separately. 1. Ram Mandir : Very nice place. There are rooms where in you can take the hot water bath.2. Walk till the Gurudwara : Here also, several places mention that you can take a dip  with locker facility etc 3. Once you enter the gurudwara , there are 2 indoor pools. One for men and one for women. Here,there isnt any place to store your clothes properly neither are there sufficient lights. People also end up washing their clothes / shampooing their hair etc. So not quite sure, how pure is it to take an actual dip.4. Once you move out and cross the bridg, there's a pool outdoors.So this is confusing.You dont really know which is the right pool to get into.  We went in the 3rd one, just in belief of it being a spiritual place. Hope we had people around to explain and guide us to the right place. It would then be a great experience."
"Though the road to Manikaran is quite narrow but local Drivers are quite well versed with it & will take you safely. Once you are there , the first thing you come across is the sight of hot vapours around & as you approach the bridge, you are wonderstruck by the natural phenomena of Boiling Hot Water springing out of a chilly cold flowing Beas River . This has been happening since ages & Gurudwara here is famous for this.  They have constructed few resting rooms in the Gurudwara complex where the floors of the rooms are quite hot , you sit on these floors for some time & your body feels energised. Having Langar here after paying Respects to Guru Granth Sahib ji , is divinely ."
I have visit this place and it give me best experience throughout my trip. The place is very nice and clean. The people of this place are very helpful and well behaved. The Gurudwara food is so delicious. I have never eat that kind of food before. Loved this place and going to visit again.
Manikaran Gurudwara is situated at one of the best location in Himachal. Surrounded with hills and a the flowing river makes it a memorable location forever. This location is very near to Kasol and is easily accessible by our own vehicle or local buses. Don't forget to have a Langar (Prashad) in the Gurudwara. There are few nearby temples which includes hot spring.
"Hi, spectacular view of gurdwara beside river on parvati valley . Its take 2-3 hrs journey from manali to reach manikaran but worth exploring scenic view of the valley throughout the journey. Have hot spring sarovar on can take bath on it as its having some medicinal value on it"
