"I went for a day trip from Tokyo. This place was amazing in Autumn with many waterfalls, lakes, trees were in red and yellow. Do not miss this place in your trip."
Took the bus from the train station to the cable car lift for an amazing mountain top vista and then a great hike through shrine ruins. Highly recommend this area both in the Fall to see the changing leaves' color and in the Spring for the flowering trees - magical in both cases.
"If you want traditional backpacking close to Tokyo - about 2 hrs by train - Nikko is a great choice to stay a couple nights. I was there 3d/2n and that was plenty of time to do everything. A good itinerary is Day 1: Kegon Falls + Lake Chuzenji Day 2: Senjyogahara Plateau + Yutaki Fall + Yuomoto OnsenDay 3: Tosho-gu Shrine + Takino Walking pathUnless you're a temple/shrine junkie I'd just go to Tosho-gu and skip Rinnoji, Taiyuin and Futarasan. Even Tosho-gu was kind of lame and it is the premier temple at Nikko. There are decent, cheap hostels in the area - I stayed at Nikko Guesthouse Sumica based on reviews and it was fantastic. One last thing: if you are coming from Tokyo and going back there get the All Nikko Pass. It includes a round trip to Nikko from Tokyo and an unlimited bus pass for the Chuzenji/World Heritage/Yuomoto routes. (The buses are very expensive, so even if you don't get the ANP get the separate bus pass for 2000 yen!) The ANP is around 4600 Y and is totally worth it. My favorite parts of the trip were the Takino walking path - very peaceful, woodsy and almost deserted - and Yutaki waterfall - very touristy but you're right up close to the falls unlike Kegon. Make sure you climb to the crest, if you're a fitness junkie like me it'll set your heart pounding (it's steep and about 1400m above the sea) and once you're up there lean against the wooden fence and feel the spray hit your face and a strange but pleasant salty smell in the air. Very relaxing!"
"We spent 2 nights in the Nikko area as a short trip away from Tokyo, and it was a great contrast to the crazy chaos of the city. If you're looking to get away from Tokyo but can't travel too far, this is a good option. Really easy to get to and plenty to see. Couple of things: be aware that the Tobu train from Tokyo splits in two so you need to be in the right carriage; trains between the two main tourist areas in Nikko become infrequent after about 4pm; some hotels won't have any english speakers so be prepared to adopt ""international hand gestures"" to communicate if you're Japanese is limited; and you don't need to stay in Nikko town to explore the area - if you pay attention to the train timetable to you can easily stay in some of the lovely hotels near Kinugawa and reach Nikko national park by train. There are a couple of value passes for Nikko which you can buy, covering the round trip from Tokyo (departing Asakusa and Tokyo Sky Tree stations) and bus/train rides between areas once you arrived, and they're worth checking out. We bought a 4 day Nikko pass from the Tobu Travel Agency office downstairs at the Asakusa Tobu Rail Station (note: this is in a different location to the Asakusa Metro station. Ask at the Asakusa tourist building, which is directly opposite the Sensoji Temple, for directions if you get lost). Staff in the Tobu travel office are really helpful so feel free to ask which pass gives the best value for your trip - I nearly bought a 2 day pass but I'm glad I double checked with them, otherwise my ticket wouldn't have been valid for my return journey. Passes are valid for the rapid/section rapid trains, which are a little tired and stop at every little place on the way. You can pay extra to upgrade to the Express train which is faster and allows for more flexible travelling between Nikko town and Kinugawa Onsen, but I'm not sure you really need it. We bought ours right before we travelled, so I don't think you need to book. Platforms are upstairs in the station, and make sure you choose the correct carriage as the train splits at Shimo-Imaichi - front carriages go to Kinugawa, rear 2 to Nikko town (the platform has signs to show you).Nikko is essentially made up of two areas worth visiting - the main Nikko national park which is accessed from Nikko town by a really convenient bus outside the Nikko train station. This has the famous shrines, bridge, Kegon falls and Lake Chizunji and seriously dramatic scenery. This bus is included if you buy one of the Nikko passes, otherwise it's quite pricey. Then there's the Kinugawa Onsen area, which has rapids, a rope walk, monkey viewing platform and famous hot springs. The two areas aren't directly linked by train, they're more like two prongs of a fork and you have to change at Shimo-Imaichi station if you want to travel between them. This is doable, takes about 40 minutes to go from Kinugawa Onsen to Nikko town via Shimo imaichi, but the connections get infrequent after about 4pm unless you ride the Limited Express (about 300 yen extra per ride if you didn't upgrade your pass). Faced with a 2hr wait for a train from Shimo-Imaichi to our hotel in Kosagoe (one stop before Kinugawa Onsen), we decided to pay the 300 yen extra to ride the express only to find it didn't stop in our tiny village, so ended up getting a taxi (1900 yen!) from Kinugawa. Teach us for not checking the timetable!We managed the Kegon falls, Lake Chizunji and a hike up part of Mount Nantai in one day. I would have liked to have visited the Kinugawa Onsen area too, especially as we were more conveniently based for this, but we ran out of time.Basically pay attention to the timetable and map you get with your Nikko pass from the Tobu travel agency and plan your travel times and you will be fine. The bus ride up to the Nikko national park is great in itself as you get a sense of just how high up you're going (once you're there, you easily forget!).  Platforms for the train are upstairs in the station, and *make sure you get on the correct carriage*. Nikko is essentially served by a train line which forks in two directions: one to Nikko town, the other to Kinugawa Onsen. Trains split at the junction between these destinations, but there are signs on the platform floor and in the carriages themselves which tell you the final destination."
"Have to traverse 48 hairpin curves to get to this lovely place.  Nice Kegon Waterfall, interesting trails, but it was crowded when we were there."
"Amazing day trip, one of the best highlights during our visit to Japan. Nikko is absolutely stunning. All the stops are well timed but the park is huge so you're only just scratching the surface but what you do see is amazing. Make sure you go into the building with the crying Dragon! Highly recommend."
I visit Japan every year for business but always take two days for pleasure. This place is really worth to spend two days minimum. Relatively short trip from Tokio by train. Buy a bus pass and book Japanese type of room in hotel to complete your fun package. If you are not very in Japanese history half day is enough to see main temples and shrines. But my advice to dedicate one day for the park itself ... take a bus to the very top last stop (Yuno Lake) so you can go by foot down to Kegon Falls and get on the bus to return to the town. It's long trip but worth every minutes.
"This national park is about 2 hours away from Tokyo. It’s a beautiful place with foliage trees, water falls and lakes.Early November is a good time to visit. There are 3 sections of the Park that you can choose to visit. And you must take a Tobu Bus to go to those places.Section 1 is from Nikko station to Bus stop #26. Section 2 is from Bus stop #26 to 35Section 3 is from Bus stop 35 to beyond Most people go to section 1 with lots of sightseeing like shrines, temples and a big lake (where you can board a boat cruise)Section 2 and 3 are less people but more romantic if you two couple want more bit romantic time together. Make sure you know the Bus schedule for going back to Nikko station because it gets dark quickly after 5pm. There’s a limited schedule for both Bus and train at Nikko National Park. Please ask the tourist information people for details."
If you are looking to experience some japanese countryside from Tokyo. Hire a car or get on the yrain up to Nikko. Lovely area
"We were lucky – the weather was sunny, very little traffic, and we enjoyed the views of Mt. Fuji and Japanese Alps.  Visited Kedon Falls, Chuzenji Lake, enjoyed the ride on Irohazaka Route."
absolutely gorgeous to visit during fall season. Take the small roads that follow streams. Beautiful hikes and waterfalls.
"It's worth visiting the park to walk along the river, pass the waterfalls and enjoy absolute tranquility and silence! Beware of bears and deers! Nice little Japanese cafes at the entrance."
"Loved the park, it was cold but we saw the kirifuri no Taki waterfall, and the Spring buds were coming out. We enjoy spring when trees are not in full leaf because one can see so much more!The Nikko collection of World Heritage listed gilded shrines and temples were truly amazing, the intricate details on them and colour, we saw the beautiful inside of many also. So many to see so take your time and a good guide is helpful. We saw the "" see no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil monkeys also, and other stories which were amusing. Not to be missed"
Trying to travel around Nikko National Park by the local bus was time consuming and expensive. We would definitely travel by our own transport next time. The day was very wet and there weren't many bus shelters and also the buses were not as frequent as expected or as economical. The two falls were definitely worth seeing especially the Ryuzu waterfalls and the gorgeous walk up to the top road. In early October the trees were starting to change colour looking spectacular. Because of the time used up by waiting for buses we missed seeing the open air Yumato onsen which looks fantastic too.
We loved Nikko National Park and were lucky enough to see it in autumn.  Unfortunately we shared the place with hundreds of school kids which spoiled the vibe somewhat!  Choose your visiting time carefully!
This view is good and we can enjoy the weather.  But the transportation is not so good. We need to wait almost 5 hours in the open space and cold weather and no other option to back to the station. Need more solution for transportation
"We travelled in a group. The National Park is definitely worth a visit.Kegon Falls, Chuzenji Lake, are beautiful. See the photos. We went in May and there were quite a few tour bus and tourists group around."
"Nikkō National Park is a breathtaking park you do not want to miss. It's absolutely phenomenal and alive with rich culture and history. It's unlike any national park I have ever visited.I'm from the states, so to me national parks literally mean parks full of nature. Maybe a canyon or a geyser here and there surrounded by trees. But in Japan, WOW! There's mountains and mountains of forestation and cedar trees as tall as buildings! And so many gorgeous temples and shrines to visit! I was taken away to how colorful and amazing each building and gate was. It's as if time has stopped and I stepped right into history. I had the most wondrous time.Whether you're a history buff, book worm, city girl -- doesn't matter! This park is a must see site for all! And it's definitely a suitable tourist location for the young and old, family vacations and even with friends. Enjoy!"
"Really worth spending the whole day or two in Nikko, not only it has the shrines and cultural heritage sites but the waterfalls are absolutely amazing. Make sure you get the hiking map and take the bus to the falls, then go for 1 hour hike along the lake and you will end up agh the cascade of waterfalls. Really beautiful scenery."
"Took an all day tour through Viator to what is a large national park with what we were hoping would be plenty of Autumn color at the end of September.  Sadly, it hasn't been cold enough (even though it was only 11 degrees when we were there) and so there wasn't much to see.  Further, the weather was quite overcast, so as soon as you get to any elevation, the views disappear and there's nothing to see.  The town of Nikko was a nice looking place, but the tour didn't stop there.  Driver/guide was very good"
"For me would not necessarily recommend. We purchased the Tobu 2 day rail and bus pass which provided you with the train from Asakusa skytree station and the bus to the world heritage sites. We paid 2670 y each. Entrance to most world heritage temples are not included. Be warned this part of country is a lot colder at this time of year, and was covered in snow and ice and was a lot lower than temperatures in Tokyo. The reason I would not really recommend it is because my experience at Rinnoji Temple was disappointing to say the least. Although it is clear that there is work being carried out from the scaffolding outside, after paying the entrance fee, we expected a little glimpse of the temple inside the scaffolding but it was all covered. Work is expected to finish in 2021. Not worth entrance fee, you get a better feel of what the temple looked like from the picture on scaffolding outside without paying an entrance fee so be warned. Also visited some other famous temples that offered a lovely little complex of gates, memorial related buildings and temples. All lovely decorated and in a stunning lovely rural area. However alone not worth the visit all the way here when similar sites can be found in central Tokyo. We found that possibly due to erosion, most of the shrines and temples had been rebuilt in stone rather than in wood. This took a lot away from the authenticity of the place and for us, made it more manufactural and less of an authentic type of experience."
"we woke up early to catch an early train ride and transferred to a bus to reach Nikko spots. we visited kegon falls, rode the bus around nikko to see the famous shinkyo bridge. you have to pay to cross the bridge. we saw the Taiyuin, the iyemitsu mausoleum. I think they have 4-5 major shrines but we visited only 3. bus was our mode of transportation around nikko. make sure you have a comfortable pair of shoes. there will be a lot of walking. travel light or carry a small backpack. take pictures of the shrines and the sign board of the shrine. you have to pay entrance fee to go inside the shrines. do not hurry and appreciate the intricate design and structure. I suggest that you stay over night in nikko to see all the shrines and tourist spots."
"Walking in the national park was the highlight of our recent trip to Nikko. The autumn colours were at its peak. One could spend a few hours or days here. There are many trails. We took DexterD2013’s suggestion to take the bus up and walked our way down. We didn’t go all the way up to Yumoto Onsen but worked our way down from just above the Senjogahara Moor, past Ryukyu Falls and hopped back on the bus at Stop 34 to Kegon Falls. The attractions were busy as tourists mainly get bused from one attraction to the next but the trail was quiet.The trails were well marked and easy to walk. Comfortable walking shoes are a must but doesn’t need hiking boots. Outerwear that keeps moisture out would be handy as the weather up there is hard to predict. Markedly cooler than Nikko. Most of the walk was under cover so sun protection is less critical."
Went up all the way to lake Yunoko. Such a wonderful place to see the leaves turn into beautiful colors in late Octover.
"We took a climbing many stairs walk in this park.  Enjoying the cherry trees in bloom.  The park is quiet as this is spring and not many people about today.  Viewed the Pagoda, and possibly tea house, no sign on it so just a guess.  Nice to roam about and take in the sights of nature"
"We took a bus on a Sunday from 2pm and was headed to Lake Chuzenji. A supposedly 40 min bus ride became a 4 hour ride! My 6 year old son had to stand throughout the bus ride. They shouldn't have allowed so many cars to head up the 1-2 lane one way up the mountain. We couldn't disembark to head home instead but were all stuck in a crowded bus. It was a nightmare. By the time we reached at 6pm, everything was dark and we had to wait in a long queue to get on the 2 hour bus ride back to town. It was the worst experience ever. We wasted a precious half day. Avoid weekends or Sundays at all costs! The public buses just boarded everyone.  There should have been some warning system to stop crowds from thronging up the mountains if they can't handle the volume."
This park is full of people in October and November. The most beautiful place to see Autumn colors. Need to spend 2-3 days if you can really stay and so wonderful tracking routes and many water falls.
"This a great park in the middle of the Nikko Shrines and Temples UNESCO world heritage site. With walking paths leading up to the shrines, there are also little hidden gems that mark the history of Nikko's rise as a tourist destination of Japan. Accessing the Shinkyo (Divine Bridge) up to Rinno-ji and the highlight of Nikko, Toshogu shrine. You can always take a bus to these locations but the best experience is walking through the forest to each destination."
"This was a day trip with friends while visiting Japan. We had read about Nikko National Park and how beautiful it is, and let me lay it out straight for you - they are all true! I was there during Japan's Silver Week, so it was very crowded.The town itself is quaint, and rather small. But, the reason people come here is to visit the Shinkyo Bridge ) the red bridge just at the edge of town, Tosho-gu, and enjoy nature. The shrine, which consists of numerous buildings, is a sight to behold by itself, and worth speding at least half a day to take in the culture and history. Don't forget to spot the Three Wise Monkeys (of the ""see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil"" fame) carving. In the same area is also Ieyasu's mausoleum, but be ready to walk up a long flight of steps.About a half-hour's leisurely walk away is Kanmangafuchi Abyss, a park where you'll get to see Nikko's Narabi Jizos (stone statues). The park is pleasant to walk in, and the view is beautiful. A river runs through the park, and I would imagine everything to turn even more stunning in autumn with all the golden leaves.All in all, Nikko's well worth spending a day, and I reckon even two to enjoy what it has to offer."
"My friend and I have booked for a train for Nikko. Why not? It's a long public holiday in Japan and it is World's heritage. We went there on November from Tokyo and it is about the time that leaves changed colours. I check the temperature that day and 2 degree celsius is something that we really need to prepare. The ticket for Nikko is at the sales office in Asakusa station. You can look for the Tobu pass and here is the link: [http://www.tobu.co.jp/foreign/ ] You can book the ticket online but it requires 4 days before departure date. So, if you don't have much time to spare or it is a pop up decision like us you probably just get the ticket a day before. I recommend the earliest train which is depart around 6 am. and you can spend a whole day at Nikko because the last train from Nikko to Tokyo is about 16.45pm Well, I only have one day but 2 days at least I would say is the best. About that time we couldn't manage to get the hotel in Nikko because it is a public holiday. I guess that everyone also wants to enjoy their holiday. I wasn't surprised that I saw many license plates from many prefectures. There are to entries from Tokyo which are from Asakusa station on Platform 6th and from Tokyo sky tree.Please check again from the website in case if they change anything. If you enter from Asakusa you will have a better chance to take a seat. Of course this is an ordinary train but they also have Nikko express which you can book your seat, but  I'd rather save a few yens for something else. Food: Manjyu is a sweet that you must try!! I strongly recommend!!! You can see how many exclamation marks that I put!!!. Really! When you arrive at Nikko it is best to purchase a bus ticket (in case that you didn't bought it with the train ticket. Check the website for more info.Better buy all Nikko pass or 2 day pass and save your time from a long lines.) Exit the station and look to the right and there is the sign of manjyu!!Attractions: Please note that Nikko is not just a place. It is an area which lives there are blend with nature. You can look for beautiful scenery from everywhere. So I would say all you can see and all you can eat. There is a hi-light about Toshogu shrine and the main shrine with big Buddha which this part will open successfully in 2020. So be patient.Cable car ticket is discounted when you show your train ticket and so as many restaurants and confection stores.You can get a tour if you want. Please ask from the train ticket booth from Asakusa which can help you plan ahead. Time: be cautious about bus and train schedule. And if you go there on a public holiday there will be lots of people and bus is usually not enough.Clothes: Autumn is very cold because of high wind and low temperature. make sure that you check the weather before.A nice camera is recommended! Extra batteries is also recommended!!"
"Get the walking trail map from the Information Centre, and do the Takino'o Path. It is 5km long and I spent 2.5 hrs doing it at a leisurely pace. Beautiful forest in the upper section, and absolutely stunning setting for a cluster of shrines, just above the Shiraito Falls. The other trail on the map, the Kanman Path, I only did the lower section of, but loved the Stone Park of many Buddhas, and the gorgeous Kansan-ga-fuchi Abyss."
"This arrest contains a multitude of shrines, temples and mausoleums that is just incredible. The forrest ist self is pure magic . Go on a foggy day and it is even more beautiful."
"The view was magnificent indeed. Snow flakes pouring down during my visit. The place look magical. Relax and easy walk through-out the shrines and park. To go here from Tokyo, do follow this tips;Japan Rail Pass, you can take the Tohoku Shinkansen (Yamabiko, Max Yamabiko, Tsubasa or Nasuno) from Tokyo Station or Ueno to Utsunomiya (50 minutes or 44 minutes, respectively), then connect to the JR Nikko line (43 minutes from Utsunomiya to Nikko). From Tokyo Station, the whole trip will take from about 1 hour 40 minutes to around 2 hours, depending mostly on the connection in Utsunomiya."
Went to Nikko Park departed from Asakusa Station Tokyo and the trip was effortless. When you arrive at the railway station cross the road for the shuttle bus that will take you to Nikko Park. Very beautiful park historically significant it has the last 2 Shogun warriors buried there. The park is very beautiful to casually walk around. The temples are all beautifully maintained and the guides and tour guides are very helpful describing everything too you. If you have a spare day this is a superb trip if it's a case of missing out on Tokyo it would be a hard decision but I would stay in Tokyo. JR Pass holders will get the transport included for the trip in with their pass.
"Arrive early in the morning because the bus crowds come at 11 AM.  We spent two nights in a traditional ryokan in Nikko.  We arrived at the park around 8:30 and there were very few people.  We climbed all the way to the first shogun’s memorial.  Buy the combo ticket and then you still have to buy the ticket to the Shogun site.  It is well worth the tickets.  More impressive than anything we saw in Tokyo.  First thing you will see is the large temple housed in a building as it is renovated.  Do see this, very interesting."
