If you are interested to know about mountaineering in detail then this is the best place to visit. We visited this place along with family and kids...Onviously we were curious to know about the highest peaks in Himalsyas..who all tried to expedite those...what are the tools used etc...Make sure to take a guide alongwith you during visit to HMI. Authorised HMI guide charge 300 rs however worth getting as the guide will give you the detail information about HMI and Tenzing Sherpa(First Indian Everest climber). All our curious queries were resolved.Nice place and Worth visiting during Darjeeling trip.
"Mountaineering in the Himalayas, I learnt after a visit to the institute, is like the Holy Grail of mountaineering. The museum was very informative in its chronicling of how mountaineering has evolved over the past many decades. Early tools used by the mountaineers ole in comparison to what is available today. One appreciates the ardour of the early mountaineers after a visit to the institute The institute is still very much up and running and mountaineering enthusiasts from around the world train here to this day."
Some nice climbing materials on display from previous expeditions. Enjoyed learning about the famous sherpas who climbed Everest. Was a small bit annoyed that the film show was not on as there were no signs saying it was cancelled for the day & I ended up wasting an hour as aâ€¦
"We were completely inspired by this wonderful museum, much to our surprise.  Mountaineering has never been a great interest of our's, but the exhibits here entranced us.  Laid out cleverly, the artefacts from some of the exhibitions make you realise just what courage/effort was required; models, such as the relief model of the Himalayan chain, bought the mountains to us.  You should go."
"Totally worth it. With such a friendly principal and staffs, one of the best places for adventure courses. Make sure you get to be with Pawal sir's rope! He is just amazing when it comes to teaching."
Visited many museums but this is a different one. Have never visited such a museum where you will find substance of great valour and pride. A salute to all the mountaineers.
"Loved staring at all the artefacts of famous mountaineers, also saw the movie. Its attached to the zoo."
"Established soon after the first ascent of Everest, this is one of the world's venerable institutes for mountaineering, and has trained many. The museum is very interesting and rich, conveying the incredible challenges these high mountains pose to climbers."
Visited with family. Exhibits especially the equipments used by Hillary and Tenzing were interesting. Lots of history in the pictures. It is also having the cremation place of Tenzing Norgay. There is a show every hour ( with tickets ) which we did not see. Threre is a childrens' place of climbing etc.Nice place
I did my BMC from HMI Darjeeling . Visited it after 4 years . Bought back all the memories. Wonderful place to visit . Highly recommended for all nature lovers and outdoor activity people
"This institute is inside Darjeeling zoo campus. Founded in the time of Nehru, it is a very old institute. It offers mountaineering courses. The museum is full of valuable items used by expeditions. It was a great learning experience."
