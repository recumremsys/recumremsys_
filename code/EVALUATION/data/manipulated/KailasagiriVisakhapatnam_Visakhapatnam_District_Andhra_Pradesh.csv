Eating points are available inside the garden. visited in the Morning, it must look beautiful in night time. Beautiful white idol of Lord Shiva and Devi Parvati."
"This is a must visit place in Vizag. On top of Kailasgiri mountains, its huge and well. Maintained. Ample parking options. Suggest to go there when the park opens up. Can take cable car as well. Took toy train to view the whole city landscape."
Visit this place and get a 360 degree view of Vizag. Its a great view from top and you can chill out for a while doing nothing. Try taking the ropeway atleast for a one way journey
"Kailasagiri is a great tourist spot offering great view of Vizag city. Other than the huge statues of Shiva and Parvati, Kailasagiri boasts of a huge botanical park and a small toy-train track. Suggest that you buy non-ac coach tickets in the toy-train so that you can see the excellent views of the beach and Visakapatnam city."
It is a beautiful park. Has circular train that takes you on a trip around the hill. Wonderful view is available. Ropeway is also available to go up and down.
Beautiful View of City and Sea from one place due to the edge of Eastern Ghats! Lot of entertainment like mini Rail etc. Don't forget or compromise to avoid the Rail trip as it shows Spectacular view of city all around. Great ambience and atmosphere especially in Winter.
"Kailasagiri is a park located on a hill in Vizag. One can have a great view of the entire city from the top. It is till date the best tourist spot in Vizag, and was also honored for the same by the state government.One can enjoy the view of the city as well as the city by having a ride on the cable car of kailasagiri. It's really thrilling. The toy train also is a good experience as it let's you discover the best of the hill park and believe me  it's really worth the price. I hope everyone will like the place. It's too much tempting. Enjoy your offday if in Vizag."
"Went juat casually to see this place. This is a hill top park with the main attraction being the Shiva Parvati Idol and the spectacular view of Vizag from top. There are three ways to go to the top. One is the stairs, 2nd is the road and 3rd is the Cable Car which costs 100 / head up and down. We chose the cable car to go and there is a mini toy train to see the whole park at a go. This was also selected as the Best Tourist spot in 2003."
"Kailashgiri is happening place in Vizag. We have gone there by ropeway. There is ample parking place near Ropeway base point. There is proper queue for ropeway, they allow 4-5 adults in single cabin. The experience is amazing.On the top there are few gardens and landscapes. There is toy train which will take you around Kailashgiri. Seat on Right to see Beach and City, sit on right to see Trees and Gardens.There are small food joints and ice cream prarlour above. The main attraction on top is huge Shiva Parvati statue. You can have professional photos here from the photographers. Remember that Ropeway closes at 8:00pm, they do announcement prior to it.If you go in evening you can see amazing view of hustling bustling Vizag city from above."
Situated between RK beach and Rushikonda. Toy-train ride is pretty good and cable car ride offers you a good view of Bay of Bengal.  Lord Shiva and Parvati idols are primary attraction of this place.
Superb view from the kailashgiri entire visakhapatnam you could see from the top . Devote lord siva and parvati wonderful status visualize. Very crowded place we enjoyed.
Kailashgirri is the great fun time place. We can take toy train ride. Fooding also available. Ropeway is available. By 250 steps walking we can reach kailashgiri. Entry ticket :15/-. Ropeway :100/-
"One of the best tourism available in Visakhapatnam visual treat is available on the top of the hill have to go. have look at the sprawling town with magnificent sea and beach views from the top. one can reach the hill top by car/cab or the Ropeway from the base station. Food joints, mini train ride complement the Kailasagiri.Very beautiful hilltop view of Vizag city, sea front and RK beach. Beautiful statue of Lord Shiva and Parvati."
"Kailasagiri is one of the prime attractions and a popular picnic spot for all the locals and tourists visiting Vizag. It is spread over 100 acres on a hill top and provides a titanic view of the city, surrounding hills and its beaches. Nearly 40ft. tall statue of Shiva-Parvati is one of major landmark. The tranquil atmosphere is broken only due to the playing kids. A costly 20mins ride of a toy train [Rs80/- (Non-AC) and Rs.100/-(AC)] is preferred by visitors. Walk around the beautifully laid gardens and enjoy the fresh breeze. Food/Beverage selling venders are in numbers. Take memoirs home and include one with self/family/friend photo-shopped ceramics. Opens from morning 6AM till late evening.One can take route bus from the city. Ropeway was not working currently, but seems to be good viewing proposition from RK beach."
Has an amazing view but skipped the train and operated facility they have which shows the amazing coast lines of Vizag. Kids and family seemed to have a jolly good time at this place
"Located close to RK beach, this hill is major attraction for tourists. the hillock offers a enchanting view of the vizag city bordered by the scenic beach all along the city. the shiva and parvati statues stand as a major tourist spot on the top, besides other attractions like toy train."
"Quiet well maintained place very much within the confines of the city. The massive idols of Shiva and Parvati form the focal point, and it also provide great views of the city and specially the RK Beach. Reaching the hill using the rope way is a delight - it’s a short trip up and down; doesn’t really matter even if you are afraid of heights (rs.100 adults, rs.60 children 4-7 yrs). The toy train is ok and provides both AC and non-AC cabins. The platform doubles up as a food court. There is also a children’s park and other eateries/ shops."
"Loved this place, and it's a must visit place at vizag. You can enjoy the sea view from top sitting on ropeway and toy train.nice and Clean hill park."
Located on top of Kailasa hills in Vishakhapatnam it is Known for it's beauty and scenery. There is a Temple of lord Shiva. One can enjoy a toy train and ropeway ride to get a scenic view of the entire Vizag city. There is a Titanic point for photoshoots with the Bay of Bengal in the background. it is managed by Vishakhapatnam Urban Development Authority (VUDA).
"This tourist location is easily accessible from the base of the hill by ropeway . It’s a very nice pretty winding drive up the mountain if you wish to drive up that way . Once you reach kailash giri there is a train which takes a slow circle around the perimeter allowing people to enjoy the view of the city below. It is a spectacular vista . Make sure you sit facing the views of the city . The hilltop offers play areas for children and a few shops For fast food / trinkets / small toys . There is a shiva Parvati statue which is well lit at night Note - it is possible to take in both day time and night time views and this would be the best way to enjoy this place . Options include driving up or taking the ropewah at 4:30 pm , drive around the perimeter or take the train ( cars allowed ) , walk around the hill top till it’s dark ( around 6:30 pm) take the train again and then take the ropeway down ."
"Do not use road. Ropeway is faster and better view. This plae is huge. Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati statue. Big garden. Play area. AC train to take you around Kailashgiri.i. Tip: 1:00 PM to 02:00 PM is lunchtime. Therefore, Ropeway and train will not be operating that time."
A hill top view of Vizag city is what amazes you from here. Most of the stunning beach roads photos you see 9f Vizag are from this point. The park has changed a lot in last few years. Too crowded. Earlier very few people used to come this place. Theres a cable cart ride but quite a ling que for it. A well maintained shiv parvati statue on top. Real amazing. For a change good place to visit. Good time will be in evenings.
Went to Kailasa giri on the rope way. Children enjoyed well the rope journey. Visakhapatnam view from the rope way car is very good. Train is there in the hill. View point is good from the train. Children park is also there at kailasagiri. But need some maintenance. Most of the play items are in repair. Food items and shopping is there. God Shiva parvathi statue is so good
"Visited Kailashgiri during a recent visit. Luckly the place was not crowded. Took the ride in the mini train and the cable car. the views from the cable car were breathtaking. Place is clean and a good breeze ensures you have a good time. However i did not find a good place to have lunch, had to come back to the city"
"Loved the views , train ride (Non a/c is best) go during sun set and then take Cable car amazing city view once again from the car. Don’t miss this place if you love scenic beauty"
This place is nothing interesting. Place is to spend time for local people not for tourist. Go if you want to do some photography from top of the hill.
Train ride makes adds a flavor to this trip. Don't miss the train ride. You can also avail ropeway trip also.You can also have lunch there.
Nice place to visit with Family and friends. We used Rope way as our means of transport as it is a new experience to the ones who want to do some adventurous rides. However it is not too scary though. It is just a 3 min travel. I suggest personally to people who visit first time to try the rope way. It has good view from inside and also you'll enjoy it a lot. LIVE AND LET LIVE.
The visit to the vishakhapatnam is incomplete without visiting kailashgiri. The hill top and the statue of the god and Goddess is truly magnificent. The bird view of sea is spectacular. Try to avoid the tram operating here as it goes in a circle and cannot get any exclusive views. If taken try to get right hand seats as they provide the sea view. This is a truly a photogenic place to Capture memory.
"The hill is crown of the city. Stretched more than 5 km, the top is flat. We climb from the far side and walked up to the park."
"Took the cable car to go up to Kailashgiri. It was a nice ride with heavy rains rocking the cable car 😊. Once up, we took the train ride to see the entire park-visibility was a little poor due to heavy Rain but nevertheless enjoyed a lot. The location of the park is awesome and you get a birds eye view of the city. Definitely worth a visit."
View from Titanic point was breath taking.The toy train journey was especially awesome. Well maintained. Enjoyed every moment of the visit.
Visit to enjoy the Ropeway @Rs.80 per head. A different experience. Nice view. Require atleast 3-4 hrs to enjoy completely
"Go in the evening, stay till dark. Nice place to spend time. Lots of food joints. Toy train. View of city and sea."
"There's a toll on the way to Kailashgiri park and hill. You reach there quickly. Parking space on the weekends seem inadequate, and vehicles are difficult to park in limited space on hilly terrain. There is a small rail-road track at the hill. You will find large and beautiful statues of Lord Shiv Ji and Parvati Ji in the park. The view from different sides of the park is decent. Quite a few eating joints are there inside the park. Enjoy !"
